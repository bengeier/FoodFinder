{"text":"Stratengers has become my local, now that I moved into the neighbourhood.  Cheap, delicious apps and pizza and great patios (one upstairs and one on the side).  Not the biggest beer selection, but we usually stick to the \"Leslieville Lager\" which is basically Big Wheel.

Service has always been friendly and attentive and I believe I have gone every night of the week and on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Just your regular pub without the attitude.  Nothing too fancy but they've got darts & pool.  Best wood-fired pizza you'll ever eat.  They promote local bands which is a big plus."}
{"text":"Great take out. Lots of space. Really nice wait staff, Indian items too as well as a wood burning oven for pizza on the menu.
 So solid.

Nice music and affordable. 

Need to try brunch if I can get a chance.

It's a nice spot for after work beers for folks who work in restaurants themselves.. Nice vibe."}
{"text":"Patio great... drinks great. Food not sure but have friends who rave about it. I think i will stick to the Patio."}
{"text":"5 stars for the patio
4 stars for the food (Mediterranean pizza is great)
3 stars because the bathrooms are sketch"}
{"text":"We where looking for a quick bite one day, and found a gem.  At first glance you might not think much of this place.  But ones you smell the wood fired pizza oven, you'll be charmed.  

That being said the menu is diverse mix of cultures.  If you just want a pizza or burger they wont disappoint! 

Love the burgers!"}
{"text":"To get here, we walked past a succession of gentrified and boring-looking Leslieville joints on Queen Street, most likely all sporting the identical patch of stick-on fake brick, pretending to peer out from beneath the plaster. Stratengers provided an amusing constrast to all the bobo bling on display. Perhaps it was the pool hall / pizza kiln in the foyer that won me over.

The butter chicken I ate to the soundtrack of forgotten 80s hits was tasty and quite spicy.  I also had a pint of local brew (a Leslieville Lager, appropriately enough). Horray for me."}
{"text":"Ugh, this review has been a draft for weeks.  Like I-went-here-to-watch-the-federal-election weeks.  I thought I'd go back and try the place again, because checking out a place when it's slammed isn't fair, but honestly, I know I'm not going to go back: on a night when they should have known they'd be busy (we were one of two large parties that had made reservations, plus all the people who ended up dropping by to watch election results on the TVs over the bar), they only had one guy working.   Bartending, busing tables, taking orders.  

Needless to say, service was terrible and I didn't get my beer.  SADFACE"}
{"text":"I had walked by this place many times over with my dog and never looked twice at it until I wanted a low key, under the radar spot in the neighbourhood to catch a hockey game during playoffs.  I decided to check out some yelp reviews and was surprised to see how much positive feedback there was.  Rounded up a group of about 8 and went there for some drinks and food.  We walked in and easily got a table in front of the big projector screen. Staff were down to earth, food was great!  I tried the pizza and its definitely the best pizza I've had at a pub - thin crust and done just right.  The only thing holding it back is the sauce (probably canned), but certainly exceeded my expectations.  Diverse menu with Indian flair and all your typical pub fare (nachos, wings, etc). And cheap cheap cheap.  I look forward to trying it again.  Oh, and good sized patio that is full of people on any given day during the summer."}
{"text":"I went to Stratengers to hang out with a friend, we sat up on the second floor where the waiter told us to yell our orders down when we knew what kind of beer we wanted. Which was strange and kind of a pain, but I could see the convenience and it wasn't a big deal. 

It had a nice lay out and there were lots of young people there eventually, though it wasn't too too busy and service was fine. It was a clean environment. I can't comment on the prices because I didn't pay for anything myself, but I was told it was cheap by someone else before. My friend had some spicy Thai dish which he loved, I didn't try it because I can't handle anything hot like that. 

I was mostly impressed with the size of the place, which had multiple rooms to sit in (including one with a pool table) and an enclosed patio which proved itself convenient. I'd definitely go back here, especially since I'm in that area often."}
{"text":"Despite years of pestering from the big wigs at Restaurant Makeover, longtime owner and super duper swell guy, Dharam, remains adamant: Long live Stratengers!

\"Why fix it if ain't broken\" is Dharam's response to the gentrify or die crowd. \"If I let them come in they'll change my menu and increase the prices and I'll loose my customers.\"

Above all, it's his customers that Dharam cares about. Take it from me who begged him two years ago to put in WIFI so I could work and eat, which he happily obliged to do and now sees me at least once a week.

Yes the interior is gaudy and some of his older customers give me the heebie jeebies. But the food is excellent for the price.

Be sure to try their creamy butter chicken and garlic naan, their sizzling fajitas (2 can share) or any of their stone-oven pizzas. 

And now that it's summertime, they've rolled out a sweet selection of cocktails, including a yummy strawberry daiquiri.

All in all I love this place. It's my haunt, my dive-bar. Long live Stratengers!"}
{"text":"Wow. I actually ventured into the place for my first time as the patio isn't ready fo us quite just yet.. I was surprised. Its a really cool little spot (looks like a dive from outside). My friend and  celebrity yelper Stephen B. informed me that the place was originally a movie theatre. Took in some delicious curry fries and another tasty pizza. Lots of big screens to watch the game. My first thoughts were this place would make a cool concert hall or nightclub. A nice surprise.

My previous 4 star review of the patio:

Nice Patio and if it weren't for the patio I'd probably be scared to enter this place. Tasty Food. I had a Italian Sausage, Onions, and Olives pizza that is supposedly made in a stone oven. They also serve a nice selection of indian food but I didn't try it. The super Nachos were tasty as an appetizer. Iconic type of Place. Service was good."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful - no reason to dislike this place. Well priced and quality food, decent drinks, nice patio, quirky to no end, etc. Would recommend."}
{"text":"strats is amazingly fun everytime i go and they have comfy chairs and the men who work there think im funny because i drink a lot so no ive never had a bad time ever at stratengers and it is really spacious and not too loud but it can be if you laugh loud with friends but no one minds because everyone is in high spirits at stratengers"}
{"text":"Great food, dirt cheap, service is either fantastic or just ok.

Where else can you go for dinner as a couple, 2 entrees, a glass of wine and a pint of lager for less than $40, even with a 20% tip????

I love this place."}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent.  Curries are ... ok, but don't compete with Little India not too far away.  The beer is usually out, frozen, or oxidized.  The clientelle are questionable, and can get outright scary at times.  The decor definitely needs work.

I say sell it to someone who knows what to do with it.  Shame about the pizza though.  Better than Lady Margherita though. It's an establishment, but so is the Duke and Jillies, so that says a lot about heritage."}
{"text":"First there was rodent droppings.... The owner a little cockroach himself was rude, arrogant , and just was on a rant that went on for a pint and a half.... The food is cheap but not great... They have a wood pizza oven to bad nobody knows how to use it, also the wood oven has nothing that separates  it from the patron walkway, definitely a health and safety issue. I live around the corner from this place and choose to walk, bike, or taxi to almost any other bar... This place needs a makeover all round and the owner needs to take classes on how to deal with customers.. A real Douche!"}
{"text":"Some of the menu items at Stratengers are pretty decent. Unfortunately for me, neither the wings nor the Village Salad are on that list."}
{"text":"Loved the Lumberjack Burger! Never had plum sauce before but I had to leave with an extra 4 for the road because it was that good! Love the atmosphere, think they need more waiters/waitresses, but I loved it overall!"}
{"text":"We ordered the fries and curry. And the wood fired sausage pizza.  It was so great, the crust on the pizza was perfectly crispy, toppings plenty and cheese evenly distributed. The portion of fries and curry was plentiful, staff was courteous and friendly. We will definitely be back :D"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food and value. 3.5 stars for the service and 3 stars for the decor. Food is simply delicious. I've never had a bad meal, portions are generous, pizzas are perfect and the chili chicken curry is nothing but delicious. As previously mentioned the decor is a little 90's but don't let that deter you from a fast and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious food, comfortable mood. 
When I lived in leslieville, this was my go-to with my roommate whenever we wanted a drink or some food. 
I would highly recommend this place, if you are into non pretentious, well priced, delicious food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since my last review. It's a decent dive bar. The curries are decent and the beer is cold!"}
{"text":"We seem to end up here alot. Great patio. Love the veggie burger. And the curries are outstanding. Pinot grigio and beer are cold. Wings are great, not a huge fan of the pizza, Found it a little cardboardy (is that a word?) I'll stick to Danforth pizza house or pizza libretto for the pizza. Went for the first time last week for brunch. Had the standard eggs, home fries, toast. They were exactly as I had asked. Will be back."}
{"text":"The service is a little iffy, but if you're not in a rush and like delicious curry, this place is great."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my 2nd visit to the restaurant and I must say that anyone wanting to enjoy the patio weather in leslieville should look no further. 

The menu is large with a lot of variation - sandwiches, salads, a number of Indian style fritters and curries (would not call it authentic Indian but definitely worth a try), and other light bites. The portion sizes are quite large so beware of ordering a lot of food. Even the appetizers are large portions (picture attached). Some of dishes like the biryanis can easily be shared between 2 people. And if anything, you'll be stunned by the low prices without compromising the quality of the food. 

Suggestion - try the fries with curry sauce. It was really good!"}
{"text":"I organized a brunch there. They have Murphy's Stout which is hard to find according to my Irish friend who nearly died when I text him that they have it on their menu.

I ordered the Caesar salad with chicken. It was a large portion, good, fresh but I hate getting fake bacon bits!! The orange juice is fresh squeezed from somewhere but sadly it had turned so I got a cranberry juice instead. 

The prices are reasonable.. the staff are nice.. I have been there before and I will return again. Great patio space, clean washrooms, nice interior."}
{"text":"this place bears a strange name and a strange combination of a sports bar+pub that carries indian food. 

the place inside is massive, has TV screens, bar, pool tables, outdoor patio and an open patio on the 2nd floor. 

on a sunday afternoon the place was empty. 

the food is good - we only ate the indian selection. and the prices are pretty cheap.
naan with curry sauce was delicious.

the server seemed to be bored but the service in general was good."}
{"text":"This place is way bigger than it looks from the outside. WAY bigger. There's a large main floor, a smaller upper floor that looks in on the main floor and patios on the side and the roof! 

This also happens to be a good friend's favourite place to go. We came here for a surprise bday (yes, he was surprised). Service was fine and though I didn't get any food, the people who did said it was great. 

It's far from where I usually like to hang out, but if I'm in the area again, I'll return."}
{"text":"I first experienced Stratengers in 2004 when I moved into the area. From what I know, it was a big biker bar long before it was bought by Dharam.

For the first year or so after the indoor smoking ban came into play, one was able to purchase a \"membership\" to Strats that would allow them to smoke inside the bar area. I had one, it was great and a big hit amongst my smoker friends to say the least. I believe the front room was always non-smoking and my guess is that is the main reason the divided dining room with the oven still exists. I also remember the washrooms being where the upper outdoor patio now is. 

The staff are always pleasant and it's true that sometimes there aren't enough of them working.

Stats gets quite the diverse clientele but that's all part of the charm about the place.

As far as food goes: 

I've always been a fan of the Indian menu. Sure, it's not as great as some places you will find in Little India; but it's a great bar with a great patio (West facing so you get sun into the evening).

I generally default to the butter chicken and a side of channa masala or a chicken tandoori pizza (I ate one earlier this evening, it has not changed one bit over the years). The beer has always been cheap and comes in a nice 22oz chilled/frosted glass. I do however miss the $4.2X Red Cap they used to have on tap.

I've had some of the other pizzas and they are all pretty well done. I can't speak much on behalf of the bar food. The salads are ok, as are the wings, nothing to write home about though.

I moved to the other side of the city about a year and a half later in 2005 and still try to visit as often as I can. It's a 20+km round trip on the bike and it is totally worth it.

I'm glad it hasn't changed that much with time. It's remains a nice, cozy, unpretenious, friendly bar. Who cares if it doesn't look trendy or associate itself with a particular popular theme?"}
{"text":"Stratengers is a fantastic departure from the newly chic \"gastro Pubs\" as they have been dubbed. An unpretentious local favourite, Strats offers a wide array of standard brewpub items, but also provides exceptional wood burned pizza's and a surprisingly strong sampling of Indian staples. The butter chicken is rich and creamy and comes with a side of naan bread for convenient dipping. 

The patio is stellar, as is the service, Strats will not steer you wrong."}
{"text":"good pizza, neat looking place. would go again try something else"}
{"text":"A lot of people avoid/never even consider Stratengers because of the exterior. However, it is a great place for affordable food and drinks. Patio is nice, and servers are very friendly. Their pizza is delicious and I also recommend their deep fried zuchinni appetizer."}
{"text":"Dig if you will, a family: looking for brunch in their 'hood. 
Seen this place so many times, had heard it was good. 

Ugh. Maybe new owners? This afternoon - filthy dishes from past meals liking up EVERYWHERE (gross...), 35+ minutes for bacon and eggs, a giant piece of hair in my home fries, forgot our drinks twice (didn't arrive until after our meal) and lots of unhappy patrons. 

Never going back.

Oh, and hipsters hate kids. At least here they do. I know my kid is only 2 foot 3, stop STARING! Yes! It is a child! I know he's not reading Proust or holding a paper handle bag from a Leslieville outlet, but he's a person who needs to eat, too. Suck it."}
{"text":"Came here for some cheap grub on the patio and it delivered solidly.  We had the chicken briyani and the chicken malai curry.  Both were great value at under $10 a plate.  I say this is definitely a value-play.  The servings are generous, but the food itself was okay.  The briyani had too much sauce for my liking.  I found the malai curry better, but the naan was store-bought (almost pita like).  The service was friendly and got the job done.  The patio is large and relaxed...but there were a large # of smokers out that night, which is a personal detractor.  

I'd come back if I was looking to hang-out on a patio for a pint and snack of some cheap food.  I'll have to try to pizza, nachos and other dishes!"}
{"text":"Remember the old days when a bar is just a bar? 

Well Stratenger's is such a bar. A place to go to drink. Funny that people seem so concerned with defining exactly what kind of bar it is. 

For me, and the others in my neighborhood it is our local. A big ol' bar where the beer is always cold and house wine is about five bucks. A place where you can walk  in wearing your Crocs and not worry if anyone sees you ( I personally would worry. Crocs are gross). A place with a big friendly patio where you can seat yourself and servers aren't crabby if a single person is sitting at a table for four. And yes the food really is good, and the decor really is bad.

They don't use the word 'gastro' , they haven't heard of 'fusion', and it's still affordable to get good and hammered during the week, and  perfectly acceptable to go back and do it all over again the next day.

It's exactly how a bar should be."}
{"text":"You know that excited feeling you get just before going on a road trip to some cool place with a bunch of people that seem really cool? You let them choose the music for the trip and it's all like Creed this and Nickelback that? THAT, my friends, is what they call a buzz kill and \"Strat's\" has it in spades. 

For some reason we ended up here at the end of the night with the superstars Kat F, Susan C and Dale Medeiros as well as my pal, Matthew. The goodwill vibe dissipated alarmingly fast and the ennui set in. 

Seriously, what's up with this place? The partitioned rooms and the harsh fluorescent lighting (see profile pic) just make me want to run the other way. 

But we did meet the infamous server \"Tommy\" who really was wonderful. He has the amazing talent of displaying the cool feigned indifference but incredible customer service most people never reach. Dale walked in the door and arrived to a huge pint before he even sat down. That was awesome. 

I didn't try the food this time either but I feel obligated to because of the actual wood burning oven sitting in the front. 

The extra star is for Tommy and the original menus which have been discarded, save for this flickr search:

{"text":"This restaurant is one of the few in Leslieville that seem to be left behind in the era that was... and this is a great thing! No one can deny that it's always nice to have hip new restaurants opening up on Queen East but once in a while you just want to go out for beer and food to a place that isn't ultra cool and expensive. That's why this place is great. It's inexpensive, it's good, and it's so unpretentious. 

The decor inside feel a bit outdated, but there's an abundance of seating on two levels and lots of tv's to watch sports. There are a number of beers on tap and in cans/bottles and they're all a really good price (which is a very nice reprieve from the $8 most new places on Queen East charge for beer). They also have a large outside patio that is fabulous on sunny days.

They have a very eclectic menu: bar food, pizza, and curry. So far I've only tried the pizza but it's great. It's thin crust, wood fire, not too heavy, just really good. The curry looks fantastic and I'm looking forward to trying it. 

The gist of this is.... Leslieville really seems to be the new hip place but living in this area there's only so much coolness you can handle when sometimes you just want to grab a cheap but delicious bite. That's why this place is so great!"}
{"text":"I will be honest, I truly do not know what to make of Stratengers.  It's a dive bar, but has a good run of beers on tap.  You'd worry about eating there, but they have a fantastic wood-burning stove out front.  I'm lost.

When I first hit Stratengers, it was to interview a friend of mine for my podcast.  When we were looking for a place in Leslieville that would be quiet, he suggested a place he'd been to before, Stratengers.  Having never been and truly just looking for a quiet place to record, I accepted the invite.  As soon as I walked in, I found myself surrounded by original 80s-style furnishings, some fairly run-down fixtures, and staff so friendly and helpful, it became confusing.  We found the upstairs patio and set up there for the next two hours to the sideways looks of the locals in for their daily post-work (or mid-afternoon as the case may be) pint.

My friend ordered food and as we mocked him for ordering anything from here for fear that you'd collapse from something, up came a fantastically prepared calzone that silenced our ridicule.  When we left the place it was then that we noticed the wood burning oven where pizzas and calzones are prepared.  Truly a shock to the system.

So, yes, it's a dive bar but with some polished elements to it.  I'd wonder what the place was like in the 80s when assumedly the upstairs dining area and table space below would be packed with people waiting for a slice.  Stratengers Trivia Tidbit:  It is the local of Canadian music icon Nash the Slash.  Check out the display on the way to the washroom."}
{"text":"I've been going to Strats since... well before I should have been allowed in bars. They have gone through of alot of renovations and many staff turnovers but still is a decent place to grab a drink and a bite to eat but not pay out the ass or end up in the local dregs. 
To call Strats a divebar makes you either a prude, hipster or a person who grew up way too privileged. The staff is for the most part friendly and there are locals that you can always count on for a decent chat. People from the local carpenter, famous writers, obscure music legends and even a teachers party or 2 from local schools. 
The butter chicken is quite good and their wood fired pizzas and calzones are out this world.

Strats is a good old haunt that you can't go wrong with.... would you rather be at the duke?"}
{"text":"I like it here. I like when a bar is just a bar. oh, and maker's mark is $4.75. good pizza, too.

my friend described this place to me as 'of the people' and as classist as that sounds -- it's true. which is great. i'm from a small town and sometimes i just wanna drink a cheap whiskey with no pretence. no annoying hipsters, just people who want a beer. I was just here for my birthday and the bartender bought me a shot. now that's quality customer service! they also have two patios, one at the side of the building and one upstairs."}
{"text":"I guess one person's \"dive\" is another person's \"charming, eclectic, homey party-space\".

I went on election night 2011 with a handful of Twitter friends to watch the results come in. TVs were kindly switched to results coverage and the place filled up rapidly. Sadly only one server was on duty, despite us advising in advance there'd be at least 10 of us showing up. So service was a tad slow, but the waiter worked his butt off and deserved every bit of the tip we left.

The pizzas were delectable. There was one - either curried or tandoori - chicken pizza that was devine.   Interesting menu...a little Mexican, Indian, and expected pub fare. The aroma of the wood oven is heady when you enter the place.

I loved the layout. Tables for between 2 and 10.  A good-sized bar in a sort of sunken living-room.  An upstairs is more like a loft ie: you can look down on the patrons below. Washrooms are upstairs, not down.

Bonus? Free WiFi! Once connected, the password is \"Stratengers333\".

I wish I lived in the neighbourhood because this would be my frequent hangout."}
{"text":"Was here just last weekend with a group of friends.  There were 8 of us on the patio, we all ordered something different from the menu, and picked off eachother's plates.  Because of this, I managed to try a lot of their offerings in one sitting.

I myself ordered the meatball pizza and found it quite bland.  Nothing special about it at all.  The meatballs were definitely from a frozen box.  The indian offerings were bland as well.
Safe to say the food here was \"meh\".  But something tells me people don't really come here for the food.  It's all about the patio and drinks for this establishment.

On the bright side...the food prices are quite low, but for a reason.  Keep that in mind, and don't expect anything gourmet.  However if you're looking for a patio to get your drink-on, i could see this being a good spot to take in that east side vibe.

3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been going to Strats for 20 years. If you think its a \"dive bar\" you should have seen it back then. And frankly I think \"dive bar\" is going a bit far. The place has been renovated in the late-90's and since has remained fairly stable. Its not a cloth-on-tables type place but its also not as grungy as the Cadillac or Lee's Palace. I don't think \"dive bar\" is a fair representation. The food is generally good. Its good value for the money in terms of quality and quantity. Usually a relaxed and quiet atmosphere and a nice outdoor patio. There is an outdoor patio upstairs too that is heated in the winter for smokers. Stats has gone through many reno's and changes over the years to remain consistent with the needs of the neighbourhood. Back in the early '90s I used to play gigs at Strats when it was a \"rock n roll bar\" and later when they tried jazz. Later they got rid of the live music and focused on food. Regular bar food, mexican, italian and indian food - all decent. Great meeting place too."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a variety of Italian, Indian and pub style food. Sat on the patio, enjoyed their lunch special that included a choice of any appetizer, any large sized salad and one two topping pizza, $30. This option is pretty good for two people as it suggests. I wouldn't recommend getting the wings (they come with fries btw) they are too small and here's no meat on them! They are dry wings and they do not come tossed. The honey garlic sauce is in a small packet, doesn't make for a good experience. The salad comes on a flat plate (should be in a shareable bowl). The pizza is the highlight of this entire experiment as it is a oven wood baked experience. I would highly recommend the pizzas. I got the tandoori and sun-dried tomato toppings, a delicious combination. They have a variety of beers on tap And the patio is dog friendly and a wonderful setting. I would only come back for the pizza. 4/5"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've had. I love breakfast food ant this place was great. Their pancakes were so delicious. I don't even know what to say. 

Get their Supreme breakfast. You WONT be let down."}
{"text":"I've been going to Strat's regularily since I moved to Lesliville last year. I agree with the previous review. A total dive bar, but with surprisingly great food. The pizza is outstanding thanks to the proper stone pizza oven, and the pints are nice and frosty. 
Their Indian menu is also great although a little salty at times.

The occasional 'character' adds to the ambiance, but so do the quiet nights where you can dine next to local film producers reviewing dailies on their MacBook Pro's.

As much as I would love to see them renovate, it's nice to have a local place like this in Leslieville where you can grab a pint and dinner without having to brave crowds."}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend and the service was painfully slow. The first server who talked to me (about 15 minutes after I had arrived) thought that I had been there for awhile and that I had already finished my meal when, in fact, I hadn't even been given a menu. It wasn't very busy on the patio, which is where I was sitting at the time. Everything was atrociously slow. Even the drinks took forever. Unfortunately for me, I ordered the nachos. They came cold and with piles of congealed cheese. They had no toppings on them. I could have easily made wayyyy better nachos at home. I asked to have a new batch made that wasn't cold (To give you an idea, if you pulled a chip away from the pile, the cheese snapped in half rather than being stringy. Definitely not the picture of freshness.) The server obliged but seemed genuinely unimpressed by my request. A hot plate of nachos came about ten minutes later but it was still just cheese and tortilla chips. NOT worth ten dollars. I also had the deep fried pickles which were mediocre at best. My friend had to go up to the bar to get us glasses of water since not a single person ever checked in on us. Maybe some of the other menu items are good but stay clear of the nachos. And the service leaves a lot to be desired. Deep fried pickles and a plate of nachos shouldn't take nearly 45 minutes to get to the table, imo."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a regular. There is always excellent service, consistency, and good standard pub food. I always know what to expect and I am always happy. The pizza is fantastic - you can never go wrong with that wood burning oven. The Muttar Paneer is also an excellent dish, if you like Indian food (which I do). Great place to just kick back, read your book, or chat with others. Have met some really awesome people there in the past."}
{"text":"I ordered three poutines to go for myself, my daughter and her friend on a not so busy night (only one table had customers on the patio and not too many inside and it was after 11:00 pm. I waited for what seemed like forever for my order  and because we ordered extra gravy and I gave a small tip  the bill was almost $29.34 (for 3 poutine!?)  well once we got home and started eating we all noticed the fries had a strange texture. I realized it was because they were not cooked all they way, there was still a raw potatoe texture to them.  So I called them up and told them the situation and the waitress that took my order said to call the manager the next day and he would most likely replace it free. Well when I called in the next day I was told there was no manager in I should call in the next day. I said there must be someone there who can either replace my order or refund my money and the waitress just said they are busy no one is there and she hung up on me. So I walked over there because now I was pissed. When I got there I realized the waitress lied because I saw the manager right away. I told him the situation fully expecting that he would be apologetic for the rude waitresses actions and to my surprise he said he was the the one who told her to hang up because they were too busy to deal with me. 
Am I not a customer too? He said she was on the phone with me for 9 minutes! I showed him that my phone recorded that  it was a two minute call. He was so rude, I did get my money back but instead of apologizing for the mishap he said that that was the way they cook fries and if I don't  like  it I can take my business elsewhere! 
Incredible! The worst customer service I've seen in a while."}
{"text":"This place is so enigmatic -- I don't quite know what to make of it. It's at once the most bizarre and inexplicable venue/restaurant/dive bar I've been to. When you walk in, you're punched in the face by the aroma of mushrooms and woodchips. There are weird upholstered booths, tapestries and ceiling fans from the 80s. They serve Indian food but the decor is pure Motel 6. I'm certain that the film director Davids (Lynch and Cronenberg) come here to brainstorm character ideas. 

We arrived at 1am on a Friday for food but the kitchen had just closed. Our server, a modern day Pauly Shore (where's that guy been, anyway?), was a hoot. Greg C had promised a menu with flowery and hilarious descriptions but Stratengers had since upgraded.

KAT: Hey bromigo, where are the old menus?
SERVER: I dunno man. I just got back from LA.
KAT: Oh yeah. What were you doing in LA?
SERVER: Oh just whoring around.
KAT: Did you just say whoring around?!
SERVER: Yep.

I'll be back to try the food."}
