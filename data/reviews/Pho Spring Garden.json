{"text":"went to Pho Spring Garden with friend who loves its Pad Thai and thought its a Thai restaurant. but the place services Thai, Korean and Vietnamese food which was a bit confusing first..

The place is pretty clean with fairly modern decor. i had the tofu soup which was ok. the broth is not as flavourful as i expected. my friends had Pad Thai and a Pho noddle soup. they both loved their food. will probably try the Pad Thai next time.

overall a nice place to go to when everyone wants different things."}
{"text":"This place serves some Vietnamese dishes as well as Korean dishes. However, don't come here expecting authentic pho or even bibimbap. Come here expecting to get good flavorful food and you will be pleased. 

The pho was decent, better than a lot of pho places in North York. The fried tentacle appetizer was crisp and tender, just needed a bit more seasoning. Their hot Korean noodle soup was really spicy and full of seafood and the bibimbap beef was much tastier than the bulgogi variety you get elsewhere. One thing to note is that the quality of the ingredients is very good for a place that does not specialize in any one cuisine, maybe they are a fusion asian place but don't know it yet, either way I don't mind going to Pho Spring garden once in a while for decent Viet-Korean fusion fare."}
{"text":"The pho broth here is 100% better than any of the other places in North York, but they don't do pho with fresh noodles (which is how I like it myself).

But the broth......YUM! 

I can also say it's probably the cleanest, and nicest pho restaurant around the area, it's not as noisy as Vietnamese Delight, and its a much nicer dining experience than Pho88.

If it's a date, and you both want Pho, come here!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. This place tries to be too many things to too many people and ends up being mediocre in all areas. The big sign up front says No MSG however the soup had an unnatural umami flavor which usually is a result of msg. Way too many noodles and not enough meat. It's beef tendon for cripes sakes!! Don't skimp on tendon! The beef was the thinnest shavings of a beef product as opposed to an actual slice of beef. These shavings looked and behaved like cooked brown paper. This is where the extra umami flavor comes to the rescue ;)  If your looking for a cheap fill go there but don't be expecting a half decent bowl of Pho cuz it may be missing  Won't be going there again"}
{"text":"This place was fine but not really special at all based on what we got. We ordered the seafood pho and the rare beef and beef balls pho and spring rolls. The spring rolls were not the loose, light, crispy viet spring roll. I think it's to do with the spring roll sheets they have. Their spring roll was much more dense and crunchy. The flavour was good though. The noodles were predominantly noodle and hardly any meat. The rare beef pho was cooked before they served it. There was only 3 small 3cmx3cm pieces and then 3 quite small beef balls. For the seafood pho, there was only baby oysters, baby shrimps and pieces of squid here and there. All in all, for the price we paid - it was fine. It wouldn't be my first choice pho place, but it's the kind of place I would only go to if my friends really wanted to go. At least based on what we saw today."}
{"text":"Went to check in with what the fuss was all about, we had 2 pho with a salad, and chicken wing app. 

The pho was delicious with just the right amount of spice, and unlike other pho places, the broth was not just salt, it actually had layers of flavour, 

next time I'll have to try the korean side of the menu."}
{"text":"If you're going here for the pho or pad thai, just think about this, would you go to a KOREAN restaurant for THAI or VIET food? Because thats what I did and it was a stupid mistake. The Pad thai noodles were mushy, very saucy, and oily. It was at least edible so I give it a 5/10. The pho barely had any meat in it and although the broth was flavorful, everything else about it was average. I give it a 6/10 at best. The 2 dishes came out to $18+tip, was disappointed to say the least, and got mad itis afterwards."}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly good for a very low-key place. Prices were reasonable and portions were generous.

Service was fast, although the waitress could have been friendlier. Place seemed clean. Music played was unique and awesome: a random mix of 80's love songs...bonus points for pleasant randomness in a Korean restaurant.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This resto appears to be run by a few Korean ladies, but they seem to know how to make pho better than many pho places. Instead of the usual MSG laden salt water they call broth found at most pho places these days, the broth here is full of flavour and tastes like it was made with REAL ingredients. The noodles are fresh, springy and perfectly cooked everytime. The only comparable pho I've had in the city is Pho Hung. The dolsot bibimbap here was also great. Fresh ingredients, rice nice and crispy, sauce was super tasty. 

The vietnamese rice however was lacking as the meat portions were small and low-grade and the vinegar/fish sauce that came with it was not that great. Have yet to try their Thai offerings, but will be back often for the yummy pho"}
{"text":"They have a terrible waitress, we don't go there anymore because of her...enough said. 

Otherwise food is very good given the price."}
{"text":"I was craving for pho and my friend recommend this place but I didn't like it much. I had the pho and it just taste like salt+water.. not a lot of flavour.  My friend order the chicken rice dish, it was ok.  Also, kinda over price for Viet food."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  We live across the street, and we are so happy that this is our go-to place when we are too lazy to cook.  The service is always friendly and fast, the prices reasonable, and the food delicious.  

I was weary at first given the menu choices come from Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan.  I find such a lack of focus often means nothing is done right.  However, my partner and I go there often - I get Korean and he gets Vietnamese Pho, and both are great! 

I love the dolsot bibimbap - I think it is the best in the neighbourhood (and we have a LOT of bibimbap around this area).  The pho is also great, and the spring rolls and salad rolls too.

I once ventured to try a chicken curry, and I was less impressed.  The quality of the chicken was pretty low - I had a few bone fragments in my dish."}
{"text":"I'm a bit confused but also amused.

I've seen the chinese and koreans run japanese restaurants. I've also seen the chinese run vietnamese restaurants. But I have never seen koreans run vietnamese restaurants. Being located on Spring Garden, just north of Sheppard by Yonge Street and a well known japanese and korean area, you would not expect to see a random Pho restaurant to be in this place. There's always a first for everything and I thought i'd give it a try.

Stepping into the restaurant it was clean, modern and comfortable. The staff was friendly and offered assistance right away. If i did not know about this area I would have thought it was a typical modern vietnamese pho restaurant. 

As I open the menu I was caught off guard with the choices. You have appetizers which consisted of spring rolls, rice wraps and salad. The next page was a selection of Pho.... so far so good. Then you turn the page and you have a large list of korean dishes ranging from Soon Tofu to Jap Chae to Korean Pancakes. Add to the mix, a choice of Thai dishes. 

Once you order you will be served with a few side dishes like any typical korean joint. At this point i'm more confused.

I ordered a large bowl of Special Spring Garden Pho, which was pretty much equivalent to Pho Dac Biet at a normal pho spot. A large is a perfect size for an average hungry man otherwise medium will do. It was fairly priced at $7.95. The soup came out very hot, not lacking noodles or meat toppings. One thing I always judge in pho is the amount of fat and MSG accumulated. Surprisingly it really was not that bad. I was not running for water due to thirst and i did not feel like i was guzzling a mug of fat. 

I always order an Iced Vietnamese Coffee no matter what viet restaurant i go to. This place sells it for $4 which i find quite pricey. It was however tasty and did have that nutty viet coffee taste that it should have. One big problem restaurants have with the coffee is they always over do it with the condense milk. Not this place.

Overall 3 out of 5 for me. I'd definitely come back since it covers my two favourite food types... korean and viet.

A few notes that may help you... Spring Garden is not parking friendly. Yes there's Green-P street parking but it usually is full and it cost an arm and a leg. 50 metres away on the east side of Doris there is a residential area. Park there as it's free. There is also one unobvious spot literally on the north east corner of Doris and Spring Garden but on Doris itself."}
{"text":"I really love this place for my fix of Pho and other Vietnamese cuisine. A small establishment with plenty of booth seating, the food is very good. I always order the fresh Spring rolls and small Pho and that will fill me up in any time. I also love their Iced Vietnamese Coffee which is almost like an Ice Cap from Tim Hortons. Prices are very reasonable and they also have Korean and Thai cuisine in the mix. 

I have been here for work day lunches and it can get pretty busy, but on off times, it's a nice, quiet place to eat. Service is efficient. A great local gem"}
{"text":"I have gotten takeout from this place a few times in since moving to the neighborhood about a year ago. Mostly I've ordered the Pho and the cold spring rolls. The broth for the pho is really very good, one of the best I've eaten and the portions are pretty big even for the small sizes. 
This is my go-to place for pho in North York. When I've gone to pick up my order I also noticed that the restaurant is actually pretty nice and clean and would be a good atmosphere for eating in as well."}
{"text":"I don't like this place. Don't know why it is rated as a \"must\". The food was just ok. The service was not good. It was after lunch time. The restaurant was not busy, but the waiter was quite impatient."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place and it's consistently good. The Korean food here is amazing. Try the kalbi hot stone bowl. KH2 on the menu. Everything in a hot stone bowl is good! 

The pho is decent but I've had better pho in the area. Stick to the Korean goodness. And when you're done go to the bakery next door for some fresh walnut cakes :)"}
{"text":"This place is a little confusing. It's called \"pho...\", which would make you think its Vietnamese. But then the menu lists it as being  Korean/ Thai?? 

I decided to get Pho since the name is what brought me to the place. 

Pho review: it's okay. Broth flavor was decent. But they are a little cheap on the meat... there really wasn't much meat in it at all. I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I tried the house special pho which I suppose would be the dac biet equivalent. I ended with good broth lacking in quantity of the meats and garnish. This said people around me where not here for the vietnamese cuisine but rather the korean items. But again $12 for a bibimbap seemed overpriced. back to the pho, I guess $7 for a small pho is just ok..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I have had good experiences.  The employees that work here are very friendly and it usually isn't too busy that you would need to wait for a seat.  It is a nice low-key restaurant to try if you are craving for either Vietnamese noodles or for Korean food.  If I'm not mistaken they also serve some Thai dishes as well?  They offer a wide range of dishes and the service that they provide is quick.  I've tried their Bibimbap as well as their Pho.  I found that their Pho was a pretty small portion size.  I was able to finish the bowl myself, no problem and be satisfied.  The Bibimbap was tasty, it came with a couple of side dishes that you can eat with it.  The price of the dishes are very affordable and reasonable but the reason why I give Pho Spring Garden a 3-star is because I've had better Vietnamese and Korean food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Most Pho places are Chinese or Viet owned (or both). This place is owned by Koreans. The twist here is they serve all your standard viet dishes, and also some Korean and Thai dishes. 

The broth is probably the most important thing in Pho. I've been spoiled by Pho Viet Express on Bathurst which I consider as the best broth. PSG's pho broth is not bad, but lacks the richness I love at Pho Viet Express. 

I also think they are a bit stingy on the beef portions. Their prices are reasonable so I can let this slide. 

Overall not a bad place to get Pho. It's actually the only place close to Yonge/Sheppard subway."}
{"text":"((note: this review was from about a year ago, and I think when it first opened. I just transfered it over from my blog))

Just a random drop in for dinner. We were looking for Pho, and passed by this one on Spring Garden. It's wierd because it's called Spring Garden Pho on parts of the menu, then Korean and Thai on other parts.

They have a nice clean, modern decor. Korean dishes, and pad thais on the menu, and Pho and Buns.

We ordered a spicy seafood noodles. It was SO spicy!

I ordered a Stone Bowl Bim BimBap ($8.95). The quiet waitress had a hard time understanding that I wanted the bottom of the rice crispy.  I've been to a place before that told me if I don't ask that, then they don't make an attempt to do it. But at the same time the bowl is so hot and sizzling, I wonder if it's just a matter of me leaving it alone for longer before I start stirring at it.
My meal also came with a Miso soup, and 3 small kimchis and bean sprouts.
I was SO full from brunch earlier, but the rice was a perfect crispy at the bottom, and it wasn't a huge portion, but I ate it slowly."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago when we had the craving for pho. I used to always go to Pho 88, but the last few times I went, I was pretty disappointed so this time, I wanted to try a different place. I looked up a pho place on Yelp and this was listed as the number one place for it, so we went to check it out and boy am I glad we did!

The Food:
We each ordered a bowl of pho. I ordered a small rare beef, well-done beef for $5.65 and my bf ordered a medium rare beef, well-done beef, tendon, trip for $6.65. I should've paid one more dollar for the medium because I felt there wasn't enough noodles in the small. I was hungry! 
The pho was really good. The soup base was really tasty and the beef tender. I'm also a huge fan of lime and when I asked for some extra slices, the waitress was happy to give me a couple more. They were cut up in fairly big slices too, so I got to have my soup the way I like it, which is tangy. Yum! We also ordered the shrimp on sugar cane for $4.95 which was really crispy and delicious. The spring roll we ordered for $3.75 was a bit of a disappointment. The skin was quite thick and just didn't taste anything like any other spring roll we've ever had. The usual place we used to go to in TW gave us lettuce and basil to wrap the spring rolls with. I really miss that. The last thing I ordered was a mango shake which was ok. I was pretty disappointed that they didn't have my favourite durian shake, but oh well. I went for pho and at least that was pretty good.

The Place:
The place was actually very nice. The decor was simple, but elegant and most importantly, the place was clean and so were the bathrooms.

The Service:
It wasn't very busy when we went so there was no excuse for any wait time and there wasn't. The waitress was very welcoming and took our orders when we were ready. The dishes came out within a reasonable wait time.

The Verdict:
Until I can find a place that has good pho, good spring rolls AND has durian shake, this is now my go-to place for pho!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty and cheap. The Korean dishes are phenomenal, the Vietnamese dishes are good too. I especially like the kalbi. Pho is a bit underwhelming but not bad. 

You can't get much better for the price!"}
{"text":"CLOSED

I can't believe it,. It's the second restaurant to close on the same street within a month. It was my go-to Pho spot in the area.

You'll be missed."}
{"text":"Pho Spring Garden is a tidy little pho joint off the Yonge and Sheppard strip. The restaurant is clean and bright. The menu is a little confusing with so many options. I stop to the pho with beef or with chicken. Their broth is tremendous, and smells almost perfumey. It's really irresistible. The beef in the beef pho is good but not great. The hot sauce matches perfectly to the meat. For about $8 you get a medium bowl of chicken or beef pho and won't leave unhappy."}
{"text":"Will definitely go back. Very clean and nice restaurant atmosphere, server was lovely, and the pho was great! I ordered the large rare beef pho. Not the best I've had, but still very fragrant, delicately flavourful and satisfying, with lots of noodles and a decent amount of beef. I like the broth to be a little more potent, but was still very pleasant. Definitely hit the pho craving spot. Will go back to try the other extensive menu items!"}
{"text":"This places serves pho, Korean and Thai dishes. Kind of the theory of jack of all trades, master of none.. a place that I had no expectations for but it was A-OK and hit the spot for a late lunch.

Dung Yum Gung (Tom Yum) with lemongrass, shrimp and rice noodles -  I actually liked this soup, sour with hint of spice. Noodles were pho noodles, not bad. Literally just had noodles and a few tiny shrimp. 

Clean interior."}
{"text":"Despite this being named \"Pho Spring Garden,\" I've ordered Korean each time I've been here.

The kalbi stone pot rice bowl was ridiculously good.  The rice got really nice and crispy from the bowl and the ribs were cooked perfectly.  The marinade was the right level of sweet and savory.  This is why I prefer to get my ethnic food when I'm in Toronto.

It's also very reasonably priced.  Can't beat that holy trinity, cheap, flavorful, convenient (to my work)."}
{"text":"Use to live in the area and walked by the place 100 times. Decided to try it and its really meh Pho. It's not bad but it's average. Would give it three stars but price brings it down the 2."}
{"text":"Vermicelli with grilled chicken and spring rolls was just ok.  The place is run by Koreans so I suspect the Korean dishes are better.  Service was good, friendly and fast."}
{"text":"My friends and I liked the food. The only dish I've tried there is pho and I think it's pretty good. Some say they have had better pho, but I haven't really. Staff are friendly and even start to chitchat every now and then which I think it's kinda unique. Also the price is low. Will go there again later."}
{"text":"This is probably our 4th trip here.   Small restaurant but seating on a Saturday night at 530 has never been an issue.   Upon arriving this time immediately I sensed new management and the updated menu and subsequent dishes seemed to support this. 

We always order KH1 which is a hotpot with beef and rice but this time subtlety improved.  Though not a fan of the sesame sprinkles the dish did come with added vegetables that added to the overall flavor and life to the dish. 

Ordered the rice and chicken dish that comes with a nice sweet fish sauce for the chicken and a so/so side salad.  Ordered this before...  It is good. 

Tried their medium pho N12 beef/tripe/tendon fir the first time.   Tasted okay to me but the selection was a bit weak for me.   A place across town offers bowls with more items including chicken, beef balls, rare beef in the same dish as N12.

Finally we had the fried squid appetizer which comes with a nice side sauce.  We are a fan of similar dim sum dishes and this is a nice version. 

Overall we like this place but find the menu to be quite narrow.   Other than today we don't typically get soups and we don't like pad thai noodles.   As we go through the menu more won't gets quickly eliminate the field.   Then again we have been here and ordered three KH1s during our stay and have been more than content with that. 

Bathrooms clean and staff friendly.   Will return. 

Quick facts
- tea no charge
- takes AMEX
- no private lot to park
- take out available"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, I like this place. It's a lesser-known, underrated get in North York in my opinion. 

I had the rare beef pho with tripe. Dinner is served with tea, and it came pretty quick. I had medium-size bowl which was a good size for one person, probably could have even done with just small size. Noodles were good, broth was good without being too salty. 

My dinner cost $7.85 including taxes, a good price in my opinion. 

The restaurant is well-lit, nice modern decor. The staff don't really bother with you after you get your food, unless you ask, in which case they help you quickly. 

The menu also has lots of Korean, Thai and Vietnamese options which I'm eager to try. 

If you're looking for an easy, low-key place, I highly recommend Pho Spring Garden if you're in the area. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Solid pho. It won't blow you away, but it should satisfy you.

Spring Rolls were good, but not amazing.

Prices are dirt cheap. Portions are huge. Excellent cheap option."}
