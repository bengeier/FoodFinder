{"text":"The Calzone is HUGE...very good and the cheese bread was pretty good. Too greasy for me but good flavor"}
{"text":"Beware of their misleading flyers and advertising.
Simply deceitful.
Ordered a 16\" pizza with 2 toppings.  Had a $5 off coupon.  Owner said he would not honor it because the coupon was for \"cheese only.\"  He said this has 2 toppings on it which I said I would gladly pay for.  Owner said \"no\" and that I need to pay full price with no discount and that I should have mentioned the coupon when ordering.  Really? I guess they thin out the \"cheese\" or something..  I said \"No\" I'm not paying for that and walked out.
Guess his business is so good he does not need any new regular customers.
Would have cost him $5 to build a great regular customer relationship with me.  Instead....this situation.
Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Definitely an awesome spot to pop into and just get some quick food, everything seemed very fresh and the employes were head on with what I thought was a confusing order,   7-8 sandwiches and not even one screwup"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about this place because there's only negative main reviews yet the filtered ones are all positve.  ????

Took my chances.  i went in and ordered a veggie sub (hold the cheese and sauces).  Loaded it up with lots of veggies.  Flling, but of course not a full-meal. I might come back to try a salad or two.  Good as an emergency vegan food place for the far south strip."}
{"text":"I say this place is worth it if you purchased a groupon. I called to place an order for pick-up & they told me to come by in a half an hour. I arrived at an empty restaurant 40 minutes later & my food wasn't ready yet. 

Other than that... The guys running the place were friendly, the pizza was decent & the Caesar salad was pretty tasty. I like how they incorporated pieces of pita bread instead of croutons in the salad. Try it out if you're a patient person who lives nearby!"}
{"text":"good damn this is some great pizza. came here on my last day. gonna make it my traditional go home meal from now on. service was great. the host gave me the remote and told me to make my self at home.very nice guy.even knew my home town and where it was. ingridients are awesome. BOARS HEAD. yeah, thats right BOARS HEAD ingridients. cheese was awesome. suace was perfect. wish they opened up a spot in LA."}
{"text":"I want to leave 0 Stars at this establishment. Let me start off by saying I went to this place because I had a GROUPON. It was for 2 large pizzas 2 liter soda and 2 cheesecakes. We get there after driving across town and the guy at the counter says they were no longer honoring groupons. I was PISSED! I bought it so you have to honor it. They refused and he offered me 10% off my pruchase. I wanted to deck him in the face. Obviously this guy knows nothing about customer service, because that's not how you keep people coming back to your establishment. STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"This place is fucking terrible! I ordered a pizza for delivery and they quoted me 45 minutes. I called back after ONE and A HALF HOUR only to have the delivery guy tell me he's on the way and hung up while I was in the middle of the sentence. Thirty minutes later, no on still came and I called them again. They claimed that the delivery guy got lost and started blaming me for giving me the wrong address. Are you fucking kidding me. This mexican guy can't even speak or understand English properly! I immediately asked for a refund and the guy on the phone stopped talking and HUNG UP! WTF! Unacceptable! I called my bank to cancel this purchase immediately! What a fucking scam! I payed them with my credit card through phone since that's the only way they said and they didn't even tell me the total and just asked for my card number! DO NOT PURCHASE from this place! Stupid, shadyass mexicans that do not respect their customers. This place just opened up, well they need to close down already because you won't survive with terrible customer service."}
{"text":"My burger was cold, friends pizza cold, we received the wrong order first, and he tried to charge us twice. Terrible place. I had to put I wished I could have put negative for stars."}
{"text":"Came in with a Groupon. There is no time specified for the Groupon but was told it's good only for dinner but he accepted it anyway at 3. Pizza was ok quality but super greasy. The side salad was large and fresh."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza on the phone...the price was $10.95  when I went to pick it up I gave them a coupon for $5.00 off I was charged $12.82 which was more than it should have been even without the coupon...why oh why  I live around the corner from this place and we have flyers in the lobby from them..I guess I will have to tell them to remove them"}
{"text":"First time doing a review.
I order delivery from this place multiple times while i'm at work. The delivery guy accused me saying he ran a record of my number and that I always say I work at a place called world mark causing him to go to the wrong place. 
That upset me because I don't even know where world mark. Come to find out I work near there. Why would I say I work somewhere else when I want my food. While working I had to help a guest. While helping the guest he just put my change on the table and walked out and I was about to tip him. I always tell the person on the phone where I am located at but this may be the reason why when I ordered before I did not get my food. Love the food and service is usually good but not that time."}
{"text":"Awful cardboard like pizza.  I had a groupon for 2 medium 2 topping pizzas, anti pasta salad and 2 liter soda.  Basically it was useless tasteless calories for nothing.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"I just had the WORST and most rude telephone worker.  I saw the advertisement on groupon. I called to see if they could deliver and I would pay the price. The worker told me yes we deliver to your location until I mentioned I was using groupon. The male worker had the audacity to tell me \"we can't deliver to you! We would make no money! So you tell me how that's good for us?\" I was so confused and said \"umm it's your business selling on groupon, why are you gettin mad at me?\" Then he tells me \"we don't even make the food you order from groupon here, it's just an introductory to the food, we make no money off you so I'm not delivering\" I was livid, I asked for his name so I could explain to the owner how he was acting and he hung up on me!! If this is how the business is ran, imagine how they cook the food. Thank you for treating me horrible, saved me money and hopefully can warn others about NOT buying their food/ groupon."}
{"text":"I found them on Restaurant.com.  I had a coupon which they agreed to deliver if I tipped the driver well.  1:40 min later I called to make sure they had not forgotten me and was told the driver had already left.  31 min later I was actually leaving to go get something else to eat when the driver finally showed up.  What is so frustrating is that they never hinted to me that it might take over 2 hours, and then when I called they lied to me by telling me my food was no longer in the building.  I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Food was great and customer service too. Great pricing. Totally recommend for anyone wanting to get away from the hustle n bustle of the busy side of the strip"}
{"text":"BBQ chicken pizza was very good.  Hand tossed crust excellent.  Also had a corned beef sandwich with 2\" of stacked meat.   Sandwich was one of the best.  Friendly staff and reasonable wait time."}
{"text":"Ordered a supreme pizza with 20 buffalo wings for takeout.  It was very good and ready in 20 minutes!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting vegas and decided to get a Groupon for this restaurant. We ordered our pizza and were told if we wanna dine-in they would charge us a percentage. It's there way of getting something out of customers since we bought it at a discounted price. Never heard of a seating fee at a restaurant. Read the rules of there Groupon before purchasing unless u want to take-out."}
{"text":"Service was not good at all! Opens at 11 but says the ovens are not ready until 12:30. What kind of place opens but can't make pizza until hour and half later. There are many better places to go to then this."}
{"text":"The pizza sauce tasted like it was made with Tabasco!  New owners. When we told them about how bad the pizza was he said well I will only charge you half price.  How about no charge? ? We both got ill from this pizza. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Ghetto ass place. Rude people who don't know customer service. Glad that place closed. Roaches all up in the pizza instead of olives. SMDH!"}
{"text":"I ordered a simple Cheese Pizza, thin crust. BEST cheese pizza ever! the crust was just thing and crispy enough, the cheese was delicious and it wasn't dry like other cheese pizzas, they made sure there was enough sauce on that pizza. It was honestly so good i ended up eating a large all by myself and i am a tiny tiny woman lol Delicious, and Jorge was so nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Ever have a meal where you regret wasting your hunger and the excitement and anticipation of filling that hunger with something delicious like all you can eat sushi? To understand exactly what I'm talking about, order a pizza from Deli Pizza Cafe.

The pizza dough was tasteless, needed salt and had that dry taste to it. The sauce was basic, the cheese was cheap and overall I could find 10 frozen pizzas at walmart that I would prefer to this thing.

The only reason I'm adding a star is because the worker behind the counter was friendly...kind of a local guy that seemed to have lived in Vegas for like 30 some years...but definitely save your hunger bullets for elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a surprise my first visit was.  A girlfriend of mine had a Group-on for this place and she invited me to scope it out with her.  On the outside, it appears to be nothing special, but on the inside, the first thing I noticed was the large selection of wine and beer, and the prices are really inexpensive.  If for nothing else, it is a great place to  drink and watch sports on TV.  I love the movie posters that surround the room.  (See if you can identify the common thread.)  The service and staff are great, especially Hugh from Ireland.  He made us a great pizza from scratch and was quite entertaining.  We had a great time and we have been back.  I am planning a retirement party for my friend and hope to have it at Hugh's, oh, I mean Vegas Pizza and Deli.  ;)"}
{"text":"Needing some food after a long day of drinking. Just happen to pop into this place that was close to where we were staying. We ordered two pizzas and they were great. Loved the feel of this NY pizzeria. Prices were right and friendly staff. I am sure if in the area and wanting pizza I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pop type place. Had a ham and cheese sandwich and the bread tasted awesome and fresh. lettuce and tomoato on sandwich was fresh as well. my side was macaroni salad and it was good. same macaroni salad you would find at other places. restaurant was a nice little place and the owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"SOOOOO disappointing & it had so much promise!!! 

I ordered a Greek salad with dressing on the side for takeout on my lunch break.

I go the salad it had BEETS on it, but they were covered up with the feta cheese...like really beets??? I double checked the 'take out menu' I got to see if beets were there. 

nope no beets. I\"m not a beet fan.

and my cucumbers were mushy and old

F-

booo"}
{"text":"I have never been to this restaurant and decided to purchase a Groupon. I am so happy I did !!! The pizza was made to order and delicious.I opted to go with very generic toppings. One had sausage and mushrooms , the other had peperoni and mushrooms. They were both wonderful !! Great balance of cheese and sauce, plenty of toppings. I saved half of each for my husband, I'm sure he'll be very happy when he eats them. Had I been able to eat the whole pie I would have, unfortunately I could only eat 4 slices so I get to eat the rest tomorrow and my lucky husband gets to have the other pie and taste both. ( I split them ) I will definately be back !!! Groupon or not. Give it a try it was great"}
