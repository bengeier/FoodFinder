{"text":"By far the best sushi.   Yes it's a tiny place but you get a big amount of flavours in your mouth.  It's family owed and it shows.  Polite, nice, and they explain to you your order as well.  Food to die for and the price is good."}
{"text":"Best sushi on Fleury, by far. Presentation is amazing.
A lot of speciality, and not expensive for the quantity and the quality."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great staff but bad business.

I've been ordering there many times and I've always ordered a lot from my phone. Although they don't have the best sushi in town, they still have some very great sushi regardless, with the chef's choice along with the bonus sushi. The staffs are very great, friendly and always happy which gives the restaurant a very welcoming and warm atmosphere. Since it's a small restaurant, I've decided to support the restaurant by contacting them on the phone and ordering over $1000 worth of plates. This would be to feed my staffs and try to spread the words to make the restaurant more known. Keep in mind I was using my very same phone and I've ordered $200 plates before without a problem (and then pay when I pick up). But this time, the woman on the phone said I have to be there in person and pay first before ordering that much, because they're afraid of pranks (ordering so much but never showing up to pay). I'm a business man who has no time to waste in situations like these for my staffs. I refuse to go there to order, pay and wait long as hell. I order on phone for a reason but they can't even trust a customer who's been ordering so much before without a problem? Don't they have my phone number registered somewhere in their system? If not, please implement the system. Because you could lose big opportunities for big profits and big boost in business. Look at Di Menna restaurant for instance. I've ordered over $100 worth of foods, until one day, I've ordered over $5 000 foods for a big event. They welcomed me on the phone with MY NAME before I could even introduce myself and took the order with FAITH. Now THAT is great business. They have me registered on their systems and they've taken my orders without a problem. All I had to do is continue whatever I have to do, then I go there, pick up the foods and PAY. I was loading the truck with the foods while their deliverer was laughing at me and my ridiculous orders. But hey great time! I love it! So Sushi Ami, unless you want to stay low profile, have that system to trust your customers in case there's gonna be big orders for business."}
{"text":"Finally, a good sushi spot on the Promenade Fleury!

Sushi Ami opened its doors about four months ago. I've been by twice in the space of a week. So far I've just had their veggie sushi so I can't comment on the quality of their fish, but the veggie sushi has been excellent. Salads are delish too. If you eat in, the presentation is beautiful. BYOB. And they deliver. What more could a former Vancouver girl ask for?"}
{"text":"J'ADOREEEEEE les sushis de cet endroit. Je tiens à préciser que je n'ai jamais été physiquement à l'emplacement, mais je commande souvent. 

Le service au téléphone est super courtois. La livraison est rapide et je n'ai jamais eu d'erreur dans ma commande. Le menu midi (plateaux de sushis assortis) s'applique même à la livraison. Tout ce que j'ai goûté à date est délicieusement bon. De plus, sur leur menu il y a des coupons pour avoir certains morceaux gratuits quand on dépense un certains montant à la carte. Qu'on le mentionne ou pas..ils viennent pareil. Ils ont des sushis qu'ils ont eux même créer et les suggestions du chef Wow...merci le chef, je ne vous ai jamais vu, mais je vous adore. 

Le seul truc plate c'est qu\"on a beau dépenser pas mal, la mayo épicé est à 1$ chaque :( Moi qui préfèrerai avoir de la mayo au lieu de soya..non non il faut payer. Bref, elle est bonne pareil. Aussi, l'endroit est malheureusement fermé le dimanche. Le prix est très correct."}
