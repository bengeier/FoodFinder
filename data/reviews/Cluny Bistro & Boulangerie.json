{"text":"Came here for brunch and had the mushroom and artichoke omelette. It was very good and served with a small salad. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came to Cluny's for brunch and was slightly disappointed in the food given the cost. The decor and ambience is really nice though, it is very unique and very elegant. From the floor to the ceiling, there was always something interesting that would catch your eyes. Overall, 2/5 due to the food but will not mind coming back again to see if it's better the next time around.  AMBIENCE [4/5] Very elegant and classy. Everything is laid out very nicely inside the dining area. Definitely a unique feel inside with the beautiful floor and ceiling and distinct tableware. The music that was playing in the background didn't match with the feel of the restaurant though.  SERVICE [3/5] Waitress was friendly but was not very attentive to our table. She was preoccupied with the table next to ours most of the time.  FOOD [2/5]  Fresh Baked Bread - FREE This was probably the best dish that we had. Portions were generous and the bread was very fresh.   French Onion Soup - $16 Disappointed that the French onion soup was not hot when it arrived at our table. It was just warm. In hindsight, we probably should have asked the waitress to take it back. It was not overly salty like typical French onion soup but was nothing special as well.  2 Poached Egg Benedict with Crab Hollandaise - $17 Disappointed that the dish came out with the English muffin burnt! For the price of this, I expect more attention to detail. This dish wasn't bad nor was it particularly spectacular. It was just average in terms of taste."}
{"text":"It is a shame that Cluny falls into the category of good food ruined by terrible service.   I have dined at Cluny a few times in this year and have been bothered by the lack of check-ins and water refills. In my most recent visit, we had to start packing up in order to get someone's attention to bring a credit card machine over. (Sometimes I wish I could stand up and wave someone down like in Chinese restaurants...)  That being said, I do actually find the food pretty good. The tomahawk veal meatball is great and I have yet to find a restaurant that does souffle consistently well. Cluny probably still has the most reliable food in the Distillery District that isn't outrageously expensive.   I would return to Cluny, but I hope the service can be stepped up."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely gorgeous  The ambience is great and just what the Distillery District needed!  The tuna tartar looks absolutely delicious.  They are only open in the afternoon to evenings. Reservations can be made online. They are big on social media so you can be tweet or facebook ready #clunyTO  This is definitely a must try! :)  Hope this helps! -JT"}
{"text":"This review is for dinner and I speculate that brunch is a different (and hopefully better) experience altogether.  We visited Cluny Bistro on a Thursday night. It is quite a sizeable restaurant in the Distillery District and the decor and design of the restaurant is romantic and lovely, somewhat reminiscent of a bistro in Paris. The atmosphere is what potentially will draw me back to try brunch on the patio in the summer. However, the food unfortunately did not live up to the beauty of the restaurant itself.  I would also like to note that despite the lovely display of various breads in the center of the restaurant, the bread served to our table was not as crunchy and soft as we expected. On the bread spectrum, it was more on the hard crust and dense interior side of breads, unlike what we would expect from a Paris bistro.  We started with the salt cod donuts for an appetizer. It was served in the cutest little iron skillet with a side of smoked potato dipping sauce. The donuts had a thin crispy shell and a creamy inside similar to mashed potato. Despite being cod donuts, I could not really taste the cod, however they were pretty tasty overall with the creamy smoked potato dipping sauce.   For main dishes, we had the hunter's stew with rabbit, pheasant sausage, and beef cheek and the veal meatball \"tomahawk\", which was tomato braised and served with a side of gnocchi. The hunter's stew was served in a small bowl, with a side of mustard sauce and a flaky pastry bread. Although the meats were tender, the flavour was lacking depth and it was a forgettable dish except for the fact that it was quite small. The veal tomahawk was also tender, slightly better in flavour, and larger in portion. I enjoyed the side of gnocchi (garnished with parmesan and basil, to the best of my knowledge) better than the veal tomahawk itself.   For dessert, we had the most disappointing praline profiteroles. Three profiteroles were beautifully plated, accompanied by chocolate chantilly, caramel crunch, hazelnut, and strawberry coulis. Unfortunately, the pastry itself was very hard and dense to the point that I had difficulty splitting the profiterole for a more manageable bite. The profiteroles were not very sweet but the delicate flavours were overpowered by the exceedingly sour strawberry coulis. The only part I enjoyed of dessert was the hazelnut and caramel crunch but I would not recommend this dessert.  Honestly, I wish I could love this place based on concept and atmosphere alone, but the quality and taste of the dishes at Cluny did not reflect the price point.  Overall rating: 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"This evening my friends and I dined at Cluny Bistro. Our server's name was Anthony I believe. Let's begin with the service. We had a group of 8 people and auto gratuity therefore applied. We learned of this at the end and it all made sense. Anthony was completely lethargic! He could care less whether we enjoyed our meal or whether or food arrived on time.   The Food. I personally got the Hanger steak medium. I have never had a more overcooked steak.... It was like chewing on a leather bag. Everyone else's steaks were either undercooked or overcooked. The $36 filet mignon was underwhelming..... The best part of that was the fries. Beware of the wine menu.... Many of these can be found at the lcbo at a third of the price. Then there was the dreadful mojito that two of my friends got. It definitely got the job done...however it tasted more like cough syrup.   Highlights of the night: the fries, the soap in the bathroom, the bread, and the ambiance. I must say a restaurant in this price range should meet a higher standard than the quality of its bathroom. I have visited this restaurant for winterlicious 2014 and I did enjoy the seasonal menu. Maybe tonight was a bad night, but I can't say there will be a third time."}
{"text":"Service: Came here on a Sunday night for dinner without reservations.  The manager was great in adjusting the table arrangements so we could sit inside (most tables were reserved and it was a little cold outside). Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu as it was the first time for most of us.  Food: I ordered the liver and onions, it was delicious if you like liver (you can even choose how well you want it done).  Others got the seafood stew, truffled wagyu hache, Cluny double bacon cheeseburger, and veal meatball.  Everyone was happy with their dishes which were fairly large portions, and we had no room for dessert. I did pick up a few praline profiteroles on my way out from the bakery, which totally hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Went for the summerlicious 2017. Seafood chowder is very good, dessert is good, but the stake is awful.......can't explain it but taste so weird...overall very nice experience."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance and excellent food. The tuna steak sandwich was very tasty. Their cocktail aren't the best"}
{"text":"Very beautiful restaurant.  Large but at same time cozy.  Perfect lighting.  Lovely but not too loud. Great bread.  Fried asparagus was good.  Mains were great - satisfying but not too heavy.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The place itself is gorgeous, very Parisian!!! Love everything about it! The service was also very friendly and good. The drinks are on a pricey side for sure! A mimosa is $15! As for food, it's good. I had a French toast with ricotta and fruit compote (was very good and lots of it). We also ordered eggs with spinach (eggs were a bit undercooked) and a basket of pastries. Overall, a very pleasant experience and I will come back for dinner for sure! Would love to sit at an oyster bar first. It's a nice place to go just for drinks as well as the bar area is very cozy."}
{"text":"Service was meh. Food was ok, but overpriced for what it was. Regret getting the macaron ice cream sandwiches for dessert. Macarons were hard and stale and ice cream wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"We have been going to Cluny's quite regularly and this night was absolutely horrendous. We were put on a waiting list and was Told that it would be 25 to 30 minutes. That was perfectly fine because it was the Tuesday of the Christmas market and we totally understood We walked around and did not receive any calls so we went back. They said it would be another 30 minutes so we said we would sit at the bar we were very patient. 30 minutes past and we got no call. We had a meal at the bar still no call. The service at the bar was pathetic. had a meal drinks a bottle of wine/no bread - ran out. We had to ask for cutlery/napkins/water etc. ordered a ginger beer the server went into the fridge & served an already open bottle of ginger beer and did not even use the entire beer but charge me the entire amount. another server said that if it was her table we wouldn't be receiving poorservice. She should've approached the mgr instead. I understand it was a busy night but you have been part of the Christmas market for eight years now shame on Clunys. Shame on you. Will not ever come back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent selection of wines (would like to have seen more 0.5L options) Somewhat surprised how much of our meal was deep fried (takes away from the frenchness).  Service was very good with the extreme exception of the boulangerie (walked out of there thanks to one employee's attitude)"}
{"text":"Wow! What a fantastic place!  My wife and I came to celebrate our 10th Anniversary.  Andrew (Manager) and Maddison (our server) were awesome and made our meal a special occasion.  So friendly and went above and beyond for us! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had a disappointing experience at Cluny last night which is what is prompting me to sign up on Yelp and write this review.  Although I am new to writing an official review on Yelp, my husband and I are no stranger to frequenting a variety of top restaurants in Toronto and around the world for that matter.  Last night was our first time at Cluny and we were both very excited to try it out.  When we walked in, we were immediately impressed with the quaint French bistro décor and overall feel and ambiance.  Loved the little bakery at the front of the restaurant.  When we arrived, we were not greeted by anyone (restaurant wasn't even busy at this point 6:45 Monday evening), after about 5 mins of standing there looking around, someone that looked like he was one of the Chefs (who happened to be getting something in the stock room/closet, finally said someone will be with you shortly.  We were greeted by the hostess with a less than impressive hello.  After we were seated, it took about 10mins before we were acknowledged by our Waiter for the evening.  Again, was not impressed by his demeanor and lack of interest in us as guest.  We've probably had better service at a local Chain restaurant or a drive thru for that matter!  Our appetizers came relatively quickly (Oysters, Cod balls and Caesar salad).  The Caesar salad was a complete disappointment, perhaps I had high expectations but when you proudly call a dish \"Cluny Caesar\" with a price tag of $13+ I would expect a little more than 2 branches of Romaine barely drizzled with dressing and 4-5 chick peas and feta lining the bottom.  We ordered Oysters and when it was  brought to us, the Waitress was trying to explain the different Oysters and said \"Oh and I forget what this one is called....\" Anyway, I don't want to get too lengthy with the review here but all in all I would rate the food quite good (minus the Caesar salad) at this restaurant but the underwhelming service takes this place to a whole new low.  The atmosphere in terms of décor and ambiance were excellent, very reminiscent of a bistro in Paris which is a rare find here.  The service was beyond below average.  Our waiter (middle aged male, appeared quite sloppy if I can be honest) was inattentive, unpleasant and simply unprofessional.  He did not check on us until our dinner was done and did not even utter a \"Thanks or good bye\" when we paid the bill.  This is definitely a very poorly managed establishment with very disengaged, unprofessional/untrained staff, you can see it in their demeanor and even the way they are dressed. I think the hostess was wearing running shoes and some other waiters were dressed in black golf shirts or sports bra like gym attire.  I am disappointed because this place has potential."}
{"text":"Dreadful service.  Food was good though.  They really lived up to the French \"slow food\" idea.  I went there for brunch.  We sat for at least 10 minutes before I chased down a server to order coffee.  Food took a while to come, and the coffees STILL somehow didn't show up until our food was almost done.  When we finished, we had to ask twice for the bill before finally giving up and going inside to pay."}
{"text":"The decor and location are very charming.  The food is acceptable but not special.  The music is too loud making conversation difficult.  Not the romantic setting we were anticipating."}
{"text":"Celebrated the holidays here with the work gang in the private dining room (December 4). I won't say I was disappointed by any means and yet I won't say I was thoroughly elated either. I would say my experience was elegant, organized, and overall good.   Firstly, I absolutely have to give big kudos to the super lovely gal that looked after me: Camille. She was simply amazing in ensuring my gluten-free needs were met. Personable and on the ball, she ensured I wasn't left out in a sea of 'gluten 20 ways' appetizers, bringing me delicious sans bun beef sliders. I was also served by another lovely gal by the name of Marie-Claire who had only been there two weeks and frankly, fooled me with her astute charm and incredible service skills. And now, let's talk about the food, shall we?  I began with the roast cauliflower salad with pomegranate dressing and roasted hazelnuts. Let me preface by saying that there is a certain expectation on my part when dining out at a swanky place like Cluny. I can make a plain cauliflower salad at home; I want something slightly fancy and full of effort when I dine out. Sadly, the salad was overly basic, lacking in flavour, and lacking discipline. It was apparent that not much thought went into the orchestration or presentation. Picture roast cauliflower, a few toasted hazelnuts, mint and parsley leaves, a few chives, and a handful of pomegranate seeds tossed together in a bowl and then plopped in another bowl (with little to no dressing).   I chose the grilled organic chicken for my main, having instructed to omit the gluten, and go crazy on olive oil and sea salt and pepper. What I got was a hefty portion of thick grilled asparagus and yellow zucchini with a small skin-on chicken breast. The vegetables were wonderful and full of char flavour. The chicken was undercooked and pink and I didn't think it a good idea to eat beyond the fully coked breast tip. I did communicate this and I will say that the gals were so wonderfully understanding and Camille apologized profusely and offered me other options. Service is A+ here.  Oh, before I forget, I had the most amazing gluten free bun here. It was absolutely perfect, brimming with hints of molasses and reminiscent of old fashioned sailor's bread. I asked for the recipe but I am told that the baker was not willing to part with the details. Naturally, I understand, having been a pastry chef myself at one time. But, gosh darn, that bread was incredible!  Dessert was okay. Naturally, I opted for the macarons (read my other reviews) and overall, they weren't too bad; a tad too chewy, but hey, not everyone can attain Ladurée or Hermé standards.   I did go around and ask my colleagues to share their thoughts on their meals. Here's a summary: almost everyone who had the tuna niçoise said it was salty, the tagine was very good (although I will say it was served in a cauldron-esque bowl and not actually a tagine), the tomahawk was enjoyed and so were the frog legs, the lentil soup was unanimously salty.  On a final note, the restrooms are impeccable and clean. I'd most likely visit Cluny again."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant and was really hoping it would be great.  As it is still pretty new I will probably give it another chance in a month or two.  Went for lunch on Saturday but they only offered the brunch menu which is pretty limited in choices.  The portions were quite small for the price.  Some dishes were pretty good and some were very bland and boring.  The oysters were very good.  The tuna tartare and croque madame were just okay.  French onion soup was good but small for the price.  The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated.  Our server was very friendly but was constantly coming by wanting to take our plates away when we were nowhere near finished.  Surprising because the restaurant was 75% empty.  Hopefully in time they will improve and we will give it another try at dinner time."}
{"text":"I had the baked chocolate and vanilla French toast. It was amazing!!! The dark chocolate balanced out the sweetness. Very hearty brunch...and oh so heavenly. The bread basket was also delicious, a combination of fresh rosemary bread and baguette. Apparently the owners wife owns the kitchen shop next door, Bergo, so lots of unique plate ware used (check out their tea pot - super fun)"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch with my sister and niece.  The place was very nice.  Couldn't resist the beautiful renovation and did a bunch of selfies like a tourist.    Lunch was a choice of oyster bar or from the menu.  The choices on the menu was light, but it did have quite a variety - from seafood to red meat.  I really appreciate the special of the day.  Omelet du jour, which was recommended by the server.  The serving was very satisfying, duck was nice and tender, egg was just right - sprinkled with a few crunchy bits of pork rinds.  Was amazing!  The food was a tad heavy on the saltiness. Now that I am on LCHF for a while, my taste buds has changed and thinking back, the high salt content is something I would appreciate now.   The server was very professional and  super nice, we couldn't refuse dessert when suggested.  Her recommendation was a hit again!    When my niece asked for a small take out box for the vanilla biscuit she was saving for grandma, the server threw in a few more.  I really appreciate the sweet gesture.   The food might not be our first choice, but the service at this place was superb.  Definitely returning and recommending."}
{"text":"The food and service here is fantastic. The best thing on the menu is the passion fruit soufflé. Oh my god it's so good. I can't forget about it. The steak frites was good I cleared my plate when usually I wouldn't get through half of a serving that size. I ate for a very long time slowly clearing my plate. Then I went for the dessert I was so full before I ordered it but I had to as soufflé is rarely on a menu. I ended up finishing my dessert as well. I can't remember the last time I left a restaurant that full and feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"The house made bread was delicious and the service was great, but that's about all that I loved about this place. Paid $16 for a bowl of thick sugary French onion soup. I could barely even swallow three spoonfuls. Also had the $26 seafood shore lunch which was their take on fish and chips. I left most of the food on the plate because it was not very good. The whole experience was altogether unsatisfying. Took a few uninspired photos. Maybe I just had back luck with my menu choices. I likely would not return because of the price. Fool me once..."}
{"text":"I loooove this place. The ambiance is amazing. Decorated so well giving you a feast for your eyes. Then the food comes and come on, delicious. We had the kale salad (fine good), and two ceviches : the scallop and king fish (by far my fave- so bright and flavourful). Shore lunch fish (perch and frites) was plentiful so it's easy to split. My tuna steak  was perfectly cooked and flavourful. As for service, Mike was great!"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when walking into Cluny is the picturesque space that the restaurant encompasses. Cluny was designed by one of Canada's Top Hospitality Design Firm, and I can really see why. From the ceilings to the tiling, there was no bad spot in the restaurant to sit.  Here is what we ordered: - Spice Roasted Pumpkin Bisque | puffed wheat berries, almond milk chantilly - Cluny Black Kale Caesar | balsamic dressing, smoked cheddar and chick peas - Chickpea and Sweet Potato Tangine | couscous, harissa and apricot - Alsatian Choucroute Sandwich | braised pork shank, sauerkraut, mustard, frites - Pomegranate Granita - Roasted Hazelnut Profiterole | chocolate chantilly  In summary, I really enjoyed it here! The decor really did it for me.  The service was great, but I feel like they weren't at their best on the day we were there. For example, they did not give us our food in sync. This seems like such a small thing but it does have an impact (for example, they gave me my soup 5-10 minutes before V got her salad. By the time her salad came, my soup was already cold).  About the food, it was alright. I had no complains about the bisque (they gave me a new one). The salad was good, but they had added a little too much dressing. The tangine was very tomato-y and got cold too fast for my pace of eating haha. The sandwich was very difficult to eat but the fries were really good with the aoili sauce on the side. The granita was refreshing and the profiterole was presented nicely. But as I was looking over their regular menu, I already pointed out many things I wanted to try. I can't wait to be back and try their beef bourguignon poutine (yeah, that exists...)!!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible. The fish and chips  children's meal was spicy! The cauliflower salad was terrible."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for dinner and once for lunch.  Both time had tuna dishes (the Tuna sandwich is EXCELLENT).  Great service, food and atmosphere.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant but the food was underwhelming ... had high expectations based on all the great reviews but was disappointed"}
{"text":"I came here for a Bridal Shower Brunch. The manager Andrew provided the best service the bride, bridal party and her family could have asked for! He was there to help set up and was willing to do anything we needed him to do in order for the day to run smoothly. The ladies serving the brunch were also extremely helpful and friendly. The food at this place is heavenly! It started as a yogurt and pastry bar and seamlessly transitioned to family brunch including delicious french toast, kale salads, quinoa salads, and bacon. Everything I ate I loved. Mimosas and Champagne were also served throughout. The macaroons were the thank you gifts for all the guests and they came from Cluny's bakery. I cannot express how wonderful of a day this was and it could not have happened without Andrew and his amazing staff! Can't wait to go back to Toronto to experience it all over again!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the restaurant decor and was pleasantly surprised when I realized it was larger than I thought. Decor is exquisite but I was sad I wasn't able to get a window seat because they were reserved for larger parties. Our waiter was nice and very attentive. The food however was okay. The kale Caesar was nice and I enjoyed the roasted chickpeas because they added a nice crunch. The burger really wasn't anything special. It tasted somewhat bland and the sausage on it tasted like something I could get at a street corner. I did however enjoy the fries which tasted like hickory sticks almost. They were crunchy like chips and well seasoned. For dessert, I had the black currant and lavender macaron. It had a very strong lavender taste which some may find off putting. The macaron itself was very chewy which I liked but my friend didn't. Overall I would probably only go again for dessert and the ambiance/ decor."}
{"text":"Seriously overpriced for the small, average-tasting food portions.    Shaky service (we were assigned 3 waiters in our two hour stay.. the first waiter announced he was leaving for the night and introduced the second guy, and then we had a third guy).   Pretentiously adorned..looks like it was designed by the same people who design Las Vegas eateries (Restaurant owner:  \"I want the Paris look, but on a low budget\". Designers: \"Sure, we can do that\".  )   Seats are uncomfortable after an hour (we sat beside the bar area).   There are more and more places like this popping up in Toronto - elaborately decorated, with average food for above average prices.   There is nothing authentic or \"French bistro\" about Cluny. It could be anywhere in an American subdivision or, as I said above, more likely plunked down in a mid range hotel in Las Vegas.   If you must go, have a hearty meal somewhere else beforehand and just have coffee or a drink at \"Clooooooney\" on the patio."}
{"text":"I celebrated my wife's birthday with some friends.  Placed reservation and the place looks cozy when we got in. We placed our order and it took 30 minutes for the appetizers to come in and another 45 minutes wait for the main dish.  One of the staff said they were short of people.  It was Saturday night and they should be expecting a lot of people to eat especially with the amount of reservations.  I ended up returning my food because it was overcooked while my friends' food were undercooked.  It was a bad experience even the couple beside us were growing impatient due to the wait.  Not how I would experience on my wife's birthday.  If I could give a half star, maybe i would."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a feast for the eyes, as well as the stomach. The ambiance is warm and bright, and only enhanced by the smell of fresh bread. We enjoyed the summerlicous menu, really great value. We couldn't help adding on some oyster once we saw how fresh the seafood bar looked. Are server's name was Mike, he was lovely, great timing with our courses, and drinks. Can't wait to try the brunch, Cluny is now one of my top 3 favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"I had my brunch reservation to celebrate my anniversary booked a month in advance. I was sooooo excited to go to Cluny. Place is stunning and people were very very nice. I wanted it to keep being awesome! Unfortunately I ordered the Maple Bourbon pancakes. I received 3 pancakes: 1 was burnt, 1 was raw, and thank god at least 1 was good enough to eat. But even for the good one, the bourbon creme topping, not that memorable and not something I would die to have again. I expected so much more from a high-end bistro. Pancakes have to be one of the easiest things to cook! And I've had amazing pancakes at many restaurants. In the end, I didn't bother to say anything to the server (not my style) and left. Pretty disappointing anniversary brunch."}
{"text":"4 stars for decoration..... Not as cozy as I thought. 5 stars for the staff... Very friendly.... 3 stars for the food.... Duck poutine too blend and heavy......organic chicken not memorable..... Deserts are too sweat and heavy.... Feels like a kids desert at Chucky Cheese. Overall the concept is here but the food needs more refinement ."}
{"text":"My experience here was not the greatest!! Despite the beautiful decor, the service is very low for ratings, everyone working seemed very distracted not coming by asking how we were, not filling our glasses, and getting our order wrong. I would not be coming again."}
{"text":"I was here for another winterlicious dinner. I like the atmosphere and the design of the restaurant. The food were good and I enjoyed it. The best part is the dessert. It was a lavender tea chocolate bar. It's not too sweet which is perfect."}
{"text":"Beef Tartar was spectacular as well as the service. A must when in the distillery district in Toronto."}
{"text":"I live upstairs from Cluny and have eaten there before with adequate results (food decent, menu not available (apparently on whim of the chef), service gets by).  However, I just tried to order take out from this restaurant and was highly disappointed. I called ahead to ask if they offered take out and was told, yes, but that I'd have to come in to order. Annoying, but fine - at least I had the option to not waste my time. After deciding to go down to order and then wait for the food to be prepared, I was ignored a hostess, before being told that I must order from the bar.   After being ignored by the bartenders for about 5 minutes, I asked one when he came close if I could order some food to go when he had a moment. He then proceeded to inform me that it would be TEN MINUTES before he could TAKE the order (after which of course, I would need to wait for it to be ready). IT'S MONDAY, the restaurant and bar were not full (and I have two years of waitressing experience to help me judge that!)   I then asked the hostess if someone else could take my order as the bartender wouldn't be able to do so for some time. She informed by that maybe a manager could, but made no move to find them - advising me to just wait at the bar.   Needless to say, I left, and went to the much friendlier Mill St Brewery 100 feet away.   It seems that Cluny has decided to maintain a facade of French snobbery, proving that they seemingly have not actually travelled to Paris, where exquisite service is a profession and people take pride in their work."}
{"text":"I went to this French bistro the first time last Monday. The experience was very positive. The atmosphere is very European and very suitable to the French theme. Our server (her name is Emma if you wonder) is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Food itself was great. However I find myself liking the appetizers more than the main. My recommendation would be the crispy sesame asparagus and spicy tuna tatar. If you have Emma as your waitress, then you have to order coffee. That girl knows her coffee. Overall experience is 'fancy atmosphere and food with unpretentious service and price'. Great experience."}
{"text":"Visited at the end of August for a friend's birthday. Our waitress was very attentive and accommodated our large and indecisive group very well and very patiently. She took time to explain the menu, gave us time to decide, made some solid recommendations to try different things,and even helped us select a birthday drink for my friend. Excellent service overall.  From memory, things we tried: frogs legs, kale salad, veal meatball tomahawk, moroccan chickpea stew, shore lunch, lime and chili king fish... I think we had others but I can't remember. Honestly, all of it was really good. The only thing was that we had wanted to try some of the tuna and they were completely out.  Overall, the food and service was excellent. The ambience is beautiful - perfect for a special occasion. It's a bit pricier, but I recommended it recently to a friend for a bridal shower and it's perfect for that type of event. Will have to return to check out the bakery!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a friend and I ordered the hanger steak with a nice bottle of Boudreaux wine.   The food was delicious and cooked to perfection. Their fries are super flavourful with a hint of onion and cut very thinly (I think that's why they're so tasty).   This place can be very price though so be ready to spend a bit.   Service was also great. The gentleman who was serving us was very attentive to our needs and provided us with excellent service.  Whenever I get the chance, I shall come back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here on a friday night.  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share: salt cod donuts, fried frog's legs (yes, they do taste like chicken), french onion soup, raw oysters, egg omelet, lobster, frites, spicy salmon tartar. For dessert, we ordered the passion fruit souffle which was probably the only thing that was just ok that night.  We also received profiteroles on the house (which were so delicious!), as there was a birthday at our table.  The highlight of our night was definitely our server.  I wish I could remember his name (gordon(?) or something like that), anyway..he was awesome! So friendly, funny, knowledgable about the menu, and very attentive."}
{"text":"In the picturesque Distillery District this \"French\" restaurant is utterly forgettable. Over booked on Thursday meant unreasonable wait time.  Attentive service but the food is bland and not creative. No excitement here. Expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"My hubby and I booked this French resto for a date night thinking that it might be romantic. Boy were we in for a surprise when we showed up only to be surrounded by hoards of women on a girls night out.  The resto had great ambience akin to being in a French bistro however with a modern decor and everything amplified, including the noise level. They had a partially open kitchen and an open bread bar where you could be up close and personal to the action.  The food was good with large portions. We had a couple of raspberry point oysters and two steak frites. The French onion soup was good however not enough soup and too much caramelized onions for my taste.   I subsequently went back for a girl's night out and had a great time.   The service is impeccable , the prices are reasonable, the ambiance is a touch upscale but also quite relaxed/casual."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for brunch and it was delicious. The place is super cute and we loved it."}
{"text":"4/5! this is a great new french restaurant in distillery. The ambiance and decor is remarkable; you definitely feel the European presence. For starters, i highly recommend the asparagus covered in sesame seed batter and for a main the BBQ seabass is a must try! Personally, we didn't enjoy the sweetbreads - so avoid that unless you like fairly chewy meats."}
{"text":"First of all, the decor is absolutely breathtaking. Our server was  unbelievably pleasant, a breath of fresh air actually. She even split our bill 10 ways for us. Unfortunately, the food for me was underwhelming. Too much fried and breaded items - the frogs legs, perch, asparagus, cod fritters and sweetbreads.  The frogs legs were very tender and fell off the bone so why overwhelm it with all the ubiquitous breading?  It would have been better lightly floured and pan fried as the core product was of good quality. My kale salad was over salted. Ok enough of my belly-aching and on to the good stuff. The standouts were the desserts especially the souffle and chocolate truffle bar. The presentation drew gasps from every member of our group.   I'm tempted to come back to sit at their stunning oyster bar but I don't think I'll be back for seconds of what I had in the dining room. But I may be back to see how they fare with their steak frites. I just wish the food was more authenticly French. In absence of that, it felt a bit touristy.

{"text":"We decided to try somewhere new for a birthday and made reservations for 7 on Sunday. Great atmosphere and amazing decor. We had the duck poutine to start and it was delicious, lamb two ways was missing seasoning but was good when we added salt. The only complaint is the service, our waitress was nice at the beginning but she did not offer us any of the specials. We heard the server next to our table offer stuff from the seafood bar but we were not informed. There was shrimp and oysters on special but it was too late as we had already placed our order. Once our server started getting more tables she completely stopped coming around ours and neglected us until we asked for the bill. Felt a little ackward towards the end as she was rude and was trying to get rid of us without even saying thank you.  We will not go back or recommend this place as it left a bad impression on us. We regret not choosing another place for our special dinner plans. Food was good but for the price and the service is not worth it."}
{"text":"Truly one of my favourite restaurants. From the gorgeous interior to the last sip of the french onion soup, this place is nothing short of a class act."}
{"text":"The Striploin Steak frites was perfectly done.  It was cooked at a medium rare as requested but what made the meal stand out was the frites!   Reminded me of frites I had in France."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to our brunch! Although we liked the atmosphere, and had good service, I don't think we will rush back. I had the mushroom benny. It was tasty but way way too oily and nothing amazing. My partner had the more basic breakfast which was ok but nothing special either, although maybe expected given the order. We ordered juice specials and they were overwhelmingly sweet. Overall, we left feeling meh, and given the price, we would want a bit more in order to come back."}
{"text":"If you go to the boulangerie for a treat you get your hot drinks in paper cups, though I did not order to go. The croissant was clearly baked too long and the seating sucks."}
{"text":"First the good. The physical location is beautiful and it fits very well will the neighbourhood. Compliments to the interior decorator as well.   The reservation was poorly handled. I tried two times to get a table for 5 both times I was told they could not accommodate as they were full. Upon arrival the restaurant was half empty and we sat with about 20/30 empty seats around us for over 2 hours.   The food was underwhelming by almost every measure. First the coffee...when my coffee arrived it was luke warm...like I mean as if it came out of the tap. When I told the server he didn't seem all that concerned indicating that it happened sometimes...and then just stood there. After I prompted him further he offered to replace the coffee.   The dishes were okay but I definitely expected more. My egg was severely undercooked and had to be sent back. The spinach bed was a watery mush. Tasted like it came from frozen.   The pastries were good though, nice a fluffy. Might return of a coffee (if they get the temperature fixed) and croissant."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Amazing decor. Really ok food. I think they are working the kinks out.  Has great potential to be a very good restaurant.  I really really like it. I want it to succeed.  I was in the hospitality industry for many many years. It's nice to see beautiful big restaurants in Toronto.  Take this advice or leave it.  Your hostesses are very inexperienced. The poor things look like deer caught in headlights. It's a hard job I know but some one more seasoned with a strong personality would do wonders.  The staff are really inexperienced. I've been there 3 times. The young waiter with the scruff seemed scared and was literally throwing plates on the table to keep up, he was only serving 3 tables at brunch. He forgot coffees and took orders down wrong. He needs to be trained. Again no personality. You can't charge 24 bucks for a sandwich and and have it served by someone who doesn't know where they are. It's not a diner. We had visited Cluny the week before at brunch and the waitress brought out raw food. I don't think it was her fault but rather  the kitchens fault. But we had to try to convince her it was raw and she questioned us. Lol An experienced eye can tell when food is served uncooked.  All in all it's a fantastic place. Management needs to rethink if they want the restaurant to succeed or fail. The reason for this Reastaurant not doing well lays in the management  hands.  I hope they do. It's a gem just waiting to shine. All the best and good luck. This review is not from a bad place. I really want it to do well."}
{"text":"Service was great.  The staff were open and friendly.  The caesar salad was crisp and the crunchy chickpeas were a great addition. Salt cod doughnuts were different from anything I've tried before. Glad we ordered the tomahawk meatball (slightly spicy) and gnocchi. Leaving this place absolutely stuffed."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch during the winterlicious, Resteruant is nice, food just ok but service is poor! After starter, we waited over 40 minutes we got our desert! Waiter forgot our mains! Not sure I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Had very high hopes for this stunning, French inspired bistro. The decor is absolutely regal and spares no expense. I was ready for Classic European brunch!   Perhaps it was too soon into their opening for a visit as many of the service glitches have not been ironed out. We ordered french press coffee and water to start...and waited for nearly half an hour to receive it. Then we ordered brunch...and proceeded to wait nearly 45 minutes until receiving 3/4 of the order. My partner ordered the pastry basket (the only thing not prepared) and this arrived well after most of our party had almost finished their meals! As well, a server took away my half full coffee press; at almost $5, I'd like to finish that! They kindly brought a fresh one free of charge.   The food was stunning! However, some of the hot food (frites, eggs) was tepid. Despite  service glitches (having to ask twice to pay, never receiving water until when paying the bill), I would certainly give this bistro a well deserved second chance. The cuisine and decor are far too promising!"}
{"text":"Overall, this place is just okay.  I came here for brunch with my girlfriends. It is a very very cute restaurant - love the decor and the space.   The service here was excellent. I wish I could say the same about the food. The good - those butter croissants - delicious!  But you can find great butter croissants at many other places in the city.  The pecan bourbon pancakes were pretty good. Not amazing but pretty good. The crab cakes benny were a big disappointment. The crab cakes were extremely fishy smelling/tasting. I couldn't even finish one.  My friends agreed that their entrees were just okay.   I wouldn't recommend this place despite the cute interior.  Cute interiors can't satisfy my belly."}
{"text":"Four of us went on Sunday April 12th, 2015 for brunch/late lunch. First, it is in the beautiful unique distillery district. The restaurant interior is absolutely stunning and grand. I felt like I went to Paris today. Our server Anthony was very pleasant and friendly. Food was amazing. We had the $1 oyster each with champagne. Great way to start the meal. Then some of the mains we had were eggs benedicts, smoked salmon omelette, poutine. Not only the presentation of the dishes were beautiful, but also the taste. I would also like to add that the skinny fries that came with some of the dishes were some of the best fries I have ever had.  More importantly, there was a miscommunication with the sandwich special of the day from our server. I think the kitchen just changed the special. Long story short, when the sandwich arrived, it wasn't what we were told earlier. When Anthony realized it, he handled it very professionally. He apologized and made sure we got the correct sandwich. It's situation like this that shows a great restaurant from an ok restaurant.  Finally, I sometimes fear going into these beautiful high end restaurant that the servers sometimes have some attitude. I must say Cluny striked the perfect note with their staff -- professional yet pleasant and friendly.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice decor. French bistro. Food was no bad but it wasn't too memorable. They do have soufflé. Wish the food was much more better."}
{"text":"Very Yummy!  Their onion soup is amazing.  I love the decor at this place.  For main course I had the meatball..it was ok.  I tried my friends dishes I liked it a lot more.   The salmon tatar was really good. Services was great.  For sure i'll be coming back to this place...but it is so hard to get a reservation."}
{"text":"Terribly rude. Had a party of 7 and was told they're not accepting large parties even though there were many many empty tables and few diners here. The hostess couldn't even tell us this information, she had to go ask a manager. Avoid this restaurant due to the rude unwelcoming staff."}
{"text":"Our experience at Cluny's was great. I was with a group of people and it was my husband's birthday. It looks great inside and the person that served us was quite pleasant. The food was great, we all enjoyed our dishes. My favourite was the Cod fish donuts, yum! The cocktail drinks were also a hit with our group as they were tasty and reasonably priced. It was a very memorable experience, we keep talking about going back."}
{"text":"Well, I was expecting a lot more and was kinda disappointed.  Forget the seared foie gras, without doubt the worst version I ever had. Frogs legs were OK but nothing that I would come again for. The duck poutine was OK . I had the two way lamb which was OK but again nothing unique. Was even served a bit cold. My gf had the drunken tuna which had zero presentation and she was not impressed with the taste. Staff were friendly but service was slow. Dessert was exceptional and the best part of the night. We had the hazelnut profiteroles."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Saturday, and was very disappointed with the experience.  The omelette I ordered was drowning in a pool of oil, so I tried one bite and pushed it aside.  I looked for the server so that I could order something else, but nowhere to be seen.  With her ability to disappear like that, perhaps the server is better suited for a career in espionage.    The server didn't return to our table until long after my dining companion had finished both a French onion soup, and a full breakfast.  The server cleared my completely full plate (minus just one bite) without asking anything!  It was now too late for me to order anything else (my companion had already finished eating both of her plates a while ago), so we paid and left.  - this was the first time in my life that I paid for a meal and then went immediately somewhere else to get something to eat (I was starving!)  - Brunch for two came to $64.36 (no alcohol).  At that price point I would expect to eat something.  Anything.  God I was so hungry when I left.  I would also expect the obligatory 3-bite check in (\"how is everything?\") that even crappy pubs do.    - Only two times in my entire life have I left no tip.  This was one of those times."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant and atmosphere. French onion soup was one of the best I've had. Cauliflower salad and ceaser salads were both tasty with great dressing. Main courses were good but could use a bit more depth.  Had the lamb and the Morrocan stew"}
{"text":"Overall, great food and even better service. The food was delicious. We definitely had some things that were out of the box thinking but must say it wasn't necessarily the best French food we have ever had. Our server, Brooke, was very helpful and always stopped by to see how we were doing. We also never felt rushed and were able to finish our wine before we even had to think about ordering dessert. Atmosphere is great... Not too loud and the decor is stunning. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and decor. I was here for a birthday event involved twenty people. The good thing is I had the chance to try out many different appetizers from this restaurant.   I would say most of them are having very good presentation, yet not much attention has been put on the food itself. The sesame asparagus frit per se is such an awesome idea, deep fried sesame is already a promise for the rich flavor and fragrance. With the crispy asparagus, I would imagine it will be such an amazing dish! However, the end result was the sesame was burned because of deep frying too long,  asparagus was soggy, and the frit was very greasy, usually a result of lukewarm oil. This is a very disappointing dish with great concept, which I will definitely try it out at home. The other appetizer like scallop, pontine, tar tar, nochalos, are all on the same line. They are great idea, but poor execution.   The main dish was slightly better, even though my friend didn't like it at all. It was a lamb stew in tomato sauce, the lamb was tendered enough, and flavorful. Sauce was rich, typical for French cuisine.   As a conclusion, it could be a better restaurant, if the quality can be maintained. I hope management can see this post and make certain changes to bring the best out of its great menu."}
{"text":"We've tried Cluny in the Distillery District twice in the past month - once for the regular menu and once during Winterlicious for the prix fixe. Both meals were excellent.  Finally a really good restaurant in the Distillery District!  From the regular menu we sampled a steak tartare appetizer, the seared tuna steak sandwich main and a hangar steak.  The steak tartare was okay but not great.  Far too much ketchup or some other tomato based sauce for my liking.  Drowned out the flavour of the beef.  The grilled tuna was excellent.  Buttery.  Lightly grilled on the outside but primarily raw.  The best tuna I've had in years.  The hangar steak was perfectly cooked and very flavourful.  For our 2nd visit we began with oysters which were excellent and then had the Winterlicious Prix Fixe.  For appetizers we sampled the lentil & barely soup which was good but not great.  We also sampled the arctic char marinated in blood orange.   It was really a ceviche.  And it was excellent.  For mains we tried the duck confit and it was perfect.  We also tried the limousin beef which was cooked sous vide.  Another hit.  We also tried the grilled albacore tuna with fennel seed crepes.  Another hit.  For dessert we tried the fruit cobbler, the chocolate mousse and the poire william sorbet.  The desserts were good but not on a par with the appetizers or mains.  And not on a par with the excellent pastries and danish which you can buy at Cluny's bakery.  Service was terrific.  The room is gorgeous.  Beautifully decorated.  They've created a very comfortable atmosphere in an enormous former warehouse space.  Wine prices seem to average a 300% mark-up compared to LCBO prices.   Based on our 2 meals at Cluny we will definitely be back.   If you are visiting Toronto, give yourself time to wander through the Distillery District before or after your meal.  If you're going to a play at Soulpepper, Cluny is perfectly situated directly across the lane from the theatre."}
{"text":"I give one star to the boulangerie. I bought the baguette and look like it's been made few days ago. Not fresh at all and burned in some place. I can harm badly someone with that hard baguette"}
{"text":"Cluny has a great location and is a great looking restaurant. I was taking my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner with reservations booked in advance. Started off well when the restaurant called me and offered a free dessert for the birthday; however upon arriving, despite the reservation we had to wait in the lobby for a table to free up. The food was great overall. The service was just okay. Seems they also forgot about the birthday because the dessert was on the bill and there was no message or candle on the plate."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant recently and sat on the patio. The atmosphere was great and our waiter was very friendly. I ordered a steak that was to be pre-sliced and served with frites. It was absolutely delicious, but unfortunately it wasn't warm. The fact that we were on the patio with a breeze didn't help, nor did the fact that it was already cut, I'm sure. I debated whether I should mention it to the waiter and decided I would. He apologized and retrieved a manager who came out and made it right. He removed the steak from my bill, asked if he could heat it up and thanked me for bringing it to his attention.  Stuff happens. Everywhere. Especially when a restaurant is brand new.  In my opinion, it's really all about how these issues are handled. Well done, Cluny. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Restaurant is quite quite amazing.  Beautiful tables, high ceilings - you feel like you're in France, definitely not Toronto. The waiter was pretty good, very attentive and got everything right!  Food was meh. Don't get me wrong - it was good - it wasn't great. I'd take other french restaurants over this at the same price. I might go back, but more for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went for Summerlicious with a friend.  We were given the regular menus without the Summerlicious menu. When I asked for the Summerlicious menu, the server, Anthony, just flat out said no without a smile. I took it as a joke and just laughed. We were impressed with the food.  However, the server was the worst server I've had in a really long time.  He only came to drop off the food and literally didn't say a word or made eye contact. We tried to get his attention multiple times but failed.  It was very busy but he wasn't busy with other customers, he was often socializing with other servers.  When we finally got his attention, we asked for boxes for our main courses since we didn't finish them and we asked for dessert and the bills all at once. My friend asked for separate bills and he replied, \"yeah, that's fine\" and walked away. When another server brought us our dessert, it was the wrong one.  We advised her that we ordered the profiterole, not the macaron; she replied, \"Are you sure?\"  with no apology. I figured that Anthony punched in the wrong thing.  Even though we asked for the bill with the dessert, we again, had to flag our server down. When he finally dropped off the bill, my friend immediately asked for the machine. When he came back with the machine, he, again, did not say a word and just punched the numbers in.  I understand that not everyone is a people person but if someone is working in customer service, they need to at least be able to fake it."}
{"text":"Just don't.  Came here for winterlicious as a party of 5. None of us ordered off the winterlicious menu. We tried the burger, drunken tuna, octopus and flank steak + frites. Steak came out cold. Druken tuna was completely unseasoned. Burger was ok - a little overdone.  Octopus was like eating rubber and served on a completely unseasoned chickpea \"pancake\" which was mushy and just awful. Whoever thought this up, do yourself a favour and replace it with a polenta. Pinot noir from California was exceptional. Only giving one star for the wine and bread.  When one of my girlfriends brought it to our servers attention that we were all unsatisfied, she took offense in the blink an eye. Stating that they must be doing something right because they are \"always busy.\" She said we should've complained right away - but we don't think all 5 of us sending back our meals would've flown over well either.  Our waitress then proceeded to bring out a dessert platter for our lacklustre experience - cute; except all the desserts sucked too!   Atmosphere and decorations are lovely but food is not worth it at all. Worst $30 i've ever spent on a meal."}
{"text":"Came here on a beautiful Sunday for brunch and it was very busy.  We didn't make reservations but the hostesses were gracious enough to take my number and text me 15 min later.   Ordered the Aviation cocktail ($12) - delicious and not too sweet. Pretty pink too!  Croque Madame ($18)- this would have been good if the brioche wasn't cut so thick.  I stopped eating it halfway through and picked out the ham filling.    Braised beef bourguignon pouting ($16)- delicious!  Skinny fries in a pouting take some getting used to but everything else was great.  Steak & eggs ($19) - pretty good.   Be warned that most items come with a heaping side portion of their   frites which are delicious but we definitely overdosed on them.  Service was great, our waitress was funny and sweet.  Restaurant itself is beautiful- would love to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I went here for summerlicious and was really satisfied with the food as well as the service! They give a few varieties of complimentary bread which are all really nice. The dessert I ordered was the Buttermilk Honey cake and it was just the right amount of sweet with surprises of tangy goodness in the citrus mousse and curd."}
{"text":"Loved the spicy salmon tartar and the fresh bread. Ginger chili fried frogs legs and fried artichoke tartine were interesting. Not too impressed with the crisp sesame crusted asparagus or profiteroles.   Came during an evening visit on a weekend to the Christmas Market. Busy, but got a table in less than 15 minutes.   Service was good. Atmosphere very nice. Price on the higher side. Would still come back to try the other stuff."}
{"text":"Terrible service forcing us to leave. Hostess tells us only high tables available in the bar, okay. fine. Seat ourselves. No menus. Had to ask for menus. Get menus. No service. Had to ask for service. Bartender not friendly. Felt like we were a burden just sitting there. Prices are expensive. Why pay for expensive food when no one is paying attention to you? Won't recommend or be back. Go to Mill Street."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, great spot to dine when in the distillery district.  Service has been exceptional (dined here 4 times already and they only opened 6 weeks ago!).  The in-house baked breads/goodies are a must..take some home! Will be going back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious 2016. First of all, this is one of the most beautiful restaurant I have been to. I felt like I was on vacation in the south of France!The service was impeccable. From the menu my husband and I chose the gazpacho and the vegetable terrine. The later was a bit blend but the gazpacho was top. For mains: Limousin beef, a bit chewy and the beans a bit dry but the other accompaniments were very tasty. The buckwheat crepe was lacking a sauce as the whole thing was quite dry. Instead of pomegranate seeds it should have been a coulis. The recommend Rose was perfect though. Dessert: the stout cake was awesome. The berry soup was good. Ask to pour the :soup\" part yourself so you can taste all the components before the whole thing gets mixed. Although the summerlicious menu sounded amazing in paper it did not \"wow \"us but the ambiance certainly did. We will definitely come back and try their regular menu."}
{"text":"I am not kidding. I signed up an Yelp account for the purpose of writing the review for this restaurant. First, we waited for more than 20min for the server to take orders after we sit down in a not busy Monday night. And when I asked if there is any veggie on the side of the fillet mignon, the server educated me that \"we are not a steak house, we are a French restaurant, so we don't have veggie on the side\". Ok, fine. Thank you for telling me this with your arrogant attitude. So I ordered the Caesar salad, and they totally forgot! I was so upset and not to mention the fillet mignon was extremely over cooked. It tasted like fake meat. They forgot to give me the steak knife as well btw. At the end, when I told the server that he forgot the salad, he kept saying it's the kitchen's fault, with no apology. Me and my friend couldn't believe this happened. Anyways, I know the atmosphere and decoration is good here, but the food and the server could not match it."}
{"text":"Poor Customer Service  I was in the Distillery a few weeks ago and spotted  this beautiful restaurant and  decided that I wanted to come back to try it out.  Last week I called to see if i could make a lunch reservation for up to 16 and was told that probably would not be possible and that i could try one of their other restuarants.    Given this is a large location and my reservation was for lunch I found this odd that they did not seem interested in addressing my request.  The person then said they would check with the manager  and after an extended wait the person came back to the phone to say that they might be able to able to assist me and that the Manager would have to call me back.   I was also told it would have to be a fixed menu - which again I found quite odd.        It is now over a week and no call back.     Must be nice to be able to turn away reservations."}
{"text":"Um... a group of us spent $96 each person. And felt like this was a Oliver Bonacini / or a Moxie (yea it's that bad).   Sorry. Food was so generic, pretty place though.   Probably won't come back unless no other choices around. But you are in Toronto, lots of great choices. Services were good though."}
{"text":"I have been trying to book an event at Cluny for the past 4 days. I have called 5x and emailed twice and each time I am told that the events coordinator will get back to me. I am very disappointed with the service and will have to reconsider ever booking with Cluny again."}
{"text":"A solid, charming spot that is sure to impress. Certainly won't risk leaving anyone in your party feeling downscale, but prices are reasonable for what you get and the place doesn't feel stuffy. Solid 85%. Good choice for a date or family dinner. Service is top notch.  I came here with my parents for dinner on New Year's Eve 2017, followed by a show at the Soulpepper Theatre, which is conveniently across the street. No NYE specials, just their normal menu. Steps away from the Cherry Street Green P parking garage exit. All in all, a solid Distillery experience.  [ decor / ambiance 5/5 ] My perfect balance in a restaurant: elegant and charming (certainly more upscale than a family restaurant). Enough attention to details, without making you feel stuffy and uncomfortable. Could be equally at home here in a blazer or in a nice blouse and jeans. Definitely a good bet for a date.   [ food : 3.5/5] Not particularly memorable, nor particularly French, but certainly fine. Portion sizes look small, but items tend to contain ample butter/cheese so you do end up feeling full.  Mother ordered the lobster bisque in a puff pastry bowl, which the server cracked and poured the bisque into, so that was a fun presentation. Served with a side of beans and asparagus in butter, which were fine.  Father ordered the sea bass, which was solid. Came with a side of root vegetables and hummus.  As a vegetarian I had a beet/cheese starter and the mushroom tartine.  Prices are as expected, without making you feel ripped off.  [ service 5/5] Waitresses were wonderful. My parents had never had oysters before and the waitress took the time to explain the different types and make a recommendation. She explained each dish and made recommendations with great detail and patience. Paid good attention to whether our water glasses were full, whether we had enough bread, etc, and was friendly without being overbearing.  [ overall 4/5 ] A well balanced experience and a perfect way to cap off 2016 with my parents. A dependable choice in the Distillery to deliver an elegant and comfortable experience. Will bookmark for future occasions."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 Atmosphere: 10/10  Service: 8/10 Overall experience: 9/10  After seeing photos of the place, my friends and I had to stop in for brunch. We were celebrating a friend's birthday/engagement and it was definitely the place to do it.   The interior is very classy. High ceilings, great lighting, and very spacious. You definitely get an upper class feel when you walk in - believe they even have a complimentary coat check service.   Since there were three of us, we shared three plates: - the classic croque madam (which is brioche, topped with ham, fried egg and gruyere cheese) - the baked oeuf en cocotte (2 eggs, brioche, spinach and shaved truffle) - pancakes (I couldn't find them on the current menu, but they were topped with a variety of berries and whipped cream)  The pancakes were fantastic. Very fluffy and just sweet enough with the fruit. The croque madam was good, but I've had better at another restaurant (Wish, if you ever want to check it out. Also very cute!). The baked oeuf en cocotte was a bit underwhelming. The spinach got a bit soggy toward the end of the meal and it was hard to share.   Similarly to Colette, one of the main reasons for coming to a place like this is for the atmosphere. In a large room buzzing with people, and beautiful decor around you, you can't help but be in a good mood. The staff were very attentive, and they do little things like bring a large French press to the table if the whole party is having coffee. It's little things like that which made the experience special.    The bottom line: some of the food is really great, some is normal, but worth checking out even if just for the decor."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas party there on Tuesday. 10 of us and the service and food was excellent. At first glance online, I thought the menu was a bit \"out there\", but I enjoyed everything.  Asparagus Frites, Ducca coated chicken with delicious veggies and praline profiteroles.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"First came here at the end of summer, shortly after it opened. Had been really impressed with the decor, ambiance, and great food. Came back last weekend (May 24th 2015) and while the decor and ambiance were still beautiful, the food was pretty poor, and the service wasn't great.   Ordered raw oysters which were downright gross - too large, too meaty, too briny - and the waiter didn't give us the heads-up this was what to expect, but admitted afterwards that we shouldn't have ordered them. They also took 45min to arrive.   For starters we had the cauliflower and hazelnut salad which came out very bland, cold, textureless, and generally lacking flavor. I had the Octopus as my main course and it was very overcooked and tough.   Lastly for dessert, trying to redeem the experience, I ordered the chocolate truffle bar - sounds delicious, right? Came out really thick, dense but not in a good way, and slightly bitter. Really disappointing, I only had two bites, and I ALWAYS finish chocolate deserts.   Sad to say I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"There's just something about the decor and vibe here that makes you immediately fall in love with Cluny.   You can tell they invested heavily on the interior design and I had my fingers crossed that the food wouldn't disappoint. And I was super impressed!   The puff pastry lobster bisque was such a nice surprise to see on the menu, I had to order it. I usually don't see this at restaurants outside of Asia, and it is my FAVORITE!   The veal meatball was also delicious, complementing the gnocchi so well. The portions don't look like much but I was so full, I had to pack the gnocchi to go.  Service was great. Our server checked up on us often but wasn't overbearing. Next time I'm at the Distillery District, I'll be back to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this morning... crazy wind tunnel walking through the Distillery, so it was nice to find a warm refuge inside. We ordered the pastry basket to start while we were waiting for friends to arrive. As always, the bread is good and you know they were baked on site. Once we finally got to ordering, I got the 3 eggs breakfast with the bacon and beans on baguette, with frites.. my wife ordered the bahn mi pork benny. I specifically asked the waitress to cook my eggs over easy because I like the runny yolk but I don't like uncooked egg white on sunny side up eggs.. my dish came and when I got to the eggs, I knew that they were cooked in advance (they were cooked in a circle mold) and just placed in a heated tray (that's why the bottoms of the yolks were completely cooked)... Definitely not the over-easy eggs I asked for.   The rest of the dish was underwhelming... the beans had an ok flavor, you could taste the onion, carrot, garlic, herbs they used but it would have been better served on a side bowl.. it made the baguette really soggy and half the frites absorbed the juices .  My wife liked her dish.. pork was cooked well (good braise on the pork belly) and seasoned okay. Her only complaint was the selection of the bread.. she couldn't cut through it because it was too elastic once it soaked up all the pickle and topping juices. The brioche or even just plain old english muffin would have been better.. but she said her poached eggs were delicious.  Ambiance, as always, is nice.. but I mean $16 for a 3-egg breakfast that's not cooked to order; you might as well DIY or go to your local diner."}
{"text":"Magic. Restaurant is beautiful and food is amazing. Share so you can try it all. Great dinner and brunch place."}
{"text":"A really good French restaurant with some fine food and drink options. Their unique cocktails compliment well with their great appetizers menu. Their burrata dish is a must try if you like fresh ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Walk in to nice decor, atmosphere not too loud and not too dark. Average service like other reviews have listed Higher end price point, I could expect a bit more of attentiveness from the service  I would highly recommend the french onion soup, good amount of flavorful cheese on top.  Salmon could use a bit more salt.  I mean... it is good from a date point of view but did not much justify the value."}
{"text":"A really pretty space, and surprisingly still quiet enough at dinner that you can hold a conversation without having to shout, despite having been surrounded by several large tables of 8 people or more.  The roasted bone marrow appetizer was tasty and well-seasoned, and came topped with escargot. The L.S.D. (Lamb Snails Dandelion) was also really well executed, with a perfect medium cook (though typically served at medium-rare unless otherwise requested).  Server was a little inexperienced and didn't come to check on our table much except when dropping off plates, but understandable considering how busy it was. Prices are on par with what I'd expect in the Distillery District. I'd come back again!"}
{"text":"Brunchers and basic bitches be warned: The mimosas here are $17 for 5oz, and so is the champagne. $17 for 5oz. Is it because it's an import from France or they're pricing highly so the alcohol doesn't look cheap?   My partner and i are both East Asian and wondered why all the hostesses at the front were skinny Asian women with long hair. Did some French manager plan this?!  We also noticed a table in the center of the room piled high with different loaves of bread and French pastries... but only waiters attended to it. The bread baskets were complimentary...but what if we wanted a sweet bread?  Our waiter reminded me of George Constanza and had a routine of rehearsed punchlines which he looked bored giving. He offered a choice between sparkling and tap water. I indulged in the sparkling one. The menu seemed to have the rustic kind of stuff you'd expect from bistros but the coq au vin poutine and smoked trout rillette stood out to me the most. However I was in the mood for actual meat so opted for the omelette du jour, which was a pretty standard French omelette containing extra salty chunks of smoked halibut and some scallion. When I say \"extra salty\" i meant it was anchovy-levels Of salt and i wish there were more egg or potatoes to complement it. The inside was lukewarm, like most toronto brunches I've had. It was not terrible.  My partner had \"the Frenchy\" which he did not expect to arrive in burger form-- it was a double beef patty with Swiss cheese. We both felt the shoestring fries were the winning aspect of the meal. All were crispy and not greasy to the touch. The fries came with a rather tasteless aioli which you could take or leave. We both left extremely full.  A basket of sliced bread samples was brought out after you order. It contained a classic sourdough, apricot bread, baguette and some roast garlic focaccia type bread. I imagine it's the way they try to get patrons to leave with whole loaves.  Overall our experience here was pretty satisfying. I'm just not sold on the mimosas."}
{"text":"Beautiful room in a great part of the city. Food was kind of average, as was the service. I'm a bit whatever on it. Kind of cafeteria-like somehow - didn't think that it stood up to closer scrutiny"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5--mostly because of the decor and the service. The food...meh. If you order the steak frites, don't expect a whole steak (a few slices at best). The daytime menu is depressing if what you're hoping for is bistro fare. And the drinks...inventive but watered down. Maybe I'll come back for the dinner service just to be in the atmosphere is a great space, but my expectations aren't high for the food."}
{"text":"Most creative dishes I've tried in toronto in a very long time.  Frog legs, raging and tuna were to die for.  Would love to go back and try every other dish on the menu."}
{"text":"For consistently good french food I go to cluny where there is literally something for everyone.  Staff is also kind, smiling and attentive,  cluny offers brunch, lunch and dinner options as well as a fresh oyster bar and pretty decent wine list.  Prices; they're priced okay mains for lunch/dinner range from $20-30 or so. The share dishes are smaller but a fun way to try a little bit of everything.    I would find Cluny perfect for a family gathering as the space is large and they are able to accommodate larger groups. Steak Tartare is a must for dinner."}
{"text":"We had dessert first in the little shop next to the restaurant.  The presentation of the desserts is completely adorable in the display cooler.  My BF had the key lime dessert and loved it. I ordered the chocolate dessert (can't remember name).  The problem is it's too cold when they serve it and the lame plastic fork cannot get through the very cold chocolate and wafer.  That's the other odd thing.  This is a completely adorable french dessert bistro with NOT inexpensive espressos from a top of the line espresso machine and you're serving drinks in paper cups - CUPS.  You serve the desserts on beautiful china and have plastic utensils.  There's a serious disconnect here that needs to be fixed.  Get real utensils and proper real ceramic cups for espresso.   We then moved to the bar in the restaurant for drinks.  The marble top and everything about the bar and restaurant is just stunning.  The restrooms are beautiful.  It's as though you've walked into an authentic French restaurant.  The drinks were good (after I made bartender 'rack' his brain to remember the recipe ??).  What's funny is I later saw the bartender take a half full glass of wine a guest had left unfinished and pour it into a separate glass behind the bar.  I hope he enjoyed it later at clean up."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant with good service, I really like the way the space looks -- perfect romantic date spot.   We had the veal meatball tomahawk and the whole grilled octopus. Octopus was large & tender but underseasoned and a bit bland, no one came by to offer salt & pepper. Portion was quite large.   Veal meatball tomahawk had a magnificent presentation and definitely tasted pretty good. Once again a hearty portion size and the creamy gnocchi next to it made it a sizable meal.   The desserts look really nice but we were too full after dinner to grab any; maybe next time minus the octopus."}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance of this restaurant is exquisite and expensive. The place is consumed with the utmost taste and class. Dining here takes me to the streets of France. The cuisine is excellent I loved everything I ate. They even brought out dessert to share for free on my husband's birthday. We were treated with the kindness of royalty, but the meal took a very long time. It is a slow paced operation here, but the food is made with care and if you have the time to spend it is worth it. Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"As with other touristy areas in Toronto, eating in the Distillery can be very hit and miss, as restaurants can thrive on the ignorance of people from of town rather than have to improve themselves in order to survive in the otherwise-cutthroat competitiveness of the Toronto food scene. The chaos of the Distillery is compounded infinitely during the popular annual Christmas Market, and this year was no exception. We made sure to arrive in the area early in order to avoid some of the crowds, but found it difficult to lock down a reservation even as early as 6pm. After our first choice for dinner said they were closed for a private function, we tried booking at Cluny, but were told they were completely booked until at least 9pm, albeit with some space reserved for walk ins. We walked into the restaurant with our fingers crossed that the wait wouldn't be too long. We were greeted by a very pleasant, polite hostess dealing with an extremely rude woman who I guess was tired of waiting for a table and who was asking the hostess to tell other paying customers to leave because they has already been there for an hour... After the hostess was done defusing this childlike nonsense, she told us the wait would be between 30-60 minutes and that we were first on her list. There was only 2 of us, which I'm sure helped immensely, as our wait time was maybe 10-15 min. She guided us to a raised booth in the bar/lounge area, and when my fiancee asked if we could have a table instead to ease her aching feet and back, the hostess was happy to help us by clearing off the table of some patrons whon has just left. Before moving on to the food, I must say the restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous. I was blown away by the bread prep area, the raw bar, and the private function rooms too. They did an outstanding job fixing up the original building.  On to the food: the bread basket our waiter set down was elegantly presented and chock full of various kinds of freshly baked bread. For appetizers we ordered their take on the Caesar salad, as well as the seafood bisque. Both were fantastic. The vinegrette on the salad extremely fresh tasting and definitely some of the best I've ever had on a Caesar before. The biqsue was equally delicious, not too heavy or rich, and the presentation of cracking the puff pastry dome and pouring in the steaming, seafood-laden soup just added to the spectacle of the meal. For entrees my fiancee ordered their take on on pho and I ordered the skirt steak frites. Let me tell you, I'm not usually a fan of lamb and its gaminess, but perhaps it's because the shank was clearly braised gently for hours on end, it was both fall off the bone tender and completely devoid of any gamey taste. Definitely the best lamb I've ever tasted, and the accompanying soup was also excellent.  My steak was perfectly cooked to the medium rare that our waiter recommended, and the frites were perfectly seasoned and accompanied by some delicious lemon garlic aioli. If Soma wasn't so close to our location, we definitely would have tried dessert there as well, but alas...  All in all, one of the best meals we've had in Toronto. The bill was also much less than we were expecting too, especially after having a very disappointing meal at El Catrin a couple months back, after which we were both still hungry and definitely did not feel like we got even remotely close to our money's worth. Our waiter was also extremely polite and professional, answering questions for us about private events (we were so blown away by our experience that my fiancee is considering having her wedding shower there).  By the time we left (about an hour later, so suck it cranky old lady), there was a huge lineup forming, so I'd recommend making a reservation well ahead of time. We will definitely be back, as even though the menu is small, there are still several things we want to try, including dessert as the aromas from the patisserie near the front entrance were borderline orgasmic."}
{"text":"Cluny is a beautiful restaurant with lots of character but are you going to have a mind blowing culinary experience? No.  I was here with a couple of friends, one of which I haven't seen in years. The restaurant was a topic of conversation because of how well it is decorated. From the floor to the ceiling, there's much to look at.  Our brunch however, was below mediocre.  I ordered the Smoked Salmon & Cultured Butter Tartine which was literally 3 pieces of toast with smoked salmon on it. Their \"artisan salad\" was also a lettuce core cut in half with sauce drizzled on it. We get that they were trying to give the impression of the food being fancy, but maybe change up the salad.  Their service however was impeccable, and I would come back not for the food, but for coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"really amazing atmosphere. Food is solid and well presented, well executed service   Cant go wrong with this choice"}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for! We came for dinner on a Sunday night and it was perfect. The food was absolutely delicious and had very unique touches. I had the BBQ pork beignet and I was in heaven. My friend had the seafood bisque and beef tartare and then we shared what was an incredible cheese plate. It inspired us to make our own when we got back home :) The fresh bread was amazing of course. You can't go wrong here! P.S. the tile floors have inspired my next bathroom"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint... until you get the bill.  Love the decor and the feeling that you just stepped into an elegant/romantic bistro somewhere in France. The patio is a quaint little setting but wish it got sun later on in the day (stupid surrounding tall buildings).  The food is great too although I can only speak to the brunch menu.  The brunch dishes are full of flavour, fresh, and never heavy in the belly.  That jam that comes with the complimentary bread is worth buying its so tasty. Those skinny fries and aioli - yum! The cocktails - fabulously lushy for a Sunday afternoon.  But why oh why was the brunch bill $350 for 4 on my first visit and $100 for 2 on my second?!?!?  I probably do indulge in food/drink more than the average person but this is definitely one of my most expensive bills for brunch.  With all the brunch places that Toronto has to offer, one could find another restaurant that is satisfying for both the belly as well as the wallet.  Since I am a sucker for the Distillery District and am interested in trying the dinner menu, I will probably be back... sorry bank account."}
{"text":"A few friends and I dropped in for winterlicious lunch and it was quite nice. Make sure to ask the waiter if you don't know what's in a dish. I ordered something that had \"duck confit\" in the description but the meal was mostly beans. Delicious beans but not what I expected. Really nice ambiance though."}
{"text":"You haven't had real sipping hot chocolate until you've tried Cluny's. With whipped cream on top, this fine melted semi-sweet chocolate gives a warming sense of divine, without overwhelming you with too much sweetness. It is sort of pricey, 5.50 before tax for a cup, but if you visit the Distillery it is a must try. The almond chocolate croissants were also exceptionally delicious. There is a wait time of roughly 5-10 minutes for the hot chocolate post-ordering during busy times in Christmas market (we went on a Saturday night)."}
{"text":"This is another addition to the mundane restaurants that line the distillery district.  The interior is striking to say the least so full marks there. The staff is well trained though is overly keen at times so full marks there as well. So if those two items are high on your criteria by all means visit this place. I have had exposure to both the bakery and the restaurant so will rate them separately. Bakery is kind of neat and the desserts look enticing. I ordered a apricot tart and my friend had the Bostock. The tart has a good shell. The filling was over powered by the almond extract IMO. Bostock was OK again over use of almond extract IMO. The macarons look good so will give them a try though next time but with SOMA right across I think they have stiff competition already.  I dined here for brunch. Had already looked at the menu so knew exactly what to get.  Crab Benedict. Crab meat was forgetful and has that frozen taste to it. The eggs were poached well and the hollandaise was OK. Fries were shoestring and didn't do it for me.  French toast. Didn't try it as was having dessert later from the comments I was told it was way too sweet. Merguez Sausages a surprisingly huge portion, was decent and I would recommend sharing it with a 3-4 people as an add on if you like this sausage.   The cafe latte was forgetful too apparently.  I would say 2.5 stars for food with a half star thrown in for ambiance."}
{"text":"Decor is lovely but the food doesn't rival it, I'm afraid. We ordered small seafood tower (not a tower, but a plate) - mussels were good, but everything else (shrimp, clams, tuna) was mediocre. The Caesar was tasty- nice and light with good composition. Do NOT order the chestnut mushroom soup- it is an absolutely atrocity; never have a tasted a soup so gross and the color makes it look like a bowl of mud. Service was great, however."}
{"text":"Pretty floors, displays don't make up for a hot chocolate that even McDonald's can do better. This review is for their take out bakery section. For $5.50 maybe I'm insane for buying it but I expected it to be good. It was too milky with not enough chocolate and it was warm. It was like Lukewarm milk dusted with coco. Ummm NO! It was definitely not 'hot chocolate'. So not worth $5.50.  I've had hot chocolate from cheap and expensive places (mainly in Europe)and places which use real melted chocolate with nice warm milk.  We purchased 4 hot chocolates and they were all the same--- not good.  While this gave the familiarity of European patisseries, the service and hot chocolate was incredibly underwhelming.   More over a rude cashier with horrible customer service. I was very displeased I was ready to complain but didn't want to create a scene during the holiday season about my experience. I don't care how busy you are the quality of the product must be good if it's pricey."}
{"text":"Every last detail of Cluny is gorgeous.  From the flooring to the wall decor, it's a lovely French bistro.  Head there to grab a drink from the bar or visit for brunch.  Both times I've been for a drink, the bartenders have been absolutely wonderful.  Friendly staff, fabulous drinks."}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing experience! We stopped by here for a few drinks and what a marvellous establishment! We walked in the front doors and everything began as a dream. The high ceilings, paintings, and all the French touches were exquisite. I don't think there was anywhere I would have rather been.  We were greeted and seated immediately and our drinks with a basket of bread came shortly after. We settled on a couple Marie Antoinettes - which is a cotton candy drink. Not only was it as tasty as it sounds but it was also an experience. They made it in front of us while we laughed and enjoyed ourselves. Now, the drink itself was lovely but sometimes the experience is what people enjoy more and I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant where my heart, mind and tastebuds left educated and happy.  I'm not from Toronto, but if you want a good experience in the distillery district and you find yourself wanting a dusk adventure, I'd stumble over here. 100% recommend this lovely and tasteful place!"}
{"text":"I give cluny two stars - 1 for decor and 1 for potential.  We had high expectations for a nice lunch over the holidays but they were woefully disorganized and unprepared for the lunch demand.  It took forever to get a table which we expected but also forever to get lunch that was mediocre at best.   One meal came out half prepared and missing what had been listed on the menu.  Just seems like theres more style than substance here."}
{"text":"A very large and popular spot. We visited here on a regular weekday, the place was beautifully arranged, servers very professional.  We had a very delicious dinner. Our server recognized us from the bakery we own and surprised us with a beautiful dessert, how sweet! Love the ambiance. A \"must visit\" in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation because of the cute atmosphere, which it definitely is. High ceilings and interesting decor, in the very cute neighborhood of Distillery District.   My friend and I walked in on a Saturday morning with no reservation and got seated right away. Most important thing about this restaurant, ALL THE FREE BREAD. It was amazing. A huge table of so much delicious bread that's complimentary. I seriously could have just eaten bread the whole meal. Also some delicious looking pastries but it was $9 for 3 pastries, which is a good deal if you like pastries.  I got a watermelon mimosa to drink that was good, but $16 is honestly too expensive.  For brunch, my friend and I split the salt cod Benedict and the omelette of the day, which has caramelized onions, sharp cheddar and an apple sauce (we got it on the side). Honestly the food was meh. The Benedict was super salty because of the salt cod. The omelette was fine but nothing special and needed vegetables.   Overall: I would come back for the free bread and I also want to try the french onion soup, but nothing exciting for the eggs."}
{"text":"Went to Cluny for our anniversary dinner and was really excited; however, we were disappointed. Our waiter hardly spoke to us- did not introduce self or check how we were doing. The good was mediocre. The best part of dinner was the escargot apps and the side fries. Such expensive fries..."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends for a birthday and expected a lot since this is considered Toronto's #1 French restaurant according to blog.to.  Wow were we in for a disappointment.   Ill make this review short and simple.  This is more like the \"Dennys\" of french cuisine if you know what I mean.  Some prime examples were the frogs legs I ordered came battered, fried and served with what seemed to be Frank's Red Hot sauce...if that doesn't blow your mind the sea food platter I had as my main came out deep fried and greasy like I was at the CNE food building getting my carnival fix.  Needless to say this is far from french cusine, but more like what Mr. Greek would be to greek food.  Would I come back here again,  simply put no."}
{"text":"My favourite spot in distillery by far. Great venue and amazing food, for a pretty good price. We went here for summerlicious and a lovely experience. It did not feel diluted, and it felt like the restauramt gave you the full experience for the discounted price.   I ordered the clam chowder to start, got the arctic char as the entree and macron for dessert. Highly reccomend the clam chowder; very flavourful topped with a seafood medley. A true showcase of what cluny has to offer. The arctic char was very good; nice and flaky fish with a peach type sauce that complimented it nicely. I would reccomend getting the steak frites, which was one of the best seasonings ive ever had on a steak. The macron was very unique, and was not too sweet, typical of macrons. It was sided with a nice sorbet.   Prices at clunys are roughly 20-30 for a dish, and the summerlicious lunch price was $23. In my opinion, it is totally worth it for the service, venue and unique taste. Worth the trip to distillery!"}
{"text":"I thought the atmosphere was lovely. And I enjoyed the wine selection. However, the food was well below what the website and atmosphere and price would have suggested. My appetizer (The spicy salmon tartar) was alright but bland, not the \"spicy\" taste as advertised. My guest got the escargot which was good.  The mains were disappointing. Mine, the fish stew, was more like slightly flavored water. The flavors had not been developed at all and the seasoning was non-existent. My guest got the meal ball, the meat itself seemed fine but the sauce was like something out of a can. Lots of dry spices and I believe garlic powder. For the cost $125 after tip, I was very disappointed. I don't write reviews, but I had to in this case."}
{"text":"If you dare call yourself a french bistro, you better have am awesome steak frites.  This was a fail. The frites were fine but the steak was incredibly dry and salty. They somehow managed to strip it of all jus. I found myself considering a request for HP sauce, but decided it wasn't necessary to lower myself to that level. My dining companion had an alleged tuna steak that was also overcooked and dry. We ventured no further into the menu.   Cluny's has a charming interior but I knew we were in trouble when I saw it was the size of an Olive Garden. You can't deliver careful cuisine in bulk. It seems to be catering to tourist clientele and if tourist joints are your reference point, then it earns its 3 stars. Service was efficient and pleasant - not outstanding in either direction.  I'm not keen to return."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, love the decor and the atmosphere.  The food on the other hand was very disappointing, The ROASTED LAMB SHOULDER NAVARIN was tasteless and didn't look fresh. The GRILLED ORGANIC CHICKEN LEGS was too plain."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant in the distillery district. Tried several dishes including the asparagus, lobster, frog legs, and escargot. Food was 4 stars all around. I like the vibe of the restaurant. Decor is great and the music perfect.  Service was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. All in all great dining experience. Do indulge!"}
{"text":"Went there a few nights back. Because of festivities, there was a three hour wait. We had a bite or two in between the wait and when we arrived, when no one else would because who would come at 10 p.m. for dinner?, we got the worst waitress of the night. She was rude, made some inappropriate comments, \"little Chinese waiter\", meanwhile, one of us was Asian. She commented on our orders, \"Oh, we're eating light I see boys?\" with a disdainful look. The whole night, she barely checked in on us, the food was definitely not worth the price nor wait, and we were all disappointed, some actually sick to their stomachs, from the experience. Never again. What a joke. By the way, the \"little Chinese waiter\" was better than our primary waitress. She was abysmal."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the staff are super! Food was good, but I felt it didn't quite measure up to the gourmet vibe set by the great interior/staff. Was there for lunch; Caesar salad was not great. Poutine and French onion soup were delightful. Would go back - mostly for the atmosphere"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a reasonably priced meal in a chic environment, Cluny is a great option.   If you are looking for an impeccable dining experience with tantalizing flavour combinations and never-before-seen dishes, I suggest you look elsewhere.   The service at Cluny was excellent, as was the freshly baked bread. The restaurant is a large open space with plenty of room between tables, and I loved the detail on the ceiling. However, the actual food was a solid 3.   We had:  Fois gras - 4/5 delicious but the piece of fois gras was teeny tiny.   French Onion soup - 3/5 tasty but extremely heavy and oily. More so than french onion soup at other places.   Some type of salad with parsley and cauliflower and pomegranate. 3/5 the flavour was excellent but the presentation was a bit dismal.   Our mains were: Lamb - 3/5 on the menu it said it was lamb shoulder, however the server described it as \"lamb 2 ways\", and it was. The braised part was the better of the two, but it really was nothing special.   Grilled trout - 3/5 the fish was very nice. Well-cooked and I loved the almond bits, however the sides were confusing. The fish was served atop beans, but then there was a small bowl of baked white beans that just didn't go with anything.   In both dishes I felt the sides were more there for filler than flavour.   The desert was an underwhelming slab of chocolate  which I think they call a chocolate bar. however the fresh baked macaroons were very tasty (if you like macaroons)."}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer at Cluny, a true gem in Toronto's distillery district. The décor is beautiful and the atmosphere feels very rich and sophisticated, I always feel as if I should wear a suit when I enter, I never do. The wait staff extends the refinement of the restaurant, with excellent suggestions and attentiveness. With such an elegant restaurant, I am amazed the prices are not outrageous, two can dine comfortably for under $85.  There is also a lovely dessert shop attached to the restaurant with the kindest staff, they kept the patio opened pass closing time so my date and I could finish a delicious lime tart!"}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful area in the distillery. Really beautiful establishment, indoor and outdoor seating available great for large groups.   Breads were not warm but fresh and delicious. Sat awhile before server came around but once serviced everything went by fast and very courteous.  Food was delicious, great portions for quality of food and ingredients. Had yellow tomato gazpacho and was delicious along with chicken paillard sandwich. Wine and beer selection really great and also delicious."}
{"text":"Alright so I feel like I should start by qualifying my stars.  The restaurant, in my humble opinion gets 3.5 stars while the bakery attached blows the restaurant out of the water with 4.5, hence my overall stars of 4.    The restaurant is good enough with tasty food and a nice atmosphere but prices are pretty high and the wine is just outright expensive!  Plus, it's a huge space and I'm always freezing my booty off in there.  The servers ARE pretty great though and I'm a sucker for good service so I'll go back and give it another go.....and I'll definitely order those incredible frites.   But the bakery, oh where to begin with the bakery??  It is DEE-liscious!  While it is a tad pricey, it is totally worth it.  The worst thing (for me anyway) is when you concede to take on a billion extra calories to enjoy the splendour that is a chocolate croissant and it ends up being hard or has that gross glaze all over the outside.  At Cluny's you are NEVER in danger of any of their sweet treats being anything less than perfect.  So go on and make room for the chocolate!  While your diet will revolt at the sight of this bakery, your taste buds will put on funny little tasselled shoes and a kilt so that they can do a jig for joy."}
{"text":"Went for their Winterlicious dinner tonight and enjoyed it. I recommend the Chicken Terrine to start, the braised beef cheeks or BBQ salmon for the entree, and anything from their dessert menu. The desserts are marvelous!! Try the profiteroles if you are a dark chocolate fan or prefer a rich, decadent end to the night. The lavendar macarons are also a good bet. It is as beautiful on the palate as it is plated.  Avoid the Alsatian Choucroute. The dinner menu tonight was slightly different from what is advertised on their online menu (it is neither a sandwich, nor does it come with fries) the pork belly was dry, and the shank and sausage wasn't anything to rave about.   For more pictures and a full review, visit my blog at https://nommynoms.wordpress.com/2015/02/06/winterlicious-2015-cluny-bistro-review/   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the great reviews about Cluny, I had a look at the menu and was impressed. They featured lots of French favourites such as Frog's Legs and Sweetbreads as well as the option to add truffles and/or Foie Gras to anything. This place, I thought, is right up my alley!  Turns out, it's up an alley in the Distillery, and every bit as wonderful as the previous reviews-- and possibly better!  I made a reservation for 6:45, which we would have been on time for if it had not been for the parking situation in the Distillery, which is nothing short of a nightmare. We arrived at almost 7:10 to find that our table had been given away. The hostess suggested that we eat in the lounge, which was fine with us as the menu is the same.  Our server, Alexandre, was awesome and helped us to choose some fabulous favourites off the menu. We had:  Frog's Legs: These were lightly fried and so delicious that the meat almost fell off the bone. The drizzle atop them was spicy and slightly sweet with a side of Celery kimchee.    Salt Cod Fritters: These are like little clouds of light fluffy fish and potato with a crispy coating. They are surprisingly light and airy with almost no grease despite looking like very dense hush puppies. The smoked potato dip seemed like a bit of doubling up on the potato in the fritters, but was still delicious.  Alexandre recommended  the Salmon Tartare and it was wonderfully flavourful and fresh with waffle cut chips and some fiery house-made hot sauce that really packed a punch without sacrificing flavour.  The server who dropped it off was just as professional and hospitable as Alexandre and you could tell that the staff were all well versed in their knowledge of the food. For a place that has only just opened, this is very impressive. They all seemed excited about the menu and everything on it.  Poutine was not out of the ballpark but we still enjoyed it. My boyfriend thought the fries were too thick, but I liked the steamy potato on the inside. The fried egg was done in a ring mold and formed an absolute perfect circle on top of the mountain of potato duck and cheese. Speaking of the duck, it was rich and smoky. The dish could have done with a little more cheese, but overall it was very good.  The little seafood bar at the back looks amazing and I need to remind myself to go back and eat some oysters there. They also have a very reasonable list of wines by the glass. It's not a big list, but they also offer a glass of Champagne (from Champagne in France) for $15.  The decor was elegant but welcoming with soft cushions and pillows on the banquettes. The room is adorned with Parisian antiquestuffs like mirrors and bottles and the colour scheme is a dark navy with white lacquered wood.   Everything here, including the service and the food, was beautiful. This place is a total win for a date night and is such a refreshing change from some of the other places in the Distillery"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice -so I will do a summary review of the lunch and dinner experiences.  Here's a couple things you need to know about Cluny: -it is a bit pricey, but the full experience is worth it for a special occasion -ambiance/decor are beautiful with attentive service to match -you can dress up without feeling out of place, but easily can get away with jeans  On the food front: -fresh assorted bread basket for the table (don't fill up before your food comes out) -try their hot sauce, you might want to drink it straight -if they have Belon oysters available, get them. They are meaty and flavourful an very creamy -salted cod donuts, great to share, and not super fishy -steak frites were very well seasoned, and the shoe string fries go well with their hot sauce -meatball and gnocchi dish were plentiful, though I enjoyed the protein far more than the gnocchi (a bit over cooked)   If you haven't been, and have a birthday, anniversary, girls night, etc, coming up - definitely check it out. It is one of the few places in the Distillery were you can get a great meal for the premium price you're paying."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in Toronto so far. As someone who lived in Sydney, Australia for 4 years I became accustomed to eating like a queen. I've heard Toronto has great restaurants but so far they've come up short compared to our friends down under. Fortunately Cluny was the full package. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and anticipated our needs. The fresh complimentary bread was delicious and the salt cod benny that I had was all the flavours I could have ever wanted - Creamy, salty with a nice soft texture. There are a number of mimosa options ($16) and the raspberry pomegranate was great. They accommodate kids with high chairs and a kids menu.   The French decor is charming and the high ceilings and unique lamps make you feel like you've been transported elsewhere.  Dating? Take your date here? Anniversary? It's a pretty great venue. Boozy brunch with the girls? Come here!  Definitely worth the price but don't come here if you are on a budget!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for brunch.  The decor is very nice.  It is a large restaurant and feels like you are in Amurrica.  Both times the food has been less than stellar.  One particularly complaint is with the fries (frites).  They were hard and stale.  They tasted as if they had been cooked the previous night and reheated in a microwave.  It was bitterly disappointing to eat them in a French Bistro.  C'mon!   I also had the eggs and steak and the eggs were cold (as were the poached eggs of my dining companion). On my first visit, I had the beef bourguignon poutine.  You can't be faulted for wanting to eat something that sounds so delicious but alas.. FAIL.  It was bland!    I won't be back."}
{"text":"I would love to give Cluny a better rating, but the food was not exceptional. What was superb was the service and ambiance. 5 stars to our waiter, Tom - excellent service, attention and knowledge! This restaurant settled right in the heart of the Distillery District is grand and beautiful with a superb wine list.  We came on the last night of Summerlicous, but ordered off the regular menu as well. We started with a small cheese board and Kingfish Ceviche. Cheese Board was good, but the Brie did not go well with the Ceviche. The Ceviche was well prepared, but just OK.  For the Summerlicous, I had the Seafood Chowder, Sirloin and Honey Cake. Hubby had the Tomahawk meatball. All the food was presented beautifully, and it all tasted good, but nothing mind blowing. We were hoping for more since we were impressed with the aesthetics and service.  You should definitely go to Cluny, it is a wonderful restaurant and we enjoyed our time there!"}
{"text":"This maybe my new favourite restaurant in the city....my boyfriend and I just loved it.  The decor is beautiful and I found the staff very helpful and kind.   Since there were so many items on the small plate selection that I wanted to try, we asked our server, Karly if it would be alright to maybe do tapa styles and she strongly encouraged us to do so.  We ordered the ceasar salad, frogs legs, cod donuts, duck poutine and beef tartar.   They brought out our plates a few out at a time so we wouldnt be over whelmed.   The cod donuts and poutine were AMAZING! A must try....you could taste the fresh ingredients.    I look forward to trying out their brunch menu."}
{"text":"So happy there's a new spot in the distillery district! Great decor,  fantastic service and good food. Highly recommend the asparagus starter and the salt cod doughnuts.  They are also keenly aware of the whole\"pre show rush\" thing and did a great job of staying on top of our needs so it didn't feel like we were hurrying.  We will definitely be back: because of Soulpepper we're in the neighborhood regularly.  This is the first place that really makes us excited about our pre - show dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent decor inside the restaurant. When you come into this French restaurant, be sure to check out the ceiling paintings which are gorgeous. The artifacts are also from the 1700s (whether they are real or not is questionable)  Anyway, we sat at the bar to see the chef cracking up oysters. However, we weren't necessarily eating oysters. I ordered a dish of ceviche and tartare for appetizer. The food surprisingly came very fast. So speed is definitely a plus in this restaurant.   For main,I ordered lamb. The lamb was overcooked but thankfully the server was willing to change the food. That is another plus.  All in all, the place is good. No need to wait for too long, food is fast. Only problem is price  if you don't mind paying the price, definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Horrific steak. Ordered the $36 filet mignon medium rare. It came out well done and poorly seared. It was a dry, grey hunk of meat. It was drier than my dead grandma. Ridiculously overpriced for such poorly prepared and inconsistent food. Steak is not hard if you keep track of the temperature, and I assumed from the decor and price point, that the kitchen staff could do just that. I wasn't even able to send it back because the kitchen was closed. Worst steak experience of my life. I've had better at Applebee's. At least they can keep it pink in the middle."}
{"text":"enjoyed a lovely lunch - the starter \"warm squash salad\" is delicious, needs a more evocative name!  Very attractive in its presentation as well.  The lovely staff treated me to a free dessert with candle & decoration in honour of my birthday -- that was SO NICE!  Decor is interesting, lots to look at, not overdone.  and at lunch, the acoustics were GREAT ... had a good conversation.  My one mistake - I didn't try the frites, which looked delicious at other people's tables.  Gotta go back!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a cold, grey Sunday - the place was busy, but no lineups, and it thinned out as the afternoon went on. The overall look is lovely, with lots of attention to detail everywhere inside - the decor really is a feast for the eyes. A thoughtful placement of the seating means that you can hear others at your table without overhearing guests at the next one. There's a bread bar in the centre of the restaurant that was artfully arranged with the various options, and an oyster bar that was equally attractive. The washrooms were attractive too, and immaculately clean. The server was a pro - welcoming, knowledgeable, attentive, and she handled special requests graciously. They are definitely not trying to rush you out of there once you've arrived, which was appreciated. The bread that day was delicious, and fresh. Everyone agreed the coffee was excellent. As for our food that day, it was ... fine. Cluny's take on the bacon and eggs breakfast was a heaping plate of food, with perfectly cooked eggs and bacon, a pile of fries, and stewed cannelloni beans.That cost $16.95. An omelet with a side salad or fries came in at the same price. There were other options, like a mushroom benedict, that got a favorable review.The desserts that day included a very tasty lemon tart with a few blueberries and a little oatmeal crumble on top for $6. The food for our table all arrived at the same time, and the plates were cleared promptly. The bottom line is that while the food was certainly well-prepared, the price of the dishes really reflects the entire experience at Cluny. There are several good parking options nearby. It's in the middle of the scenic Distillery district, it's very pretty inside, there's plenty of staff and we had no sense we were being rushed out to turn over the table. It's not a foodie find, but definitely a destination for a social day with family and friends."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous!! Madison was perfect server. We trusted all her recommendations and we loved all three! She was super friendly, outgoing and adorable!"}
{"text":"It was the perfect last-minute plan: Post-theatre cocktails at Cluny.   I was immediately mesmerized by the decor--modern brick walls with Louis XIV-esque mirrors and couches, juxtapozed with the beautifully decorated floor tiles that reminded me of the most ornate Azulejos one would only find in Portugal. I was indeed transported to France, to the Marais, and for a brief moment--I was in heaven.  From an aesthetic point of view, Cluny takes the cake.   We decided to sit at the bar and order a round of cocktails. I went ahead with the Guillotine ($14) and subsequently discovered that bourbon with an egg-white foam is not my thing. Too bad. The Moulin Vert, however, was great. How can you go wrong with Citadelle Gin, Curacao d'Orange, St. Germain, Muddled Kiwi, and citrus? You can't.   We also had three small plates: The ginger-chili fried frog's legs ($15), Crisp Frites ($8), and Table Side Wellington County Beef Tartar ($13). It was then that I realized that Cluny is just La Societe but in the distillery district: over-priced French fare with just a little bit better than average food. Good frites though.   Update: I have been here another  two times since my initial visit for cocktails and some bar snacks, and I found that with the bartenders also playing the role of waiters in the bar area, this just doesn't work; it creates confusion and made for some very bad service at times. Frites are still winning though."}
{"text":"Stylish decor, relish raw bar with wide selection of Oysters! Amazing place for date night"}
{"text":"I went here with a few of my girls for winterlicious and generally speaking I had a good time. First off the atmosphere was gorgeous. I was really impressed when I walked in and the Ceiling definitely caught my eye. We tried all three appetizers on the menu. I got the mushroom soup which was okay. My friends got the butter nut salad and they weren't too impressed, I had a bite and we all were in agreement that it was way too salty. The cod appetizer was pretty decent.   I got the trout for the main dish and it was absolutely delicious (I can still taste it on my mouth). Very flavoured and done to perfection.  My friend who cut the chicken crepe enjoyed her meal too. The dessert were pretty well done too. The pear ice-cream was very refreshing and definitely my favourite. Overall I enjoyed this place. I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the appetizers and the waitress wasn't the most friendly.  Also we unfortunately had to wait a while before being asked for drinks and what to order and another while to pay.   I will defiantly be back at this place. It seems like the perfect spot to go to for a Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant in a beautiful place.  We ordered seafood stew and steak that day, steak was very impressive, cooked perfectly.  Seafood stew was ok, a bit salty to me.  Servers are welcoming and helpful."}
{"text":"Came in here as a walking break from the Christmas market; it wasn't too packed because we went at an off time for brunch at around 3 pm.  As others have noted, the ambiance was very pretty and picturesque. I loved the marine-inpired starter plates - different from the typical standard white plates. Very cute. The service was great from beginning to end.   I ordered the pulled pork eggs benedict. Personally, I thought that the English muffin was too hard and made it a bit difficult to cut into smaller pieces. I personally enjoy a softer English muffin for my benedicts to make it comforting enough for brunch. Eggs were poached fine and the hollandaise was good too. I thought the fries were delicious! It was crispy and I couldn't get enough.  For dessert, I ordered the bittersweet chocolate truffle bar, which came with cotton candy and marshmallows. It came with the grape(?) cotton candy covering the entire plate and was quite a sight at first that I thought I ordered the wrong dish! It was very memorable as I have never had something presented that way.  Overall, the food wasn't bad but it also didn't blow my mind. I think it is a decent place to grab a bite if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Came with another friend and their child for lunch.  Food is not good here and extremely expensive.  We ordered the union burger which came with pig skin, and it looked fabulous!  But the taste was average and the pig skin did nothing for the burger, other than being an attraction on the menu.  I had the kale and cold chicken salad, and for $18 it was an appetizer size plus the dressing was some of the worst I've had.  Chicken was juicy and flavorful, but the kale tasted like dandelion leaves they picked from the parking lot...."}
{"text":"Came to this place for my wedding anniversary with my husband and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Love the French atmosphere and they even gave us a nice complimentary dessert spread on the house for our anniversary. One star off in the fact for the service in that it was a bit slow and the server didn't always refill our waters."}
{"text":"Good decoration, cossy ambiance however foods are mediocre. Ultimately the taste is not worth the price"}
{"text":"What a place this COULD be.   Great room, hit and miss but more hits than misses food - miss and miss service.   This was a highly anticipated Resturant when it opened and for a couple of months they did well - since then the service joined most of the rest of the Resturant at the Distillery District - as in mediocre and frustrating.   We had a couple of drinks and desert at the bar a few nights ago - we had to work HARD to get then attention of the over grown child (about 45 going on 12) at the bar who was doing a bad job at flirting with the two ladies (only clients) in front of him. Shame since the drinks were great and the desert beautiful (candles, dry ice, good taste - someone Is trying here). We would ignore this if it was a one time occurrence but sadly this is regular occurrence at Cluny.  Rik, I appreciate you writing back. We visited after a show at Soulpepper last Friday, September 2nd around 10:30 PM."}
{"text":"Whelp, apparently too good to be true.  Was excited having had a great experience here to share it with friends visiting from NYC.  Just embarrassment after embarrassment.  Incorrect orders, drinks spilled in our laps (obviously can forgive that-honest mistake but didn't help the night) undercooked chicken, lamb AND fish but over cooked steak.  Drink orders screwed up, promises to take unappealing items off the bill with no follow through.  Just a massive disappointment."}
{"text":"A distiller's factory warehouse, very busy during the Sunday brunch hours, we were told a \"30 mint wait\" (as we were expected) however very soon we were called, and seated. Our waitress was very professional and attentive, even though the whole house was totally mad at that moment. Our breads were freshly cut, our orders, Braised beef mushroom poutine were marked small on the menu, it was enough for  more than we could finish it. The Croquet Madame was marked large, and it was large enough indeed!   For Stylish dinnerware, real napkins, sufficient services I give it a 5-star. For foods get my 4-star, because I agreed with the previous reviewers that Braised Beef Mushroom, we could use more the beef in visible."}
{"text":"So there seems to be a few themes in previous reviews for this place.  Mine is fairly consistent with what others are saying but I'm a bit more generous with my star awarding - and for a few good reasons.  First of all - the service.  Basically - terrible.  Our cocktail order took forever to arrive (so much so that we questioned whether she forgot).  At times our server was attentive - at others, gone for good.  Overall, this was a disappointment.  She redeemed herself however by noticing a special occasion card on the table and bringing free dessert to celebrate.  This was something I've never seen done before - noticing the card but not being asked for anything - and I was quite touched by the gesture.  Food wise - very mixed.  Two of us had salads to start - both were OK.  I tried the fancy Caesar which I spent more time cutting up than eating.  The other two had French onion soup which was, to be honest, terrific.  Our mains were two steak frites - delicious.  The other two had the lamb which was so bland it was literally shocking.  I felt bad for the two that ordered it - listening to us rave about the steak while they ate salty, tasteless meat.  Would I go back?  Maybe for soup and steak.  The reviews are very mixed for this place and I believe that's definitely warranted. Seems to be a toss-up whether you'll have good food or service.  Something to be aware of."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for their winterlicious menu and loved the atmosphere of this restaurant right away! The food was amazing, especially their famous french onion soup which is a must-try! Only let down was the melted pear sorbet for dessert, tasted amazing but was just quite melted when the server brought it out. Other than that, would definitely recommend and go back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance and the food.  Their patio is great and the service is wonderful.  I have had fantastic brunch here and the pork belly with eggs is soooo good.  Just wish they had more of the tomato jam.  The croque madam is also excellent and text book good.  We did enjoy their their duck poutine but it just did not feel like it was cohesive enough with the flavours.    Their desserts are top notch amazing and their walkout store serves really fresh items.  So good.  Will come back here again and again."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with no reservation. Luckily, there was space in the lounge area so we were seated immediately.  But if coming here, reservations are probably a good idea because we peeked into the dining area, which was big, and it was PACKED!  It took a little bit of time before they let us order, but after we ordered, the food came SUPER fast.  I got the pulled pork eggs benedict and my friend got the Wagyu Hache.  Both were absolutely delicious!  The thin little fries that came with them were awesome!  I hate home fries at brunch that are always under cooked and gross.  Awesome brunch!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here. Felt like I was whisked away to France. Really enjoyed the fresh bread basket and the creative menu options.  Came here on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy. Luckily there's tons of space here, and I'm told that it's a great spot for a last minute group dinner when you've forgotten to make reservations.   I ordered the tuna croissant which was a bit disappointing. I found the croissant & tuna flavourless. The endive salad was decent. The frites were tasty but they seemed overly dehydrated.  Would come here again to try more menu items, the desserts & the attached boulangerie when I'm in the distillery district again."}
{"text":"Place is amazingly decorated Food is good  We were a big group, yet the service was great"}
{"text":"A new five star on toronto!   Cluny is a beautifully designed new restaurant that has the food to match.   My wife and I are from New York and LA, and as such have a level of expectation when it comes to selecting great restaurants. while toronto has a lot to offer finding the hidden gems that offer great food takes some work. Thankfully cluny can be added to our list of toronto gems. Not only is the food amazing the ambiance is equally perfect and located in the distillery means that you can take visiting guests give them the toronto treatment and an amazing culinary delight.   The bottom line:  The food is spot on & perfect! The decor was done right! The service is spectacular!  Weather you are going on a date, going out with friends, or a business dinner cluny is a top contender.   Read my other reviews you will see I never you wrong!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor! Love the floor tiles and ambiance of this restaurant. Food does not stand out particularly however if you are looking for a good spot to catch up with old friends at a fancy place - here would be a great choice!"}
{"text":"Mediocre overpriced food. Food had too much pepper like big chunks of it. I am however willing to go back to try their regular menu the brunch menu was distasteful and unoriginal. Two stars are for the bread and the beautiful ambiance."}
{"text":"Atmosphere on point and oh so French. Service was friendly and also on point. Food was meh at best."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. I highly recommend the spicy salmon tartar, the seafood platter and the crêpe flambée. The staff is kind and helpful. I'd recommend the tables with a kitchen view - it was interesting watching the chefs."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious lunch and was blown away!  The Good:  1. The venue is drop dead gorgeous, and so is the surrounding area. It was such a treat to dine here and marvel at the decor. Ambiance was great.   2. Service is efficient and friendly.  3. The mushroom soup was divine. The servers poured our soups over bowls of mushrooms and maple fudge, right before our eyes. It was a nice touch. The soup itself was very rich and delicious. The fudge was surprisingly good, and I was sad when I realized I only had one piece, which I had already eaten.  4. The sesame macaron dessert was heavenly. We all ordered it and savoured every bite. The crushed cardamom beneath the ice cream was a pleasant surprise, and added a nice layer of flavour to the dessert.  5. The cost: lunch was $23/person, a steal.  6. The bread was fresh and well seasoned (I think one of them had salt and rosemary on it, which was just lovely).  The Bad:  1. The Chickpea and Sweet Potato Tagine sounded promising, but it was a bit of a flop. It was pretty plain and a tad flavourless. I ate some of it, but ended up eating tons of my friend's fries (which came with the pork sandwich, and which were delicious) instead. Her fries were skinny and came with a side of garlic mayo (which was also delicious).  The Bottom Line: COME HERE if you can get a reservation!! Despite my disappointing main, I thought it was fantastic! I'll definitely be back after Winterlicious is done."}
{"text":"This place! Oh this place! Nothing less than magical. It is an experience!! I want to go back to Toronto just to come back to this establishment. You can tell that every detail of this restaurant was made with meticulous detail and love and they spared no expense doing it. The food is absolutely delicious. They cafe outside of the house has these amazing little pasty that you must have!! The hot chocolate is made with real chocolate and also goes into the cafe mocha if you order one. I had the Marie Antoinette cocktail it was very neat to watch the cotton candy dissolve."}
{"text":"Note: This review is only for the boulangerie.   I came here during the Christmas market and was intrigued by it's patterned foyer. One thing for sure: the people who decorated this place sure knew what they were doing.  To the left, to the left, the bou-lan-ge-rie is in the room to the left.  This is a French pastry shop that is in front of the Bistro. It was a warm tiny shop with a pretty good system in place from the door for crowd-control reasons I suppose - one way in, one way out.  What caught my eye were the croissants and then the tiny French pastries just beside the cashier ($3.5). Of course, I went with the Mocha Éclair because why would I get a croissant? Maybe next time as a way to compare with the croissants at other places and Pillsbury ones.  The pastry was smaller than the palm of my hand. Although it was not big in size, the looks made up for it (I promise I'm not always this shallow).  Overall, my experience was very pleasant as soon as I stepped into the shop and when I left. Since I came during the Christmas season, it may have been busier as opposed to a visit in the summer or after the New Year."}
{"text":"If you are into french food this is a must try.   The decor is beautiful, the food is so nicely prepared and decently sized.  Yes it's pricey but this is normal for the distillery.   I had the burger which was perfect except for the overpowering slice of Gruyere (i think). And the fries I think are cut too thin, leaving them too crispy and underseasoned. The octopus was amazing.   I am definitely coming back for brunch."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  Try the frog legs. They're fantastic! They use chenna/chickpea flour for the batter so it's gluten-free. I also got their filet minion medium rare and they cooked it perfectly. Their wine selection is great too. This is a great place for a fancy dinner.   Only negative was we had made a reservation for a large group and they didn't record it down properly. Thankfully when we came in they had room otherwise we would have had to elsewhere with an 8 person group at peak dinner time."}
{"text":"My coworkers picked this stunning restaurant knowing it would be right up my alley...and it sure was!  Cluny has absolutely beautiful decor with the theme carried throughout the entire restaurant and in every detail.  I started with a refreshing Jardin de Jasmine cocktail and we had a lovely bottle of Sancerre with our dinner.  We had a group of 6, so we were able to try several items on the menu including the salted cod doughnuts, scallops, poutine, pb&j foie gras, and the snap pea, asparagus and green bean salad as our appetizers.  The standout was definitely the poutine...the kind of stuff you dream about!    For my entree, I opted for the steak frites and was not disappointed.  The strawberry rhubard claufoutis rounded out my delicious meal and I was perfectly content leaving Cluny!"}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with this restaurant! My boyfriend and I come here often and it's slowly becoming a staple in our \"great places to eat\" list. Having come back from Paris recently, we thought we'd be sick French cuisine; boy were we wrong!  -The ambiance of the restaurant is breath taking. Its large and spacious. When you're being seated, get the taller person to sit on the cushioned seat as they are a bit too low and makes you look like a kid if you're 5\"2 or shorter.  -order a small selection of oysters! They are delicious! If you are not sure, ask the wait staff the difference between the oyster selections and what they recommend.  -take your time with their menu. Ask yourself if you want seafood or meat. The steam frites are delicious and done to perfection. But if you're a seafood lover like I am... I say go ahead and treat your tastebuds to the Halibut Cheeks! Trust me, you'll thank me later!  Lastly, I would recommend this place for special, romantic nights out. Their price is a bit high, but you have to take in the environment, the ambiance, and the quality of food. Children may not be suitable for this restaurant, but big, more refined kids are!"}
{"text":"In the heart of distillery district, a nice little town-like escape from the busy streets of downtown, Cluny serves up modern french cuisine with a tiny little bakery shop attached. (Great macarons sold there)  I visited during brunch so I tried the 2 poached eggs Benedict with hollandaise, steamed spinach, English muffin and frites. My only complaint is I wish there was different varieties to this Benedict as i would have preferred smoked salmon rather than a mountain of spinach. My fiancé indulged in the bacon cheese burger which was bigger than his already large head lol but no complaints on his end.   My favourite part of brunch was the cocktails!! We both tried the moulin vert which is gin, curaçao d'orange, st.germain and muddled kiwi. Was amazingly refreshing and beyond what I was expecting. Definitely want to visit again during their dinner hours!"}
{"text":"Food wise is really good. I ordered the apricot lamb shoulder. The lamb was so juicy and tasty. I recommend it of you looking for something a bit sweet and moist. The environment is great. Perfect place for a dinner date(good for first date;)  However, I give the service 3 stars. We were a group of 10 and celebrating my friend's birthday. The server we had was a bit aloof and not paying much attention to us. We are a group of well behaved professionals fyi. Lol."}
{"text":"Came back for brunch. Take a look at their menu, and you'll want to eat almost everything.   I really wanted to like the brunch, but maybe what I ordered wasn't their best dishes.  I would say the food was 3 stars, but overall experience still was a solid 4.   I love the ambiance here, high ceilings and fancy decor, yet you feel at home ad classy at the same time. Service is excellent and super friendly. No complaints.   We got the $9 PASTRY EXPERIENCE to share. It was only their Almond Rum Chocolate Pastry (the best one), a scone and a chocolate muffin. All was good, but if you check out the bakery outside, the Almond Pastry is about $2.75. The rest wasn't really that worth it. I would see if you can request it separately.   I had a Pear JUICE, which is fresh but a little pricey at $6 a glass.   Was debating between the Lobster BLT, Eggs Florentine and Crab Cakes Benedict. Opted for the CRAB CAKES BENEDICT, which comes with frites and aioli. I didn't love it. Mostly because the fresh crab cakes had a fishy taste/smell. But it was fried to perfection, with a poached egg and hollandaise on top.   Hubby got the RICOTTA STUFF FRENCH TOAST. Was good, but really dense. Thick 2 layers of toast, with Ricotta cheese in between it was more like a giant sandwhich, than stuffed.   Overall, an OKAY meal, but I really want to give it another chance, and I'd get something different."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Pastries are excellent and entrées are well prepared. Service is always quite good even during a busy weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.  Cod donuts and candy floss desert were standouts. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. Every time I come here, the menu, service, and wines never disappoint. This is definitely a place where you can bring a date or even a group of friends. Absolutely beautiful restaurant - definitely come with enough battery to snap a couple pictures ;)"}
{"text":"Pros: Decent menu selections, expansive drink list, all items ordered were good, but not exactly memorable. The service was great. Our server was honest and made some great suggestions.   Cons: Forgettable dishes..."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to Cluny Bistro. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype.   Ambiance was really nice but the food was not hot at all and the taste was just so-so. Definitely, not worth the price.   Our server never came to check if we needed anything else after our food came. We had to hunt her down to get ketchup for our table as well as to get more water.   I don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious on a busy Sunday afternoon and it was amazing! Food and service was top notch, needless to say the french-esque decor was very well put together. In addition to the regular meal we were served a variety of breads from the massive bread table in the middle of the restaurant. Baked in-house! If you're too full after a meal to try their pastries and sweets, swing by the boulangerie on your way out to take a few home for later. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place was great when they just opened. Food is still ok now but the service really took a downturn there. I been at cluny about 5 times in total and the last 2 I was extremely disappointed with the service. Would not be going back any time soon unless they improve on their service standards"}
{"text":"A gem in the distillery ! The best french bistro in the city !!! Every dish that we ordered did not disappoint and most of all the price is reasonable :) i am loving this place , romantic and relaxed !! Love love love"}
{"text":"The five stars are for their Steak Frites (which the fries are the shoestring type and evenly spiced) and their Baked Lobster Bisque that comes baked with a puff pastry on top. Think chicken pot pie but fluffier even more delicious heavenly pastry. I enjoyed this dish immensely.  The table next to us ordered their ginger chili fried frog's legs... looks interesting but I was too chicken to order.  Restaurant looks new and very classy while still being comfortable. Great location too. You can stroll around the Distillery district before/after dinner, especially when the Christmas market comes alive with beautiful deco and lights.  We had desserts elsewhere after, but they all sounded delicious, so next time we will eat the dessert there.  I will be back soon to try their lobster poutine, as well as check out the bakery attached to the restaurant."}
{"text":"A few bite from our full experience review -  \"The menus were a work of fine art - there were renaissance motifs overlayed with Japanese ink style and British detailed line drawings. A designer's orgasm was reached by the addition of branded plates with patterns.\""}
{"text":"Order the French onion soup... one of the best I've had in toronto.  Food in general, pretty good.   Service was a bit off.   I wasn't able to finish my whole plate so I asked for a box to take home. My server took my plate and packed it up for me. When I got home, I noticed that half of my food was missing, and it had just been tossed into the box. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We often considered Cluny but never officially stopped in until today. I was anticipating classic French refinement in a casual bistro atmosphere. My expectations were not met, unfortunately. The decor is great, the patio is charming, the staff are friendly, but the food missed the mark for me and my partner.  We had the Marrakech chicken salad (the highlight) the shore lunch (nicely battered and perfectly cooked white fish paired with cold, hard shoestring frites), and the beef poutine (just ok and waaaay too much cheese).  For the price and all the hype, I expected Le Select quality. This is not a true French bistro. I don't normally order poutine in a French style, nor would a proper French establishment ever put poutine on the menu, unless they were raising the \"poutine bar\".  I regretted my choice after the first bite. Coming from Quebec, I've had a wide range of styles and flavours, and this was just a big glob of gravy and cheese over shoestring frites. Not worth the money (or the cheat day)."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal as restaurant is to die for atmospherically and in decor. Service was inconsistent and wait times quite long for our meal. No one was impressed by food- except steak sirloin which was delicious. Overpriced and forgettable. Did hear brunch is different and better --- should have tried that"}
{"text":"So. Much. Food. I came here for brunch with girlfriends and this was the only occasion that we didn't opt for the summerlicious menu as there were just too many Amazing baked goods on offer. We opted for the baked good selection AS WELL as each ordering a brunch item.   I have no photos of the baked goods because they disappeared immediately. They were all amazing but the chocolate-almond croissant, and the lemon-cranberry scone were unbelievable and really left an impression. We all went to purchase these items in the bakery after our meal, even though we were completely stuffed.   I ordered a version of eggs benedict with prosciutto that was so amazing, but it was also so much food that I could not finish it all. I want to let everyone know: it seems all brunch options are served with fries - really was not expecting that one!  Our waiter was also wonderful - he chose our baked goods and had all sorts of great advice for our meal. The only thing I wished he'd mentioned was just how much food we had ordered - we were all so full!"}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving this place a lower score but they did have some positives about their restaurant. The positives, their bread selection is great and best of all was they were are very fresh and great tasting. You know how some people decide how great their bakery goods are, you have to listen to the crunch of their crust. If there's a lot of crackling noises in each bite, it makes for a great bread. I kept munching on bread served with butter on the side. Definitely enjoyed their bread selection. Crunchy outside and soft and moist on the inside. Their French bread was legit.   I ordered their Frog legs which were cooked very well. Juicy and lightly battered for some crispiness. I would order that again but the portion was kind of small and for the price, I honestly expected more in quantity. The pickled vegetable they served on the side didn't make sense to me. I ditched it.  Not that I value this much but their interior design and decorations were very well thought out and nicely presented which I very much appreciated.  On to some negatives, my friends ordered their expensive egg benedict and to all of our surprise, the prized item of an egg benedict is their poached egg which is when popped, will ooze out but not the ones here. Two of my friends ordered this dish and both were soft boiled eggs. We were too pressed on time so they didn't bother to ask them to do it again but I was pretty shocked and disappointed as they would even bother to serve those eggs to us. Simply lightly poking at it would seem obvious that the poached eggs were over cooked. Keeping in mind they charge a lot for it and to just have soft boiled egg is unacceptable.   My cousin told our waitress at the time that my sister just got married and we were expecting something from them as a nice gesture for choosing their restaurant to celebrate but we got nothing. I have never seen this before especially for what I would consider a fancy/nice dining establishment. I hope it was just that waitress and they typically would do something as a nice gesture for people.  I also wanted some oysters but our waitress at the time had no idea about their selection in terms of taste wise aside from just reading out the names of each which I could easily do myself. So we just decided to not bother with the oysters as they didn't do anything to make me want to order them.   My rating is pretty generous, I have trouble recommending this place for others to try. Did not leave a great first impression in my books."}
{"text":"I visited Cluny for Winterlicious very recently. My 3* is being a bit generous and can be partially attributed to the fact that I really really want to like Cluny.   Nestled in an old building in the historic Distillery District, Cluny is quite simply a beautiful restaurant. The decor is so cute and unique. I loved little touches like the large bread table in the middle of the restaurant where servers went to cut fresh bread for their tables. The bread was delicious too. Service was great all around with friendly attentive servers and quick, well timed service.   Now if only the food matched. I had a salad for my first course which was large pieces of lettuce with sparse additions. It was also weirdly salty. For my entrée I had a duck confit, sausage, and white bean casoulette which was just... Weird. It just didn't taste good and was an odd combination of items and was thoroughly unsatisfying. I will say that the raspberry profiteroles for dessert were delicious and beautifully presented.   I would come back here to try their regular brunch menu just because I want to like this place so much! But this is one of my not-so-good Winter/Summer-licious experiences..."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our one year anniversary and overall it was a great experience!   1. Ambience is amazing. Looks like you got swept off your feet into an upscale French restaurant but you can wear regular, casual clothing without feeling self conscious. The cute little bakery at the front is so cute! Loved the tiles on the floor and the layout is very intimate but open-concept. I would love to come here again but sit outside next time for a different \"feel\"  2. Service was SLOW. We waited close to an hour for our food. Our waiter was good about bringing extra bread and the other bus boys/ hostesses did a good job of keeping our water filled.  3. I ordered the small seafood platter and my husband ordered the steak. My platter was absolutely amazing! Delicious and perfectly made. Oysters tasted fresh. Tartar was buttery and melted in my mouth. Shrimp was tasty. I loved it! My poor husband's steak was overdone and took forever to come out. He was hesitant about asking for it to be redone but it was just so chewy that he had to. Even then, not only did it come out way after I finished my meal, it was still overdone (but at least it was better than before!). Our waiter handled the whole situation well, although he didn't even give us a discount for the inconvenience or offer any kind of way to make up for it. The frites were tasty though!   4. Added bonus: the hostess remembered it was our anniversary and brought us two freshly baked croissants at the end of our dinner (on the house). Besides the great seafood platter, this is prbly what saved this review from just being a 3/5 rating.   5. Price is very high. Too high for the quality of food that they're sending out. I think I may just stick to desserts and/ or appetizers next time!"}
{"text":"The decor is so, so gorgeous and the entire staff--hosts and server were all sweethearts.   I came here for brunch and ordered the organic beef burger with a gluten-free bun along with fries. The GF bread is really good--tastes like whole wheat which I haven't had since giving up gluten. The fresh orange juice is perfect (not an easy feat).   Despite the mixed review, I want to return and try dinner. Honestly the atmosphere alone is worth the visit and overall Cluny exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"We wandered into this beautiful place for lunch on a Wednesday without expectations beyond soup and salad. I had the chicken salad Marrakech. The chicken was grilled, very flavorful, perfectly cooked and served separately from the salad. The salad was shredded carrots, dates, goat cheese, pomegranate pips and other wonderful tjings i forget in a fantastic citrus vinegrette. My husband had the lamb meruguez(sp) which was very well seasoned sausage with peppers, onions and cornbread. Both dishes were stellar."}
{"text":"I went for Brunch.  Was disappointed.  The food was just way too salty and couldn't make any simple substitutions."}
{"text":"Just the right restaurant with the right ambience to take your wife to (or husband) for your wedding anniversary dinner. We came in early at around 5 and found that the place was not yet busy. We were led to a 2 seater table at the back. I find that annoying. As if only bigger parties deserve a centrally located table.  My wife ordered the salt cod donuts while I ordered the chicken liver tartines. Delicious absolutely. For entree my wife ordered the Double pork chops. She was happy with it and I agreed after a bite that the pork chops were crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  I ordered the pot au pho braised lamb shank. That is when disaster struck. I have had lamb shanks before. Granted they were primarily at Persian restaurants and as stews. But there was something wrong with the way the lamb and the whole thing tasted. Should it be so strong and repulsive to the palate? I did not want to spoil it for my wife by being difficult and arguing with the server. But in hindsight I should have returned it. I can never recommend that dish to anyone.   Overall good experience. Great place with lot of delicious menu options. Terrible lamb shank though."}
{"text":"What a great place with fun ambiance and excellent food to match. We were a party of 14 having dinner. Menu had to be prix fix for 12 or more. Seem like endless amounts of shared appetizers were promptly delivered. We had a choice of main and dessert. See pictures. My main was the steak that was cooked perfectly with shoestring fries. The whole night was excellent. Highly recommend this reataurant. Make reservation since we noticed many people being turned away at the door. Special shout out to Jenny at the Cluny events team who coordinated the night and helped out at our tables."}
{"text":"Reggie, one of the bartenders, is great. Warm, friendly to everyone, a real treat. The french dude? Friendly only to certain people and not so friendly - in fact brazenly rude - to others. Barely looked at me when serving me, didn't thank or acknowledge me when I paid - in fact, was flirting with another patron while he gave me my receipt. For a supposed fine dining restaurant, and for the prices they charge, that is shockingly rude behaviour, and I expect much, much better.  For that, they get a meh. I'll take my local dollars where they're appreciated and I'll tell my friends and visitors to do the same. It only takes one experience like this to sour a local resident's impression of a place. A shame, because their cocktails are so good, and so is the food."}
{"text":"Was here on Sunday for coffee and croissants; we had gone to the Distillery for the market and assumed we'd find a place to have a light breakfast.  Bingo!    It can't be complimented enough--the interior really is nice.  Very unique.  Even the washrooms are upscale.  We only sat in the bar area as we were not having full brunch.  I really enjoyed the coffee, served in a french press unlike any that I've ever used.  The three croissants were all incredible.    I thought service was great.  I would really love to come back here for a proper meal, especially dinner.  Great place--and another reason to come out to the distillery district."}
{"text":"This place is really nice! It was my first time dining here and my first impression was that the ambiance and decor is that of a classy, elegant, and European-French feel to it. There's dim lighting, a bread cutting station in the middle of the restaurant where you can see someone slicing bread for each table, and a semi-open kitchen concept at one side of the restaurant.   Service was mediocre. There was nothing special about the attention or service received from our waitress. I ordered something off the cheese menu and I can't remember the exact name but according to the receipt it's called Smoked Blue -- this includes about three tiny bite-sized pieces of eggplant with a piece of goat cheese on top and shredded cabbage on top (not too sure). The cabbage part was the nastiest thing I've ever tasted. I'm not sure if it was pickled or something but I left all back. Considering the cabbage comprised most of the meal I felt like my waitress should've asked if something was wrong with my meal if she saw I left it all back on my plate. It also would've been nice to know that I was ordering an appetizer when she initially took my order. So I basically had three bits of eggplant for $15.   My boyfriend on the other hand loved his meal -- he got a burger and fries. I couldn't taste the burger as I'm vegetarian but he said it was actually one of the best burgers he's ever had (and he's VERY picky). We both loved the fries and how they were cut thin (kind of like long Hickory Sticks).   I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here to try something else. I mean, I looked around and everyone's food looked good but I guess I just chose the wrong thing."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I came here on a Saturday night, reservations are recommended, this place is busy! I've heard mixed reviews about this restaurant so I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised afterwards.  Seafood Bisque - yummmmmy!! The puffed pastry that came with the bisque was delicious. Escargot - I liked the flavours but it got a little too salty  8 oz Hanger Steak - the steak was nicely seasoned BUT it wasn't hot....it was between cold to warm and a little on the burnt side.  Dessert - The baker's sampling - rip off, the samples was tiny and not that great.  Overall, I thought the food was good but on the pricey side. The restaurant is gorgeous, it really makes you feel like you're in France. Not sure if I would go back, maybe for brunch."}
{"text":"Food was nice, great service, prompt seating.   We had their signature gruyere onion soup, broth was delicious, and the gruyere cheese was lovely. We also had their seafood bisque which comes with a phyllo crust.  Also very nice.  For mains we had their bird cage chicken, arctic char, pork beignet, steak frite, and veggie souffle. Chicken and pork beignet were very good, the rest are average. Pork beignet is a spiced doughnut stuffed with pulled pork, a very unique dish. The chicken comes with a fried crust giving it nice texture. Chicken was cooked nicely, not dry at all.  Arctic char was average, nothing special. Veggie souffle was nicely done.  Will definitely be back for another special occasion. Price is in line with food quality, service, and ambience."}
{"text":"Love Cluny! Great choice for Summer/ Winterlicious. Creative menu; great location (suitable for this restaurant). We find our visits to Cluny very enjoyable. NB: listen to their voicemail. Such a cute song!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for Summerlicious this year, the food was pretty good for summerlicious menu (good portion sizes and pretty tasty). However the service was not on par- our server was rude and did not smile to us nor try to make conversation. For a restaurant that calls themself a french bistro, we expected the service to be top notch too. Train your servers please!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this, but was very disappointed. Cocktails were expensive and very underwhelming. We waited 30 mins for our apps and 40 minutes for our mains and were not offered anything for the wait. My appetizer consisted of grainy tomatoes and my main, which sounded like it was going to be great, was a big let down. I ordered the Crepe Cordon Bleu, and it was essentially a chicken finger, wrapped in ham from the grocery store deli, in a cold crepe. My husbands steak frites (which was $40 btw) came out well done (no pink at all) and cold.  Desserts were awful as well.   Pros: the decor is lovely and our waiter was nice, fries were good   Disclaimer: it was summerlicious and a busy Saturday night - but our resos were at 9, so certainly not eating at the peak"}
{"text":"This review is for Cluny's boulangerie, which I've frequented several times in the last few years. They make delicious croissants, cakes and pastries, as well as others savoury items. I particularly enjoy their almond croissants. I recall one visit where I had to buy a second almond croissant because my sister devoured the first one I purchased!   It occurred to me during this last visit just how costly their food is. Hubby wanted juice but was told that a tiny juice box of Kiju orange juice cost $3. A regular latte and a cold pressed juice came out to close to $15!   I don't normally complain about cost in my reviews  but I was particularly taken aback by the cost of 2 beverages. Will certainly think twice about buying from here next time, or at least would likely not buy cold pressed juices!"}
{"text":"Take some space in the Distillery and throw some euros at it and bingo you have a wonderful french bistro  Its a wonderful spot to go to for drinks and eats even if you are not planning to spend some time knocking around the distillery.  This place is really about the ambiance and decor and if you close your eyes you will feel that you are in paris until the server speaks to you in english. Service is very good with no complaints even when attending with 8 guests.  Food is good and probably the emphasis is usually on the pastries anyways ( i dont recall rabbit on the menu) so they go extra mile on presentation.  Nice thing is that if you go as a group the menu will appeal to all and even the die hards will enjoy the french onion soup starter (it really is that good), mains and then melt with joy over the various baked items.  after a few visits I finally caught on they have a take out bakery (left side of entrance) and gelato......hmmmmm you could almost park without paying, run in, grab stuff and be on your way before the parking patrol slaps ya a ticket. The $4/hr fee will pay for some croissants....."}
{"text":"Was less than stellar tonight.  Sat in the bar area because the dining room was at 70% capacity, with reservations coming in.  Was the same when we left an hour and a half later.   Server was not well spoken, and uninterested in the menu.  We asked about a cheese dish, and the answer was: 'uh, it's won awards?'   Not exactly a confident recommendation.  Food arrived before drinks - that's an indicator right there.  Back to the menus for a sec - had to get our own menus from the hostess stand - hostesses which were too busy socializing amongst each other.  2 stars because the poutine was good.  Nothing more as our salmon tartine, packed to-go, was basically thrown (dumped) in to the to-go package.  It was an untouched dish so it could have easily been preserved as served - like take out! Really disappointing tonight."}
{"text":"Came here with friends. Located in Distillery District, I always seem to pass by this restaurant every time I walk around that area so I able to finally make it here for a meal! We came here for Winterlicious lunch. Loved the décor In the middle there is a bread table full of an assortment of bread. I simply loved the bread!! We kept ordering more and more rounds of bread. I really loved the garlic bread- it was quite good! I really loved their Winterlicious menu which was a 3 course meal for $28 during lunch. They also had a $15 for wine pairings for each of your courses which was a nice addition to the meal. I ordered the French Onion Soup, the Steak Frites and the Mont Blanc. The meal took a bit longer to come but we were just enjoying great conversations at the table. The French Onion Soup was quite nice but it was super hot. The steak was nicely cooked and seasoned. I thoroughly enjoyed the steak. It was nicely plated and came with skinny fries. For the finishing touches to my lunch, we got dessert. I got the Mont Blanc which is nice vanilla cream on a plate. Our server was good. She can kept making sure we were satisfied with our meal and kept giving us copious amounts of bread! The restaurant itself creates a nice vibe with its beautiful décor, a nice display of their wine shelf and the bread table was right in front of our table. Overall, a very enjoyable meal here and will definitely be back. It's just a great hidden gem in the Distillery District to eat at!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor and atmosphere .food is crap never again.we had madam croquet It was bland,salted cod cakes was over fry and test less with dead arugula salad,onion soup was disgusting and over powered stock. Expected better what a shame!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is so European and so romantic. Our waiter was also super tendative. We came here for the summerlicious lunch on a saturday afternoon and it was packed. They have a patio too, which is great for the summer weather. I got the seafood chowder as the starter which consisted alot of seafood and the seafood broth was not fishy so it was really tasty. It was a great complement with the starter bread which was amazing. We got seconds cuz it was so good. My friend got the asparagus fritter which uses qunioa instead of bread crumbs. Initially it was good, but because it was fried she got sick of it pretty quickly just because qunioa is really filling itself. For the main, we got the steak and frites. I wanted mine to be cooked well done which was done perfectly, this was also true for my friend's medium rare. The steak was flavourful for me, but my friend thought it was a little dry. The fries came out warm, but none the less they were addicting. My favourite was the dessert which was the pistachio macaroon. They had a really sour sorbet on the side which complemented the macroon really well. The macaroon was really really really good. Very fresh and very tasty. This place also has a bakery section where you can buy macaroon and different pastries. Over all this place is really pretty and food is pleasant. I would definitely come back to try their tuna burger and their pastries."}
{"text":"Gorgeous decor and flavourful, sophisticated cocktails and food.  My new favorite restaurant in Toronto.  My friend and I shared a grilled endive and artichoke salad and salt cod fritters, the latter which were to die for.  I had the Lamb Navarin which was basically a type of deconstructed cassoulet.  Very, very good with rich, complex flavours."}
{"text":"Wow. Where to begin?  We came here for brunch and fell in love with the food and room.  I would recommend this place based solely on their complimentary chocolate and cherry bread.  Maxing with a red wine. Beautiful room, amazing waitstaff, and high energy."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner as part of Summerlicious.   Most of the dishes were excellent, and were prepared very well in terms of presentation AND taste!  I started off with a gazpacho, which was cooing,  refreshing, but also tasty at the same time.  The burger came with a mountain of fresh shoestring fries, which were delicious; portions were quite large!  The braised beef roast was tender, and the sauce was tasty.  The desserts were a delightful mix of textural and taste contrasts! I wish I got more desserts.  The place itself is huge, and decorated very ornately. Service is professional and efficient."}
{"text":"Service was good and the food was just as good with a group of friends. Totally want to head back when it's warmer."}
{"text":"Went there for Summerlicious and the hostess was pretty rude and unpleasant to deal with, the waiter wasn't that attentive, and the food was ok. The appetizers were atrocious, the main was okay, and the dessert whatever. Seriously overpriced and it was quite warm in the restaurant as well. Would never go back. What a waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning restaurant serving delicate and crafted French cuisine! The decor in this bistro is to die for, seriously its so beautiful! I came here for brunch with some friends and had a wonderful time. The ambiance is light, joyful and conversational. Every table is enjoying themselves and the food that's being offered. I ordered the haddock cake Benedict that's served with sautéed kale. Surprisingly not heavy at all and each bite has a bit of a bounce in your mouth. My friends ordered the mushroom Benedict, omelette and steak & eggs which all looked delicious. The steak and eggs were plated very nice I have to say. We all shared the indulgent, melt in your mouth French toast and I couldn't have been more pleased! I really liked the experience here and would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Went here with a client last night.  I thought it was very good.  We both had the onion soup and steak and frites. Both were very good.  The steak was very tender and the fries were skinny and delicious.  The wine list was adequate.  The service was efficient.  Recommend."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience here on a date last night. We decided to pop in without a reservation, and they happened to have a spot at the bar. We ordered a bottle of wine, which was delicious. Staff was not too intrusive, but attentive. They overheard it was my birthday and when we ordered a dessert to split they added a candle and wrote happy birthday on the plate. We were offered dessert wine (bartender chose and it was delicious), and were not rushed to pay or leave. We were the last ones in the restaurants and were never once asked to leave. I had such a pleasant experience with the quality of food, the staff and the ambience, it's no wonder you need a reservation to eat here!"}
{"text":"October 5, 2017  Returned to Cluny's yesterday for a quick lunch sandwich.  Ordered two ham and Brie on a baguette.  Heated.  The panini press warmed the bread but did nothing to the ham or cheese.  So toasted the baguette.    I requested some mustard which the server got in a small plastic cup.  However, no knife.  Three servers behind the counter serving no one and they don't bring a knife?  Did she think I would dip my finger in the mustard and spread it in the sandwich?    Poor staff training.  Strike two.  No strike three because I'm not coming back.    Better sandwich and service at a Subway.    Previous visit,   Had the Lobster Bisque Soup and Caesar Salad. The Soup needed some seasoning, it was bland for a bisque.  Also, served lukewarm not hot.  The white beans were unnecessary.  I would not recommend it. The salad was tasty but I wish restaurants would cut off the hard ends of the lettuce.  You had to cut the romaine yourself but then everything slid off the plate.  I would recommend this Salad but be careful or your lap might get dirty.  Service was very good.  Atmosphere was very good."}
{"text":"The interior of Cluny is beautiful and the staff and plating presentation of the food is lovely. But the actual food themselves are a big miss. The atmosphere and ambience is what you come here for, it is a shame that the food is not up to par."}
{"text":"I had high expectation when I walked into this restaurants because of the positive reviews I saw on yelp and how nice the decoration was, but in the end, I was not that satisfied walking out.  Decoration was beautiful which I think is one important element in a restaurant, but if you are going to charge a slightly above average price on food, I expect at least slightly above average food tasting and quality and a decent service.  The server we had was okay, there were some minor adjustments could be made to make it better, such as pouring water a little more careful so water is not all over the table and putting down plates softly not almost throwing them on the table.  We had a party of 7 and ordered a few appetizers to share, and each one of us had a main course.  Crisp Sesame Baked Asparagus \"Frites\" - appetizer Roasted Duck Poutine - appetizer Spicy Salmon Tartar - appetizer Tiger Water Marinated Prawns - appetizer 10oz striploin - main course  Food overall were average, but the Duck Poutine was pretty good WHEN you mix the egg with the poutine that comes with it.  The Spicy Salmon Tartar was good too, but not overly impressive, plus more chips would be better considering how big the Spicy Salmon Tartar portion was.  The prawns were good and fresh, but to be fair, if you can make fresh raw prawns bad, that is very depressing.  The Asparagus and steak were very dry and didn't have the flavouring that made you want to eat more and I was surprised the steak was not that juicy.  I didn't have the opportunity to try their desserts because we brought in a cake for my friend's birthday, but I was very unimpressed they charged us $42 open item fee and was never advised by the waitress when she asked us if the cake was for dine in at the beginning.  Very unprofessional for not advising your clients on potential additional charges in advance!!  1 star for the decoration, 1 star for the appetizers, everything else was not worth the price we paid for.  If you are in the distillery district area, you can come to Cluny for appetizers, but if you want to enjoy main courses, I would prefer checking out the Beer Hall or Pure Oyster House next door.  (Heard El Catrin is good too but I have not tried yet)"}
{"text":"Went to Cluny's for the first time while visiting the Christmas Market, and luckily got a seat right away. We shared the poutine, octopus, and salmon tartar. Loved each and every single dish, especially the poutine. The sauce was tasty, and loved how the fries were skinny. I've had more tender octopus before, but still enjoyed it nonetheless. The only downside during our dinner was the service. The server didn't really check up on us, and we had to ask him to refill our water several times. Would've enjoyed our dinner more if he was more attentive."}
{"text":"What a nice ambience! Definitely a good place to celebrate special occasions or to have relaxing brunch on the weekend. My boyfriend and I were here for Winterlicious 2016, so I can't really say much about their regular menu items. Although I enjoyed the 3-course meal that day, I felt like it was overpriced. I guess we paid a good amount for dining in a good ambience.  I plan on going back in the near future to try their brunch menu! I would love their assorted baked items."}
{"text":"Cluny delivered an excellent brunch. Family & I enjoyed the atmosphere, service & food.   My husband is \"gluten feee\", while they will accommodate, the GF bread was dry and without flavour.   We arrived at 10:30 and the Bistro was quite quiet. By 11am, the place was humming and impossible to sit without a reservation.   They serve alcohol  (mimosas etc.) from 11am onwards.   Even though the waiter wasn't well informed about the menu (had to check on details), the service was excellent.   We will return & highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My sister and I really wanted french food and my sister suggested how she wanted to try Cluny's out because she heard really great things. Cluny's is located in the cutest district in Toronto it kind of reminds me of Tribeca in NY. My sister ended up being late for our dinner so I sat at the bar and ordered a french 75. Cluny has a lot of cool and tasty beverages which I really enjoyed although they were a little weaker than I'm use to.   My sister and I decided to order a bunch of small plates to share. We chose escargot, ceviche, pate, and the hanger steak. Before ordering everything we had half a dozen oysters. The oysters I would come back for they were delicious a little expensive though. If there were happy hour for oysters this would be perfect. The ceviche was also very delicious. If you come here and want seafood this is the best option on the menu. The server really recommended it and I'm glad she did! The escargot and pate however was something to pass on. I was picturing escargot as the buttery goodness it is but it was presented so weirdly I ended up not eating it. I thought it was salty and not how I imagined it. The pate was also not how I picture it at all. I'm a huge fan of pate but this just did not excite me. The steak was also your average hanger steak you would get at a restaurant. We ended up finishing everything with dessert. They have many options which I wanted to get but we only ordered the soufflé which was delicious! They have many other options which looked delicious too.  My sister and I thought everything was a little overpriced especially since we didn't love half the things we received. I would probably come here to just order small things like the ceviche, oysters, or dessert but for everything else it just didn't seem worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. The atmosphere is magnificent. I felt like I was on a Parisian sidewalk inside the restaurant. The decorative suspended ceiling is beautiful.   Oysters and tuna tartare were superb. Duck poutine was a little bland but that's my only complaint. We also had the lamb two ways which was heavenly.   The absolute best part of the evening was the service. Our server was Claire, straight from Ireland. To say she was delightful is an understatement. She made our night. Friendly, witty and so attentive. Hope this review finds it's way to her."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is yummy, service is always great, and the restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous... love the bread station in the middle. In terms of the food, the menu changes pretty regularly so I can only speak on what I had the times I was there-  For brunch, definitely order the little pastry basket for the table if you like sweets. I absolutely loved it, and that brioche is to DIE for.  my friend got the Croque Madame and said it was absolutely delicious, very rich, but totally impossible to pick up. He had to eat it with a knife & fork.   Now onto the dinner menu! The sesame crusted asparagus was a miss for me. The asparagus was overcooked so it had that sort of watery-stringy texture that asparagus can get, and the sesame crust was bland.  Salt cod donuts are delish!  It appears they've changed their caesar salad recipe since I've last been there, but when I went it was some whole romaine leaves, crispy chickpeas, and smoked cheese. The components were all really yummy (ESPECIALLY the crispy chickpeas) but not really sure why they served the romaine whole... it just made the salad a bit more difficult to eat.  The bone marrow & escargot dish was great, but I wouldn't call it a 'must try'.  The coq au vin poutine is alright for one bite, but I couldn't possibly have had another. That dish was entirely too rich & heavy, in my opinion.  The fried artichoke tartine is AWESOME. Definitely try it. All the flavours are just spectacular together, and the puff pastry is so deliciously light & fluffy. I'd never had Peruvian peppers before and the flavour is so interesting!  PB&J foie gras is definitely a really cool take on foie gras. I love PB&J, so I enjoyed this dish.. honestly I think that warm, fresh brioche might have been my favourite part. Lol  The octopus dish is really great, the potatoes are so beautifully seasoned, but my turnips were inedibly undercooked. I couldn't cut through the centre of them with my knife, which was disappointing as I love turnips. It was probably a fluke though.  The arctic char almondine is CRAZY good! Every component on that plate just works perfectly together.  A date once ordered the Frenchy burger and said it was VERY good.  The frites are perfect - crisp and seasoned.  Now for dessert, if you have a sweet tooth like me, you HAVE to try the chocolate soufflé. It is so amazingly rich, gooey, chocolate-y... omg. It's perfect. I've gone to Cluny just for this dessert before.  Phew, that was a long one. Overall, the food here is generally really great and the atmosphere makes for a great dining experience. Definitely date-worthy, but also really nice with friends or family. And take the opportunity to explore the lovely Distillery District!"}
{"text":"A second visit pre-theatre to this lovely room. Very expensive oysters were tasty, but some of the great apps had gone from the menu. The veal tomahawk was good, salads fine, breads excellent, but it seemed marginally less good than we recalled. Still, a very good place to dine before Soulpepper."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the French onion soup. I was not a fan of the country pate. The stuffed zucchini had very hard, crunchy undercooked zucchini stuffed with what was described as \"roast chicken, vegetables, faro and goat cheese\", yet all I tasted was chicken and lots of salty green olive. I am not a fan of olives. I would not have ordered it had I known. Therefore, I sent it back. Instead I got the brussel sprout small plate. The flavors where quite good and the texture was wonderfully chewy from the wheat berries, with the exception of the uncooked TOOTHBREAKER ones.  There was a good tablespoon of them in/on it. Perhaps this is what one gets from daring to send something back to the kitchen? Soufflé was good but didn't need to be so large. See"}
{"text":"Overpriced tourist trap. $100 brunch for two people that was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had in ages.   Our server never bothered to ask how our food was but if he did, we would have sent back the Wagu Hache (burnt egg on top of an overcooked hamburger patty). The burger was fine, mainly because I was starving. Won't bother to go back despite the very nice interior."}
{"text":"Spent Boxing Day Brunch at this French bistro at the Distillery District.  The decor is on the spot a nice cozy ambience of Provence and chic. Love the wooden crown moldings!   We ordered a bread basket to share and the almond chocolate croissant was just to die for! I ordered a salt cod eggs bennie but to my dismay, the eggs were overdone!   The pear ginger juice was freshly squeezed and the combination struck a very nice balance! The freshly brewed coffee was a mild roast and very smooth to the taste buds.   The servers were courteous and a perfect place to catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"My fellow live theatre-lover friend Julie invited me to an afternoon show at Toronto's Soulpepper Theatre yesterday afternoon.  We decided to meet for lunch before the show so that we could properly catch-up on each other's lives.  The best choice for a quick pre-show lunch was Cluny Bistro and Boulangerie, which is directly across from the Soulpepper, in Toronto's chic Distillery District.  Now, if you know me, you'd know that I'm slightly obsessed with all things French, and specifically, Parisien, so there was no arguing from me. I mean, who says \"Non, merci,\" when offered croissants, macarons or un Croque-Monsieur? Pas moi!  I would have liked to have eaten in le bistro, but we were a little pressed for time, so we opted for la boulangerie, which is really, the \"take-away\" section of the restaurant. (By the way, what is the real difference between a 'restaurant' and a 'bistro?')  Once you walk in you are transported to Paris...well, at least I pretended I was. The décor is a chic mix of old and new - I'm not sure what the building used to be, but the restaurant's designer did an interesting job of mixing black and white tiling, hard wood, leather stools with those gold button-like things on them (what are they called? J'ai oublié.). You are immediately drawn to the colourful and sweet goodies that are in full view in and on the display case. I think the lovely lady behind the counter tried to get my attention a few times before I snapped out of my baked goods reverie.   I was drawn to what they called a \"Croque-Monsieur Panini\", which of course, wasn't really like the open-faced street crêpes that you can buy in Paris, but rather a very tasty-looking Cluny version of them. I ordered one while Julie ordered an almond croissant and an Americano, while I picked a bottled cane-sugar Shirley Temple, that reminded me of my favourite version of the drink that I used to order at Swiss Chalet when I was a kid.   So maybe my lunch wasn't genuinely Français. But we sat on the patio and did a little people watching while we sipped and munched. Just like the little bistros in Paris. Again, I pretended.  My Croque-Monsieur Panini was delicious. The egg bread they used was divine. And Julie didn't even offer me a taste of her croissant, so I'm going to assume it was good too. I loved the little details Cluny does: a company decal that seals your sandwich in the paper they wrap it in. The same logo can be found on their serviettes, plates and cups. There is faint French music playing in the background. What a delightful find!  It's not a French bistro, but a French-based one. I took a peek at the bistro menu and they serve interesting dishes like ceviche, tartare and Moroccan chickpea soup....not French at all, but the Cluny version of them have a little `French sprinkling` in them, like a side of ratatouille. It`s a French fusion restaurant of sorts, really. That's okay. I am still a fan.  I do intend on going back to experience the actual restaurant - their photo gallery on the website made my mouth water.  I think the first thing I'd order is the Ginger Chili Fried Frog's Legs."}
{"text":"Not only is this restaurant in the coolest new districts in Toronto, the restaurant was exceptional all the way around. I arrived solo to start and of course sat at the bar. Normally I'm glued to my cell phone, but the bartender Reggie would have none of that. He is very engaging with his bar patrons and makes you feel welcomed the moment you sit down.    Then my hubby arrives for our 20th Anniversary dinner and we had the full attention of Jamie, our waiter.  When he saw us trying to pass different apps across the table, he literally ran to the table and did it for us (Twice). LOL.    The French Onion Soup  and the Table Side Beef TarTar were amazing.  Also they had 3 ovens/warmers for their breads and butter on display in the middle of the restaurant.   Super cool.     The atmosphere is very Chic as every good  French restaurant should be.     I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a superb experience and dining!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Cluny is probably among one of the popular French restaurants in the city.  Note to self, making reservations is highly recommended. Beautifully decorated, you truly feel like your in an upscale French restaurants, beautiful bar, wall of vintage wines, open kitchen, floor to ceiling French architecture is appealing to anyone who comes here. Though wait times can be long, their service is exceptional along with their menu knowledge.  In terms of food here's the break down:  **8oz. Hanger steak and frites 5/5; portions were sufficient, cooked perfectly as asked, medium rare, and the FRIES! were so delicious. **Sesame seed asparagus: 4/5 beautifully presented, nice balance of crunch from the sesame seeds and soft flavor of the asparagus. **Cheese board: 3/5 not a big fan of this, however nothing special. **Lobster bisque:5/5 served in a cast-iron bowl, rich, thick and packed with flavor.  Overall a great place to indulge and experience French cuisine in a lovely environment."}
{"text":"I was in awe when I walked in - the ambiance and decor is classy and elegant with a bar made of marble and fancy mirrors all over the walls. We didn't make reservations for dinner on a weekend, and the place was packed, but we were able to take the last table in the bar!  We ordered the meatballs, french onion soup, and poutine - all were really good. For it being so busy, the service we got was great as well.  I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went to their summerlicious. It was my first time going there and I heard nice reviews at that place, so I had a high expectation..   The service was nice, the people were really friendly there. And what I liked the most was the deco of this restaurant.. However, the food was not as good as I expected..  I ordered the seafood chowder for appetizer.. The plating was really pretty, with all different kind of seafood in the plate and the soup was poured in by the server. It was really fancy. However, the soup was really fishy.. my friend could even smell it from her side.  For entree, I ordered the steak.. The server explained that the steak was done in \"French-style\".. but it was really chewy.. I had to spent most of the time cutting and chewing.. It wasn't pretty.  The only dish I think was good, was the dessert. My friend and I both order the honey cake.. It was really good. Especially, with all those different citrus  dressing around the cake, and the sorbet on top of the cake, it was really refreshing.  So, overall, I would give this summerlicious experience a 3/5.. I would recommend people to go try their regular menu probably, instead of their summerlicious menu."}
{"text":"Top notch food and ambiance. Buffalo \"sweetbread\", asparagus frites and kale salad for apps - heavenly. Great mains as well. I will try their bakery next time too."}
{"text":"After roaming around during our visit to the Toronto Christmas Market we decided to go  eat at Cluny.  This is our second time to come to this place and honestly I like the food better the first time we were here.  We noticed they have also changed  the menu and increased the price but the quality of the food is now lacking.  They still offer you the freshly baked bread with butter but that's the only thing I enjoyed. We also ordered Cocktails - Bulldog Francais & Mojitos but there's nothing spectacular about it.  For food, we ordered a small Cheeseboard, Cluny Caesar salad and Coq Au Vin Poutine - all mediocre!  The Coq Au Vin has more fries than braised chicken and for $18.95 this is pricey.  I have recommended this restaurant to families and friends before but after dining tonight I don't think i will be doing the same thing."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for my birthday, and generally loved the experience. Service was wonderful, food was divine except for the lobster poutine. (Cheese kind of clumped together and fries were soggy) Other than that though, everything about my Cluny experience was lovely. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cluny several times, twice for brunch and once for dinner. It's in a lovely location, set in the beautiful distillery district. The decor is nice and welcoming, I especially like the faux ceiling they have. I'm pulled between rating Cluny as a 3 star or a 4 star. The 4 star is really for the pastries and the poutine they serve. I'm from Montreal, so I have a certain expectation when it comes to croissants and poutines, but both of those were amazing and delicious. The juices for brunch are also good. But the rest of the menu has been a bit of a miss. Not that it's not delicious, but it's almost like they're trying too hard and missing the spot in the end. The croque Madame for brunch was yummy, but it was insanely heavy. I could barely finish half of it. My boyfriend had the portobello Benedict (I think it's portobello... It was a large mushroom of sorts). It also tasted really good, but it just wasn't quite satisfying. The mushroom basically replaced the bread/english muffin that is usually in a Benedict and I feel like it kind of took away from it.  For dinner I had the frenchy. I was tempted by all the amazing ingredients in the dish. It came as a huge 2 patty burger. It looked amazing. And it tasted really good too! Several cheeses, seared foie gras, bone marrow aioli etc the problem however was that it was way too big. I could not eat it as a burger no matter how hard I tried. I eventually gave in, and used a fork and knife to cut up the burger and eat it in pieces. I know. Shame on me. There was so much going on in the burger that I could barely taste the foie gras.  My boyfriend got the truffled local chicken, also tasted good, but it was pretty much half a chicken, some rice, and that's about it. It became a bit monotonous after the first few bites. The same goes with the octopus. It's not that it's not good, but the problem was the monotony of the dish. The octopus was practically a whole octopus (mind you, a small one), but by the time you've eaten two or three tentacles it is just the same thing bite after bite.  In the end, the taste of the food is great, the price is on the higher end, but it falls short in the satisfactory level, and it does feel a bit monotonous, could use some variety on the dish. If I could, I'd give it a 3.5, but there's no .5, so 3 will have to do."}
{"text":"I felt like I just stepped back into Paris! This place is a little bakery, attached to a bar area and a restaurant.  The bakery is just lovely - lots of breads, unique jams/spreads (champagne mustard anyone??) and pastries.  If you are looking for a unique gift for a foodie then definitely stop by here.  Had a drink at the bar - wow, what a gorgeous and elegant space.  The bar table is marble..the entire place looks so classy - definitely if you are looking for a great first impression, come here for a few drinks.  Next time I will try the restaurant as I am curious to see if this is a 3 part winner!  The prices seem expensive but a special occasion may warrant a trip back ere for some dinner  Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"We were here a few weeks ago.  Make a reservation.  It was quite busy. The food was delish.  We ordered a bunch of things.  My fave small plate was the steak tartare...be forewarned it's very raw, they crack an egg yolk into it at the table when they bring it out.  I don't mind, I'm always trying tartares when I can (I love them).    My future cousin in law loves soufflés, and has them whenever they are on the menu.  She said the soufflé here was the best she's had in the city..possibly anywhere (but I'd have to double check on that).  We ordered 5 entrees to share between 5 people, and we each had a different favourite, so I guess that means they were all good?!?  I liked the lamb 2 (or 3) ways best.  But the meatball, chicken and fish were crowd favourites also.  They have a patisserie attached to the restaurant.  I ordered some macarons from the bakery to go.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Cluny for quite a long time and finally today got a chance to try it. I got HIGH expectations for this place but blah. You think with the amount of money you spend here you'll get an great customer service experience but no. One of the woman who looked like a supervisor ignored us and treated us poorly. Then we bought around 4 of their pastries they didn't offer us a paperbag to carry, and the girl just walked away doing something else. Food is good but their customer service is not. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Pretentious is an understatement.  Were not in France people.  Not that that would change my view on this place.  I hate French food.  I do not care for splooge drizzle on my plate.  My food should not need to look like a Picasso to taste good.   Now on to this restaurant.  If your not pretentious do not go here.  If you are pretentious you will love this place and will love telling all your friends about it.  Their french Onion soup was delicious and for that it gets a 2 star instead of 1.  The service was fake.  Trying way to hard to be a higher class server.  Dude, I don't care for your conversation.  I care about when and what my food will taste like.  Do your job.  Your 10 minute fake conversations with every table is the reason why my food is cold.  No one cares about your dogs and cats and the game of scrabble you played."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday during the week while at the Christmas market.  The decor is very beautiful and artistic. The staff were very accommodating.  We really enjoyed the truffle chicken and the fries and hangar steak was delicious.  I'm not much of a fan of chicken, but it was so flavourful.  The octopus was a bit overdone, but had a nice presentation and good flavours.   We enjoyed the profiteroles and chocolate dessert.  Loved the drink cocktails as well."}
{"text":"When I walked in immediately loved the design. It was a very nice place for special occasions. Me and a friend ordered the french onion soup, oysters, steak frites, and fried seafood mix with fries.   The French onion soup was nice. I loved the huge puff pastry on top. The oysters were good too. However, I was disappointed with the mains. The steak was alright, it wasn't bad but I wasn't impressed. The fried seafood didn't come out crispy. They left it in the kitchen too long before bringing it out to me. It was pretty bad considering it is a higher end restaurant. I will probably not return for authentic French cuisine."}
{"text":"Came here for weekend brunch. Ordered the three fried eggs with house baguette and French toast. French toast was good more like the bread pudding. The fried eggs were rubbery and I could have made it better myself. We also had a coffee where the first cup they have us is broken and we had that replaced and the second time around the coffee tasted much lighter and watered down. Strike One..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Great! Food: Meh  Some friends and I decided to do brunch here on Saturday, and I must admit that overall, the experience was good.  For starters, they allowed for a reservation on the weekend, which is always a big plus, and although this is the case, I'm not sure we would have needed one as the restaurant has a very large and nicely spaced out seating area.  The first thing i noticed when I walked in was the bar made out of what appeared to be white marble, which was spectacular.  The servers and staff were very courteous, attentive, and seemed generally happy throughout our whole experience.  Our table ordered a variety of different dishes, all of which were \"ok\".  I wasn't disappointed, but also not blown away.  I had the three cheese omelet, which I must admit is a bland dish to begin with, which was well prepared and nicely presented.  Some deserts were ordered as well, which were very well presented.  Overall, if you have friends in town and need a decent, accommodating brunch experience, this place shouldn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious, food was meh, nothing worth noting. Ambience is very nice, has antique stuff on display and a bread bar? Service was slow."}
{"text":"Last night took a friend and colleague out to celebrate his recent promotion....he had never been to Cluny but I have become a bit of a regular as I work nearby and visit for business lunches once a month or so.   We shared a lovely bottle of white Rhone wine and he had the tomahawk meatball and I had the roasted skate after splitting the salt cod fritters. After dinner we had tea and split an order of profiteroles.   Everything was delicious...the room had a nice buzz. My only slight complaint might be that the skate could have been seasoned more...and since I love capers...they could have been piled on the Romenesco sauce.  Service was cheerful and accommodating...and my guest LOVED dinner. Go Cluny!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant - great food, ambience, service. They have it all!   Baked Sauvagine for 2 - The baked sauvagine for two was so good and a must if you're having red wine. It was by recommendation from the waitress (she was lovely) I don't like the use of truffle oil in general but in this dish it is so yummy. How could one say no to melted cheese.   Foie Gras - Came on a pancake. Perfectly prepared. Not much can go wrong.  Tomahawk meatball - The meatball was equal parts juicy and seasoned, but not overly so. It came smothered in tomato sauce. The gnocchi on the sides could be a dish on their own - fluffy, light, buttery... just went perfectly together with the meatball.   Octopus - The octopus was charred and juicy, topped with aragula and capers and anchovies... The charred octopus made it more seafood-rich in flavour and went perfectly with the salty/tangy sides. The ladies next to us said they hated theirs because it was 'dry and the worst thing they have ever tasted'. I could see they've never tried/didn't expect charred octopus, so they were caught off-guard. I liked mine, a lot.  Portions are big and pricing is great, just right to have everyone leaving content.   I realllly love the interior of this restaurant - it may be my favourite in Toronto."}
{"text":"This review is for the bakery only. The restaurant looks great, but I have never eaten there so I cannot comment. On Sunday afternoon around 4pm, the wife and I bought two croissants from Cluny. Mine was terrible. Dry, old, almost inedible. If we weren't already driving away, I would have brought it back. Her's was a bit better, but not the exceptional, fresh, flakey, buttery treat we expected. A high-end French bakery with miserable croissants is like a lifeguard that doesn't know how to swim.  I want my $6 back."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Cluny for lunch. We ordered the Seafood Set, Hummus and Asparagus fries. The staff is super friendly and made us feel very welcomed. He was attentive, checked on us and refilled our water without us having to ask him. Decor is very classy. The food is more on the heavy side (maybe because of what we ordered). Portions are huge and you definitely won't be leaving hungry."}
{"text":"Great everything... Quality, selection, service, presentation, atmosphere  One of the best all around meals that I have ever had..."}
{"text":"We usually love coming to this place and the food is excellent. However, when we came to celebrate my birthday our server ruined the whole experience for us. The server was more than willing to engage in multiple prolonged conversations with surrounding tables; when it came to us, his service suddenly came evidently quite short handed. He barely smiled or sustained any form of conversation with us. He could not be bothered to serve us and throughout the night he consistently failed to meet any of our requests. My father became extremely aggravated and it led to an escalation to the management. The management and the food was the highlight of our night. She attended and resolved the situation in a very professional and cordial manner. She was able to address the concerns immediately.  Thank you Eva."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our meal today at Cluny. Having been there before, we were looking forward to another good outing, but it started off poorly and got worse. Our reservation for 5 was seated at a table for four, with three of us having to squeeze onto a bench seat, and the middle straddling two tables. The service was very slow. Granted, the restaurant was busy, but when tables that arrived after us received their food well before us, I began to lose my patience.  When the food finally arrived, the two identical seafood dishes looked very different, with one serving undercooked shrimp. My \"Steak and Eggs\", advertising grilled sirloin and two eggs along with frites, delivered the eggs and frites as expected, but the steak turned out to be two thin slices of beef, undercooked (see pic). As we couldn't get our server's attention, we asked another staff member to find the manager.  He ordered another seafood dish, which also took a while to arrive.  In the end, they comp'd one of the meals, but that was too little too late.  Poor service, and 2 of 5 dishes were sub-standard.  Only one star for this visit."}
{"text":"The interior design at Cluny is very 1940's Paris and very beautiful.  We got the steak tartare (5/5), the braised beef and mushroom poutine (5/5), and the asparagus fries (3/5). The food is good and the service is attentive. Fresh bread is also great.  Price is a little steep, although not out of line with the other options available to you in the distillery. The quality to price ratio is appropriate for tourists (and a little high for locals)."}
{"text":"I love the decor & atmosphere of this restaurant! Came here on a Sunday for brunch and to see the huge harvest table filled with fresh bread and pastries definitely whet my appetite.  It makes sense to start with a plate of the morning pastries. We received a pumpkin spice danish, butter croissant and a cranberry scone, complete with butter and jam. The pastries were delicious! Probably one of the best things on the table.  We also ordered the sausage muffin and portobello eggs benedict. The sausage muffin came wrapped like a sandwich from McDonald's. A tad on the greasy side and not sure if the sandwich warrants the price tag of $17.90.  The eggs benedict seemed like a decent sized with 3 poached eggs and a portobello mushroom underneath each. I just found the dish a bit too deconstructed to my liking.  The server seemed nice but she is lacking a bit of experience. She would get everything we ask for very promptly but some items were common sense, such as a spoon for my coffee and pepper & ketchup?  I think the space is gorgeous and it's a great space to catch up but the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The decor and ambiance is really nice here - comfy seats too. Service was so slow though :(  It took 45 mins from the moment we sat down to order our food - and that doesn't  include our wait for the food. But it was okay because our group was really chatty so it didn't feel as long haha  Drinks:  CLUNY SANGRIA (3/5)  Appetizers:  SPICY SALMON TARTAR 3.5/5 I love avocado so I liked this.. would've liked it more if they added more avocado (Personal preference!)  BEEF POUTINE 3/5 The fries were good, reminded us of the hickery sticks  RICE FLOUR FRIED FROG'S LEGS 4/5 Frog legs tastes like chewy chicken for the ones who haven't tried frog legs before! This was really good :) Would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a small appetizer.  Mains:  9 OZ TOP SIRLOIN 2/5  I should have gotten the lamb because this has got to be the driest (and rather tasteless..) sirloin ever... The sirloin was basically the \"side dish\" and the fries became my main because it tasted so much better haha"}
{"text":"Save your Money. There are WAY better restaurants in Toronto.   This is the second time I ate at Cluny. The first experience was subpar as the waiter did not explain the menu well. The Lamb Tagine came out with maybe three tiny shreds of Lamb Shoulder and all starch. We sent it back and got a steak. But for my husband to watch three other people eat while he waited was not acceptable. There was nothing you could have done? We left full but discontent because the price was expensive and the portions were small. Not everything was well thought out and the plates are much larger than the food so it makes the portion size look even smaller. We told the server we were unhappy and he did nothing about it. No manager came and talked to us about any problems.   Regardless, we decided to give Cluny another chance during Winterlicious. We were sat by a friendly waitress. The food is the lost cause of this beautiful restaurant. For appetizers we had: Truffle Brule and Lentil Soup. For mains, we had: Beef Tongue Pastrami, Chili marinated heads of Prawn and the Duck Confit Cassoulet. For dessert, we had: The Pear Sorbet, Chocolate Macaron and Profiteroles. The best dishes: Truffle Brule, pear sorbet, chocolate macaron and profiteroles. Everything else was like was just thrown together. The lentil soup had combination of flavours did not go well together. It was too acidic. The beef tongue pastrami was like 3pc hors d'oeuvres with a large mountain of fries. The shrimp was so overcooked. It was sandy and unappetizing. The cassoulet was too acidic and too sweet. It lacked salt. The food runner will run 2 of 3 dishes and leave the 1 person waiting two minutes until they got their dish. Does your chef send out food together or very sparse because it makes the guest feel like you just fire food at random and send them at random as well. I understand you are busy but the service was unforgivable. The server never asked us for more drinks when we finished our drinks. We want to order more but was left hanging. The server was never there when we needed him. We waited a good 15 minutes before someone cleared our appetizers and then another 15 minutes for the mains. Everything was time stamped by my photos. The server did not ask us about allergies. So you are just going to roll the dice with the possibility of us being allergic to your food. Wow that is so very comforting.   There are many good restaurants in Toronto and after two major letdowns at your restaurant, we will not be returning and diverging anyone who brings up your restaurant to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and decided to try out the summerlicious menu. The decor is quite interesting and definitely unique, but I felt a bit cluttered and it was quite dark. They could probably use more fabric to break down the noise levels. With glass and tiling everywhere and he vast open space, I think it amplifies the noise level quite a bit.   My boyfriend started off with a seafood chowder. I thought the broth base was quite nice and very flavourful. There's quite a variety of seafood in the dish so that was nice to enjoy. I had the swordfish ceviche. I am a sucker for seafood and i love acidity and freshness of ceviches. I was not disappointed with this dish at all. They did an amazing job with the swordfish slices and there's a crispy shrimp cracker to pair it with. I love that the sauce was very acidic and they had some fresh greens over top. There are dollops of guacamole that help break that acidity down and bring a new layer of flavour to each bite. I enjoyed it very much!   The mains were not quite as impressive sadly to say. I had the chicken cordon bleu crepe topped with a poached egg which was paired with a very large side of slaw. I really liked the salad and again, the flavouring was on point. The chicken was sadly bland, but mixed with the slaw, crepe, yolk, ham and blue cheese, it was a nice meal. My boyfriend had sirloin which came with brussel sprouts and layered baked/roasted turnip. The vegetable sides were very well caramelized and flavourful. But the steak itself was rather plain and had no seasoning. It seams they do an all star job with the sides but really neglected the proteins. I guess we had different stars to our dishes that night.   The desserts were interesting. I had the honey butter cake which tasted like a home made lemon cake I use to make. It was really quite delicious and I loved the cake texture. They put a yogurt gelato on top which brought in some tart flavour. And around the cake they had these lemon custard drops which were tart and I thought paired nicely with the sweet cake. My boyfriend had the tiramisu like cake or truffle chocolate bar. It was topped with some basil I believe, and it tasted quite nice. It was a bit sweet for my taste but that's milk chocolate for you.   Service was nice. Our wait for the food was a bit lengthy but not to the point where it would be anything negative. I guess it's worth it because they do take the time to present the food nicely on the plate, and that can affect how it will taste as well. Our server was Alice and she was very attentive and friendly and she was there enough to check up on us but left us our space to enjoy our date night :)  I would want to come back and try more of their main menu and brunch as well. It's a great location and there's parking literally right underneath. Finish a meal here and take a stroll around the distillery district. it's quite a romantic neighboorhood."}
{"text":"First time coming here for Summerlicous dinner! The interior of Cluny is very modern and cozy.  ured since I had an opportunity to try absinthe, let's do it! Let's drink an alcohol that has an alc/vol of 62% ... Good idea? Bad idea? It was fine since I diluted it quite a bit and only drank half... lol I got a Lemon and Black Walnut flavour, but nope. Nope. I couldn't taste any of that.. the absinthe flavour was just too overwhelming (licorice flavour everywhere) to the point where I just started using the drink as a palate cleanser between courses... welp.  I got the following: YELLOW TOMATO GAZPACHO (VEGETARIAN) herbed croutons, basil pesto  MOROCCAN STYLE PORK SHOULDER POT ROAST apricots, fennel, tomato, cous cous  FRENCH APRICOT GALETTE yuzu caramel and black sesame ice cream  Overall, the food was good and our server was very attentive as to when to refill our waters. Would come again!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and food was delicious. The baked goods were soft and tasty. The teas were very fresh. The waitress took her time to answer all our questions in a friendly tone. As we were leaving, the waiters/waitresses gave us a smile and told us to have a great day. Overall, food is pretty good here, price is fair, service is just as good. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink and some small bites in the late afternoon. It wasnt a typical time to visit - restaurant was quite empty. But nevertheless, the food was excellent, and I'm glad we went! LOVED my winter squash salad. And the poutine was DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"It was a cold night in January, walking through the distillery district. I noticed a cute little pastry shop and went in, lots of tasy french pastries! Straight ahead the double doors will lead you to the restaurant.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. The decor was probably my favorite, there were lights from the light tunnel right in front of me, the ceiling had beautiful wood detailing.   Now on to the food. I tried the fried asparagus which surprised me, it was phenomenal! We ordered a second portion. The burger is totally Instagramable! So it's a cumbrae's beef burger with braised wagu beef and a whole slab of fried cheese. Sounds amazing right? well the burger was a little bit too thick in my onion and a bit overdone, the wagu beef ontop was delicious! Once you pressed down on the bun, a flow of melted cheese comes oozing out, what's left is a hard and overpowering cheese residue that I didn't enjoy.   Also very very very messy!    The fries kinda reminded me of McDonald's fries as they were very thin and crispy.. You should go in and check out the decor, I've heard they also do brunch!"}
{"text":"Once again, Cluny Bistro comes through as a great place for a special evening get together. The special of the evening was all about fresh tuna which was A-OK with me. I had a delicious seared tuna on a bun with a side of their addictive shoestring fries. Plenty to share. The perfectly cooked tender tuna slices were topped with a fried egg so I got my healthy protein fix. There was also a great paella dish with quinoa instead of rice and tuna instead of shell fish. It was a good take on a favourite dish.  The mixed drinks were very nicely presented and tasted great. The desserts made the meal a complete success. Our favourite one was the chocolate truffle bar with a big cloud of cotton candy. We all had fun sharing that one and reminiscing about eating cotton candy at the CNE. Our waiter, Fab, was great. He gave excellent suggestions and was so fun to talk to. We will be back very soon for sure."}
{"text":"I gave this a 3 stars, but only because of the atmosphere, location and desserts. The food was not that flavorful, out of the three meals we ordered, one was delicious, the rest were take it of leave it. It was also a misfortune that we received our meals probably 10 minutes before our appetizer.  I ordered the Cluny Caesar and the BRIE DE MEAUX \"GRILLED CHEESE, which both lacked flavor. We also ordered the MOROCCAN CHICKPEA & SWEET POTATO STEW and the 6 OZ BEEF TONGUE, The tongue was the best thing in our meal, it just melted in your mouth, very delicious. The stew lacked flavor as well. The decor makes you feel like you are sitting in a restaurant in the middle of Europe, beautiful warm colors, ornate and tall ceilings. The bar area is very reminiscent of a French bistro. As we were leaving, we stopped at the patisserie attached and ordered a dozen macroons, which made up for the dinner. The best ones were the orange and the salted caramel weren't bad."}
{"text":"We came here during the Chrisrmas market for dinner and tried a lot of dishes. Highlights were definitely the coq au vin poutine and the chocolate bomb for dessert. For mains we tried the octopus, filet mignon, lamb, and burger. The burger looked delicious but it was dry. The filet mignon and octopus were cooked perfectly. However, my lamb came out too cold for my liking and the staff decided to reheat my lamb instead of making a new one, turning my pink lamb brown and overcooking it. I expected more, especially if im paying close to $40 for that dish alone. Also, one of my friends were vegetarian and there was only one vegetarian main. Please give them more options!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at the distillery district. That day I was here was having ice storm but luckily there was an underground parking nearby. Around 2 mins walk away from it. When I walked in, it's look like a sit in bakery shop. Like the one in England. It was a nice place.   The food here was good. But I love the dessert the most. It look so nice and taste good. Love it so much.   Its a good place to chill with friends."}
{"text":"If you're looking to have a capital 'E' excellent experience with all the frills and fancies you can get, Cluny is the place for you.   The decor is STUNNING, and of course, the distillery district is equally gorgeous. We went for a friends birthday brunch and the service was good, we had a waitress who was being shadowed by a trainee, and so sometimes service was a little slow, but with mimosas and some complimentary pastries, the wait wasn't long.  I had the Croque Madame which was presented in a very Instagram friendly way (thankfully!) and was also much more filling than I anticipated - I didn't even finish the fries as I was so stuffed. It is a bit on the pricier side (for the 3 of us to have brunch it was something like $250 - but the mimosa's are like $15 so KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR BOOZE TAB) but if you're looking to impress I would give it a whirl!   Also check out the boulangerie on the way out - the almond tea and macarons are FABULOUS"}
{"text":"This resturant has an upscale feel without being too pretentious . Our service was wonderful. The bread basket that came out before our food was enjoyable. They served 3 varieties of bread. My dinner of a 3 egg omelette with cheese was satisfying without being heavy. I was indifferent on the salad that came with it. Overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try Cluny for some time, and as surprise for my birthday, my wife brought me here. Well, we just left. Sat for over 10 minutes and no sever ever came by...and the place was LESS than half full! I said something to the hostess and a few minutes later a manger came to apologize, but never even offered to take our order. Just kept saying she was \"sorry\" with no attempt to keep us and turn our experience around. Great way to start my birthday :("}
{"text":"We were in the Distillery District for the Toronto Light Fest, so we decided to check out Cluny's first. We did make a reservation a few days in advance.  Oh gosh. First of all, it is SO gorgeous in here. I kept looking around and admiring all of the interior design elements. The lights, the paintings, the centrepiece displays - all so beautifully put together. Everything is also in warm-tone colours, which makes the place more welcoming.  My boyfriend and I shared the braised beef & roast mushroom poutine, which was an amazing appetizer. The flavours worked really well together. I then ordered the Provençal seafood stew, while he ordered the veal meatball 'tomahawk'. I think the entrees were both solid choices.   What pushed this restaurant to deserve a 5-star rating was the service. Our waitress was extremely attentive and kind from the moment we sat down, and I haven't experienced such great service in a while. Kudos to the employees here for maintaining that vibe during the busy dinner rush. So glad we got to experience this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very good ambience.  The decorations are ornate and complex, tables, chairs, space - everything is done in excruciating detail to mimic a high-end place in Quebec.  I am sure American tourists are very impressed.   The wine list is extensive (and expensive), but I opted for beer.  Sacrilege, I know.  I started with the Onion soup and my girlfriend with salad.  The Onion soup was probably in the top 3 I've ever had, hands down, in Toronto, Quebec or France, amazing and the cheese on top was actually top-shelf - you could taste it.    Then we had Baked Sauvagine for 2 to share, and it looked small initially, but man was it filling!  My gf gave up after a few bites, so I had to finish the monster - talk about stomach overload.  The amount of fat in that thing must have been incredible - and it tasted every bit as marvelous.    Overall a great place for French food in a great ambiance with an emphasis more on the ambiance than the food."}
{"text":"Great interior design, lovely atmosphere, friendly staff, very good service but just average food is all I can say about this place.  we were there for brunch with a group of people and just dropped in with no reservation; the server was very friendly, with great recommendations;  We ordered different dishes and few of their cocktails; the steak was very dry and salty, Caesars Salad was just OK; cannot remember what other friends ordered exactly but they were all saying the same thing that it was just an average food for the price.  Their bread selection was amazing and we loved the bread and butter that was served right before our food."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars.  Stumbled upon this place while roaming the Distillery over the Labour Day weekend. Ended up setting up camp here for brunch.  The decor is well done and has a definitely European vibe to it, as confirmed by the Dutchman in our party of 6. Service was prompt and attentive. The brunch menu looked fantastic and they definitely have a very creative collection of dishes.  Where Cluny lost half a star was on execution.  For this meal, I went halfsies on the bourbon pecan pancakes, and crab cake benedict.  On paper, the pancakes sounded rich and delicious. Unfortunately, the execution fell flat. The chocolate toffee sauce was a bit on the tame side, not very chocolatey nor toffee-esque, reminded me a bit of Hersey chocolate syrup to be honest. The bourbon creme was more like a foam and while impressive to look at, it was WAY too intense in flavour. Overall there was just a lack in harmony in the dish.  The crab cakes faired better and overall I would say it was decently executed. The accompanying shoestring fries were great as well.  TIP: Request a side of their homemade aioli to go with the fries!  One person in our party had the stuffed french toast and described it as tasty, but found the ricotta a little too runny. Strong words coming from someone who is a lover of food and usually very VERY forgiving.  Overall, I wouldn't say this is a mainstay for regular t.dot peeps, there's better for less (Mildred's, School Restaurant, The Saint Tavern, etc). Cluny is a decent spot to come for an occasion like when out-of-town guests visit, brunch with parents/in-laws, etc. or when you want a venue that is a little different, sophisticated but not overly pretentious."}
{"text":"This will be a review of their Winterlicious 2018 dinner menu.  Our experience didn't start off on a good note. We arrived early to our reservation, and they told us our table wasn't ready yet (which was fair, since we we were early). So we went out and walked around the Distillery District for a bit before returning at the time of our reservation. We then had to wait a further 15 minutes before they sat us. I thought this was very unprofessional as we had a reservation, arrived early, and still had to wait so long. When we were seated, they only gave us one menu even though there were four of us. We had to ask for additional menus. After taking our orders, the bread came out, which tasted ok, but was cold.  Now the food: I ordered the melted gruyere French onion soup, arctic char almondine, and finished with the bittersweet kwokolate bar. The French onion soup was very good, though the presentation was awkward. The bowl itself was sitting in another shallow bowl, presumably to catch the overflow. But this construction made the soup a little awkward to eat. I really liked the toast, which was still very crispy even though it was in the soup. The arctic char was ok. I would have preferred the skin to be crispier, rather than soggy. The dessert was the star for me. Beautifully chocolately and decadent.  My family members didn't fare as well with their meals, however. The filet mignon came out medium to medium-well done, even though it was requested to be rare. The short ribs were very dry. The final desserts were also mixed up, as they brought out the wrong desserts twice.  Ultimately a pretty disappointing experience. I might come again when it's not winterlicious/summerlicious, to see if the regular service will be better."}
{"text":"Cluny Bistro & Boulangerie is my favourite restaurant in the Distillery District, it's a hard decision between Cluny and El Catrin. I have the SEARED TUNA STEAK SANDWICH, personally think it's one of the best in town. It comes with house-baked brioche bun, oven dried tomato, fried egg.  Not a huge fan of their tapenade or the frites but overall a great dish. The only worrisome part of their service was the hostesses, they're more than just the face of the restaurant - better training may be required."}
{"text":"The Summerlicious is not worth to go.  The striploin and pickerel does not have much taste. The pickerel even have several some fishbones on the meat, seems like they do not care about the quality of summerlicous menu."}
{"text":"Toronto, Canada's Cluny Bistro restaurant serves up a bread pudding style Chocolate and Vanilla French Toast- normally not a huge fan of bread pudding french toast but this one is not too bad. Chocolate cooked between layers and a vanilla whip on top gives it a nice sweet flavor, don't think I even used the syrup. Final score: 7.5"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Came here for a birthday dinner and everything was perfect. When you walk in the beautiful french decor is super eye catching. We were seated right away and started with some drinks. We tried the Marie Antoinette Martini and this other drink with smoke coming out of it (not sure what it was called). Both tasted pretty good and came with quite a show.   To start with me tried a few oysters that were super fresh and tasty as well as the kingfish ceviche. For our mains we tried the Striploin steak that came with some super crispy fries on the side as well as the Lamb and Snail dish. It was my first time trying escargot and I have to say it was quite delicious. Both mains tasted great.   We also got a complimentary dessert since it was my friends birthday which was super tasty. Overall it was a great experience, our server was very friendly as well and we really enjoyed the french vibe!"}
{"text":"I've long considered most of the restaurants in the Distillery District to be a little pricey but Winterlicious presents a good opportunity to try them at a reasonable cost.  My companion and I had planned an outing to photograph the TO Light Fest and then have dinner at Cluny Bistro. The weather turned out to be cool and damp and the exhibits were a little disappointing.  We got to the restaurant about half an hour early and they were quite busy. They weren't able to seat us but we sat in the lounge and had a couple of cocktails while waiting. It's a nice ambiance, almost intimate, except for the crowd.  We got a table just past our reservation time, with a nice view of the entire dining room. The Winterlicious dinner menu ($43) had quite a few choices but we ordered the French Onion Soup and Caesar Salad to start, Arctic Char and Beef Short Ribs for our mains, and the Chocolate Bar and Charcoal Profiterole for dessert. We also opted for the wine pairing with each course for only $20. That was a bargain!  The Caesar Salad, with some crispy chickpeas, was good and the chickpeas added a nice crunch. The sweetness of the onions came through the rich broth of the French Onion Soup but the star of the show was the cheese. That was really good!  The Arctic Char was very good, with a nice blend of flavours in the salad. The Short Rib was a little disappointing. I felt it could have used a little more seasoning or more time to develop the flavours. It wasn't bad, but could have been better.  The \"Kwokolate\" Bar was definitely chocolatey and the Granny Smith sorbet was tart, providing a nice contrast. The Charcoal Profiterole was okay but, other than the blood orange cremeux, the rest of the flavours were understated.  The wine pairings were well matched to each course and was a really good deal. Spend the extra $20!  Overall, it was a very enjoyable evening - nice ambiance, very good food and service, and great company. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really beautiful, and I would have loved to see the place busier, but visited at an off time and had the pleasure of sitting outside. So many cool spaces within this place--I'd love to have a place like this to nosh. They had a special lunch menu going on where you could choose from a starter, main and dessert for one price, which was just as good as the main menu. Had a half avocado stuffed with shrimp (just the right amount), the spinach crepe (quite filling), and the profiteroles (which were just a hint too salty for me). Staff was quite friendly, food solid, lovely setting. Also, no fresh brewed iced tea, but starting to believe that's a Canadian thing, like in the UK, except, tea doesn't seem as big a deal here as in UK."}
{"text":"I made RSVP with a special request and it was not as followed, it was a pretty simple request. We had a party of 14 which was split into three tables but scattered across the restaurant which was unpleasant. Our server (Victoria) was understanding about our situation and was patient. Management couldn't get one simple task right by placing us by each other. The layout of it would have worked. They tried to charge us $3 per slice of cake, which we had brought in ourselves. Which ruined the birthday event for the person who we were celebrating for. The food was not great, appetizer was bland, the main was good and then the dessert fell flat. The price of the food was not worth the quality they had presented. Will not be coming back. Do not recommend. You'll be disappointed, I was, right off the back by their service."}
{"text":"Located in the distillery district in Toronto. We had a private room as it was a group booking. We had a set menu but they kindly accommodated my vegan and gf needs. I had a delicious veg soup to start. The veg tag i even was made with quinoa instead of couscous for me and the yogurt was omitted. For dessert I got a berry bowl  The service was friendly and the washrooms were clean. The restaurant is quite big and has a bakery section where you can buy food to go."}
{"text":"4 star for ambience, decor and service!  3.5 star for food-for summerlicious menu tho. Didn't expect much as we tried the summerlicious menu, spinach and ricotta salad had a nice twist with crunchiness, moroccan style pork shoulder roast was mediocre but came with delicious couscous.  My date has short rib burger and it was a little tasteless, the fries were excellent with garlic aioli. Desserts were pretty but can do without.  Would probably come back for drinks and regular menu. The bread selection was excellent and tasty as well. Overall, a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I had lunch here a few weeks ago (winterlicious menu).  The food was very average.  The desert was the best part - I had a macaron and my friend had the delicious hazelnut profiteroles.  My friend had dinner there and also agreed that the food was very bland.  I would not recommend dining here but maybe going for coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"The food is French inspired. I personally really liked the mushroom Benedict. It's a poach egg on top of a mushroom accompanied with French fries. It was a nice brunch order. Decor is amazing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant definitely on my top list. The atmosphere is warm, inviting, classy, and definitely fun. I have tried most if not all of the menu and it's difficult to name my favourites because everything is sondelicious. I love the decor!!"}
{"text":"Walked into Cluny at 10:30pm for a bite after theater. The restaurant was not very busy but there still seem to be a good complement of staff. That said it took over 15 minutes for the server to come to my table. (I was beginning to feel invisible). She was lovely/friendly when she did come over. I ordered the seared fois gras and cannot recommend it. The fois gras was tasteless. It was sitting on a piece of thick french toast that was drenched in blackcurrant/cassis sauce. It looked unappealing and the combination of all of these ingredients did not complement each other. I am not dismissing this restaurant entirely and might try it again but this was not a good start."}
{"text":"The decor was like nothing in the area - fresh flowers (even in the bathroom), tile floors and ornate ceilings (even in the bathroom.) The inside area was larger and more beautiful that you can tell from the outside.   We had the prix fixe menu for lunch with wine pairings. What a treat. The gazpacho and asparagus frites were delicious, tuna salad and crepes, with raspberry and chocolate for dessert. The drinks matched each dish perfectly. You left satisfied, but not stuffed.   Our server was attentive and the music was an added bonus. Definitely the restaurant you want to try in Toronto."}
{"text":"In March I made a reservation for myself and my partner. It was her birthday dinner and as such it was supposed to be a special occasion as indicated in the reservation booking.  While the restaurant itself was nice enough and the food was generally ok, upon reflection I would like to take a moment to share how unsatisfied we were with our waiter.  He was generally unattentive - we sent much of the time trying to get his attention but we felt invisible. When he did arrive we placed orders for appetisers and twice forgot what we ordered and had to come back to ask.  When we asked about a \"low sugar\" wine suggestion, he dismissed us and blathered on about \"how he could go on all night about wines\" and then didn't give us any useful info or guidance - he really knew nothing about wine! When we selected a bottle he referred to it as something he would open if there a bunch of friends over but nothing special otherwise - boy it didn't make a $60 bottle of wine feel any good I'll tell you!  Neither of us liked the sauce that came with the tiger shrimp and despite being shrimpaholics I could barely eat them - when I asked the waiter if he could perhaps score us a more traditional sauce we were told that was not possible -- he didn't check - he didn't even try! My G_d you have a restaurant at your disposal - could you not make a shrimp sauce - if not please close your doors!  When the desert came, he served my partners desert first and then 5 minutes later brought mine out and it was decorated with Birthday wishes - except it was HER birthday not mine - he really should have asked, but it seems to me he truly didn't care!  While the food was generally good, though frankly not outstanding, I have to say the service was so poor that I felt cheated by the tip.  I'm sure the waiter in question is a very nice person and I'm sure he is very skilled in his job but frankly that night, and at the time, his service was simply unacceptable for the standard of restaurant it claims to be. He treated us nicely but it was as if we were in a diner!  My intention for writing is not to scold or find fault but rather to let you know that this was a special occasion and it felt far less than that. Here's hoping your staff will remeber that every customer is there for a reason and it matters to them even if your heart isn't into it!"}
{"text":"Everytime I step into Cluny, I feel like I have been transported to another city! It is such a beautiful space. We went to try their brunch and Summerlicious menu. Everyone enjoyed their food and liked that we had the option of ordering from the regular menu or the set course that they were offering. We tried the fried asparagus, seafood chowder, cod, steak frites (love their skinny fries), and macarons from the Summerlicious. From the brunch menu, we got the burger (which was huge and delicious) and the pork banh mi benedict (which was good but felt like it needed more pickled vegetables and pate to make it taste more like a banh mi). Overall a great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3.5 stars.   If we are taking the fact this is in the distillery district into account, then it is closer to 4.5 stars  6 of us came for a gf's bday recently and it was better than I anticipated.  That is not to say there were not hiccups along the way.   The most notable of these hiccups included having to wait in the front bar for 40 minutes after our scheduled 9pm reservation. I didn't mind this bc I personally was almost 20 minutes late (bad, bad friend).  Further, the restaurant comped us a generous dessert platter and a bottle of sparkling, although, given that there were 6 of us it should have been two at a minimum so we could all get a full glass each (one bottle = 5 servings)  The second and possibly more notable hiccup was service by the front bar bartender.   He was terrible. As mentioned, I showed up late and found my friends sitting with full drinks to which I asked, are you guys on your 2nd?  Their response was, no, we just got them, 20 minutes after ordering.  I sat there for 5 minutes and he didn't even acknowledge my presence so I went up to the bar and asked to see a wine list to which he rolled his eyes.  I don't even understand that, am I a Jedi mind reader who is suppose to know what wines you have by the glass?   He perked up when I asked him for the tables drink bill and all of a sudden was quick and smiley.  Vomit.     The front bar wasn't busy.    There was absolutely no reason for his shitty service.    Things were markedly different when we were seated in the restaurant.  They didn't cramp us at a table for 4 as some restaurants often do and our service experience went from a zero star to 5 stars instantly.   I wish I remembered our servers name, she was amazing, I think it started with a J.   We are all more share plates type of people vs individual meals and that worked out well for the menu.     We had:  Beef tartar -5/5. In the running for one of the best beef tartars I have ever had  Tuna tartar- 3/5. Pretty average, needed either better chopping or better tuna  Ginger Chili Fried Frogs legs - 3/5.  Deep fried and essentially tasted like deep fried chicken thighs  Lobster Poutines - 5/5.  I am not even a big fan of lobster or potatoes, what made this dish was the gravy (fries and lobster was also delish)  A couple of orders of their flank steak - 3.5/5.  Good but just exactly what you would expect for a slightly better than average flank steak.  I would recommend it for sharing, not for an individual main   Their desert platter sealed the deal - just order it.   There are many other things on the menu I would like to eat and plan on going back."}
{"text":"So I've been hearing how good the French Onion Soup is at Cluny, which meant it was inevitable that I would wind up at the Distillery-located eatery one of these days.  We arrived on a Saturday night and quickly took a seat at the bar. The ambivalent bartender notwithstanding, the service was quick and efficient.  Called Melted Gruyere on the menu, the French Onion Soup is described thusly: \"Served French onion soup style, glazed onions, rich beef broth.\" It arrived in a hot bowl overflowing with broth, and the plentiful cheese was as melty and delicious as I hoped. The broth itself was absolutely incredible; rich and beefy, it ranks among the best broths I've ever eaten. Add to that the irresistible caramelized onion and crispy bread, and you've got what's undoubtedly the most magnificent French Onion Soup I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth.  The soup was so good that I'm still giving Cluny five stars even though the \"Crisp Sesame Baked Asparagus Frites\" were a disappointment. The sesame coating was too sparse to be effective, and the asparagus was underdone to the point where it was almost crunchy. A flop, to be sure.  But that French Onion Soup. I would step over all your mothers to eat another bowl of that deliciousness."}
{"text":"Great food. Tiny glass of scotch though. Service is just ok. This restaurant is among many dining and shops in an old Distillery. With the trip even if you don't eat here."}
{"text":"Had brunch here, ordered the steak & eggs and cod Benedict & orange juice. The steak & eggs was ok, the beef wasn't the best but the frites were good. It's $25.95 which is pricey. The Cod Benedict was salty and the portion was small, wouldn't order again. We ordered 2 orange juice ($6 each) and was surprised it came in a wine glass, they didn't even fill up the glass and the portion was so small. If they charge $6 for fresh juice, they should at least put in a decent size cup. We spent $12 on Orange juice which was totally not worth it. Although, the ambiance is very nice. After brunch, you can walk around the distillery district."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed. We had a fairly high expectations when we came here as it's ranked as the best French restaurant in 2014 and we are visiting it for our wedding venue selection. The service was ok but our server didn't know too much about the food here. The food itself was very salty for every single dishes. My boyfriend ordered the seafood stew and the seafood was not fresh with bad smell. Personally I think I would never come back again."}
{"text":"worst service ever. Meh food. came here for my birthday dinner. hostess was very rude, told us if we wanted to sit at this other table it would take 15 min wait, at the door, when we saw another waitress clean up that table in 2 minutes. My friend was bothered by how the hostess was so rude to me, that she talked to the manager, and they agreed to move us to another table. Reserved hours in advance with a note saying that it was my birthday, and waiter didn't bother to ask me about what they offered for birthdays. Everytime we had a inquiry or request, it would take the waiter 20 min to get to us, and it was not even busy, given it was a wednesday night. Ordered medium rare steak with my friend, turns out they mixed up our order with another table, and then had to wait another 20 minutes to get our actual order. Didn't bother to bring us a steak knife even though we ordered a steak. Steak was burnt as well, and had a funky smell to it. FINALLY, asked the waiter for dessert options for Birthday, and he proceeds to ask \"well what do you want?\" How am i supposed to know what you guys offer, as he did not offer me a dessert menu. After he gives us the cream puff, bc thats what he recommended, he did not proceed to tell me there is hazelnut in there, which i was allergic to. I should have mentioned that I had nut allergy, however he did not provide any ingredients or ask me in the beginning. A  1 hour dinner turned into a 3 hour dinner with bad service. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came here for Winterlicous dinner.  When we first walked in we find it very noisy.  If you prefer atmosphere like pubs then you should be fine with it.  Interior is nice with Christmas light outside next to the building.  However my family find it very noisy.  The food has a decent portion.  We started off with French onion soup, then follow with roast beef and dessert cake.  The beef was a bit over cooked.  It could be too many people there and kitchen staff messed it up.  They seem to be understaff that night as we try to get someone to help with getting the bill and no one available.  We waited for 10mins before someone came to help."}
{"text":"DO NOT BELIEVE THESE 1-STAR REVIEWS FROM MORONS!!!  Came in on our first night to Toronto. Everything here was great, from the service, the wine, and all of our food was fantastic.   Our server was a taller red head who knew the menu well and was generally awesome, checking in on us at just the right times, and her food recommendations were really spot on. We came in after having a few drinks and she was happy to shepherd us through the menu, which we got through a lot of.   Definitely a place you want to check out if you're into a mix of rustic and modern French food."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday at 1:45pm for their brunch menu.  My friend ordered the Beef and Roast Mushroom Poutine.  It came with frites fries and the beef was super soft.  The cheese was very cheesy and stringy.  Overall it was good.   I ordered the Grilled Chicken Marrakesh Carrot Salad.  The salad came with chickpeas, dates, cilantro, pistachios, feta cheese, and lime dressing.  It was very tasty and I devoured my meal.  The portion was perfect - my stomach was satisfied."}
{"text":"Quite a rich experience! Enjoyed the baked Sauvagine, one of the most decadent dishes I've ever had. Amazing. The poutine was delicious, more meal size than appetizer, could have used a little more beef, but the fries were crispy perfection. Caesar was good, as was the service."}
{"text":"Got to try Cluny out for Winterlicious and was  super impressed by the atmosphere, decor, and especially the food! The beer braised beef cheeks somehow reminded me of my grandmothers roast beef dinners, while the cod donuts and frogs legs appetizers were perfection!  They have a bake shop at the front where you can buy all their tasty treats and breads they serve!  Highly recommend checking this place out when you're down in the Distillery District."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I had the grilled chicken, which came with fried taro chips and a sun-choke dip. The chicken was okay but the dip was amazing. The drinks are good, but a bit pricey. The ambience is what I loved most though, very beautiful space with great decor. A must visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Located in the distillery district this restaurant gave us a very cozy feeling. You can never really appreciate the beautiful decor until you step inside- it truly is a very warm and inviting restaurant. We came to this restaurant to have brunch and were seated almost immediately. The service was good. The tartare was exceptional but the steak lacked flavour. The frites which came with the steak were fantastic. We found the presentation and the decor really did provide a French bistro feel. As it was nearing 4 pm most of the restaurant was empty. A family of 4 was seated right next to us. There was plenty of space to seat everyone  comfortably throughout the restaurant but we felt like they were clumping people too close together. With the exception of this, we enjoyed brunch at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time here and I think I will visit it again! The restaurant design is very nice as there were two interior designers in our party and naturally discussed about the design and materials used in this restaurant. This restaurant is much bigger inside then what I thought from the door front, spacious and great design. We came for the summerlicious menu and for $38 this is definitely a repeat for us. The seafood chowder has great potion with big mussels and other seafood. The striploin was fair potion and taste wonderful. As for the dessert both the cassis sorbet and truffle bar were delicious. We didn't try the chicken for the main and tried the pickerel which the potion was fairly small. Overall a great experience here."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of the Distillery District, we showed up to Cluny's on a Saturday while the Christmas Market was going on. It was a bustling time in the area and took us a bit of weaving around the crowd to finally get inside Cluny's.  I had searched up Cluny's previously - and also stepped inside the bakery portion on a separate occasion but hadn't tried the food to-date. I chose this place because I was intrigued at the cuisine and the decor, and thought that my friend would appreciate it likewise.  We put our name down for a table and walked around the market, only to be summoned back about 20-25 minutes after (our estimate provided was closer to 45 minutes). #win.  THE DECOR ------------------ Cluny really put dedication into making you feel like you were in a French Bistro in Paris versus the frigid Canadian winter. The faux framed ceiling, table decor, seating, wine cabinets, floor tiles all lend itself to a transformational experience. Everything is beautifully laid out too - including the central bread table overflowing with fresh baguettes, croissants, and more.  The plating ware, the tea pots and coffee siphonware are all so distinct and unique, unbelieveable.   THE FOOD: ----------------- We were presented with their Christmas Market Brunch Menu - alongside their regular brunch menu.   I ordered the BAKED OEUF EN COCOTTE (2 eggs, brioche, winter greens, truffle & frites) She ordered some type of beef broth item from the special brunch menu - I can't recall or find the name of the dish at the moment - oh well!  Both of our meals tasted fantastic and the plating/presentation was beautiful.   NEXT: --------- The plan is to come back at some point to try the dinner menu as well. Perhaps with a bigger group just to expand the sampling possibilities. It looks like they have large-format tables in the back area for larger parties - so that is definitely something to think of, for your next gathering.  I believe they have a patio as well, so next summer should be a treat. Check this place out next time you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Came to Cluny for our first time on NYE. We were a bit overwhelmed with the extensive menu but our server, Jacqueline, guided us through it very well.  We went with her suggestion of sharing a few dishes, starting with the feature of duck two ways, some fresh oysters and the superb lobster bisque.   Overall, a memorable New Year's Eve, great place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This review for Brunch only.   This place is the perfect fit for the Distillery District; what I mean by this is the feel and look of Cluny - makes me think old world French Bistro and I have found a way to magically teleport myself back to Paris.   Cluny's service is Outstanding; along with the feel of the bistro, you can't help but feel you will be well cared for the entire way.   However, the brunch menu needs to play more to their strengths, since I found that most of their brunch menu to be pretty weak. Their pancakes were one of the densest things I've ever tasted, it was awful enough that I couldn't even manage to even finding two bites of it before I gave up. Pecan syrup with bourbon cream came with the pancakes, also, didn't do much to enhance the dish and in some way the bourbon cream detracted from the dish, even further by adding the texture of slimy (which I didn't really love at all).  It is a bit of a pity, since we thought their pastry experience, and since that was the first to arrive - it had set the bar for our expectations - the server had offered to let us take a look at the bread bar and check out want we were curious to try - but we left it to our sever to decide.   My food objections set aside - their service really is quite outstanding - in a way our server looked at our practically untouched pancakes and asked us what we didn't like them, and without us asking, she took it off our bill, so we were pretty surprised at that - since we weren't expecting anything at all.   Overall, great service and atmosphere, food wise - menu is interesting but can be a hit or miss depending on what you order."}
{"text":"French inspired, whimsical, cute restaurant in the Distillery District. Came here for my birthday dinner and was wowed by the ambiance and the interior decor. Very unique and a great setting for afternoon treats with the ladies.   We tried the Veal Meatball Tomahawk and the lamb two ways. The dishes itself were interesting but the flavoring was over powering and that's saying a lot for someone who likes her seasoning. My favorite part was desserts. They gave a very delicious profiterole birthday surprise which was perfect. The passion fruit souffle is also highly recommended, not too sweet, very light with a slight tang. Perfect for sharing!  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is Amazing. Everything was excellent (service, food, atmosphere) . They have the most amazing bread and pastries I have had in Toronto to date. The focaccia bread is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"You're whisked away from the Disneyfied cobblestones of the distillery to an equally out-of-place 1885 Parisian bistro.   The decor is fantastic.  The rumour is that they spent a million dollars on the interior.  It shows.  Delicious food, shiny people.   C'est dommage.  The environs make you want to dress up in period costume.   At one point you find yourself screaming 'Bon jour de Mères!' as loud as possible as they bludgeon you with heaps of butter.       How could one complain?"}
{"text":"I'm going to start with saying that's it's a beautiful restaurant, great ambiance, atmosphere and service. Our server was attentive, patient and very authentic. I had high expectations.. But once the food arrived and we were done our meal, we felt something was missing. The food did not wow us. I was excited to have the sweet breads, but their 'buffalo style' twist was too over powering ... And the sweet breads were lost in the sauce. The beef tartar but the best of the lot and then my liver with fries , the presentation was plain and nothing to it, they had their shoestring fries and liver. I had high expectations and slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I booked a table for two for Winterlicious 2017, we had amazing experience! The decor is wonderful! I can feel the fusion design of the restaurant, and everything is clean and organized. For the food, I had the chicken liver parfait as the starter. The parfait itself is delicious. The savory flavor went very well with the sourness of the black currant sauce. However, the rye crisps inside is way too hard for me, I gave up after one bite. It definitely matches the wine. A pretty good and light dish to start! I tried my friend's mushroom soup as well. The presentation is absolutely stunning (sorry I don't have a picture for that), and very flavorful.  I had the trout almondine for entree. The fish is tasty and fresh. The sauce with cumin inside amazed me the most. It covers the fishy taste of the trout successfully. The dessert is just okay. But I did enjoy my financier and my friend's chocolate bar with chestnut ice cream (super tasty). Overall, atmosphere 4/5, food 3.5/5, service 3.5/5. Btw, an elegant lady sat beside us was celebrating her birthday with her friend. The server brought her a marshmallow cake dessert on the house which looks amazing! I think it's a very cute thing to do! Will definitely come back when I drop by distillery district."}
{"text":"Nope. Food is bland. Server was awful. The only thing good about Cluny is the bread and interior design (though it is very loud). I ordered the Shore Lunch and seriously had no idea that it would be a platter of deep fry. Also, balsamic vinegar came in a spray bottle that was impossible to use from all the grease smear on it. Server was sarcastic and insincere. Did not bring us additional bread even though we requested it and basically went MIA after we paid the bill. I would not recommend. Very poor and subpar service and food."}
{"text":"Sadly I thought the reviews would be wrong. Ordinarily I'd give a 3 star but based on the prices it deserves a 2. I think overall the good was very good however there is much to be improved upon. Our reservation was not ready when we arrived which was a disappointment off the bat. Food took an hour and 15 minutes to arrive in the Wednesday. Hangar steak was cut up and looked like it had been pre chewed. Flavour was great, sadly it was very cold as well as the fries. French onion soup was great. Veal tomahawk was very cold. Overall very disappointing we asked to speak with a manager a few times and after the meal they gave us a card and asked us to email. Would not go back and would not recommend it to any friends or family."}
{"text":"I was wondering why this place was so talked about but couldn't get a solid 4 star rating. Then I went and experienced it for myself.   The food would have been passable is the service was at least mediocre. Just horrible at the basics of customer service. Regular check ins, water refill attentiveness etc."}
{"text":"Hello review seekers!  Let me tell you a little about my experience at this wonderfully chic dining venue.   First of all, fantastically located. I love the distillery district. It's got a nice old school vibe to it similar to Gas Town in Vancouver. There are plenty of bars and restaurant venues here to wander into and check out should you happen to desire a bar crawl! If you do a bar crawl, I would save Cluny for last because their patisserie has really fantastic dessert/dinner crepes that make for a nice late night snack. I mean you could also choose to finish with Cluny because you might feel a bit more classy ending a night of drunken debauchery in a super classy joint that could make even the messiest blackout drunk feel fancy, but I won't question your motives. I do know that Toronto women in particular care more about their après-alcohol feasts than they do the rest of their evening so I feel it's important to note the patisserie. Nutella banana crepes. Nutella.....Banana....Crepes....Nutella.Banana.Crepes.   Second, I love sweet wines and they have a fab selection of rosé, riesling, and gewurztraminer.   I think that's all I have to say. I guess it's pretty clear I didn't eat in the restaurant and just drank at the bar and wandered next door for dessert at some point. On that note, there are some well dressed men here and they will chat with you in a manner differently than say Sneaky Dees, which is always nice."}
{"text":"The venue is spectacular!  The food, however, has suffered over the years; however, they do have consistent hits!  I would recommend their Moroccan chicken and, if you're adventurous, the frogs legs!  Been their for brunch as well, and it was nothing spectacular.   I think what makes this place memorable are their attentive, beautiful looking staff and the place itself!  Bathrooms are gorgeous!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5, not 4.  But I will be nice since it's fairly new.   So.  I was really prepared to love this resto.. I remember seeing raving reviews from a few foodie friends that went and getting hyped about trying the items on their menu.  However, I was ill-prepared in doing my homework for which dishes to order, which led to a couple bad choices on our part.  Small Plates -TABLE SIDE WELLINGTON COUNTY BEEF TARTAR I mean.. I like it, I just don't love it.  It had a tangy kick similar to the horse tartar I had at Black Hoof, but the seasoning wasn't all there and while I enjoyed the first few bites, I kind of got bored half way through.  The bread it came with complemented the dish well, but.. it was alright.   -FRENCH ONION SOUP I didn't pick this one; but we both thought this was a bit too salty... Duncan House's French onion soup blew this one out of the waters and I honestly couldn't have any more after two spoonfuls.  Too much salt, the cheese couldn't even be the saving grace.. nor could the lovely bread.    Large Plates HUNTER'S \"STEW\" - Rabbit, pheasant sausage, beef cheek, whole mustard sauce God I loved the pheasant sausage.  I thought it would taste like chicken.. but nope.  It The mustard sauce complimented the protein so perfectly, and while I wasn't a huge fan of the veggie medley in the stew, the sausage made the dish for me.  Rabbit meat also had a more distinctive taste than the last time I had it at Luma.  Recommended!  DRUNKEN TUNA - Seared ahi, red pepper pesto, pomme purée, rocket salad, sherry vinaigrette The tuna was done medium rare - on the rarer side.  I thought it was really flavourful but the birthday boy I came with thought it was a little salty.  To each their own but this was recommended to us by the waiter and I really liked the red pepper pesto on the side as well when I dipped the tuna in it :)  YUM.  Dessert MACARON ICE CREAM SANDWICHES Honestly just ordered this one so I could have a birthday message for the birthday boy.  It was really nice that when I included my request in my reservation in Open Table, they remembered and spelt on a message with chocolate & added a candle and everything!  I hear they give complimentary desserts to birthday guests anyway.  The dessert itself.. well, I had better macarons for sure.  The ice cream and sorbet were delish (raspberry sorbet, bailey's ice cream, and vanilla) - but the macarons were a little disappointing.  Overall, the ambiance was fantastic and makes the resto very fit for a special occasion.  Especially around the holiday times when the Christmas Market is going on and everything in the distillery is absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with friendly and sweet service. It had beautiful decor with good lighting. I ordered the eggs benedict and a lemonade. The fries were finely sliced and the bread was fresh. However the food was not filling and I felt like I ate nothing. Would come back here but try some other dish"}
{"text":"On a recommendation from a friend, we ended up here for a late breakfast while enjoying the Christmas market.   There were five of us, including a three year and it was freezing outside. We got there at roughly 10:30 and there was a huge lineup. Apparently they had just opened so we were told 20-25 minutes and that they would send us a text.   We walked around. Enjoyed a couple of tantrums and then got back to the resto. At about the 40 minute mark we were led to our seat and ended up in the bar area.   The omelette selection is apparently pretty rigid. There is the one of the day and one other one. They are not big on substitutions. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and a farmers platter. The sandwich was very good. The farmers platter was good although not as good as I was expecting for $25.   One plus is that they have their own bakery and bake their own breads, etc.  We did ask for another bread basket but it mysteriously never showed up!    My cappuccino was made with almond milk, which I am glad they had and was decent.   The servers were all fine. No issues there.   The decor makes you feel like if you were in some cosmopolitan European city. I'll go with Paris.   So overall, a decent spot. Perhaps a little pricey for what you get.  It was a little hectic when we were there. I think we may try this place again when it is not crazy packed."}
{"text":"We had the sesame asparagus, baked cheese with mushroom and salmon tartar. Everything tasted good and had good portion sizes. The salmon tartar was one of the best things I've ever eaten, light and full of flavour. The cheese was good but expensive and the asparagus were alright but cheap. I would go again but would make sure to make a reservation as we ended up eating at the bar."}
{"text":"Visited on June 1st. Excellent service by Alison.  Had the bone marrow and frogs legs.  Classical flavours with modernist presentation."}
{"text":"First off, the pros of dining here: No doubt that Cluny is a beautiful restaurant with so many details to look at from the light fixtures to the amazing décor in every corner to the overall Parisian feel of the place. It's just as beautiful a space as the pictures you see online. The fact that it's in the chic Distillery District also adds to its allure.  My friends and I came during Summerlicious to try their $23 lunch menu and all six of us liked how there were several great choices for appetizers, entrees and desserts. It was honestly hard to pick because they all sounded delicious! I ended up getting the asparagus frites for my appetizer, which was crispy to my liking and okay in taste. Meanwhile, my husband and two of our friends got the seafood chowder, which they said was alright. The two friends who got the salad said it was tasty overall. For mains, most of us got the steak which came with thinly sliced fries. I think it's safe to stay that those of us who ordered the steak frites were satisfied with the portion and it was okay in terms of taste. One of my friends got the arctic char and he enjoyed it. For dessert, three of us got the pistachio macaron with mango sorbet, which was beautifully presented and tasted decent - wish there was slightly more of it though! My husband got a good portion of cassis sorbet, which tasted alright but he wished he had gotten the other chocolaty dessert. All in all, we thought that our lunch here was good value for what we paid and the atmosphere is just really nice.  I want to emphasize that I really wish Cluny well since it has some good things going for it but there are a few areas for improvement:  -It seemed to take a long time between when each course arrived. It seemed to be about 30-40 minutes from the time that plates were collected from the last course? I'm thinking it was likely due to it being Summerlicious and it being the weekend in general.  -The food tasted just okay. I wouldn't say that any of the dishes were amazing though. Some of them could have been more flavourful but that's my personal opinion.  -Service could be more consistent among staff. Our server seemed to be in a bit of a mood throughout our entire dining experience. I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was because the restaurant was busy for 2 p.m. on a Saturday and not sure if they were short staffed but we found it hard to track him down during our lunch. The occasional time we were able to find him to ask him for something, he looked at us, then literally brought what was asked and walked away. He just seemed very annoyed to be there. When the mains arrived, I asked him if my steak could be done a bit more as I really did ask for mine to be well done when he had taken everyone's orders earlier. He sharply insisted that my steak was already well done. I started to say that there were several slices that were pink (it was medium) but he had already grabbed my plate, turned around and quickly walked away with it... not sure what to make of that behaviour. After about 25 minutes later when almost everyone was done eating, one of my friends asked a different server who happened to pass by if he could check on my steak and he came back within minutes to say that it was finishing up. This second staff member ended up bringing it over about ten minutes later and sincerely apologized for the wait. When we saw our original server at the end of our meal and we were ready to pay, he didn't talk to us as we were paying or as we were leaving. I guess service is a hit or miss depending on the server.  Regardless of some of the details above, I would definitely be open to trying Cluny again in the future. I would probably try the regular menu instead next time and avoid going on a weekend to see if the dining experience would be better."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a meal with friends or family. Came here with 8 people.  Service was good. Staff were on their game.   Food selection was nice and so was the wine.  Looks like they have upgraded the menu in the past year or so.  They have a kids menu now.  The only lost star here was the burgers in the Frenchie were cooked differently. One pattie was well done while the other was medium.   Not unreasonable for a stop in the distillery district."}
{"text":"We went there for Winterlicious....You'd think they would give you good food so you would come back...  I hate Kale caesar salad REALLY?? how's that french!!!! Vegeation tagine MEH, boring bland, now we have african food. alright... Dessert ..profiterales. OMG OMG AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! LIKE OMG !!!!!!  Partner had calamari he said worst he's ever had.  main beef cheeks they were ok Desser profiterales OMG OMG AMAZING  Server was too casual and didn't know too much."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday dinner. This has become one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. First of all, I didn't know that such a beautiful gem was hidden in distillery. I can't believe I haven't been here sooner. It's a french style restaurant with beautiful decor and food that makes you want to Instagram everything. There's an amazing bread station in the centre of the restaurant. We dared order rich and heavy foods because you only live once. Our top two favourites were HANDS DOWN the BRAISED BEEF & ROAST Mushroom poutine, and the wonderfully melted cheesy baked sauvagine for two (stuffed with mushroom and truffle paste). This is probably the best poutine I've had as far as I can remember. The flavours build and hit your taste buds like an explosion. Ahh. Craving it the moment I left.   We also ordered the baked lobster bisque and the duck confit pie that came with a giant bone marrow in the centre.   We probably wouldn't order the lobster bisque and the cotton candy dessert (milk chocolate pot de creme). The dessert didn't taste very good lol and the lobster bisque (though good) just wasn't on par with the other dishes.   Service was quite slow but our server went out of her way to make our experience better."}
{"text":"I am immediately impressed by the decor and ambience of this place.  It has lots of natural sunlight and has the perfect feel for a brunch, very French.  I've had brunch here two times and both times I found the service to be very snotty.  On the most recent visit, one of my friends joked that they also had the attitude of the French to go with the decor.    On my first visit, I didn't take too much notice of how rude and curt our waitress was, especially when we asked about how the pricing worked for the pastry bar (yes there's a pastry bar).  She kind of talked down to us explaining that it has to be paid for - obviously, we weren't assuming that it was free!  During the second visit it was my friends who really pointed out that the service is shit.  Our server ignored us and turned her back on us as we made requests.  When I ordered the steak and eggs, she acted like I was being a nuisance when I asked for my steak medium rare and my eggs over easy.  At the every end when we were splitting the bill amongst 3 credit cards, she thought it was amusing to call us by the colour of our credit cards.  Imagine the waitress just waving around your credit card and saying \"AND THE BLUE CARD\", and \"NOW THE ORANGE CARD\".  It was extremely unprofessional and not impressive at the least.  My friends comment that the waitresses all seem dead.  Maybe they are overworked and underpaid, I cannot assume their situation, but I can concur with my friends that the service really is shit.  The food is just okay.  Both times we went for brunch. I had the chilled layered crab salad the first time, which was interesting but I wasn't crazy about it.  Steak and eggs the second time was good.  Although 3 of us had a side of frites, they were all a little different and sadly one of my friends had stale frites.  I was planning to do a birthday dinner here, but luckily I didn't.  This place is totally overrated."}
{"text":"When in Cluny, eat like the French?    Want take-out?  Not a problem.  They have a cute little cafe in the front.  But if you'd like to sit and dine in their grandiose well-decorated space (like Louis XIV-Marie Antoinette kinda grandness), you're also more than welcome to as well.  So, really, it's a patisserie/boulangerie/bistro all in one.   Pretty cool right?  Love it!  When dining in, you will probably be too busy glancing around all the little beautiful details around the restaurant to even notice whether the food serve to you is even up to par or not.    But as distracted as I was, I couldn't help but notice my crab cake egg benedict was a little over-salted.  Their skinny frenchie french fries was amaahzing though, so that made up for it.   Pear nectar juice served in a cup was not fresh.   Could tell they served it out of a bottle.  $6 for a teeny wine glass.  That was definitely overrated.     The restaurant is so big that it was pretty obvious that they were understaffed.  (i.e. not enough waiters to serve all the tables).  They were less than half full and we still had to wait 15 minutes for a table for two. They should definitely work on that.    Still, I enjoyed my visit very much and will be coming back to try their other dishes.     Sigh...  Still thinking about the beauty of this place.  It was beautiful, yes indeed.   *starry eyes*"}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance is the real charmer of this restaurant. Located in the Distillery District, I like coming here to feel a little fancier than my usual casual self. The food was good too. I'd come here for a business function, date, or family occasion. In particular, I'd come here for brunch!   Only annoying having to pay for parking, but that's the downtown life."}
{"text":"We came for meal a long time ago, but this is our first time stopping by at the bakery patisserie section. There are some nice random finds like hazelnut oil and almond oil, although I would not know what to do with it if I buy it!   The patisserie section have a bunch of adorable looking cute cakes and pies. The key lime pie is the cutest looking! Thought the label is edible, but found out that it's not edible after taking a bite!  There's two small benches inside, so you can sit down and enjoy your treats!"}
{"text":"Beautiful space, good location for  family/friends who want to have brunch while spending the morning/day in distillery- food was terribly mediocre. Would NOT recommend planning a birthday there. Service was so slow, our reservation from 1 pm turned into finally placing our order at 2 pm - even though we were sat on time, we could not get service until 1 hour later. we would have left except it was a 10 person table- for the request of a  birthday.    The menu was dark (a lot of cooked brown foods) and really ordinary  and predictable items- the usual steak frites, eggs bennedict, yogurt and berries (yawn).  I ordered  a pretty good looking  caesar salad that was really unexciting but about the only thing I could imagine was  live and still nutrient rich. Aside from the baked breads, and the pretty interiors- this place was highly un-experiential and a rip off.   The bill is then split into several tabs and they have the nerve to charge a plating for a cake  when the average spend at the table is 30$ (times 10 seats)  I paid a little over $50 for the salad, a plating fee for the cake and a glass of prosecco- that I didn't order/ drink with a socially appropriate tip. - You'd think the hospitable thing to do is to extend the courtesy after making us wait- to waive the \"plating fee  \" but alas this was  insulting  cash grab at the end to top off the experience .This place needs to step up their service and come to the table with something less hollandaise and  equally excite the palate to match the restaurant's tasteful sense interior."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner on a Saturday night and sat at the oyster bar. Ordered the coq au vin poutine, the salmon ceviche and the octopus to share between myself and my girlfriend. Food was very good overall and the portions were bigger than expected. The overall fault of the night was the service - our server literally disappeared throughout most of the night, and we had to ask multiple times to have our water refilled. Took us a very long time to get the bill as we could not flag anyone down, restaurant seemed understaffed. The couple beside us seemed very frustrated as well, as they too waited roughly 10min for someone to get them the bill so they could pay and leave, not something you would expect from a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a group of friends. The restaurant and service were ok. I didn't think there was anything special about this place. Food of course was overpriced but I guess that's normal considering it's in the distillery district. My friends and I started with their pastry assortment which were delicious. Would definitely recommend as a starter, especially the chocolate croissant. For the main, I got the mushroom benedict which came with 3 eggs rather than you're traditional 2. It was good except it was way too salty. Service was average, nothing over the top or amazing. Overall it was ok but I don't have the urge to return. If you really want to try the place, I wouldn't say not to, but I also wouldn't plan around it either."}
{"text":"I really like not being cold, so Cluny tends to get my vote every time I dine in the Distillery District when it's not the hottest days of summer. The bread is fabulous, and might even upstage their main courses. That said, most of the food that I've ordered has been decent - it's just not ultra memorable.  I will keep choosing this place over several others nearby for the following reasons: - The splendid decor helps set the fancy brunch mood  - They have plenty of INDOOR seating for cold weather - The service is excellent and notably better than several other nearby restaurants - The fresh bread is superb"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved everything we are here!  We started with the frog legs which were crispy and flavourful.   I throughly enjoyed my pot-any-pho. Each bite filled with flavours dancing in my mouth.   I asked for GF bread and got my own little loaf which was freshly baked and I was able to enjoy my bread and butter as well (which is a rare treat for me and I always enjoy it when I can get it). Bonus: they don't discriminate by charging extra for this gf option.   Service was prompt and friendly. We were tended to on a regular basis.   The decor is very French with a modern twist to it. Is go back again when in Toronto.   Bon appétit!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Amazing bread! That's important to me. App- Split the beef bourguignon poutine and brussel salad w my wife. Poutine was a large portion and very good. Salad was AMAZING. Some kind of honey dressing w crunchy grains and soft fresh mozzarella cheese. Entree- Braised lamb leg in an asian style broth. Sounded interesting so I went for it. Very good. That said, the top of the chop that wasn't on the broth was luke warm. I know they can't braise to serve...but it should at least be hot. Others at my table had the burger which was massive and delicious. Hanger steak and frites was very solid too for a cheaper cut of steak. Veal meat ball tomahawk was just ok. Sauce tasted too tart from all the wine in it that almost tastes like they didn't cook it down enough. Kind of tacky jamming the bone into the meatball for the 'tomahawk'. Drinks took a while at first. Service was friendly and solid though! Fun spot!"}
{"text":"This review is for Winterlicious 2015, dinner at $35. I enjoyed my time at Cluny, our server was very friendly and relaxed, she did not rush us to finish our dinner, unlike some restaurants. Each dish arrived quickly and plates were cleared off promptly.  My friend's order:  -Pressed Chicken Terrine: it is quite delicious! While the chicken terrine itself did not have much flavor, the tomato jam gave the terrine a hint of sweetness, whereas the olives and picked beans provided a touch of sourness and brightened up the dish. The yellow and smooth hollandaise sauce rounded out the contrasting flavors and made the dish cohesive. This was a well composed appetizer and a great way to start the meal!  -Beer Braised Beef Cheeks: The beef cheek was cooked perfectly, it was very tender and succulent, the seasoning was spot on as well. The roasted brussel sprouts were a nice addition to the dish, and the horseradish added a nice, little touch of freshness to this \"meat-heavy\" dish. The barley gave the dish a hearty-comfort-food feel, a stew appropriate for the winter months in Toronto :).  -Roasted Hazelnut Profiterole: the profiterole itself was airy and light, delicious not overly sweet. The dark chocolate ganache was divine and the slight bitter taste helps to balance the sweetness of the profiteroles, a very well balanced dish. The hazelnut chantilly and bits of cookies (?) added some texture to the sauce, but it was not really needed in my opinion. If you enjoy dark chocolate, I highly recommend this dish!  My orders:  -Tomato and Saffron Braised Calamari: By braising, it allowed the calamari to soak up the broth, leaving the calamari very tender and juicy.  I don't think the fennel was needed as it didn't add any flavor to the dish, and I wish the broth had a bit more salt or spice, it was a bit under-seasoned for me. Nonetheless, the broth was perfect for dipping pieces of soft bread  -BBQ Steelhead Trout:  the fish was flaky and moist, the seasoning was spot on. The almond sauce seemed non-existent. The beans had no flavor, but the roasted carrot added a nice touch to the dish with their natural sweetness coming through. The salad also added some nice texture and was quite refreshing :).  -Lavender Blackcurrant Macaron: the lavender flavored macaron was very mild and the blackcurrant tasted like a concentrated blackberry flavor to me, not too sweet at all! I believe the ice cream was raspberry as it was a bit sour along with the coulis, but the sweetness from the meringue helped to cut down the sourness."}
{"text":"crepe was incredibly delicious. went to the bakery side during holiday market and since we've tried most of the holiday market foods, decided to wander in here.  love the decor when we first walked into the lobby area.  and the crepe was surprisingly good! especially relative to the poutine, turkey legs, sausages etc around at the time.  will return to try the other foods, including restaurant."}
{"text":"I like the decor of this place. The food here is whatever. Its not even really french? There are many things on this menu that you wouldn't find in france...(Tomahawk meatball?) The food is average or below and nothing really particularly good about this place.   Nope. would not recommend or come back."}
{"text":"Three of us came into the Cluny on short notice so hadn't read any reviews and had no expectations.  In fact, it may have been \"low\" expectations as most of the Distillery restaurants are grand decor venues with ok-to-good but not great food.  Long story short though, Cluny exceeded our expectations and we will likely come back.  The pros and cons:  The Cod fritters were very light and tasty, and a very generous serving. The potato dip was an odd pairing but it tasted okay. The French Onion soup and the Ox Tongue were excellent.  The former was a bit pricey but it did taste very good.  The Ox Tongue was a surprisingly large portion and really well flavoured. I haven't had souffle too many times in my life, but I thought the souffle + financier were divine.  Now the misses:  The sweetbreads were tasty but at 3 tiny pieces, came in at about $5 per piece!  What! The crunchy heirloom carrot sticks on the side were an absolute mystery. Heirloom carrots in general are lovely, but I didn't understand that pairing at all. And considering that all the other portions were so generous, the 3 measly sweetbreads were disproportionally small, almost like they forgot half the order. The beef tartar was really disappointing.  I have nothing to say about it except that they were chunks of chewy sinewy beef.    Lastly, the service was a semi-miss that night.  The servers were all friendly and polite, but they seemed a bit inexperienced.  For a restaurant that is trying so hard with everything else from the ambitious menu to the detailed decor, it's not okay to use inexperienced staff, young and polite as they are.  There were several times that the servers gathered and chatted casually as ONE of them was slicing and assembling a bread basket. The bread station is displayed like a room centrepiece so we're all watching them chat while handling the bread.  Chat in the back, no one can see you! I know the kitchen staff are talking over the food while they prepare it too, but it's something else to have to witness it. Actually in most open kitchens, I've only seen staff have quick exchanges or talk about their orders, not who they're meeting for drinks after work. It seemed somewhat unprofessional. With everything else going for it, I'd expect the service to be a tad more sophisticated. Maybe it was just this night.  Oh, and the French pop music is cool but maybe just a bit too loud for dinner. It got a bit distracting and we found ourselves trying to speak over the music all night.   Overall though, we were impressed with the quality of the food and will not hesitate to come back to try other items on the menu. And the souffle and the bread basket ensured that we would definitely sample offerings at the boulangerie on another day!"}
{"text":"Had the French onion soup here. Pretty good soup however a little pricey. Good service, good vibe, great decor."}
{"text":"Ambience was great but thats the only good thing i can say about this place. I ordered the hot smoked salmon omelette and was really disappointed by it. It was very plain. Just omelette, cheese and salmon. As a result of that, the taste was just plain. If you come here pls stay away from the omelettes."}
{"text":"came into Clunys for drinks and appetizers. We were disappointed in the cheese platter that was offered at $13. With 2 waiters trying to explain the menu - each completely different. We were told we have to order 2 cheese platters for them to be able to plate it because 1 order means the plate would be empty and they will not serve it. so at $26 dollar (2 cheese boards) we hoped it was shareable between 2 people. 6 crackers , 1 fan of sliced apples , 3 pieces of preserved nuts and cheese later it was not very appealing for the confusion. With a dozen possible cheeses we were able to choose the 2 we were allowed on the board even though it was available.     The chili honey comb was very good.  The atmosphere was nice and beautiful for a date night.The  appetizers and coffees wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"I came here with my family when we visited Toronto for a night out filled with wine. We had great service here with our waiter making sure we had our glasses filled and plenty of bread for the table upon request. Two others decided to join us just for a drink and the wait staff had no issue with putting together a table to join us for 45 minutes. We started with the cheese plate which was great with the homemade bread. I don't remember much from the meal seeing it was a year ago but I had to make sure I did this place justice and threw some stars their way."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch but it's the first time I went with my hubby for dinner.  I like the dining room but it's large and can feel noisy. It was a full house on the Friday we were here.  For starters the baked sauvagine was excellent.  The crab and avocado tartinade was good but not as flavourful as the sauvagine.  For entrees we both had the tomahawk meatball with the gnocchi and it was yummy.  With a jug of sangria $140 + tip."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's Birthday. The restaurant itself is beautiful, I would come back just for the interior. We shared the asparagus fries, tuna tartar, French onion soup, Caesar salad, steak frites, seafood platter, the burger, and a couple of desserts. I would say most of the food was good, the only thing my friends and I didn't like was the steak, it was burnt. Also the service was slow and not that friendly. Overall I would recommend trying this restaurant:)"}
{"text":"Been to Cluny twice.  This bistro is very expensive but you are paying for Distillery District prices.  I ordered their French Onion soup..the cost of it is a price of an entree at some restaurants.  The soup was good but is extremely tiny.  I ordered the Turbot fish and the presentation looked very weak.  It looked as though someone vomited on the plate.  For a $30 plate, I was very disappointed.  Our bill was over $160 for an appy, entree and 1 glass of wine.  Due to the slow service we didn't want to stay for dessert which was unfortunate because it did look good.  I won't be coming back.  Could not justify the cost of this restaurant and the food very mediocre."}
{"text":"The food was incredible and portioned well to share. We ordered from both the small and large plate to share (sesame fried asparagus, duck poutine, brioche grilled cheese, and drunken tuna) and was too full for dessert BUT they have a separate bakery that does take out so we bought macaroons to go. The macaroons were simply amazing. Or drinks were on the sweeter side but that is a good thing as most drinks nowadays are too stiff and almost undrinkable.  The decor is upscale French but not stuffy - and it's got a modern hipster flair. The table breads were absolutely delicious (my favorite was the one with nuts in them). If the service was faster or if the servers were more attentive I would have given this place 5 stars but we had to ask for water and bread, ask for refills on our water, flag down our server to order, got the wrong dish brought to us and then had to wait the full prep and cook time for our ordered dish. It was almost a three hour meal with lots of waiting in between dishes. I would recommend this place to anyone who has been to Europe and experienced the three hour meals because I don't think most other people could tolerate the long wait. Please do go and try the bakery because it is worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing.  We came here for brunch and was seated very promptly for our rsvp.  The service was excellent n the food was delicious.  We have the crab cake benes n the eggs n bacon.  The bacon has this great smoky sweet flavor flavor the crab was fresh.  Both eggs were cooked  to perfection.  The only thing that was needed was a shaper knife to cut the English muffin but nothing to drop a star for."}
{"text":"I've come here twice for brunch on a Sunday and both times I thoroughly enjoy my experience! On my last visit I tried the pulled pork eggs Benny and it was fantastic! The only reason I'm not giving Cluny 5 stars is because I came back specifically for the Croque Madame to find it no longer on the menu! Bring it back! It was absolutely fantastic. #pleasebringitback"}
{"text":"Positive points : Ambiance (except the r&b ish music playlist !?), variety, quality Négative points : Service is careless and totally disorganized, also way overpriced."}
{"text":"Gorgeous Ambiance with the best French Food in town. Their French onion soup is to Die for along with their Brioche sandwich.. They have the most delicious cafe within their restaurant which has the best croissant in Toronto \"the chocolate rum croissant.\" Yes it has RUM in it!! It is pricey, but it's worth every penny of it!!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have dined at Cluny, and I am very happy to say that the offerings here have improved with the recent arrival of their new executive chef Murray McDonald.  Being at The Distillery district, it is understandable that some people would think the prices are a bit inflated. Even so, I would argue that it is not by much. True, the food here is pricey compared to what you get at Mill St Brewpub just right next door, but you get what you pay for and the food is at a totally different caliber.   The decor here is extremely gorgeous, with a large outdoor patio, cosy bar area and a large dining room with a seafood station and a bread station.  For our visit, we had a large seafood platter - with whole lobster, a cluster of snow crab legs, oysters, mussels, clams, a plate of diced salmon with guacamole and escargot. It was definitely the star of our dinner there given how large and impressive this platter was. There was even dry ice in the middle and we were wonderfully entertained by the smoke that came out when water was poured down into it.  The bone marrow starter was wonderfully different than others I have had given that it was topped with escargot and was extremely tasty.   The goat cheese and fig was simply delicious and I would highly recommend it.  The Peruvian ceviche was a delight and colourful to look at, but was a slight miss given that it was perhaps a tad over-salted.   The gazpacho was light, refreshing and a get way to get your appetite going.  We had the char broiled octopus as a shared main dish, which IMO was a steal at $27.50 with other places charging as much as $60 for a similar portion. It could be a tad more tender, but I enjoyed it a lot nonetheless.  For dessert, we had a chocolate bomb which is cracked in front of you revealing a mango/passionfruit sorbet inside, along with chocolate sauce mixed with berries and pop rocks. I thought the pop rocks made the dessert interesting, and it was definitely neat to watch the shell crack open. But unless you are a huge chocolate fan with a lot of diners with you, I would perhaps not order this given how large it is.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Cluny immensely, and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"What happened to the 5 star restaurant that I once raved about? My friends and I came here for lunch around 1:35pm and was told the wait is 45mins without a reso despite plenty of empty tables right in front of our eyes.  We walked out completely confused and in disbelief that we decided to call the restaurant and see if we can make a reso instead and they booked us in for 1:45pm. We walked back in and got seated only after the same hostess triple checked her screen. Interesting system they got going on here...  As for the food, when it first opened, the menu had more of a Parisian flare to it. Today, I looked at the menu and it has more of a Middle eastern flare to it.  I love all food but I was feeling more French today.  Since I'm already here, I mind as well just pick something. The kofta (sorta like a kebab) spoke to me. When I ask the waitress if it has cumin in it, she didn't know but will ask the chief. I told her I really don't like cumin so if it did, I will take the chicken carrot salad as my second choice. Moments later, she came back to advise there was cumin in the kofta so she ordered chicken salad for me.  When I took my first bite in the chicken, all I tasted was cumin.  To make matter even worst, the chicken was super dry.  My friend's salmon and steak frites were jus toj however, the beef tortier was delicious! Definitely the best dish on our table."}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious. I would say 3-3.5 stars.   The restaurant is located in the Distillery District. They have a nice big location for such a great neighbourhood, and a nice decor. The restaurant looks great. The tables are a tad close and someone near us was farting so that wasn't the most enjoyable thing. I didn't dock any stars for that, my review is based solely on factors within the restaurant's control.   They serve a variety of bread, and some butter to start. It looks like they have a giant island devoted just to the presentation of bread and wine. Interesting!   The first course I got was the mushroom soup. It sounded really great on paper and had an interesting presentation. A small portion of mushrooms (possibly enoki) were marinated, possibly in a red wine vinegar or balsamic reduction. A cube of maple fudge was put on top. The soup was then poured on top of all that, and we were instructed to mix it well. I could see why, because even having mixed it for a solid 30 seconds, the fudge didn't get mixed in well enough, and near the end was a very sweet and mapley surprise. The soup itself wasn't too interesting in flavour but it wasn't bad.   The main course was the duck confit with sausage option. It came with some kinda pickle they called Quebec-style ketchup, which had whole tomato chunks. I thought it was ok. Not awesome but also not bad.   I would say that the desserts had the best flavour out of all the courses. I got the pear sorbet dessert. There were nice, savoury spice flavours like cinnamon, and other fall spices, and it was topped with an interesting pear preparation. It was nice and cozy for fall or winter. I also tried the chocolate lavender dessert. The chocolate was very rich (that's a good thing), and there was a berry flavour to it. It was very good. It said lavender, so I was hesitant to try it, but no overbearing lavender flavours, thankfully. The accompanying ice cream was kind of boring, though.   The service was friendly and efficient.   I would say the highlights are the atmosphere (if you're not near a farter or a loud diner), and the desserts. They had nice to-go cups for tea/coffee, so I imagine this would be a great spot to get a morning caffeine hit and a pastry.   I would like to try the brunch menu sometime as the breakfast photos of other contributors look delicious. I would also like to try the non-licious dinner menu, as I am reluctant to think that they put their best foot forward with Winterlicious."}
{"text":"Our menus had OLD food all over them. Wipe off your menus people! SHEESH. You can't pretend to be fancy and then right as I open the menu there is all this food matter on every page. Okay so I try not to judge too harshly on \"restaurant-week\" type things such as Summerlicious. I always tip well no matter my experience during these events.   I didn't even go here specifically for that Summerlicious thing, but nothing else on the menu stuck out to me. What did stick out was the mediocre experience. We went here with a plan to get whatever we wanted and celebrate a professional accomplishment of mine. Think throwing dollas at the club. But alas. The drinks were very watered down. This place had the weakest Long Island Iced Tea I've ever had!! So when the server *finallyyyy* came back around, I asked for a beer for the next drink. Instead he brought me another seemingly virgin Long Island. This was annoying but I knew it would take another 20 minutes for him to fix so I said nothing. Our food was...whatever. Even with the small portion I didn't feel the need to finish my plate. We did the drink pairing for another $20 each and the wine tasted like my sorority days- out of a box. The drink pairing was not worth it in my opinion. Overall I would never come back to this place for any reasons (mebe brunch? but doubtful). The establishments nearby seemed to have happier customers. I would not recommend this place to others. You can only really drink here if you are able to drink beer (fills me up personally) or hard liquor (and even then, the Makers Mark shot that my partner ordered was the smallest friggin shot I've ever seen). I have noticed this trend at a lot of places I go out lately, maybe these places think they are saving money but we simply won't be back.   I am not a drinker.   If I come to your establishment and   (((drink my partner's beer (some) + 2 long islands + beer pairing + southerncomfort and orange juice pairing + wine = and I'm not even a little buzzy warm)))) WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU. Again, let me emphasize that I am not a drinker! but rather the type of date that it should be veryyy easy to get into the zone.   We left this place like whatever and wanting to get drinks somewhere else but then semi over the excitement that we went INTO the night with, because of this place, so we just went home.  We tipped well as the virgin drinks were not the fault of our server. But his service was still shi**y. I don't mind shi**y service at KFC but cmon now. THIS IS WHY SOME PLACES SHOULD NOT DO restaurant week type events. Because now me, someone that can afford to eat here and having drinks flow- and the $$$ with it, will never come back. Even if it's not restaurant week. Even if it's the only place open I wouldn't come back. He came to our table with the pairing drinks as I was taking the last bite of my dinner. He apologized but I didn't even care at that point because obviously he didn't. At two separate points our meal was interrupted by a server bringing out food or drinks that was for another table.   Lastly, it always bothers me when waiters come to the table and are like \"are you ready to order\" but then you see an older group of people come in and they get the whole speech on the specials and this and this. Like what do I look like? Do I need to slap your face with a hundo for you to take me seriously?!? Just because I'm young does not mean that I haven't worked hard for all dis in life. Whatever to this place.   *note: To be clear, \"throwin back dollas at a club\" analogy was made in reference to our mental state towards the financial expense of this dinner. As a celebration for years of hard work towards a specific goal. I re-read this and wanted to clarify, since a \"club\" atmosphere this place is not, and behaviorally we did not present as such."}
{"text":"Comfortable environment with a lot of open space and interesting decorations. A nice mix between fancy and casual, I think. Although French food is not necessarily my favorite, this wasn't bad at all. Wine selection was excellent, but pricey as you might imagine. Beef Wellington was really good. I personally think this is a great place for lunch in the Distillery District. Be sure to stop by the adjacent bakery to grab some macaroons."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere here. 6/5 stars for decor. I had a three cheese omelette it was good it came with a wedge salad. Had two fruity delicious cocktails. My boyfriend had the poutine and said it was good."}
{"text":"Very good place. They have very good quiches. Also good selection of wine. Remind us  good restaurant from France"}
{"text":"It was a good late lunch that only happened because most of the restaurants on tank house lane were closed for maintenance.  The carrot salad was very flavourful with pomegranate and dates.  Service was multi tasked but attentive."}
{"text":"The waitress (named Lauren) was very rude and condescending. We asked her politely if she would take a picture of our group at the table and she was a total snot and refused to take the picture. She obnoxiously told us she was too busy and had to take care of other tables. The time she wasted behaving like a condescending  snob, she could have easily and graciously taken the picture. I explained the situation to the manager and instead of recognizing that it was a horrible customer experience that he should avoid repeating, he started to defend Lauren and making excuses for her bad behavior and treatment of us. He quickly realized how he sounded and changed his tune to be more understanding. He didn't do anything about it though. I doubt he spoke to Lauren to correct her behavior, and he certainly made zero effort to make it right with us - his customers. It appears they don't care about how rude their staff is, or how bad the customer's experience is. It doesn't matter how great your food is or how beautiful your restaurant is, if your staff treats customers badly, then customers will not return. There are plenty of alternative great restaurants in Toronto so there's no need to put up with bad behavior. I would not recommend dining here."}
{"text":"First impressions may matter but there needs to be depth to keep your interest and coming back for more.  There's is much to admire about Cluny ... it can be a nice looking place and it's service is fast to serve the food.  The reason why I felt it didn't reach 4 stars is because the flavour is just ok.  The foyer area is open and shows a really nice dining area.  We arrived a bit early for our reservations and the dining room had a few open tables.  We were asked to wait so they can set the table ... sure don't mind.  When we were shown to our table ... it was the worst one in the middle of the main walking area and closest to the door.  Funny thing ... it was already set from the moment we arrived.  I'm not sure what the hostess was trying to do.  I ended up asking them to move us more inside and to a table that wasn't in the main walking area ... they did agreed and with no issues.  The entire time we dined, no one sat in the bad table.  The dining room is probably the most impressive thing about the restaurant... nice atmosphere,  interesting ceiling, and well spaced tables.  It was quite loud though ... it wasn't the music but more the room just reverb so many of the conversations.  As for the food, the most interesting thing I tried was the free olive and spiced (paprika?) bread.  My seafood stew wasn't too large but it was mainly watery.  I had no interest to dip more than one piece of bread into the stew as it had no flavour.  The shrimp, fish, mussels and clam we're all mild in flavour.  The striploin was cooked fairly well but similar to the stew... just ok.  Nothing especially flavourful.  The side order of peas and bacon was ok as well.  Overall, visually it's nice but the true substance of a great restaurant is the food and Cluny was just ok."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. I rarely give one star reviews but this restaurant does not merit anything more. My husband and I came here for brunch. He ordered their \"signature\" crab cake Benedict and I had the smoked salmon omelette with creme fraiche and caviar. We also each had French press coffee.  The crab cake was fishy and had pieces of shell in it. The omelette did not have any caviar and the creme fraiche was a watery mess. The French press coffee was so weak, it honestly tasted like dirty dish water. And on top of that, everything was really expensive.  The restaurant itself is a beautiful space, but I felt really ripped off after eating here. No bueno."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Cluny! Went on a Sunday evening for my birthday with a small group. Book a reservation for 730 and the table was ready right on time. Like everyone else wrote, the interior is stunning, everything from the plates to the ceiling is beautiful. Service was good, attentive and polite wait staff without being pesky. Got to try the french onion soup, beef tartare, open face salmon ravioli and filet mignon, all very good but a little on the salty side. I have to mention that the time from when we ordered to when we had the food at our table was very quick! Also liked how they had the bread station in the middle of the restaurant. Would love to come back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend - this was actually my second time coming for brunch.   Chilled Layered Crab Salad ($24) The bottom layer was avocado spread, next layer with quinoa mixed with raisins, then topped with cucumbers and crab, and finally topped with 2 crispy poached eggs. The ingredients were fresh, I liked how the crab salad was real crab meat. The poached eggs were more towards the cooked side and not runny, which was a bummer. I gotta say this salad was really good, really refreshing to have on a hot summer day - but probably something I could make on my own as well. Way overpriced I must say.  Pork Banh Mi Benedict ($20) Roasted pork on a grilled sourdough, topped with pickled carrots and turnips, and 2 poached eggs. There was a lot of meat so that was good. I didn't like how the sourdough bread - it has a hard crust which made it really hard to cut and eat it without all the ingredients on top falling apart. The pickled carrots and turnips did not go well with the eggs benny and hollandaise. The dish comes with fries - I love skinny fries and these were really crispy so that was good. But I presume they were old fries since they were double fried.  What really bothered me the most was the drinks. They had a special feature, strawberry guava juice for $6. Sounds great, made with fresh fruit so I ordered one. When it came, it was served in this tiny glass cup (similar to champagne glasses), but more importantly it was half full. I'm not drinking wine here, why are they not filling it to the top? What ticked me off the most was I saw them serve another table with the same drink but it was filled to the top - clearly they are inconsistent with their pouring skills. My boyfriend ordered a mimosa with peach juice, costed $16 and it was served in the same half full tiny glass as mine!!!!  This place is ok, but overpriced for sure."}
{"text":"Busy, touristy, hypee-place, a little bit overdone for me. I don't know about the restaurant (I just hate when I am told that \"everything is reserved\" as it cannot be true because there always is someone who does not show up).  Croissants are brioche type, that is to say not good croissants. Forget about them, really, and stop citing these croissants in pseudo top 10 list of croissants in Toronto!! I did not even finish them (I bought two, and stopped after the first half one...).  However, pains au chocolat, almond croissants are OK, much more crusty and tasty, and rose water \"croissants\" are original.  Globally expensive (more than 3 CAD for each croissants and pastries up to 6.50 CAD)."}
{"text":"Incredible!   Unique atmosphere that is fun yet sophisticated. Service is excellent. The steak frites is quite tasty, and the overall experience was 5 stars. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal in the distillery district!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute with such a nice atmosphere! The food was great. Had the onion soup and it was amazing. The king fish ceviche was so good and the lobster bisque was great. The service was great and hey had a variety of bread which was awesome! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really cute french bistro style restaurant. Right in the bustling Distillery District, this is a really happening area and it was nice to find something a little bit quieter to have a quick drink and appetizer. We shared the slated cod doughnuts and beef tartar which was prepared tabled side with quail eggs. A really interesting experience, food and wine was great, service could have been more attentive, and the cocktails were mediocre at best. Go for the food and to try something new!"}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere, bad staff. The Boulangerie is lovely but the staff are young, inexperienced 'shufflers'. Not a clue. Out of Sugar, out of lids, out of cream on a Saturday but awaiting the shipment? Why not pop to the store and grab some cream? Just a thought. No insight and clearly 'just a job' for them."}
{"text":"Showed up for brunch without a reservation but managed to get a great table in the bar section. Service was impeccable, food was great, atmosphere can't be beat. They have thought of everything - even the place settings are gorgeous! I will definitely come here again (and will try to reserve so that we may have a spot in the stunning dinning room)."}
{"text":"Surrounded by historical buildings this restaurant is located in the Distillery District This beautiful and  spacious French restaurant offers delicious food and incredible service to the customers. Freshly baked bread is displayed in the middle of the restaurant so you see and try the bread of your choice. The fried frog legs was delicious! One of the best meatballs I have ever had is the \"tomahawk \" meatball with the bone! The tuna steak sandwich was wonderfully fresh and flavorful. The server were so friendly and professional. She would always stop by to check how we are doing. Highly recommend to everyone !"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The decor is beautiful, as are the fancy plates.  I have been here a few times for lunch and dinner, but today was my first brunch visit.   Everything was excellent.  The omelette was perfectly cooked, the salad crisp and refreshing.   The fresh bread basket accommodated my love of gluten and my guest's allergy and the house made Seville Marmalade was delightful."}
{"text":"Great ambience. The space is gorgeous if you are one to appreciate all the beautiful details. They use beautiful cutlery the bar is well done an from floor to ceiling the space is beautiful!  We went for brunch My fiancé got the steak and eggs and I got the carrot marakesh salad with chicken no complaints can't wait to go again :)"}
{"text":"I love French food, so when a friend of mine wanted to do her birthday dinner here, excitement ensued.  The decor is very pretty - old-fashioned Parisian salon, with a bread-cutting station in the middle of the dining room. The restaurant is located right smack dab in the Distillery district, so makes for a romantic little walk too.  The food. Oh god, the food. First, we ordered the Tasting of Cluny ($13 per person). This has   BBQ sweetbreads, crisp fried frog legs and the chef's daily selection, which was seared tuna with pesto. Lacklustre, verging on inedible...The frog legs and the sweetbreads were both doused in this \"bbq\" sauce that more closely resembled Frank's Red Hot sauce and was, confusingly, way too spicy. It didn't complement either food. The frog legs were just MEH and were certainly not crispy. The seared tuna received an unanimous opinion...\"...is this canned?\"   Anyways, for the mains, the BF ordered the Seafood Shore lunch ($25.90), which was essentially deep fried seafood (mussels, white fish, oysters) with fries. It was just ok, nothing spectacular and not outstandingly fresh. I ordered the Cacoa nib crusted terrine of Quebec Foie Gras. This was the highlight, but came with no brioche or toast points for the terrine. Of course, the bread station and gracious server fixed this, but it was not a well thought out dish. And it came with 3 chocolate macarons....(????) Taste good, but I stand confused.  Our friends ordered the Pot Au \"Pho\" ($24.90) and Roasted chicken. No comments from my friends on what they thought of it. They did give a glowing review of the Melted Gruyere ($15.90), the french onion soup.   Overall, I'd say half a star for the decor. Half a star for the foie gras terrine dish. A full star for the service, which was top notch, and very gracious. Even when they mistakenly gave me a foie gras side dish for my main, rather than the foie gras appetizer dish, they gave us the foie gras side on the house as apology for the mix-up. Very classy. But no...I wouldn't recommend to those who love food."}
{"text":"Wonderful bakery and the restaurant is on point. Not only do they put a terrific French twist on a lot of great dishes,  but they also have the BEST Cocktails in the distillery district. I'd even go to say they have some of the better cocktails in the city."}
{"text":"Have been multiple times for dinner, brunch and winter/summer-licious.  Love this place! The interior and dinner wear is gorgeous, you feel like you've stepped into a Parisian Cafe, and always amazing service at Cluny. The staff are very attentive and friendly and never pushy nor do they rush you out. Plus there is parking in the distillery which always makes life easier and they take resos. A great place for a special event or to bring guests or a special date.   My all time fav is the french onion soup. Must try.  All other menu items are great, with the exception of a few misses, but nothing is ever inedible.   To get to 5 stars, I wish they had a bit more menu variety. Have had some not as thrilling  dishes (ie the bahn mi benedict wasn't that good), and is a tad overpriced for some items. Also, the last two times I got bread at the bakery it ended up being so stale and hard it was not edible :( But the good definitely outweighs the bad and other than these small misses it's a great place that I will keep returning to :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere on the patio, weather was great when we passed through! Beautiful flower arrangements and fun seating, though the food was okay--not bad for a touristy place.  We ordered the tuna burger, seafood stew and the lobster Poutine. The tuna was cooked well, came with an egg and fries. The stew was okay, as well as the Poutine--a little heavy for my taste. The lobster Poutine came with curds and shishito peppers."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 5 stars Food - 3 stars Value for Food - 2 Stars  Overall - 3 Stars  Know that if you are here to enjoy the cute restaurant (and the fresh breads), then read no further. But if you want to get good value for what you pay for in terms of the food, you will likely be disappointed, as I was. Even on looking at the menu, it didn't seem too exciting, but if they can execute well, then by all means...but that wasn't really the case. The fries were pretty good, but it practically overflowed on my plate, so needless to say I didn't want any more half way through. The food wasn't terrible, but for the price they charged and the expectations set from the pretty décor, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Late entry but my friend and I came here during Winterlicious 2017. The interior design is great for catching up with friends or having a date with your partner. The food here is delicious. The dessert was unique. However, the salmon fillet was a little over cooked and charred. The service was friendly. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The bread display made me decide on my breakfast.  House made baguette.  Mmmmm carbs.  I also changed my order from fried eggs to poached eggs.  Despite the name of the dish being fried egg on baguette, it was also served with bacon, braised cannelloni beans and frites.  I loved every bit of it.  The cannelloni beans were stewed with some tomatoes, the acidity cut down on some of the grease from the rest of the meal.  There was so much food that I unfortunately wasn't able to finish!   The hubby's wagyu haché was so good.  The waygu wasn't a steak of anything, but was more like a hamburger patty or meatloaf. This was served with 2 eggs, stewed tomatoes, frites and aioli.  The aioli was to die for.  And I rarely say that.  I couldn't stop eating the aioli.  I ate it with everything hoping that I wouldn't run out.  My friends at the table were the same, eating the aioli with everything.  People that didn't have aioli come with their food, stole from someone that had aioli."}
{"text":"Food is presented and prepared creatively and is tasty! The place itself beautiful. The weak spot, service. I ate in the bar area, where there simply should have been more servers/staff. Things devolved from from poor to bad as the night went on. Sadly, my comments to a manager were met with a tepid, cool response."}
{"text":"This is my first time to Cluny. The service was slow so slow, waiter seldom cared about the customers. We ordered steak for main course, steak was fine but the fries were not so good. Will not go again."}
{"text":"This review of Cluny Bistro is based on my Winterlicious 2018 experience.  I love that Cluny Bistro has a wine pairing at $20 for the 3 courses ($43). This offerings really pushed the rating to a 4 star.  Food was tasty. I love everything I ordered!   Or just maybe, the pre dinner cocktail and the glasses of wine just put me in a good mood?  Our waiter was fast, efficient and engaging!   One of my better Winterlicious experience in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Expensive and limited lunch menu but we had a good time. Great atmosphere, great bathrooms too! Would like to go back just for dessert and drinks/coffee."}
{"text":"A very belated review because I last ate here some time in the summer, so my memory of some of the details might be a little fuzzy. However, I do remember this as being one of my favourite/best dining experiences this summer, so that has to count for something. Despite not feeling super French food-wise (I mean... my lamb dish seemed rather Mediterranean-inspired), everything was delicious. For apps, we indulged ourselves in meaty goodness with the beef bourguignon poutine, table side wellington county beef tartar, and duck rillette & foie gras macarons. All of them were FABULOUS. The beef bourguignon poutine was maybe the least exciting, but it was still very cheesy, meaty, flavourful and enjoyable despite the fact that the fries used were of the thinner variety (I usually prefer thicker fries in my poutine.) The beef tartar was very moist, maybe not quite as flavourful (less spices although they had salt you could sprinkle on the top) as the tartar at other places, but I thought was fine. The duck rillette was a pretty standout dish for me though, because it combined two things I LOVE, mainly foie gras and macarons. It seems like it would be weird, but the slight salty and sweet mixture worked well and was supplemented by the little shot of strawberry rhubarb smoothie and glazed cherries or whatever on the side.   After being pleasured by our meaty apps, we moved on to our main dishes, which involved... a lot more meat (clearly the theme of the night.) Our spread for the evening included the braised lamb shoulder, two steaks (I believe both were filet mignons or else one was a hangar steak), and the truffled wagyu hache. Surprisingly for a non-steakhouse, Cluny does steak DAMN well, because both steaks were cooked to perfection... SO tender and juicy and not a single bit past medium rare as requested. The wagyu hache was a bit... different, by no means a bad dish, but it was kind of like a ground patty, so kind of threw us all off. It wasn't dry, it was well seasoned, but it just didn't have the same kind of oomph as a slab of steak. The lamb shoulder was what I ordered, and the dish was filled with apricot, tomato, green olive, preserved lemon, and chermoula. I mean it was absolutely superb, the meat was so moist and soft and just fell off the bone, and there were so many different flavours in there what with the sweetness from the apricot and some spices and I think there were also some sliced almonds in there. The only thing for me was that all the chermoula got to be a little bit too much (too heavy on the carbs), but overall it was great. Special shoutout goes to the fries that came with all the steak/beef dishes because they were AMAZING. Like thin and kind of crispy... like a better version of McDonald's fries. Don't even judge me, because they were honestly like crack... crack fries all the way, could not stop eating them.  Removed a star because the service wasn't amazing, at least not at the same level as the food. All the servers were very pleasant, but at least at the very beginning we were kind of ignored as they rushed around us tending to other tables... to the point where we were all SO HANGRY and just desperately wanted to order our food. In the end, they were apologetic and also gave us dessert on the house (cream puffs) for the birthday girl, so it wasn't all bad, but did kind of mar what could have honestly been a perfect evening.  I would definitely recommend Cluny's for any occasion though - birthdays, anniversaries, dates, whatever. The restaurant is gorgeous and located in the lovely Distillery District so you really can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"C'est magnifique!  Seriously, this is the best French restaurant in Toronto and my overall favourite date spot in the city. We've been visiting regularly since its pre-opening event last year... I even proposed to my now-fianceé outside of the restaurant after enjoying a romantic dinner there!  From the moment you walk in, you're surrounded by the rich ambiance and Parisian-inspired decor. Cluny nails everything from beer and wine selection to the music and the staff uniforms, but it's the food that inspires the most praise.  If you're looking for French cuisine, Cluny has everything from Escargot to the most amazing French Onion Soup you can find west of Québec. The tableside Wellington Beef Tartare is incredible, as are any dishes involving cheese, but my favourite large plate has to be the Veal Meatball Tomahawk which comes with a beautiful side gnocchi. If you're with a group, I'd recommend sharing plates so you can samples a few items from the menu each!  Service is fantastic and prices are (surprisingly) very reasonable. For the adventurous, I recommend trying the Absinthe Fountain ($8 pp) with your group as a digestif - very fun.  Next time you're wandering through the Distillery District, pop into Cluny's Boulangerie for some delicious bread or pastries - I highly recommend the olive bread."}
{"text":"Cluny is beautiful. The restaurant seems to care about presentation and atmosphere, but sadly I don't think the price is justified when it comes down to flavour... to be honest, it could be what my girlfriend and I ordered. We don't typically hover towards prix-fix menus, but we did on valentine's day since the seafood platter and fish sounded so enticing. They looked great, had wonderful aroma, but flavour fell flat more than once. Lastly, we had warned about our table's nut allergy and we asked if we could swap the dessert in the fixed menu to anything without nuts. We had mentioned that nuts could kill my girlfriend. This was overlooked, and the chef came out with the beautiful looking dessert and poured pistachio cream over top. I immediately told him there was an error and they cooperated. We waited about 15 minutes for them to fire up the dessert we ordered. The dessert was very good. Outside of that hiccup, the service was great."}
{"text":"This was a delightful surprise in the thick of the Toronto Christmas Market (distillery district) area! While it seems like they are known for their sweet and baked goods, we had the pleasure of dining at Cluny on a busy Sunday night.  We stumbled upon Cluny as it was comfortably nestled in a corner away from the crowds. Upon first greeting, the hostess told us the wait might be extremely long because of the Market. However, after speaking with the manager, they somehow decided to open up a private dining area at the back for us, which shortened our wait by more than half and gave us a real \"private dining\" experience! To be honest, we're still not sure why they decided to do that (but we're not complaining).  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and cocktails, and recommended some drinks and daily specials. I couldn't wait to take a big sip of my White Wine Sangria, to which I have no complains.  To start, we ordered the French Onion Soup with perfectly melted guyere cheese. The flavours were impeccable! I only wish there was a crunchy element to the soup, like croutons or a crostini on the side.   Next, we had the Pan-Seared Quebec Foie Gras on a sort of french toast with blackcurrants to cut the fattiness. The Foie Gras was melt-in-your-mouth and full of flavour, but I do think the toast could have been smaller and there could have been more of a sauce. This was also a slightly sweet dish, and our waiter did mention some order it as a dessert vs. a savoury appetizer.  For mains, I had the Provencal Seafood Stew. This came in a cute wooden plank with a small iron pot and side of chili mayo. The seafood was fresh, but the real star of this dish was the stock. Absolutely delicious tomato flavour, but not thick, just a liquidy seafood broth that I could have every. single. day.   One of my friends ordered the Lamb 2 Ways, which he said was delicious as well. The lamb looked soft and tender, and was cooked perfectly. I knew he wasn't lying when there wasn't a morsel of food left on his plate.  Another friend ordered the Grilled Octopus. This one fell a little flat - while cooked nicely, the octopus lacked flavour and could have really used a bold sauce to enhance the flavour. It was also sitting on a bed of mashed potatoes, which was an odd combination.  We had to skip dessert because we were so full from our meal (and we had to leave some room for Market snacks!) but overall we were very pleasantly surprised by our accidental finding. I would give both 4 stars for food and service for this excellent meal, and will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely beautiful. The decor is nice and ornate and it felt like I walked into a victorian manor for dinner. Also reminds me of Collette.  The food was good and on par with a higher-scale place like this. That being said it is on the pricier end. I would not doubt the skills of the chef on any of their menu items.  The apps on the menu are more or less traditional and common. The mains get a little more creative. Sea bass was fresh, and this one of the few places that still serve a tuna burger. It was quite delicious except some of the sauces in the burger were overpowering the taste of the fish. Nevertheless the fish was fresh and was served med-rare to rare - I like it that way.  I would definitely come again, but wouldn't too often as 1) pricey and 2) it will lose it's novelty if I go too often. So, filing this one under the 'nice night out' section seems appropriate.  What a great place. Would recommend."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time to the restaurant, it got great atmosphere, great service. Every dish is worth trying. And after dinner you can take a walk in the Distillery to burn off some calories."}
{"text":"Though the food was delicious, the service was the most awful ever.   First of all, our waitress took forever to serve us water. Then when we were finally ready to order we waited over 40 minutes before she attended to us. And worse of all, she had the most horrible attitude because we asked why is the service slow?   Then when we waited over 50 minutes for our main entree, we spoke to the manager and he eventually served the food (which was obviously ready for meal service but waitress just didn't want to serve us). So basically her attitude went downhill the minute we mentioned about the slow service. Usually, when clients give you feedback you should accept it and learn how to overcome it rather than pout. Worse of all, the rest of the management team just did not deal with the issue and acted like we couldn't afford the meal or something.   I am usually not this negative but because of the really poor service and unprofessional way that they dealt with our feedback (which we spoke to staff calmly about and were not yelling nor being condescending) I have to make sure that others be warned of this. I'm not sure if it was an off day but the way they dealt with the feedback indicated to me this is a poorly run operations. Too bad because the food is good but I will not be returning nor recommending and will make sure I tell others of my unprofessional experience with this restaurant."}
{"text":"It was my birthday and my mom's friend suggested this restaurant to me. The moment I stepped through the doors, it automatically reminded me of my time in Paris. The decor of the room was absolutely phenomenal and there was even a bakery inside the restaurant which had Parisian baked goods.   We were served by a friendly girl who quickly directed us, a group of 7 to a large and spacious booth. She gave us our menus, answered our many questions and whisked away to bring us back bread. The waiters and waitresses had an island of freshly baked bread which they had to cut themselves. The range of different bread was endless as some had spice and others had fruit. It was not just your ordinary bread.  We needed up getting the salt cod donuts, roasted duck poutine, spicy salmon tartar and the potted pork creton as our appetizers. The dishes were flavourful and had the right amount of salt in them. I was surprised at how crunchy and tasty the cod donuts were as they weren't appealing on the menu. The potted pork creton is a must try as the sweetness of the apple & lemon balm jam complemented the apple bread and pork really well. The salmon tartar was okay, not much excitement or spice as I have tasted something similar back in BC. The duck poutine was okay, salty and fatty because of the duck fat but it was something different.   For our main, we had the veal meatball \"tomahawk\", lamb two ways, 6 oz filet mignon, drunken tuna and bbq'd mediterranean bass \"almandine\". I ordered the lamb because the menu said it was crusted in pistachios but in the end only  whole pistachios were sprinkled on top. However, the lamb slices were cooked to perfection and the pulled lamb melted in my mouth. Our mains were satisfying but the lamb portion was smaller than I had expected. All the dishes were creatively plated and piping hot. The veal meatball was a sight to see as a huge bone was jabbed into the meatball. The tuna was hidden underneath a salad and was deemed pretty good by my brother.    The best part of the meal was the dessert. I received a stunning plate of praline profiteroles with excellent piping skills of \"happy birthday\". When I read about the profiteroles on the menu, I wasn't really impressed but I was proven wrong. I will never forget this dessert as they transformed a boring old profiterole into a dessert with sweet, crunchy, tangy and refreshing elements. The rest of us ordered the passion fruit soufflé, the baker's sampling and the bittersweet chocolate truffle bar. The baker's sample came with 4 Parisian baked goods which was a macaron, madeleine, a miniature chocolate ganache tart and a praline profiterole. A simple and non heavy way to finish off the meal. The chocolate dessert was sweet on top of sweet, so if you have a sweet tooth go for it. The souffle is a must try and hands down the best !     Although this meal broke the bank for me, the service, food and decor is definitely an unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"We were strolling around the Distillery District (because we're tourists) and decided that we needed some dinner. Everywhere seemed packed so we went in this place because there wasn't a line out the door like all the other restaurants. I was very impressed when we walked in it was a nice establishment with tiled floors, mirrored walls and a marble bar. The bar area reminded me of a speakeasy in New York City. There were 5 of us so I was expecting a long wait since it was a Friday night. But the hostess said that they could put a table together for us in 10 minutes. Score!  When the hostess said she had a table set up outside on the patio, I was a little hesitant because it was a chilly night. But when we got out there it was pleasantly warm thanks to the heat lamps and partially covered patio walls. We started off with a couple bottles of wine and a cheese board for some of us who were hungrier. I shared the rosé which was delicious! Nice and crisp. When the cheese board came out though, it was really tiny even though we ordered a medium. We ordered it for 3 of us in the group although it would be good for 2 people, which was disappointing. Shortly after, our entrees came out. I ordered the burger which came out a little on the dry side but was still delicious! The fries that come with it are addicting! Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals as well.  All in all it's a typical fancy-ish place with high prices and small portions but I enjoyed my evening here. Our server was very nice and accommodating but a little on the slow side which I don't blame him for because it was a Friday night and the place was bumping. I would come back here and try out the bar with some of those cocktails on the menu!"}
{"text":"Don't know about the negative reviews here. Start by entering the heavy brass doors to the incredibly decorated renovated liquor factory. There is a wood frame ceiling that is really beyond description in its craftsmanship featuring beautiful carved medallions as well. There are elaborate hand built China cabinets holing beautiful examples of French China and porcelain. The lighting is perfect and the view of the kitchen makes one ready for the innovative meal. The menu is a bit extensive but worth the read. We had Buffalo style sweetbreads prepared in the style of wings. This innovative dish succeeded by not having a sauce that would overwhelm the natural flavor and texture of the sweetbread. Frog legs with an Asian ginger sauce and celery k chee was perfect. French onion soup was served in a cast iron pot with ceramic interior. Oysters from 6 locations were available. I had some from Maine that were amazingly fresh and tasty. My wife had the lobster which was a visual and taste treat. Desserts were interesting as well. This place has great food and a vibrant atmosphere. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place. My cousin wanted to try a french restaurant and i wanted to take her to the distillery so that's when I decided to give cluny a try.  First off, LOVE the interior!!!!!! Looks very french. The  ceiling, the flooring, the bathroom is beautiful!  We went there for brunch so we tried bourbon pecan pancakes, ricotta stuffed french toast and crab cakes Benedict.   All delish!  The crab cakes is a must!  The coffee they serve it in an individual french press which was so cute.   I still have to come back and try the rest of the menu.  This is a must go hands down!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the restaurant misses some final touches to make it great. The atmosphere is gorgeous, beautiful renaissance style decorations mixed with a modern touch. The service is where they need a little help.   We arrived a little earlier than the rest of the group and sat at the front bar for a drink. Although there were numerous servers, we sat for 15 minutes without anyone asking us for a drink.   Once seated at the table with the whole group it took some time for the rest to get drink. We ordered oysters to start and the waitress brought us a different amount than we had asked for. No biggy, but when one of the guests ate a bad oyster nothing was done  on her part.   The main courses were good. I had the veal tomahawk meatballs which was one giant meatball with tomatoe sauce. As far as meatballs go it was good, but nothing will blow you away. It also comes with gnochi which is quite bland, simply creamy. The onion soup I had a bite of was very good; thickly caramilized onions.   Overall the experience was good, but I won't be writing home about it."}
{"text":"Food was good. I had the seafood stew as main. Ok, the service has improved a lot. BUT, it wasn't the wait staff that providing good service you'd.  It was a guy wearing blue sweater checking what we're missing at our table. He came to check our table after our pretty boy waiter left our table. He brought the missing folks, sponns... Little stuffs here and there. The owner definitely is trying to do something."}
{"text":"Yummy food, beautiful setting and a welcoming ambiance. The French Onion soup is a must try. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Besides the location and nice decor, the food is just alright. Nothing really stood out to me. The steak was a bit too dry for my liking but I tried frog legs for the first time and they were quite tasty! Just like chicken haha. For dessert the macarons were too stiff to be enjoyable. I would come back but only for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to celebrate my wedding anniversary at Cluny. It was terrific. We had an attentive server (Brent), the food was wonderful and the kitchen even sent us a lovely plate of profiteroles with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate sauce. The atmosphere was pleasant, the wine was at perfect temperature, nothing but good things to say. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great decor and presentation. But bland, and odd tasting food.  The first thing you'll notice about Cluny is the beautiful decor and \"grand\" atmosphere. You'll feel like you've travelled to Paris the moment you step in. another thing you'll notice is the large BREAD TABLE in the centre of the dining area. To me, this was the highlight of my experience, the bread, which doesn't really justify the restaurant's soaring prices.  In terms of service, most of the servers were, like the food, bland, with great presentation. At times, it felt like I was speaking to a beautifully decorated wall that would occasionally smile back at me. Overall, it was kind of an awkward experience.   Now, the main event, or honestly lack thereof, the food! My family and I ordered a variety of dishes, as it was my mother's birthday.   We started off with the Snap Pea/ French Bean Salad which was SUPER SMALL and OVERPRICED. We then had the Tuna Tartar which was standard and probably the best dish of the night. For main courses we had the Veal Meatball, which tasted bland, and dry, although the added bone was cute. The char boiled octopus lacked seasoning, it was literally boiled octopus that had been slapped on the grill for a minute or two. Then we had the grilled fish, which again, was bland, we covered it in salt and pepper. Also, all the dishes as a whole were \"overly complex\" and now in a good way. Many of the accompanying sauces were either too tart, too vinegary, or too bitter to really compliment the food. This is description is applicable to the side veggies as well.  Overall, come here only ONCE and do it just for the bread and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We always try to order something new off the menu and we've never been disappointed! Food is superb and presentation is always on point making it a great place for a special date.  The only concern is timeliness... make sure to make reservations! If you're catching a show at soul pepper - give yourself enough time for dinner (2 hours or so). While the waiters don't rush you (up side) it's not the place to go if you're in any rush."}
{"text":"This time, we went for the winterlicious menu 2016, which has very high points and low points. I was really disappointed in the duck confit entree which tasted like spaghetti sauce in a can. I don't even know if duck was part of the dish. I told the waiter my honesty because he asked. He didn't respond at all. Service was slow, we were at the restaurant for a good two hours. For the dessert, I decided to get a French press and he gave me a whole lot of attitude that it cannot be shared among two people. We shared it anyways and it was more then enough. I do like more cream in my coffee anyways. It was disappointing, and the menu lacklustre.   I would not pay money for the regular menu and definitely not the winterlicious menu which is supposedly a 'deal'. Not worth the time or effort."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch, the beautiful decor is probably the only thing going for this place. The servers were absolutely rude. The food was awful. Toronto's has so many amazing brunch places but this place was terrible. The tuna tartar was so fishy and most likely old. The benedict was mediocre, the omelette of the day was bland. It was just a terrible experience with terrible terrible service."}
{"text":"I'm so sad that Cluny was such a disappointment... I've walked by here many times while strolling through the Distillery District and it looked so chic and beautiful inside but never got the chance to try it until last night for Winterlicious.  The place is quite big inside, with a seperated room for the bar, another one to sell desserts and small bites, and they also have a private dining room for special occasions. The decor and ambiance was very cozy and definitely would remind you of a chic Parisian café, however the food was the complete opposite.   Started with the chicken liver parfait - it was paté with strawberry sauce, as if it was a scoop of ice cream... what would the French think of this?! More gimmick-y for the presentation than it was for the taste. I'd pass on this. Then I had the duck confit pot pie - how sad that I prefer the ones from the frozen food section of my local supermarket... The crust was sad and not even in one piece, and I probably had no more than 3 pieces of duck in there. It definitely was not worthy of being served at all. The only thing I actually enjoyed last night was the lavender tea chocolate bar - it was a bit fancier than your regular kit kat bar. My friends had the pistachio granny smith dessert and the ice cream tasted like pure alcohol, another huge disappointment.  I realized I had fallen for the ultimate tourist trap in the distillery. Don't waste your time dining here - I'd just come back for a coffee and the atmosphere but I'll save my tummy the disappointment and eat elsewhere. If you're looking for a better version of Cluny, definitely check out Colette; similar decor but with 10x better food and service."}
{"text":"This is a review for 2018 winterlicious lunch menu. Summary: a nice and romantic French restaurant with good food and fresh bread Service: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Environment: 4/5 What I recommend from the menu: french onion soup for starter, steak frites for main, Mont Blanc for dessert. What I like: the fresh bread, good portion, nice decorated dish, the environment, the service What I don't like: I found the food here are generally too heavy and the steak is a bit too salty.  This place is pretty hard to book during winterlicious time, but I found a slot for lunch during open table website. This place definitely required a reservation. When I came to the restaurant, it was pretty packed. Walk-ins required a long time to wait. I have been wanted to come to this restaurant for a while. I have passed by this place in distillery district many times during summertime, Christmas market and festival of lights. I usually would visit the pastry shop outside because I love the almond danish there. Overall, I am pleased with the experience. I am definitely getting a good deal for my winterlicious experience ($28/person). My friend and I are both very full after this lunch. It was festival of lights at distillery district, and the environment was pretty nice. I would definitely recommend it for a date. Our waitress was nice and attentive. I actually love the bread here. Our table was beside the bread station and we clearly saw how our waitress prepared our bread. I don't think refills were allowed. The bread was fresh and came in 3 favours. I don't usually eat the bread, but my friend and I emptied bread basket. Starter: French onion soup was pretty heavy. It had a layer of cheese on top. Main: I was a bit worried because the waitress did not ask us how well we wanted our steak. (Of course, I wanted it medium rare.) However, when the steak came, it was cooked in a right way. I think it was due to the volume of winterlicious, every steak was pretty consistently cooked medium rare. However, I did found the steak a bit heavy and salty. The steak has a slice of garlic butter on top and sauce on the side. The fries came with a mayo. I remembered in Paris, the fries did not come with ketchup. However, the waitress handed us ketchup. Dessert: Mont Blanc. Not exactly sure what was inside it (apple and gummy?). This dish was nicely decorated.  In conclusion, I definitely recommend visiting this restaurant for winterlicious. Be sure to make a reservation beforehand."}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicious dinner. The food was fairly priced, from my understanding the french onion soup on a regular day is quite expensive so the winterlicious menu price point isn't bad given that.  I had the french onion soup, braised short rib and the charcoal profiterole. All were good, I'm not shouting from the rooftops but I was satisfyed and the short rib was fall of the bone soft. The dessert wasn't too sweet which was perfect after a rich meal. What I will rave about is the amazing gin cocktails, those were so good I would go back for that alone  The reason for taking away a star was the service. Our server was attentive, fine, but he was far too la-di-da for my liking. This is a nice place. You should not be showing up at the table with your hands in your damn pockets. He then proceeded to only take two drink orders and he didn't want to wait for the other two of us to decide stating he would come back . This also meant that our drinks came at different times. He came to check and see how our courses were going but never stopped long enough for more than a \"fine\" I'm also fairly sure two of the people who ordered the fish's orders got mixed up cause one was supposed to be well done but no big deal.   Check time came and he brought he machine over and walked away, normally a server would step back to allow space but he just left for about 5 minutes. He just didn't seem very interested in being present.   Anyway, restaurant is really good. Hopefully have a different server next time."}
{"text":"Went for a work off-site with 20 or so peope. Had frog legs, asparagus, and buttered bread to start. Each was amazing.   Venue and servers were perfect, constantly filling our drinks and asking if we needed anything. They were also super friendly and professional.  The steak was great, however I did not agree with the choice of sauce. Desert was amazing.  The private room we sat in was exquisite and set the mood very well. We had drink tickets so many of us ended up having a more amazing time than expected. Great place for a great group of people.  Food -4 Venue -5 Service -5 Vibe -5"}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch around 11, there was an hour wait, but we were a large group of 10. This place deserves a 4/5 for ambiance and service, but the food is a 2/5. The complimentary bread is by far the best tasting thing at this restaurant. The Eggs Benedict was ok, the eggs are served on a portobello mushroom instead of a traditional English muffin. Unfortunately, there was a lot of inconsistency in how the eggs were cooked, some were runny and some were fully cooked. My mother and husband had the grilled chicken and carrot salad dish, they enjoyed the salad on the side but said the chicken was dry and bland. The steak and eggs was good but a really small portion size of the steak.  A friend had the lamb merguez and another had the croque madame. They both liked their dishes, but nothing amazing. Ok experience but probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful and service was great. While we had to wait an hour for our reservation, they were apologetic and bought us a round of drinks. The food was good and I'd like to come back here and try more, but nothing blew my mind. The bread at the beginning was delicious. The salmon tartare was also great, fresh and flavourful. Asparagus frites were a bit too salty though, and the fries were cold. The cocktail I had was a highlight- it had green tea, ginger, mint, and cognac and was the perfect level of sweetness. In short- I think I need to come back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Closest I've seen to Balthazar (SOHO) in Toronto.  Decor, layout, table presentation and attention to detail is impressive.  I could see that ownership had a clear vision and invested significant $ and time to bring this restaurant to fruition.  My expectations were high and looking forward to a great experience.  Having said that my Sunday brunch experience was average.  Dined with two friends at 2:15 as most of the other guest were finishing.  We were in no hurry but service was very slow.  I was excited to see an assortment of pastries on the menu.  We were presented with a danish, chocolate croissant, something that tasted and appears to be focaccia and another pastry I couldn't identify.  Truly a disappointment.  The danish was dry and so underwhelming that I didn't bother to try the others.  It should not be difficult with amount of talented pasty chefs in Toronto to deliver a great product at a restaurant of this caliber.  The WAGYU HACHÉ which is essentially a hamburger w/o the bun was presented well and I enjoyed it.  Tuna tartar was done nicely as well.  The omelette appeared to on point.  As stated service was slow and food runner had no clue who ordered what and every item was 'auctioned' at the table.    I will certainly willing return to this restaurant for lunch and dinner as I do love the location and ambiance but looking forward to improved service and pastries."}
{"text":"winterlicious 2015. I had the kale salad, beef cheeks, and profiterole. All awesome. The kale is fresh. The beef cheek was so tender I can finish the dish using just my fork. Profiterole was devlish I'm a chocolate fan. My friend tried the calamari, trout, blackcurrent macaroon, and side-ordered 4 variety of their oysters. She loved the calamari, the trout to her was good but she didn't like the sides. I think the sides (squash) are fine. The blackcurrent dessert was nice. One thing though, the bread is cut on the station in the middle of the dining room, it looks cool, but the bread is served cold. It'd be nice if they are served warm and fresh. Wine selection is ok. Server Mike was cheerful. I wanna come back to try the brunch."}
{"text":"Lovely spot for lunch in the Distillery District, the only thing that let it down was slow service towards the end.   Food was exceptional, nice wine selection, and the bread was perfect. Lovely atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"The WORST and most HOSTILE costumer service I've ever experienced!! The waitress not only spilled the drink all over our table and clothes, she never apologized for that. She even gave us an attitude. The appetizer came first then the bread and butter!! When we asked her about the bread she said: \"I have another table to serve, too\"!! We ordered burgers, she did not even asked how would we want the meat to be cooked!!After we complained to the manager regarding this unprofessional behavior they only gave us a free desert. The waitress, MIRANDA never apologized and that was not acceptable in any shape or form!! Nobody should be treated the way MIRANDA treated us!!"}
{"text":"This placed used to be better. Came for dinner last week and ordered a Cluny burger, king fish ceviche and seafood stew. The seafood stew tasted metallic, really bitter and off. It gave my fiancee an upset stomach when we got home. The food was just average and certainly doesn't match the pricing."}
{"text":"Arrived Sunday 1pm for summerlicious menu.   Seated fast.  Great attentive service from Allison. It was busy and a full house.  Summerlicious.  Be prepared.  Lunch was $23 with choice of app, main and dessert.  Well worth it.  I had the Seafood chowder, ham croque and sorbet.  Other 5 star items you must try are coated asparagus fries and macron for dessert.  Wife loved the artic char fish.  Layered crab salad with quinoa was filling and yummy."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to try the Winterlicious lunch menu. The restaurant opens at noon and that's when our reservation was for. Just be aware they were finishing setting up and there was a slight delay in seating everyone.   We both ordered the French onion soup, I had the steak frites and tartlet and my friend had the Croquet monsieur and Mont Blanc.  The soup had a thick layer of cheese (that was ever so slightly on the burnt side) on top of a rich broth. I like my steak more on the medium well side so was quite surprised when I cut into the steak that it was too rare for my liking. The waitress was quite accommodating and had my steak cooked a little longer. The fries were delicious. The seasoning on top was just right. My ganache dessert was delicious. It wasn't too sweet and I liked the raspberry pieces and cookie (?) that added a different texture to the dessert."}
{"text":"My first place to have a meal in distillery district. The restaurant is very big and good for private chatting. They have very lovely tea snacks (macarons booyah!)."}
{"text":"We had come here for a Winterlicious reservation....  but once we were here, decided to just order off the regular menu.  I had explained in another post, I don't really eat dessert....and I have been unimpressed by Winterlicious menus as of late.   I'm glad we opted for the non-Winterlicious menu as our portion sizes seemed to be significant compared to the table next to ours.   We ordered the Ginger Chili Fried Frogs legs... very tasty.  We also ordered the Traditional Country Pate en Croute.... WOW... this was HUGE.  Biggest Pate I have ever had.   After those two... we could of been done.. again.. good portion sizes.   But then came our meals... the lady had the Veal Meatball Tomahawk with gnocchi.  She thought it was fantastic... I thought the meatball was meh.  But maybe because I grew up eating Italian style meatballs, I'm not sure.   I had the Grilled Bass Almondine which was very good.  I was impressed with the taste.  Service was very good.  The decor was beautiful and I would likely return to this location.  Well done."}
