{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant while waiting for my next flight.  I ordered a chicken burrito.  I was completely disappointed by the little amount of chicken that was added to my burrito.  It was like 13 small cubes of chicken.  I couldn't detect any chicken in any of my bites.  The burrito was mostly rice and vegetables.  Certainly not a Chipotle burrito!  While I was eating my burrito, I noticed the checkout gal (the one handling money) go from the cash register to the food prep area to prepare another customer's order.  She did not wash her hands or put on any gloves.  She was the same person who prepared my meal and then it dawned on me that she did the same thing to me too.  Gross!  Why does airport food and service have to suck so bad?"}
{"text":"Good luck getting any sort of service here. Multi tasking isn't encouraged here. Not to mention sense of urgency."}
{"text":"I ordered a \"big as your head\" burrito special for $8.95 that included a drink.  I was then told they had no tortillas, but I could get a bowl.   I thought it might be a tortilla bowl, but it was just a plastic bowl.    When she rang up my bill, she didn't get me a drink.  The meal cost $10 plus tax.  I asked about the burrito special and included drink.  She said I couldn't get a burrito special and had to pay an additional $3 for the drink.  I felt very misled.  I doubt I'll be going back."}
