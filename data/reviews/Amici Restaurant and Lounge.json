{"text":"Excellent service and the veal was awesome ,we went with a family of 3 and everyone had a great meal. We will be back. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim, wife was craving Italian and I wasn't cooking today.  Can't find a flaw with this place at all.  I don't particularly care for Italian restaurants in general.  I usually find them to be overpriced and hit or miss in quality.

Service was very friendly and prompt, food came out at the perfect pace.  App of meatballs were as good as any I've ever had.  Salads were fresh, always a plus.  Both our meals (Seafood linguini in a red sauce for me, lasagna for the wife) were fabulous.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to try the new restaurant in town, Amici's. What an upgrade from the recent bar/restaurants that have frequented this location. This is an authentic family-run Italian restaurant where you will be greeted by brothers Frank and Dino and treated to large portions of authentic Italian cuisine at great prices. We shared the family platter and were able to sample the chicken parm, lasagna, chicken alfredo and spaghetti with delicious homemade meatballs. I can't say enough about the martinis and cocktails--I will definitely be back for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"We were very happy to hear of a new family owned restaurant in North Royalton.  We enjoyed our experience.  Staff was very nice and efficient.  Prices are very fair.  Bread could be a better quality.  Salad was served in bowls hot from the dishwasher.  The food was excellent.  I had lasagna and it was enough for 2 meals.  My husband had the Around the Boot which he said was excellent and took about 1/2 of it home too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Saturday evening and service was good and food was way above average. Will definitely return !"}
{"text":"My husband & I tried this place on a whim about 2 weeks ago...I ordered the chicken marsala & he had the Around the Boot meal. My dinner was good, but the chicken did taste a bit hard(was it frozen then cooked?), but everything else was great. The cocktails were AMAZING! We came back again this past weekend & again my husband ordered the Around the Boot & I ordered the pork chop & spaghetti. WOW! It was DELICIOUS! Cooked exactly the way I wanted, I actually ate the last bits off of the bone! :) It was juicy with nice grill marks on it-my husband said he is ordering the pork chop next time. We are definitely coming back! The owners & wait staff are all very nice & you can tell that they actually care about their customers. Jo is the best at making martinis-try the Tiramisu & Shamrock one-it tastes exactly like those after dinner mint chocolates(Andies?) that some restaurants serve after the meal. GREAT place! There is a bar area attached, it was nice also, when there isn't a huge crowd. A group of older people came in & were quite loud & rowdy, ending our evening at this place. Too bad, we would have spent more money there-if they can get their \"regulars\" at the bar under control, I think it would be much better. All in all, a good date night out with the hubby!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and it has yet to disappoint. Food is very good and very reasonably priced. Most places have a gluten free option,  but this place has at least 8 gluten-free dishes and everyone I know that is gluten-free have raved about."}
{"text":"The have The best Ziti I've had anywhere. Nice owner, great service, Love this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch today, she had the Chicken Parmesan and I had the Chicken Marsala, both were good.  Served with thin sliced Italian bread, mixed greens side salad, and a side of spaghetti with chopped tomato sauce.  Portions were moderate, enough for lunch but not for dinner.  Prices moderate ($13/$14).  Table cloths and flowers on the tables so some effort made on atmosphere.  Service was just fair, only two tables occupied so waitress read a magazine in the corner.  Huge pepper grinder sitting on the side bar but none was offered for our salads.  I wish that restaurants would train servers to actually stop at a table and inquire how the food is instead of yelling \"You doing alright?\" while walking past.   No effort to offer drinks, appetizers, or dessert."}
{"text":"Wow. Love this place !! My husband loved loved the meatballs. He's very picky so that was good :) the sausage was so great we asked about it and found out it is local and they prefer to use local businesses when possible.  Can't wait to go back. Very clean and very enjoyable atmosphere !"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken francaise. What came out was a piece of chicken so laden with grease I could've rung it out. And not a drop of lemon butter sauce. Green beans were greasy too. Not sure how that happened. The salad was made with iceberg lettuce, haven't seen that in quite awhile and just as tasteless as I remember. The bread they brought out was fresh but it was just ordinary sliced Italian bread. The waitress was confused much of the time     I can't really recommend this place. At a loss as to the other people giving 4-5 stars. The ambiance wasn't great either."}
{"text":"We decided to try Amici and we were not disappointed. Our food was delicious and everyone we were with thought it was great. The owners were very personable and greeted us right away. While we did enjoy the food, a few of us got the \"Around the Boot\", and felt that we did not get large enough portions for the price. But all in all, a very good experience!"}
{"text":"Went here bc I heard it was great. I was good, but the portions were very small. The meals were about $15 each but neither of us left full. 

I had the eggplant parm and my husband had something called around the boot - which is a choice of three things. We also had the moz planks and enjoyed them. 

$35 and we only had water"}
{"text":"I'm a pinch...good. Needs a little help in the waiting staff and presentation but overall value was good and good was above average. Not exactly a date night joint. Great during the week where the hell we gonna go joint. Wife was happy I was happy"}
{"text":"Second time here. Complete opposite of first visit. Wife's chicken Francais and fettuccine was cold. I had spaghetti with meatballs. Meatballs were cold. By the time our server came back around to ask how our meals were I was done with my meal. They made a new dish for my wife. Chicken was hot but the fettuccine tasted sour."}
{"text":"This was the worst Italian restaurant i have been too, would never go back. the sauce taste like a sauce out of a jar, the chicken parm was like rubber, veal parm was tough and could hardly chew, we went to D'Agnese's instead, how people rate this 4 stars i question it,"}
{"text":"Very happy my wife and I chose to go here for our anniversary! Italian is one of my favorites when dining out. I had the chicken francaise with a side of alfredo penne. My wife had an eggplant and chicken parmesan combo entree.  Food was great, has a nice cocktail lounge area, and the owners are welcoming hosts."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good prices.  We called ahead and went with a group.  Everyone enjoyed what they got.  The side salad was a little boring and could have used a little something.  But the appetizers of mozzarella planks and bruschetta were good.  Baked ziti, eggplant Parmesan, around the boot, spaghetti, seafood pasta, kids grilled cheese with fries was all enjoyed.  Decent cannoli."}
{"text":"Coming from the wife of a picky Italian husband, this food is the real deal!  Honestly delicious italian food!!!!  Staff are all wonderful and casual environment. Prices are very reasonable!  I recommend this restaurant to anyone who will listen!"}
{"text":"Just went today and ordered  \"around the boot\"\"  Fantastic and the salad was fresh  Will come back"}
{"text":"We went for a birthday dinner. Nice little place. Food took awhile but there were a lot of us. Food was delicious! I'm a serious meatball critic and they were divine. Portions were decent sized. The bread on the table was great except I could have ate 5 more slices. Service was top notch. 
The cocktail menu had interesting drinks. I think I had one of everything. Loved them all!! Will take the hubby their for a date night."}
{"text":"We were disappointed after our meal. I ordered chicken marsala and it was tasteless. My daughter had the Alfredo and it was also bland, the sauce rather runny. My son had no complaint about his meatball sub. My husband had linguine with clam sauce which he felt was ok-small portion. There were not many others in the restaurant and it had just opened a couple weeks before. I assumed the service would be outstanding considering this and that the last restaurant in that space didn't last a year but the service wasn't great. The (I assume) owner or manager was there but never bothered to acknowledge us even though he walked past our table several times. We will not be returning to Amici's, which is disappointing because it is near our home and we had every intention of frequenting it often."}
