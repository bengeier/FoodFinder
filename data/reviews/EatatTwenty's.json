{"text":"My new Saturday morning hangout!!  The food is top notch!  I consider myself a biscuits and gravy connoisseur, I have to say, Twenty's is in my top 5 of all time!  The management was very attentive, assuring a great experience.  Their coffee is also some of the best around.  It's not the cheapest joint in town, but you pay for quality!"}
{"text":"I usually love a little local joint but this was just not a very great experience. In small town quaint downtown Grafton, it has a fun little outdoor eating space. That's about all it really has though. We were disappointed to have just missed brunch and the lunch menu is pretty limited. The \"unique side salad\" was good but the chicken panini was a massive miss. I would not recommend it. For $8 I got two big piece of bread with the smallest amount of meat I've ever seen on a sandwich. We almost sent it back but I hate doing that.  I tried to eat it but the little bit of chicken on the sandwich was too grisly to chew. I gave up. The waitress took it from me without even asking why I didn't really eat anything on it. I basically paid to sit there and order something gross. Then I paid and left. My wife had a basic burger and it was okay. The patio had so many bees on it that we had to move back inside. Needless to say I won't be back anytime soon. There's a lot of potential here but they are certainly missing the mark right now."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite local restaurant, fantastic fresh food right here in Grafton. This place is a must try!! Went there for the first time this morning and had the Heuvos Rancheros. Every bite was fantastic, even the salsa was homemade and amazing! I also had the cinnamon roll which was phenomenal! Super attentive staff/owners that were very friendly and happy to chat with us about the exciting plans for the restaurant. Can't wait to go back and try something else from their great menu."}
