{"text":"I been here a couple of times, and every visit keeps getting better and better.  On my last visit , I ordered the Fish Fillet  with white rice and a side salad.   The fish was really tender and juicy, I got 2 big fillets over a bed of bell peppers and onions.   The prices are good for the amount of food that you are getting.  You get what you pay for, does not apply here."}
{"text":"The best original Mexican food in town ,I have been in so many Mexican restaurant !!! But this one I could eat there every day"}
{"text":"Having tried Mexican food in Corpus Christi Texas, I'm pretty confident when I say I've had authentic Mexican food, and this place has legit Mexican food. I've tried several different \"Mexican\" food places in Charlotte, but this one is by far my favorite. Freshly made food daily, great seasonings, generous portions, decent prices...Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great choice for takeout Mexican food! The place doesn't really look like anything from outside and it's in one of the older strip malls of south boulevard. You walk inside and there are pictures on the wall of what they offer. I think most tacos are $2 (depending on what you order). Delicious made to order food, not expensive, and the place was clean.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has become my favorite authentic Mexican restaurant in town. The dishes are extremely cheap for the quality of food that they make! The salsa that comes with most dishes is certainly homemade and delicious. I'm a fan of finding things that I haven't tried before and the fist time I bit into their barbacoa, tripe, and beef tongue tacos I couldn't stop there without ordering at least one of each! I have yet to have a bad meal here in the two years Ive been eating here."}
{"text":"Quick recap: this place is simply delicious. Authentic Mexican, probably the best tacos in town, delicious steak dishes, and subs. This place is carry out only! The salsas are spicy and the rice is always on point.   Been here a good number of times. The only dish I can't say I loved was the enchiladas and the carnitas. Outside of that, everything has simply been amazing and shockingly authentic.   The service has always been good to amazing. Even though they are usually busy, they bust their tails to get everything done quick and correct. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere screams hole in the wall. Not a big place but again, it's carry out only.   Can't recommend this place enough. Probably one of the best, if not the best, Mexican place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their tacos!! they're AMAZING!!! i could eat them for every meal and never get sick of them. their green sauce is amazing too!! in fact, im going to order from there right now...."}
{"text":"Very legit, takeout only Mexican. Cabeza and tripa were as good as I ever had it--loaded with meat. Only one tortilla each but larger than normal.  Hit this up if your stopping by post office or dollar gen!"}
{"text":"OK, so I can barely drive by this place without stopping, I go today and meet one of my friends, I am excited that I am with someone so I can order more food and share and maybe, just maybe, try something different than the Al Pastor tacos.  So I order, 2 Pastor tacos and chicken enchiladas.  My spanish is muy malo, but I knew when she said ensalada that it wasn't a good sign.  We got a good chuckle out of it and ate our stupid shredded lettuce salad.  You know, I didn't even say anything.  Donde esta mi bicycleta?  SÃ© que es mi ensalada."}
{"text":"Small place for counter service only. There are only 5 chairs lining the window wall for you to sit in as you wait for your order...and no place to sit outside. So have a destination in mind when you place your order...  The food was good and fresh! The shrimp fajitas were plentiful and flavorful. The one sketchy part was no prices on the menu. I guess they make them up as they go?   The place stays busy and people were in and out during the lunch hour. It was bright, clean, and employee was friendly. I was definitely happy to use my Spanish, but like Nicole W. said, it's not necessary...your pointer finger can interpret just as easily."}
{"text":"Ordered the three taco special with rice and beans that came to a little over $8.  Got the al pastor and two carne asada tacos. The pastor was good, nice bit of spice. Thought the asada tacos were pretty dry.  I'd definitely try it again, but not bowled over. To put it in perspective you buy the same meal from Sabor for about $1 more and I think the quality there is better. I will definitely try this place again though and maybe go with a burrito or something else."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food. Love the asada and carnitas tacos. My husband likes the asada CA burrito. I wish it was a restaurant where you can sit and eat right away. We are not close to it, and the food is no longer hot when we get home."}
{"text":"Good food.  Take out only but they do take credit cards.  I recommend you call in your order service is a bit on the slow side but worth the wait.  One of the only places I could find sopes."}
{"text":"We leave near here and decided to give it a try finally last night. But you need to be able to speak Spanish are at least some it seemed like. Our order was wrong but the one burrito we got instead of the one we ordered was the best thing we got so it was nice. My wife who use to travel to Mexico alot when living in SOCAL and she said it was pretty authentic to her. We will try again for sure. The place also seemed very clean."}
{"text":"I dropped by today. And my food was pretty good. I got a special with tacos, rice, and salad. And beef nachos. Everything was good. I wasn't obsessed but i was pleased. My order was $16.91. Going forward I would definitely ask for prices up front. But thats pretty much it.   Note *their menu does not have prices so if you want to make sure you actually brought enough money to cover what you want ask them for a takeout menu and the prices are on that."}
{"text":"Fonda Mexicana El Paraiso: A tiny, order and go taqueria with some definitely delicious and affordable options that extend beyond tacos...tortas, salads, fajitas, etc.   Seating: None, unless you count the five chairs facing the cash register, awaiting food.   Service: Smiley and helpful. Speaking a bit of espanol helps but probably isn't necessary.   Food: Al pastor tacos son deliciosos. Perfect amount of onion, cilantro and tender pork. Plus, the tortillas are well-made and surely crafted in house. The barbacoa taco was well flavored, spicy but strangely super duper orange...I ate it anyway. The green salsa is perfection. Get some.   Beverages: There's a case of everything from juice boxes to bottled water to Jarritos.   Price: Affordable but not dirt cheap. Surely it depends on what you order...my dining partner ordered up shrimp fajitas which came out in a giant box filled with everything under the sun. That, my friends, is a good value.  Gracias, Fonda Mexicana El Paraiso."}
{"text":"I love this place, this is becoming my go to at lunch time.   Every thing I have tried on the menu so far has been fantastic. My favorites to date are the Chorizo and Steak Tacos, Huarache (Oval Shape tortilla stuffed with refried beans and prepared with cactus with a choice a meat) the Supremo is excellent.   The Tortas are also very good. The Steak, Cuban and Pollo are my favorites. They are pretty large and can actually share it with another person.   Plan to spend about $10, which is I think very fair for a yummy lunch cooked to order and prepared with Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican food my (Mexican-American) boyfriend and I have found in Charlotte! Anything with pork pastor or carne asada is super flavorful and delicious (I usually get tacos, but gorditas and other items with the meat are also great). Chorizo is good too, and my bf likes the torta cubana (ham, egg, hotdog, avocado, cheese, among other things on this colossal sandwich). I have found the carnitas to be on the fatty side, so those aren't my favorite.   Take out only."}
{"text":"Great place to stop and get some very Flavorful mexican take out.  I drove passed this store front many of time always wanting to check it out.  Finally for lunch i was able to stop and see what they had.    There is a lot to choose from and they have pictures all over the wall to see what you want to order.  I got the california burrito. It was massive and had some of the best flavor I could have wanted . I highly recommend stopping by and checking this place out. I know ill be back to sample more of their offering.   They also make the orders really quick too."}
{"text":"AMAZING place. Since I moved to Charlotte from Mexico, I haven't been able to find a good authentic Mexican place. This. Is. it.  Tacos, gorditas, huaraches. They are all great. The pastor is delicious and the carnitas are just like home."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my Mexican food, as I'm from Arizona and this place did NOT disappoint. The location is in a strip mall off of South Blvd, but don't let that discourage you. They're quick and authentic! The salsas are made fresh and boy, they are spicy and delicious! This place was recommended to me by a co-worker and I'm so glad I came to check it out. Next time I'll have to order a few different things on the menu.   During my visit, I got the carne asada tacos which came with three tacos and rice and beans. The tacos were garnished with onions and cilantro. The only thing I would've added was cheese (which I forgot!). It was delicious! The steak was tender and cooked to perfection. You really didn't need anything else added to it. My friend ordered the enchiladas and it was plentiful.   They didn't have prices listed anywhere, but it was pretty inexpensive. We'll definitely be back!"}
