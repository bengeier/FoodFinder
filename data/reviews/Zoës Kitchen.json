{"text":"The quality of food at this location specifically can be described in one word: \"meh\". Meaning not very fresh, under/over cooked and sloppily pieced together. I love the idea of Zoe's and I think their menu is awesome but the inconsistency with this store is a shame, esp with its awesome location and high volume of customers. So why even bother writing a review? I'd love to see this location turn it around and start caring about the food quality and customer service. I feel like with Zoe's you want to get away from fast food but too often I'm disappointed with how my food looks and tastes, like it was just thrown together and sent on it's way. I mostly order online and when I get home I noticed items are missing also. Extremely frustrating."}
{"text":"We love Zoe's! We go once a week and love the quality and the service. Also Felipe is amazing, he keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"First I must mention that my spouse and I, we like trying new cuisines & flavours, we go out for food at least once a week for very casual dining.

We decided to go to this restaurant as we wanted to eat some type of Mediterranean cuisine.

The place could have been a bit cleaner and tidy, all the tables were dirty and needed to be wiped down.

The service was absolutely disappointing. The cashier was extremely moody when asked about certain menu items, acted annoyed by the questions.  My wife decided to go with the Steak Stack, the downside is that they barely put any caramelized onions or Rosemary oil on the sandwich.  I went with the Mediterranean Chicken which was dry.

In conclusion the whole experience was not good, and very disappointing.  We had heard such great things and this experience did not live up to it."}
{"text":"Gave Zoes a try. I ordered the Greek Chicken Pita and my wife ordered the Chicken Kabobs. Both were good and came out within 15 minutes for lunch time (12 pm). With any new place, there a few service things they are working out. For instance, my wife didn't get her sauce, so we had to go up and get it. Overall, pretty good and with the number of people coming through (over 50 to my count), others must think it's good as well."}
{"text":"Super good food and very friendly workers! I will definitely be returning to try more of the menu. ZoÃ«s is a great edition to rivergate."}
{"text":"Tasteless... very unfortunate, great location but isn't worth buying.. salads has no dressing on.. chicken salad is only consistent if chicken and mayo no salt or pepper at least... I had chicken pita, the dressing on it was so blend that it didn't even taser like it had anything on it ...
Hope they improve but knowing that is a chain restaurant and everything is premise and orders in .. not likely.."}
{"text":"I usually am a huge fan of this place however my last visit this past Monday was not so great. Hoping it was just an \"off\" day. We arrived around 12:30 so mid lunch rush and it started with about a 10 minute wait to order and followed by another 20-30 min to get our order. We ended up asking for it to go since our lunch hour was shot. The manager ended up refunding our money but then I realized I paid cash while my friends paid card so ultimately I dos not receive a refund. then, when walking up to the counter I noticed their tzatziki sauce out in the open in the front fridge uncovered (not good). Again, I'm hoping it was just a manic Monday..."}
{"text":"I work next door to this place, and it's the best! I eat lunch here almost every day. If you're looking for a cheap great FRESH meal, Zoe's the place. I've never had any bad food. Also the staff at this location is amazing! They've been super nice to me! This is one of my favorite places to eat! It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"Still recovering from a cold I stopped here for the orzo and chicken soup.  Amazing flavor !  Added the New Mediterranean  baked feta. Best feta ever with Olives, tomatoes and pepper. Feeling better and I will go again. Good healthy yummy food !"}
{"text":"I love Zoe's Kitchen but every salad I've ordered at this location has been limp and tastes a little off. Too bad because it's the closest to me!

I will continue eating at the others and hopefully Camelback will freshen up their salads!"}
{"text":"This place is a staple for me. When I need some vegetables and didn't prepare a healthy meal for work I may just be here.  It is a take a number and sit down joint but it's clean and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Editing my review. I originally gave Zoe's 3 stars, but on my third visit I ended up having one of the worst dining experiences of my life. I'm typically not a person that will completely write off a restaurant based on one bad experience but I think sometimes it is completely understandable.

I'll start off by saying on all 3 of my Zoe's experiences I ordered the grilled vegetable kebabs. Not bad, but they are not great. And extremely overpriced, to boot. The item is marked \"vegan\", but the salad it comes with is topped with feta cheese, which makes it not vegan. Zoe's needs to take their \"V\" off this item because if it wasn't for the fact that I emailed Zoe's corporate email prior to my first visit, I would have been stuck with an inedible salad. Besides, vegans are smart enough to ask questions about menu items that are not clearly marked vegan. Just don't give them false security by labeling non-vegan food \"vegan\" because then we'll feel we don't need to ask questions. 

In short, what happened last experience was I ordered \"grilled vegetable kebabs\" and ended up with a plate of big, stinking, chicken kebabs. A sight not pleasing to most vegans and vegetarians and frankly, quite offensive to ethical vegans and vegetarians. It's not a \"choice\" for me, it's a belief and a lifestyle. This is the equivalent to serving a steak to a Hindu, or a rack of ribs to a Jew.

Anyways, server takes my beans off the plate and takes the plate back to get me my kebabs. Mind you, the chicken kebabs cost more than the vegetable ones but I figured getting my money back would be more hassle than it's worth. 15 minutes pass. My beans go cold as I patiently wait the return of my food and pita for which to eat said beans. In a flurry of apologies and napkins, my server arrives with my plate. By this point I've already decided I'm not coming back here ever again. But the cherry on top is there are little bits of feta cheese in my salad. 

Done and done. There are some mistakes that are unforgivable."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go when you're hungry, but don't want the \"blah\" weighed-down yucky, greasy feeling.  I always order the greek pita, well, because I'm a feta fan! Yes, a large amount of the menu has feta, so if you don't like it, you may want to rethink coming here.  The rice pilaf is delicious, I also love the fruit bowls (not a fan of the pasta salad).  Chicken salad is good, but I think it needs some salt & pepper personally. Yaya's chocolate cake is really yummy! All in all, I enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"All the food was ready for pick-up exactly on time, the family Mediterranean meal was delicious and hot..Lots of feta on salad, fruit fresh, cold and crisp....will definitely eat here again !!!"}
{"text":"The food here is always awesome! We love the chicken kabobs and grilled vegetables. they are super delicious."}
{"text":"Chicken was great, coleslaw is different every time, roasted vegetables = yellow, brown broccoli and sliced carrots."}
{"text":"I love this place....healthy, and delicious!!! They have a wide variety, and choices for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I have been several times to other locations and this one is as good as the rest. Very clean and a good value."}
{"text":"First timer here. Quick service.  The meal was fresh. Would definitely recommend! The staff members were personable. I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places for quick, healthy, delicious food for years. It's always fresh and quick and I love getting a container of the chicken salad for lunch the next day. 
I usually go to the location on 7th Ave but was in a hurry on my way home from work and stopped at this location last week. I got a chicken sandwich and potato salad to go. Upon taking my first bite on my drive home I found a 2 and a half foot long hair attached to the bite in my mouth and the sandwich in my hand. I didn't have time to turn around and ended up only eating the potato salad after throughly searching it for more hair. I'm disgusted that there are people working on their kitchen with long hair and aren't putting it up.
I am sad that I can't trust this company anymore because the foods is super delicious but I won't be returning to any of the locations."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here,everything tastes fresh and has tons of flavor. I have tried so many things off the menu and loved them all. My favorite is the chicken kabobs and salads."}
{"text":"We accidentally placed a pick up order at the wrong location. LaTasha and Julio were very accommodating and quickly fixed the situation. We definitely will be back for the great service and amazing yaya cake!"}
{"text":"Picked the chicken kabob it said zoes favorite it was.good not great nothing really specail about this place but good.for a.lunch"}
{"text":"For this being a fast-foodsy place, it is one of the best options despite it being a bit on the pricey side. However, they have a buy two for $6 deal with great options. 

It's my to-go place for those nights when you don't want to cook but you want to make a health-conscious decision. In fact, it's featured on healthydiningfinder.com where you can find a list of their healthiest meals. Also, they have some tasty options if you are feeling like splurging or simply are not that concerned about calories. My boyfriend always gets the steak roll-ups - they are delicious!

A couple of tips about this place: You can get a free mug if you sign up for their emails.  Also, free wifi (after 2pm)! Not sure how it's monitored because it's a recent discovery of mine. Wish it were an all-day thing, but I am excited to have found another place where to get some work done. 

On the downside: parking. It's located at the metropolitan shopping center and it gets crowded around dinner rush. 

Overall, a nice place for a quick, healthy bite!"}
{"text":"Great dinner at Zoes  Kitchen. Only their second day open.  Fast service,  food was wonderful.  Got the kabob plate and sandwich.  Even got some sides to take home. The GM Chris even stopped by our table to check on us. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Got a salad, with a dead mosquito body in it. Very disgusting.
Wouldn't go back. Lettuce and vegetables should be washed several times before served to people to consume."}
{"text":"I've loved coming here and still love the food, but an unpleasant confrontation with Shannon has unfortunately made me decide to no longer come to this location.  I bought a cookie for my kids that was undercooked and brought it to Shannon's attention.  Long story short, she was very rude about me bringing it to her attention, even though I did it very nicely.  She all but jerked the cookie from my hand (after complaining that she baked the cookie herself so it was fine) and walked away, and even mocked me, not to mention never apologized for the undercooked cookie.  She just stood there with a fake grin saying, \"Yeah.  Ok.  Great.\"  I have never, ever written a complaint on someone but she was SO rude that I figured it was time I did."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the friendliest service around. The people who work here are young, professional and very socialble. Btw food is great too."}
{"text":"For a fast food place this is great! I ordered the tossed salad and my husband ordered the Greek salad with grilled chicken. The daily made dressing was yummy and would def come back here!"}
{"text":"Seems to be consistent with all the Zoes locations but the Metro is the worst... YOU MUST be rude and a professional eye roller and have ZERO customer service skills. All I asked for was a substitution and they acted like I had asked for a huge favor. Pretty sure all you have to do is push a button. Then I was charged $2.50 extra. Love the food but have no plans in returning after several encounters of rude behavior. I was a regular (3 x's a week and had been ordering the same thing with out being charged but ALWAYS got the attitude). No longer will I be going there!!!"}
{"text":"So fresh. So tasty. So interesting. So healthy. I enjoyed the chicken pita pizza and they had wonderful Greek salads. My husband had chicken ka-bobs and loved them. Can't wait to go again. My mom bought a jar of their salad dressing for $4 because it was so good. The dressing also makes a great marinade."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Zoe's and we will definitely be going back. I ordered the Greek Chicken Marinara which came wirh a side salad as big as the meal and my partner ordered the Steak kabobs. Both dinners were very flavorful and well worth the money. The portion sizes were big. 

Since we hadn't been there before and didn't realize how big the meals were we ordered the Hummus Trio. I loved that they served it with soft Pita, crispy pita, tomatoes, cucumbers, and green pepper. It really made the flavors of the three pop.

Lindsay was the host/server and we cannot say enough about how nice and attentive she was. She made sure everyone in the place was enjoying their experience there."}
{"text":"I downloaded this app and made an account just to write a review for this place. The only time I will ever go back to zoes kitchen is to pick up the refund that they owe me. Today was my last time in there due to terrible service. I got home and my order was wrong for the fifth time with them. I honestly can't believe that it's even possible to get someone's order wrong that many times. It's a shame because when my order is correct the food is excellent. Sigh... If someone from zoes kitchen sees this you need to sit down with your team and let them know that just because an order is to-go that doesn't mean don't pay attention or care about what you are doing. Unfortunately, I won't be back. 

Sincerely, 
-Person that drove 15 minutes to get an incorrect order (5 times)"}
{"text":"Zoe's Kitchen is great and healthy. I always go for the salmon kabobs. It's a bit pricey, but filling."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating lunch at Zoe's today.  Food was delicious and the GM made sure my experience was a good one.  This was my first trip to this location,  I normally visit the Blakeney location,  but I will definitely be going back to the Carmel Commons location. Thanks to the friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"Tasty, quick, clean and the white beans are so good I buy them by the quart load.
Great place for a quicky before Trader Joes ( so I don't buy the whole store) ... get the Chicken Kebobs ... and there is often parking right outside so you don't have to do the round and round by TJ's"}
{"text":"How can a place that just opened have a sanitation score of 93? Food was cold and the service is severely lacking!"}
{"text":"So, I accidentally walked into Zoe's today 7 minutes before they opened. Before I could even say hello, an employee named Crystal shouted across the restaurant, \"We don't open until 11!\" at the top of her lungs. Okey-dokey. I was just picking up some items from the case so I stood there like an idiot for 7 minutes while Crystal barked out orders to the kitchen in a tone I wouldn't even use on a dog. I have had tried to support this business since it opened (the company has an appealing backstory), ordering food from catering on several occasions. I agree with other reviews that the food is ok, bordering on bland, it's pricey for what it is -- and the service at this location is horrible. That would have been ok but after the way I was greeted this morning, I'll never eat there again. Even though Zoe's is a chain, some locations are franchised, while others are \"corporate-owned.\" This location is corporate owned, and the service reflects it."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. The prices were good too! I love orzo! :)"}
{"text":"I worked for Zoes on Camelback for a few months in 2007. But my review will be true and impartial.

I knew from the first time I ate lunch at Zoes that I wanted to work there. It was the most delicious lunch I'd ever tasted, and I wanted to eat it every day. So I did. But I only tried a few things once I found my favorite.

The chicken kabobs are usually tender and juicy. The rice pilaf can be a bit salty, so make sure to have a drink handy.

The Gruben is touted as a healthy version of the Reuben. It's not. The turky and swiss with spicy mustard and Zoes slaw on rye is full of hidden fat in the form of butter slathered all over the bread before it's grilled. It oozes sometimes.

The sandwich I keep going back to is the chicken salad sandwich. Out of the 5 days I worked, I had that sandwich at least four of those days. If you substitute Zoes slaw for the iceberg lettuce, it adds some more flavor to the sandwich. 

The sides are much the same as the entrees, good overall. The pilaf, as I stated above, is overly salty more often than not. The pasta salad is my least favorite, but all of my friends love it. The slaw is delicious. My favorite is the potato salad, but it depends on the day. All of the food is made fresh that day, so it can vary from day to day. Usually it's a good, even mix. But the potato salad can be too dry, too wet, too much potato, etc. If you make it on the right day, you're in luck. 

The cake makes me want to gain 500 lbs. The problem with the cake is that it's pretty much all sugar. The first time I had to help in the kitchen and make the cakes, I wanted to brush my teeth immediately. I think the mix makes something like 4 cakes, but the recipe called for about 12 cups of sugar, and the frosting is a combination of granulated and powdered sugars with cocoa. That's it. No wonder I have cavities. :\

I don't understand what's up with all of the bad reviews. I'm not biased, trust me. I worked there when it was a franchise, and the owner was an asshole. But the food is consistently great, and the service is always quick and polite. Whenever it's my choice for lunch, I choose Zoes on Camelback."}
{"text":"I like their tuna sandwiches, fresh cut fruit, and potato salad.
Seems moderately healthy.

I like the open atmosphere and the contemporary yet ergonomic interior deco.

Faster than most places."}
{"text":"Alrighty... here we go.
This place has pretty decent food.  Its not terrible at all.  However, the place claims to be healthy and fresh... I have a fundamental problem with a place that uses styrofoam plates, styrofoam cups, styrofoam to-go containers and individually plastic wrapped forks and knives.

Do you know how much landfill that is per person?  

The food is okay, but there is nothing healthy or fresh about styrofoam.  

F-  

i wont be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered catering to be delivered for a party I was hosting last night and the food was so well received!  The delivery arrived on time, everything was in order, and the food was excellent!  The steak rolls were my personal favorite. Definitely would use again & recommend."}
{"text":"Great spot and management. Always use for business catering events. Chicken kabobs are best item."}
{"text":"I'm not to big a fan of rye bread, but I love Zoe's Gruben. The egg salad sandwich is also very tasty! Most of the things on the menu are healthy and light, except for the chocolate cake (which is VERY hard to resist)!"}
{"text":"I love taking clients to Zoe's Kitchen for lunch. The food is amazing, the menu has many options, and the area is very modernized.  My biggest compliment is how clean the restaurant is. I usually go there around 1-2pm and the restaurant is not slammed, but there are a lot of opened tables with left over food, plates, trash, and drink spills on most of the tables and floor. My clients and I stood there for a moment by the dirty drink machines to figure out where to sit. They do have a patio, but the humidity was to high to sit outside. We told the lady at the front and she just shook her head in a yes movement. She  just kept doing what she was doing behind the counter. We finally sat at a dirty table and placed napkins down. The lady never came around to clean any of the tables, but a gentlemen came and started sweeping the floor. I gave 4 stars becuase the food is healthy and i never feel full once i leave. A little worried about how clean the back of the house is if the front doesn't even have a good matience team. My suggestion- clean the front of the house and acknowledge your customers."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the staff is warm and welcoming, and the ambiance is cozy and fun. What a great place for a leisurely brunch/lunch. I highly recommend the spinach wraps with chicken and a side of quinoa. Feeling brave? Then top off your meal with a chocolate chip cookie .... But you've been warned, this cookie is not for the faint at heart! Provecho!!"}
{"text":"Tried 3 diff dishes..all were below avg at best.  Too expensive for bland food."}
{"text":"The first time we came here for dinner  it was between 4 & 5 stars. This time though its a definite 3. The staff is very friendly and courteous but the food was not really as good."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and short wait. I love the fact this is health conscious place of business. The hummus is excellent and the soup was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This place has great Greek salads and Sandwiches, I always order the steak sack Sandwich with Greek it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for lunch and was impressed. I had the spinach wraps with chicken and grilled veggies.

The wraps were super fresh & delicious and the veggies were good, too. I'll definitely be going back to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"Had the Greek tossed salad. Too big to eat! My sister wasn't a fan of the tabouli.  It looked like the wrong item."}
{"text":"So I walk in here despite all the horrid things I've heard about Zoes kitchen . Even the one near my school we avoid at all costs. I should have turned around but my starvation was taking over my post-final exam brain. 

The floors were DISGUSTING. like okay I get parents don't care if their kids make messes in restaurants and you can't stop that, but come on, get a broom, I dont want to see that. It's really not appetizing. 

I saw a girl working there that I went to high school with. She saw me too and came out of the kitchen area to give me a hug and when I approached her a women SHOVED her hand in my face as if I was about to cross into a restricted area and I was still standing near their counter. My friend said not to mind her and that this lady was the manager and she always has a horrible personality. Don't touch strangers like that! Rude!!! 

So then when my friend went in the back again this Jessica lady just straight ignored me and my boyfriend. I finally asked her if I could order something and she said that they were closing and shed see what she could do? They didn't close for 15 more minutes and it was only 845. I walked in with my boyfriend at 830 and talked with my friend for 15 minutes. But this lady just rolled her eyes and kept stacking chairs in the restaurant. Oooookaaaay then. 

The food was okay. Nothing to write home about. Not to mention the sodium content is stroke inducing. My boyfriend was shocked how much salt was in it. 

Prob won't ever go back again it's just not worth the price you pay for it and since its filthy super dirty. I also will not be applying here for a summer job lol"}
{"text":"Went here a bunch of times over the first few months they were opened and loved it.  Healthy and good tasting.   Went three times in the last two months and the quality seems to have dropped off quite a bit. I kept giving them another try, hoping it was a fluke, and I hate to say it but I won't be back anymore. 
Got some funky lettuce one time and l had the steak wraps and it wasn't that good.  Had the white beans, which I loved when they first opened, but something is different and they're not that good now.  I'd guess they weren't so fresh. Its too bad cause I loved this place when it first opened."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! this food is so amazing I usually hate salads but it tasted so fresh and the salmon I got with it was just cooked perfectly! Love this place can't wait to come and eat here again, made my day!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Super friendly staff, healthy food with plenty of options and really affordable. We go here often and everything in their menu is great. Their app for reward is also really nice, we get free \"goodies\" often."}
{"text":"Fabulous, fresh, healthy, inviting, clean and the service is amazing!  Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"they have really fresh tasty food. really great service. I called in a large order to the wrong location, they were able to pull it and recreate it in a few short minutes. again I love their food and great service"}
{"text":"Zoey's food is good and reasonably priced.  Compared to the other nearby  sandwich shops  this place offers a nice touch.  It's very clean and the staff is friendly.  Can't say that  Zoey's is automatically on my radar but when I do go I immediately remember why."}
{"text":"Other than our chicken roll ups being correct the rest of our experience was terrible.  We ordered online and still had to wait 15 minutes for our order to not only discover when we got home that our salad didnt include dressing and all our sides were wrong.  Say your time and money by going elsewhere"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the family take out meal we ordered tonight. The chicken kabobs had no vegetables, and we received pita that was Cole and stale. Also we were missing salad topping (feta, onions, peppers, and other toppings). Looking forward to a meal, but was disappointed. We've gotten this meal many times, and this one is missing so much tonight."}
{"text":"I just tried at 8:43 pm to order chicken kabobs to take home. They have already turned off their grill and said they could only provide salads and pitas. They could not do anything hot. They close at 9pm."}
{"text":"I called in a to go order. The guy that answered was very short and acted like he had somewhere better to be. He was extremely rude. When I picked up the order I asked for it to be repeated because he seemed distracted when I got my order. He was acting smart and repeating 5 different meals back to me. I found out his name is Jeremy. A manager needs to teach this person some manners."}
{"text":"I been to different Zoes around Charlotte more than a dozen times.  They are quick with good, healthy food and a good value.  The reason for the two stars is due to my latest experience at the South Park location.  Ordered on-line for take-out for my family ($85 order) and when I got it home the order was wrong.  Got something I did not order and several items I ordered were missing.  Too late and too much trouble to return to the store (plus we were hungry), so we ate what we got.  It was good, but not what we paid for.  Later I went on-line to provide feedback (which they enthusiastically ask for), told them about my experience.  3 weeks and I have heard nothing.  I have sent a second email, so we will see what happens."}
{"text":"We purchase our staff lunches from Zoes and have had an incredible experience each and every time!! The family meal is perfect for a small office lunch and the food is fresh, healthy and prepared on time. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious and I would've given it 5 stars, except when I was ordering over the phone I felt like there was a communication issue. I usually would've let it slide as a phone issue, but when I got to the restaurant the cashier and I were talking a little and she kept using \"Fuck\" and \"shit\" in her sentences.  It didn't bother me, but it was very unprofessional. 

5 stars for the delicious food that made me moan. Minus 1 star for the unprofessional cashier."}
{"text":"Zoe's is probably one of my favorite places to eat in the Midtown area of Charlotte.  The service is wonderful, the staff are the kindest and the food is the freshest! I could eat my Hummus Plate usual everyday!!"}
{"text":"The Rosemary Ham and Mozzarella Panidina was delicious. The potato salad had a little too much prettier in it, but still quite good. Staff was extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Fast and convenient healthy place for lunch.  Salads are always fresh and crisp.  Service very prompt.  If you want something light, try the side greek salad and add grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Zoe's does it right every time! Clean, GREAT food, and amazing service! All the staff are very friendly and helpful. Lots of food for a great price! Everything is very fresh and the chocolate cake is soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Probably the most poorly run Zoe's you could imagine.  10 people waiting on orders for I've 15 minutes, most of which came out incorrectly.  Do NOT order online.  They can't get it right."}
{"text":"We needed a quick dinner and stopped at Zoe's Kitchen for a sandwich.  I was immediately tantalized by the Gruben Sandwich, and ordered it with a side of roasted veggies.  What a delightful surprise. . .real roasted veggies: broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, onions deliciously not overcooked.  The sandwich was also bursting with flavors.  This place is so far above \"fast casual\" dining that it deserves big Kudos."}
{"text":"This place is great! Friendly service, and amazing food for a good price. It was my first time in today and I will be back many more times.They have many different gluten free options on the back of the menu, which helped me out a lot. They also make their hummus fresh. It is a must have!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and delicious! I love the Greek chicken pita with a Greek salad-so yummy!"}
{"text":"I've sample a few dishes from Zoe's and I haven't been disappointed with anything I've had yet. The hummus is great, the salads are great, the sandwiches are great, the pitas are great, the kabobs are to DIE for and I am in love with their freshly squeeze limeade! The selection of sides here are amazing and I love how they are made as healthier alternatives to the traditional side. For example the slaw and the potato salad are made with no mayo and still manage to taste amazing.

The decor in here is lovely, it's very bright and clean looking and the manage to have a decent amount of seating for how small of a space it is. You never have to wait too long for your food which is great considering it's all made to order. It's a bit pricier then say grabbing some fast food during lunch but it's a lot healthier too and I never feel guilty or bad after eating here. They also have all their nutritional information available online which I really appreciate. 

The employees here are also really friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great sandwich! I got the chicken salad sandwich with the red potato salad. Relatively inexpensive for the area, with a decent amount of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken kabob original full of flavor and fresh  the homemade lemon lime drink was perfectly tart  It was reasonably priced and quick service  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Super yum! I love this place and so glad it opened in South Park. Relatively easy in and out. Quality food. I love the tossed Greek (with no onions) or the chicken roll ups or the tomato soup and Greek salad combo. I mix their sweet tea and the hibiscus tea for a favored sweet blend. I've also used call ahead for pick up and ordered online."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's Kitchen! I have had dinner here several times and ordered catering as well. I have always had a great experience. The food is always delicious and hot! I love the grilled chicken dinner with the veggies. I also like the chicken kabobs and the pita bread is awesome. The service is always pretty good. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love eating here. The food is healthy, fresh, and most importantly it tastes good. The salad dressing they make is some of the best I've ever had and we always keep a bottle of it at home for our salads. The service is great...fast and friendly. They have outdoor seating which is always nice on a pretty day.  If you have children you won't have any problems finding things on the menu that they will want as well!"}
{"text":"I've been here about ten times or so. The food is good quality like you'd expect from a Zoe's. Staff is very friendly. However, the wait time PER PERSON is definitely an outlier in a bad way. With Zoe's bring as big and corporate as they are, they must measure this statistic. Not sure why they can't fix it at this particular location though."}
{"text":"Healthy, tasty and quick. The Trifecta. Hard to find. I didn't even really know what kind of food it was before I went. I guess it's contemporary Mediterranean?

I got the chicken kabobs per the recommendation of the friendly cashier. Chicken was very good, nicely spiced. Comes with rice pilaf and greek salad, both were done well. Overall a healthy, tasty meal and a great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Visited yesterday with family.   It was after the normal rush.  I have always enjoyed the food.  The chicken wrap wasn't as fresh as usual and the wrap a little stale and not much lettuce either.    I normally love love the red potato salad, which is served up warm.  It was ice cold.  It was good, but it's normally warm which brings out a better flavor.  Not sure what happened this visit.  
I'd say to staff, just because it slows down and the \"rush\" is over, please don't neglect the normally great service and quality food you offer up when it's busy.  Not pleased this visit, but it's normally very good."}
{"text":"Located in a really nice area of Charlotte with your choice of inside or patios seating! The staff here is very friendly and the food here always tastes fresh. Being a full time athlete when I think of healthy eating, this is the first place I think of. Lots of great selections for anyone to try! The best item on the menu in my opinion would be the steak rolls with pasta salad. I always leave satisfied and recommend everyone to try! This franchise is fresh, healthy and a nice first change to your healthy living!"}
{"text":"Zoes is pretty good.  It's decently cheap and has quality food delivered quickly, which is why I am a regular customer.  I gave it three stars because their food is inconsistent at times.  For instance,  on my visit tonight, the humus and pita appetizer was below par with what I've previously experienced, as was my steak roll.  I wish I could give them 3.5 stars.  I feel like 3 isn't enough, but 4 would certainly be too much.  I will come back."}
{"text":"Pretty crowded! U will be surrounded by lots of kids and mummies at weekends! Not the place I would like."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing even at Zoe's Kitchen and was off the charts!!!  Our guest loved the food, the atmosphere and the friendly staff!  Even our the staff at our office eats there twice a week.  The food is fresh and healthy and the price meets the quaility.  Would recommend Zoe's to anyone.  My favorite so far is there Chicken pita pizza. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch for the first time today.

Very nice, bright and friendly interior. 

I ordered the Chicken Kebab and a cup of their lime-aid.

The kebab came with rice and a greek salad and was brought to the table by their friendly staff.

Nothing wrong with the food but also not \"extraordinary\"... I thought the salad could have used more \"oomph\" (took me a while to figure out what that yellow/red stuff in the bottle in the middle of the table was ;-) and the chicken was a little bland.

I found the lime-aid to sweet for my taste.

Still, an OK place to maybe take the kids to for a quick lunch some time - at least it's healthy!"}
{"text":"We always receive great service here and really good food.  It's healthy if you leave off the chocolate chip cookie -- but who wants to do that?  The chicken and shrimp kabobs are my favorite.  The soups are refreshingly healthy.  Be sure to download the Zoe's app and get free food every time you go!"}
{"text":"Stopped in over my lunch hour with my husband while trying to squeeze in both lunch and errands at the Target across the street.  First tip, park in the bottom level of the Target and walk over.  You'll have a better chance at finding a good spot there.

Nice, modern decor and outdoor seating seems promising upon first arrival.  However, after some probing about the tuna pita the staff admits that it is canned tuna.  I've never eaten can tuna but I do give it to my cat.  Against my better judgment I decided to order it any way.  It was edible but confirms my previous decision about canned tuna.

My husband ordered the turkey on ciabatta.  Again, nothing special here.  My side of vegetables looked charred and soaked in oil.  One bite and I was done.  The side of beans my husband ordered were probably also canned.

If you are looking for a healthier alternative to greasy fast food then it might do in a pinch but if you have the time to spare keep driving to find a better healthy alternative.  Not to mention, two meals and one lemonade came to $17.00+.  For that price you can find fresh food around Charlotte that isn't prepackaged."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great price and very convenient for catering and takeout. I'm so glad this new location is open! Parking is a challenge, that's nothing out of the ordinary due to it's location. All 3 times I have been have had excellent and fast customer service."}
{"text":"Food is good. The dinner for 4 is quick, easy, and feeds the entire family. I highly recommend Zoe's."}
{"text":"I must be missing something. Zoe's strikes me as just average fast fresh fare.  The food is okay and fairly priced.  The decor is not much different from the nearby McDonalds.  Good but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Great food! I was looking for something different and less processed and this place is awesome! Lots of options and you can mix and match pretty much everything. They also sell their sides to go which is great so you can take a quart home to enjoy all week! I've tried the steak and salmon and both were cooked perfectly with great flavor but not over spiced. The hummus is made in house and you can really taste the difference. The only negative so far is that their sweet tea tasted soured to me, but the unsweetened tea and unsweetened green tea were really good. At dinner the line wasn't very long and our wait time on our food wasn't long either. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"While on my way to a neighboring establishment I discovered Zoe's Kitchen in Scottsdale. I have always wanted to give their Phx location a try, so this was my chance. I am a vegan and ordered the veggie pizza and salad. I neglected to inquire if these qualified as vegan (My Fault-they did not) and when the salad arrived, I explained my situation and they could not have been nicer about it. They remade the salad sans cheese and recreated the pizza to be vegan and EXTRA good! Wonderful staff, nice atmosphere. reasonable priced and delicious!"}
{"text":"Not too bad... But I say that with hesitancy. 

I had the pita pizza, which was delicious, but extremely overpriced. For $11 I got a small drink, \"pita pizza\" (which was really just a regular-sized pita topped with marinara, chicken, and feta), and a dinky salad that had no dressing. 

There are better deals on the menu... One of my friends got the \"gruben\" sandwich with a bag of chips (sans drink) for a bit over $7... but she couldn't even eat the thing because it was falling apart. 

As far as the space goes, it was clean and the workers were friendly enough. It was super loud, and definitely not intimate (if that's what you're going for). I'm not sure if I would go again because, in all honesty, it is a tad over-priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Went to ZoÃ«s Kitchen tonight for supper. It was fresh and tasty. The restaurant had modern decor, giving a young and colorful vibe. I had the Mediterranean chicken, my daughter had the chicken rollups, and my wife had the chicken kebabs, it was delicious and healthy! I left ZoÃ«s feeling light, not bloated, and ready to come back! Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch stop. A dollar or two more then most places but you cam tell the extra money is going into the food as the ingredients are higher quality. Sandwiches, salads and pitas."}
{"text":"kind of a weird cafeteria system. But the good is good and healthy."}
{"text":"Tasty deli style food, small portions, interesting ambience.

Go up to the counter and order, help yourself to fountain drinks.

The furniture is really interesting, kinda bauhas, but the place is sunny inside and has a friendly casual atmosphere of professional patrons.

For the portion size, the cost is prohibitive. Don't come here hungry expecting to spend thriftily."}
{"text":"Had their signature Zoe's grilled sandwich.. It was delicious! Especially with their home made dressing."}
{"text":"I love Every Vegetarian/Vegan option they provide, and the portions are very generous. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: The general manager contacted me to apologize for the way my wife and I were treated last night. He gave us three free entrees and a gift card. I definitely respect the effort he made to remedy the situation. Very personal touch and I appreciate that. Thanks!

I've never been treated so poorly by a restaurant manager. I called in a \"to go\" order and was told to pick it up in 15 mins. My wife waited patiently in the restaurant for 35 mins and asked repeatedly when our order would be ready. She was told that a catering order came in and that our two entree order had to wait until the catering order was finished. At 40 min mark I spoke the the shift manager and told him this was unacceptable. Instead of any hint of an apology he corrected me by telling me I had only waited 34 mins. Once again I explained that this was unacceptable to which he accused me of being rude. He told me that he was going to comp my order but he was no longer b/c I was \"rude\". He told us that if we didn't like how it was being handled that we should go somewhere else which we would have except that we had already paid. It's not okay to take money from a customer then treat them with such disrespect. No respect for our time and definitely did not value us as customers. Come to find out they got our order wrong. Only had 40+ mins to get it right. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but great experiences with Zoe's.  We have used them for business lunches, and I come here a lot on my own.  The food is simple, fresh, and somewhat healthy, and the prices aren't bad.  The staff has always been very pleasant, which is always a plus.  I love the protein plate and the Chicken Slaw Pita.  Also, you can ask for baked chips if you don't want the regular ones!"}
{"text":"Tried Zoes Kitchen for the first time and the food was great. Everything had a lot of flavor and descent portions. The employees were so friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow this was my first time at Zoes and I was not impressed...first of all I could not order my meal because the lady that was in charge kept barking orders to the kitchen. Second of all my food came out really late.. I asked who was the person in charge and the guy attending me told me it was Maria(the lady that kept yelling to the workers in the kitchen). When I asked to speak to her she showed no concern what so ever about my complain. Bad management skills all I have to say is that I will not be back to Zoes kitchen."}
{"text":"Hipster pretentious food that only caters to the untrained western palate. It's boring!"}
{"text":"Was in there last week during my normal visit.. I couldn't help but noticed new staff since the regulars have always exceeded above and beyond the expectations of what customer service should be.. I didn't think twice before going in an ordering my food.. That was mistake! Was so used to going and seeing the same familiar and friendly faces, they alreminiady knew what I always went in for.. Now when I asked for my food in a particular way I noticed this seemed to bother them..this new staff no longer wanted to go out of their way to satify customers... It really upset me how the new manager didn't take a second to acknowledge me or take into account the fact that I wanted my food done in a particular manner.. I'm really disappointed in my visit and it hurts to say I will visit a different location from now on.."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything I have tried is excellent!  I love ordering online and doing takeout.  Great healthy yummy food!"}
{"text":"In one word if I had to describe Zoe's kitchen it would be \"Fresh\". 

Atmosphere is relaxing and calming. 

Food is ok, but bland needs a little bit of additional flavor. The vegetables roasted or otherwise taste fresh. This is definitely a healthier version of Panera with a Greek twist. 

The only complaint would be the space where you get your drinks. Not only do you have to get your drinks, but also your utensils, napkins and a lid and it makes it a difficult in a 10ft space while you are trying to hold a table number. God forbid there is someone behind you also trying to get their drink or a refill.  

Should have had two drink stations put in like Starbucks or Caribou does with their condiment bars."}
{"text":"Zoes Kitchen in Flower Mound served me the worst Steak kabobs I have ever had!
The Steak kabobs have always been my favorite, these were so tough you could hardly cut with the knife. There was no real flavor in the meat, I only ate the potatoes and vegs and left the kabobs. I complained to the counter and more was served. These were worse than before. We left food!"}
{"text":"Zoe's reminds me of Noodles and Company, amped up, grown up, and more consistent. Ultra fresh (you'll never find slimy, wilted salad leaves here, or dried up looking lemons) and friendly, this is one of my favorite quick eateries. After my first time here, I obsessed over it so much I had to go the next day. No joke. 

My favorite dish here is the shrimp or chicken kabob plate. Not only is the protein super tender and seasoned well, it goes well with the rice, the accompanying salad has big hunks of salty tangy feta. 

Their big honkin brownies/chocolate cake pieces finish out my meal. Some people would accuse this confection of being too dry, or lacking more frosting. Sometimes a big super moist decadent cake isn't what you need. 

The take home tubs of pasta salad or hummus are delicious too, and a nice alternative to packaged grocery store hummus. 

The only thing that could earn my fifth star is how the restaurant handles busy weekends. Tables sometimes aren't cleared and it's not very appealing to see half-eaten wraps and crumpled napkins strewn about. 

PS. Another plus for me...the large plastic water and drink glasses and lemons. I can't stand tiny little glasses that require frequent filling up."}
{"text":"The manager working the register is so friendly and sweet! Fruit bowl is actual fresh fruit and deeelicious! The spinach and chicken wrap has great flavor! Quick service, good food, friendly staff! I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to stop if you're short on time and would like a healthier option. There are plenty of vegetarian options on the menu, and you'll find pitas, sandwiches, and salads that are a nice change from other chain lunch stops in town. Although I don't frequent this place, I have noticed that there isn't much variation in flavor between the menu items here; this is probably due to the fact that Zoes tends to use the same key ingredients in many of the dishes--they just rearrange them. Nevertheless, the spinach rollups are yummy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has serious service issues 3 out of 5 times eating here.... The management needs to evaluate the staff here.  

Be prepared...."}
{"text":"This is a kinda Greek place that serves a nice selection of somewhat healthy foods. I wished they had actually called the dishes their real Greeks names (ie: gyros, souvlaki) but they have to appeal to Southerners who aren't always up for weird words. (gyros = yeee roes).
Anyways, we had the hummus and salad plate which was very good. The chicken roll ups were nice and warm with a definite Greek flavor, the shrimp kebabs were entirely too spicy, though. My 11 year old loves spicy so he ordered these knowing it would be a little hot. They were scorching hot. I wish they would've noticed that a kid was ordering this and said something. The \"pick 2\" that my 16 year old got was less successful. He opted for the cookie side dish -other choices were salad, fruit, dessert or hummus which is a nice selection - but his sandwich was TINY and the cookie didn't round out the meal much by making it full-size. Go for a bigger side dish unless you aren't that hungry! 
My one complaint was the pita. It's very good here, warm little triangular pieces served with the meal and with the hummus, but they don't give you enough! There was easily a half cup of hummus on my salad plate but only 4 triangles which was probably the size of a small pita or even half of a larger one. I asked for more when I went inside (we ate on the patio which was nice) and the girl there seemed baffled. They should be throwing this stuff around left and right because it is dirt cheap, calls out for hummus and a drink and really makes for a well-rounded looking meal. So, I said we had too much hummus left and needed more pita. She brought out...4 triangles. We actually laughed because these things are about the size of one Doritos chip. Oh, well. It was tasty, at least!
The bill came to $35 for 2 meals,1 half sandwich and cookie and 1 hummus and salad plate. Not expensive but not cheap. Healthy and fresh and nicely different. Good for kids, too!"}
{"text":"Good food that's good for you and your pocketbook.  Friendly staff and very clean establishment."}
{"text":"Great customer service!    Our food was delayed coming out.  Other customers that came in after us received their food before us; we've all been in this situation before.  To make up for it, Zoes refunded our entire bill AND gave us a $20 gift card.   Great food and service.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Love Zoes!  Real food, cooked to order and always delivered with a smile!  

Two of my favorite dishes include the Greek Chicken Pita (grilled chicken breast, lettuce and feta) and Orzo Tabouli Salad with Shrimp kabobs (baby spinach, tomatoes, orzo).  Both are light yet filling and always satisfying!

{"text":"Love this place. The salad hummus plate is one of my favorite plates. The chicken slaw is really great. Never been disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"The chicken kabobs were quite disappointing. The chicken was super dry. However, the sides that came with it was good. We also got the beef kabobs. Those were much much better. The beef was moist and tender. The potatoes were excellent. Also from those two, the hummus and pita was ok. I've had better but it's worth getting. Btw, don't forget the cookie. That's pretty good."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week. The chicken kebobs are great, and the roll-ups (steak, chicken, or spinach) are terrific. Most items on the menu are lower-cal, so this is a great place for those who are counting calories."}
{"text":"The worst service and rude servers i ever got access! They had no clue what they were doing or serving. Very rude and not organized, we waited 30mins to get our order and when it finally arrived it was the wrong one and we mentioned that this is not what we ordered the server rolled her eyes to us. Basically those two women working in the front are just the worst thing in Zoes kitchen! Dont ever go to that location you will be treated like shit here!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food!!!! Period!!! Sandwiches are great!!! Customer service is great!!! I was at the counter while ordering, i was asking about the cake, they had on display and the guy gave me a free slice o cake cuz it was my first time there!!  cool place, good food."}
{"text":"Matt was such a nice guy. It was my first time in and he was incredibly patient with my friends and me as we continuously asked a bunch of questions. The food is also........ SO good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went to this spot this past Sunday, nothing to get excited about it.  It's totally overpriced \"greek\" food.  There isn't much of a selection on the menu, just a few sandwiches and some kebob platters.  The chicken kebobs are just ok, the rice pilaf tastes like crap out of a box.  I paid $12 for chicken kebob entree and a vitamin water, I could've gone to  Greek Isles nearby and had better food for less. If this is supposed to be fast food, it should cost a lot less than $12 for a meal with a drink."}
{"text":"I usually love going to Zoe's but had a sub par experience yesterday. I placed a call-in order and still waited 20 minutes for my food at Zoe's. I paid for my order using a gift card that was sent to me via email, and the cashier said they didn't accept gift cards via email.  My husband used the gift card previously at this location, so I know it worked when the barcode in the email was scanned. I asked her to try again, and she reluctantly did, and the gift card worked. Finally, when I got home, I found that my braided white bean order contained mostly broth and a few beans lingering in the bottom of the container. I was disappointed by my experience, but the food tasted delicious, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"What a great find! 
Down for the my first spring training and will definitely go back to this place. David and his crew were on the mark. I had the 
HUMMUS & PITA - Excellent
TABOULI SALAD - Fantastic w/ STEAK KABOBS"}
{"text":"Good food. It's always been fresh during each of my last visits. It's a good change from the same ol usual eats. I love the roast veggies."}
{"text":"This Zoes Kitchen location is convenient to the Steele Creek, Lake Wylie, Tega Cay areas. Love the salmon kabobs, lentil soup and quinoa bowls."}
{"text":"We enjoy the healthy fresh food options and  it's a nice change from the same few casual restaurants in the area.  The staff is always courteous and pleasant, although sadly for them they appear short staffed and overworked but seem to handle it.  My complaint is that they are always out of rice or orzo soup and this occurs at 6:30 on a Friday night.  Practically each time we've been there they are out of a popular item.  I would think they would now be able to estimate the amount of a popular side dish and plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I stop by there occasionally at lunch with a Ci-worker.  I always go for the chicken kabobs.  Excellent flavor and taste.  Excellent service, even during the busiest of times."}
{"text":"I ate at Zoe's for the first time today, and what a great lunch it was! It was snowing today so there wasn't a whole lot of people out so there was next to no one at Zoe's. I say that because our food came out really fast. I don't know if it'll be different when crowded. I ordered the chicken rolls with a side greek salad and it was awesome! I look forward to going back and trying more from their menu."}
{"text":"My sandwich was tasty, but very very small. It had very little turkey on it.  For 8 bucks, not worth it whatsoever. The slaw was ok, nothing special.  Probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Just picked up take-out from Zoe's after ordering online. The whole process was super quick and easy. I literally walked in, was handed my order, and walked out. Paid online... It was was great!
Then, the food was DELISH! First time visitor, so I didn't know what to expect.
I'll be honest , I needed hangover food, but wanted to stay relatively healthy. I'm so glad I chose this place. I can see why people love it!
My friend and I shared the chicken rollups with the white beans as a side and the chicken salad sampler plate. Everything was great and I don't feel bad about eating it either. 
I'll be back to try other menu items for sure :)"}
{"text":"Janeka is right - this place does rock! Amazingly good and fresh food! Love all the healthy options. Can't wait to try every single thing on the menu. The staff - can't say enough nice things about all of them. So sweet and accommodating and all seem to really enjoy their jobs. This is my new go-to place for lunch!  :o)"}
{"text":"While it's not quite the meal we were expecting, it ain't half-bad, either. The prices are, perhaps, a bit  higher than I might anticipate for the atmosphere (the fast-casual was a surprise, as from the patio seats we'd often seen outside, I somehow was expecting some basic table service), but given the variety and types of ingredients they use, I can understand ponying up a couple more dollars than you might otherwise throw down for a 'typical' fast food experience.

The food was good, fresh, fast. Husband was surprised to see a side salad delivered before his pita pizza (both of which he enjoyed). My greek salad with grilled chicken was plentiful and fresh, with lots of crunchy vegetables, briny feta and olives, and still-warm chicken on top. The potato salad (vinegar-style, not mayonnaise-based) at the bottom of the dish was a somewhat odd addition - not wholly unwelcome, but not something I'm used to in my salad. I found the lemony vinaigrette to be a better salad dressing choice than the bottles of Greek Oil/Vinegar mix that sit on all of the tables, though Husband used the bottled stuff for his salad, and also liked dipping his leftover pita into it.

We liked our meal well enough, and if we were caught on a major shopping expedition in the area might stop by again for a quick meal - but general we prefer something a little more sit-downy, with an ambiance that entices us to linger a little longer."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat!  Fresh and clean!  Love the steak stack!  It is tender and extremely yummy!"}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy meals.  Came with family at off hour so parking was fine.  Friendly staff, quick service, tasty meals, kid friendly.  I highly recommend Zoe's!"}
{"text":"If there was a way to give this place zero stars, I definitely would. Any place where the first impression is that the floor looks mighty dirty does not sound promising at all. 

We walked in at 7.15 on a Saturday night and there was no line at the counter. The place had 4-5 tables that were occupied inside and another 2-3 occupied outside. The rest of the 10 or so tables inside had dirty dishes and/or crumbs and leftovers piled on them. In addition, the floor was a complete mess. One of the wait staff offered to clean a booth for us when she heard me comment to my husband that there was no clean table to sit at. I had to call her back to clean the floor at the booth which was littered with straws, olives, paper napkins and crumbs. Definitely not a good start at all.

We went to order the food and they told us that they were all out of the pilaf - at 7.15 on a Saturday night!!! We ordered chicken kabobs with roasted veggies and seasonal fruit as well as a Greek salad. Since I signed up for their email updates, we were entitled to receive a free order of  hummus and pita chips. We showed the email for the free appetizer to the cashier who said he will ring it up as free and then somehow forgot to do it! We noticed that we were charged for it and he had to go back and void that. Sigh! But hey, we were still positive as mistakes can happen anywhere. 

By the time our food arrived, we had been in the place 15 minutes or so and none of the wait staff seemed inclined to clear the dirty vacated tables or clean the filthy floor!

When our food arrived, I had to take it right back to the counter as the kabobs and the veggies were cold. Like they had been sitting out for a long long time. The kabob skewers were replaced by ones that were lukewarm instead of cold and the veggies from the old plate were just dumped back into the new plate along with the kabobs. By then, I had lost patience with the whole establishment and decided not to take them back a second time. The kabobs were not juicy and were bland and tasteless - very meagerly seasoned. However, the veggies in the salad were fresh and crunchy. And their house Greek dressing is excellent. 

Needless to say, we will not be returning to this place anytime soon. We are big fans of Mediterranean food and have eaten at Zoe's Kitchen at Ballantyne and Southpark. Both locations are excellent and have great food and service. This place is a shame to the franchise of an excellent restaurant chain. 

You can see in the photos I have uploaded how dirty the floor is. This is well after the tables have been vacated. I wish that there was also a way to portray how unappetizing the food was in the photos. 

Also, they have free wi-fi, but it is an absolute joke! Do not bother to connect to their network. You will grow old trying to just download text (not even graphics)!"}
{"text":"They finally got tzatiki!!!! Been going here for years for the chicken skewer meal or the tossed Greek salad-- both delicious by the way, but was always left needing a side of tzatiki for my chicken and pita. Now, all is well with the world. Yum."}
{"text":"I called in a lunch order for 32 people today at 10:45 and Danielle and the team at Zoe's Waterfront had it ready to go by noon! The food was top-notch, fresh and delicious. They put each person's order in an individual box, labeled with their name. For a corporate orders, Zoe's nails it! Love their reliability and service. Plus the chicken roll-ups are one of a kind. I've been ordering them since high school."}
{"text":"I have had Zoe's cater for several business lunches and the food is always a rave review by guests.  Much better than Jason's  Deli, and healthier choices too."}
{"text":"Staff inattentive & has no sense of customer service. The food is good though. It would be nice if they tried to earn a customers business with good service."}
{"text":"Wife & I both ordered the chicken pitas, and split an order of baked falafel. On a mildly busy Saturday afternoon it took 17 minutes for the food to come out, they waited to bring my beer along with the food? The falafel had the consistency of a dried stale oatmeal cookie & crumbled into pieces. Chicken was just okay, don't think they marinated it like a typical Mediterranean or Greek restaurant would, just plain grilled. Pita bread was just okay. Tzatziki was kind of bland. All and all a forgettable chain restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service from manager... out of what ordered and didn't even tell me for 30 after I ordered and was waiting. People all around not getting foods and mistakes! Been to other locations and great but would not come back into this one!!!! Stay away! Handing out stuff to tables around and walk pass us 4 times! Rude!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Zoe's is definitely a place I visit regularly. The location is very central, but the parking can be a pain sometimes. Parking in the parking deck is always complicated what with people flying in and out of Trader Joe's and Best Buy. I usually parallel park on the side of the restaurant.

Every time I go I get the Grilled Shrimp Salad with marinara sauce instead of the dressing. The shrimp are marinated in a sauce that is rather oily and are left with their tails on, but the delicious chargrilled zucchini and white beans make up for it. Their pita bread is rather good too, but perhaps a little too much flour.

The drinks are self-serve and they offer green tea which I founded refreshing. 
This place can get rather crowded during peak times so I try to come at odd hours. The service is a little slow, but I suppose that's because they make everything fresh. It's kind of expensive for being a casual sandwich, salad and soup place, but the freshness is worth it.

I love sitting outside during the warmer months and people-watching. The staff is very polite and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Went recently and they vastly downsized all of their portions. I won't be back and I used to eat here at least two or three times a week. It's a shame businesses feel the need to cut corners after they become establish. OHSO did the same thing. Customers are too savvy to put up with this nonsense. I literally felt ripped off by the amount of food served to me for the price I paid. I ordered a hummus trio which was literally three tablespoons of hummus. (One tablespoon per flavor). I also had the quinoa salad and they put about one quarter the amount of quinoa they usually put on and it has zero broccoli in it. Not the mention the bed of lettuce it sat on was a small handful at best. Please rethink visiting this place especially if you are used to the way it used to be. They will skimp on you. Thanks"}
{"text":"This isn't a Mediterranean place per se. I'm actually not really sure what it is. We'll call it a smorgasbord of lunch goodies. It's a cute place and I've been in for lunch a few times. It's not anything to write home about but  I enjoyed it. A reasonably priced place if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Zoe's is fine, if you take it for what it is: a casual, counter-service spot to grab a quick bite during your lunch break. The food I've had there has been fresh and well prepared. Not particularly flavorful or inventive but I think you get a decent amount for your money because the sandwiches include a side (I'd go for the fresh fruit or the yummy pasta salad) and chips. I'd recommend the chicken tortilla roll-ups or the egg salad sandwich. I've been satisifed with both. 

I just wanted to offer my two cents because I feel like this place gets a bit of a bad rap on Yelp from people who are seemingly disgruntled that Zoe's sandwiches or ingredients are not more \"quality\" or \"gourmet,\" but if you just adjust your expectations, you'll realize that you're actually getting quite a decent & convenient lunch for $6.75."}
{"text":"So to start...I love all things Zoe's! Their lentil soup is my absolute favorite. Today I ordered a quart of it to have later. I usually check my food before I leave but I've never had a problem with their soup so I just left. Well I just took it out the bag and something seemed different. My lentil soup was extremely watered down. I'm used to it having a thickness to it and I really felt like they just gave me tomato broth with lentils and carrots in it. Not what I was expecting or what I was excited to have. Very disappointed today."}
{"text":"Zoes is apparently very disliked by the I'm-too-edgy-for-Phoenix-but-can't-cut-it-in-LA hipster \"gourmand\" crowd. I prefer their salad dressing to Newman's, though, and that chocolate cake is a damned mouthgasm. The limeade is good too although I'm sure every sip brings me closer to diabeetus.

It's essentially fast food (what's the Greek equivalent to 'gringo'?) but I've never had a bad bite there. I ordered the protein plate in my Atkins days and now typically the Greek salad, which comes just as I like it, with absurd amounts of feta cheese. The potato salad is made with their dressing which I prefer to the standard gloppy mayo-soaked crap."}
{"text":"It's hard to pick which was the worst part of my last meal at Zoe's.  I used to eat at Zoe'a anywhere from 1-3 times a week - always the tossed Greek salad.  

And almost every week, it arrives (I generally order thru Postmates for lunch) different than the last time.  Sometimes it has pasta salad in it, sometimes potato salad. Sometimes cucumbers, often not.  Sometimes no olives, which is particularly strange for a 'Greek' salad...

But this last week was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.  For about the 6th time in the last 6-8 months, the salad arrived without one of the main ingredients - the grilled chicken and onions combo.  This is a tough one to forget, being a main ingredient and all.  But much to my surprise, this wasn't even the worst part of this delivery.

I called the location to let them know they forgot the chicken.  Additionally, I wanted them to know that these screw-ups occur way to often for an item like this.  It would be like ordering a hamburger at McDonalds and getting your order without the meat (and let's not debate whether that is meat or not....)

I asked to speak to the manager on duty.  He gets on the phone, I tell him what has happened, gave him background about how often this has happened - and that if they can't fix the problem, I'm going to have to stop ordering from Zoe's, despite the fact that I really like the food.  But getting the order wrong almost all the time is just frustrating.  The assistant manager offers me a free salad.  This is great, and I'm grateful for that - but what I really want is for them to just make the salad right, and I explain this to the manager.

So here is where it just goes off the rails.  The manager proceeds to tell me I should be more grateful for a free salad, and that he isn't on the actual cook line and can't check that every order is made perfectly.

I was speechless.  It actually took me a second to process what the 'manager' just said - he's not on the line, therefore can't verify or be responsible for the quality of the product of the location - he is in charge of.   It come to think of it, he might have said he was the assistant manager, so maybe that explains it....

Needless to say, Zoe's is not just off my menu, but my department's lunch menu as well.....

Edit - I can't seem to reply to you, Bethany, so while I appreciate your offer, I am going to decline.  I forgot to mention another issue in my review.  Since the assistant manager was less than polite or helpful, I asked to speak to the overall manager.  He said she (I think it was a she) was out and back in tomorrow.  I said it is very important that she call me, given the repeated issues.  I gave him my number, but she never called.  That was really the last straw, and why my company won't be ordering from Zoe's any longer as well."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS! I suggest the tuna sandwich on sourdough. It was so fresh and flavorful that sometimes I dream about it. This place is very modern and stylish but with a nice twist on Mediterranean food. I can't wait to try more on the menu, this might become my weekly go-to place!"}
{"text":"For someone who is new to semi healthy eating out.
I loved the Zoe's Club Pita. First meal, from a place of the like, that i finished everything that it came with. Minus the mustard of course.
I would like to try the Chicken Kabobs next time as they were sold out for the day."}
{"text":"Man, I totally love the food at this place. The difficult part is when you are ordering takeout. Every single time I call in they mess up my order and have even charged my card twice for a dinner I had bought. Make sure when you eat here you are paying attention to what they are doing."}
{"text":"I love ZÃ¶es Kitchen's food, of course. But their staff is always so friendly and sweet every time I come here to get food before work! I always try and come to this location just because of the awesome staff and food. Normally when I place to go orders they come out cold (at other restaurants not here) but my food is always super hot and fresh here! Love this place!"}
{"text":"It's fine.  I consider it \"healthy fast food.\"  The cashier was friendly enough, and the seating and decor are solid fast food restaurant style.

I only came here to appease the appetites of someone else.  I wouldn't come back on my own accord as I don't care for the food."}
{"text":"Ordered and received wrong food. Called and manager owned up to mistake and apologized. Will update after I return to get order fixed."}
{"text":"Zoe's has some of the best food I've had. Always fresh and very tasty.  And super convenient that it's right next to a bunch of stores you could shop and stop and eat"}
{"text":"We love Zoe's Kitchen.  Foods always been great.  Never had an issue getting items Gluten Free. Place is always crowded but in a good vibrant way.  Try the protein plate it's actually tastes a lot better than it sounds."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I come in to any of their locations!  I'm on the run alot and probably eat out more than I should,  but I don't have the guilt when I eat here!"}
{"text":"I visited for the first time 1/22 and I can't wait to go back! They have a small area outside and I took my dog with me. I was offered water for my pup right away. After deciding on steak kabob plate, and using their awesome soda machine, we waited for the food which didn't take long at all. It was seriously like a home cooked meal, I loved it. Even the sides were delicious, everything tasted so fresh. Even though I ate all my food, I had to try their chocolate cake. It was great, not too sweet! Yum"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Have loved ZOES forever. However I am absolutely devestated that they are getting rid of the only thing I order, the orzo tabouli salad w shrimp kabob. I will not be coming here now that they are discontinuing this menu item. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"ZOES. All day every day. If you haven't tried this place- GO. I've had over half the menu because we go at least once a week and everything is delicious! It's fresh and flavorful and HEALTHY which is a huge plus. The orzo tabouli salad with salmon kabobs is my go to- but the gruben is a close second! Just look at the menu and try not to drool. On a no carb day you can do a protein plate with chicken, carmelized onions and their feta slaw (mm) or roasted veggies with chicken kabobs. They have a lemon vinaigrette that goes with everything. House made hummus... Kid friendly. Fast and fresh. I could go on for days. Definitely my favorite fast casual place in town!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Zoe's for my first time, as I was in the area and one of my coworkers constantly raves about it. 

My friend and I were greeted by both friendly cashiers and given time to read the menu.

It was an oddly cold day in Arizona so we each opted for a cup of tomato bisque soup. We also both selected the turkey stack sandwich (sliced turkey breast, lettuce, feta spread, tomato, mozzarella and rosemary oil), which comes with your choice of side item. She got fruit and I tried the mayo-less slaw. I was so full from the hearty soup and the slaw that I barely got two bites taken out of my sandwich before I tapped out. :(

Everything I tried was fresh and tasty. I will definitely be back to sample more menu items. 

P.S. They have the cool touch screen soda fountain for all you pop drinkers."}
{"text":"Obviously I'm still going to Zoe's kitchen on a regular basis because they kick ass. Unfortunately Seth is no longer the manager of that location but Lindsay now is and she kicks ass as well. A big thank you to the whole Zoe's staff for always keeping it real with my chicken and spinach roll ups and odd post mates requests. Oh, the brownies are so good!  Zoes stock is also on the up and up!"}
{"text":"It's really not that hard guys! Giving 2 stars because when my order is actually correct the food is good but nearly every time I order something is wrong! I have high customer service standards but I'm also understanding. I'm not sure if the problem is at the register when you're placing an order or in the Kitchen but seems like both. Just picked up the salmon kabobs (comes with side salad and rice) a side of white beans and an extra cucumber sauce. What I received: salmon kabobs (zucchini too thick and therefore not cooked) side salad, white beans, grilled veggies (!?!?!) And no extra side of cucumber sauce. Blerg! Not worth driving back."}
{"text":"Zoe's Chicken Salad Fruit Plate AWESOME~

I eat Zoe's every weekend after i get done working out.  My two favorite Healthy Items on the menu is the Chicken Salad Fruit Plate and the Lean Turkey Pita.   The fruit is a wonderful selection of green apples, grapes, strawberries, pineapple and oranges.  Sometimes you get the melons but they don't over do it.  The homemade dressing is a perfect vinaigrette that coats the salad just enough, but doesn't make it over bearing.  

Both of these items fill me up with nutrients and vitamins to help with the rest of my day, without feeling too full.  I highly recommend giving it a shot but make sure the salad dressing is included.  Sometimes they do forget it."}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time last night, I usually go to the one on mallard creek church. I met some friends for dinner and ordered my food, we sat down and friend #1's salad came out, they apologized for my wait and said my sandwich would be out soon. no worries, it's been less than 5 minutes since i ordered!
friend #2's food comes out a couple minutes later and they brought me a cookie to apologize for my wait. and my food came out a minute later.
all in all, I was waiting less than 10 minutes and hadn't even begun to wonder where my food was, at the Zoe's I usually go to I'm used to waiting AT LEAST 20 minutes for anything to be brought out. 

And i thought my food was better at this location.
All that to say, I was blown away by the customer service at this location and friendliness of the staff.

I never even thought I was waiting a long time, but the employees did, and aimed to make things right and went above and beyond when nothing was even wrong in my mind. 
Absolutely wonderful location!"}
{"text":"Pretty good!
the service has been pretty slow every time I've been, but its a great place for a yummy, healthier option."}
{"text":"Third strike, you're out.  We're regulars who come all the time but I'm done wasting my time.  Or, rather, I'm done have YOU waste my time.

I ordered online at 11:00 for 11:45 pickup.  Simple, easy Greek salad.  I got there right at 11:45.  At 12:20 I was out the door with my order.  Everyone in line who arrived AFTER me were getting served.  They seem to value their catering/car orders over their regulars.  I can understand this happening one time.  But this is the THIRD time in about a month.  Unacceptable.  Oh, plus when I did finally get my order and looked at it back at the office, the lettuce is brown and wilted while some of it is see-through like it's been frozen or something.  Thanks for valuing your die-hard patrons so highly.  Not."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how I feel about Zoes Kitchen yet. I'm a sucker for Mediterranean food which is why I think I'm getting a bit thrown off about this place.

I came thinking I could get a quick dinner on my way home from work so I wouldn't have to cook. The amount of food that came for the amount of money was very small compared to other casual fast dining but wasn't too bothered by it. I got a small starter and a sandwich for $17.

The amount of vegetarian options was underwhelming. I usually see more than they had available at other mediterannean places. I got pesto hummus with pita bread (you need to request the bread) along with the only vegetarian sandwich they had to-go.

There was only one person in line in front of me at around 6pm and 7 other people either dining in or waiting for food. It took me 15 minutes to receive my food.

The food was good! Not absolutely amazing but good nonetheless especially considering it's a fast casual restaurant. I will definitely be giving it another shot!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious, you just can't beat that.

If you're tempted to grab some fast food, but you want something much tastier and a little healthier, go to Zoe's. We had the steak roll-ups with white beans and the steak kabobs with pasta salad. Everything was awesome, it was filling, the place was clean.

It's like upscale, mediterranean fast food."}
{"text":"Excellent, healthy alternative to fast food. Staff is always pleasant and helpful. One of my favorite places to bring the family."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see Zoe's Kitchen coming to Rivergate and that it is now open.  We had gone to other Zoe's in the Charlotte area, so we already knew all about them.  They actually inspired me to make my own spinach roll-ups for the work week (eating one as I write this review).

We stopped by on Sunday afternoon for some lunch.  Kevin and I split the tossed Greek salad.  We normally get our own thing, but that sounded good to both of us and we just ended up splitting.  Ended up being enough to split.  We both thought it was very good - chicken, pasta salad, and veggies on a bed of lettuce.  We both actually thought having both the carmelized and red onions were a bit much.  Just give me a bunch of the crunchy red onions and I'm good.

Welcome to the neighborhood Zoe's.  We will be back!

PS - they sell their Greek dressing and we buy it.  We are almost low from our buy at another location, so we will have to restock soon!"}
{"text":"Good solid consistent food every time. the steak kebabs are delicious. as are the chicken. I'm always greeted with a smile and a happy face which makes all the difference in the world when you're providing a service and I want to thank you. I'll be by today!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch. The food is always great but it is definitely always crowded."}
{"text":"For more than a decade Zoes has been one of my favorite (fast food) restaurants to grab a healthy bite. This massive chain litters the South's cities, but is fairly new to the Phoenix area although more seem to open often. It's a large chain known for quality and fresh food, great service and entrees that are largely healthy. In this part of town it's a chore to decide where to eat simply because there's so many options. Zoes is on the more affordable side.  

This particular location (I've been to about 75 of their stores nationwide, maybe a few more, actually) excels at providing friendly service in a always clean atmosphere. We choose Zoes for several reasons.  Everything is made fresh, from scratch and on site daily. The food is brought in every morning, prepped and served. Yes, fresh. Every day. Where else can you find that from a fast-food type chain? 

The biggest challenge at Zoes is what to order. There's so many tasty items on the menu. Normally, we start with the Hummus Trio (classic, basil pesto and red pepper hummus). Keep in mind, they make this on site. And, there's cool, crisp veggies to dip, too. 

As for entrees there's too many good ones to list, but we're partial to the Chicken Roll Ups, Beef and Chicken Kabobs, Tossed Greek Salad, Gruben and new (ish) Power Bowls. To be fair there's nothing on the menu that doesn't reach your table cooked to perfection, well seasoned, fresh and with a friendly smile.

Zoes is ideal for couples, families, young adults and children (even this kid's meal is healthy and impressive). There's something that was made in house for everyone and packed with enough flavor to keep you coming back. It's a fast food chain that doesn't taste like fast food."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Great location. Very laid back atmosphere packed with value and healthy food. This time I tried the lean turkey pita and it was fair (still way better than Which Which. I'd stick with the Greek Pita next time. However,  the hummus and lemonade was very good. Good luck finding a better fast foos style restaurant with better quality, healthy choices and this value."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch.  Had the pimento cheese sandwich on Rye which was not exceptionally flavorful but still a decent vegetarian sandwich.  I paired that with the pasta salad which seemed like a hybrid caprese salad with goat cheese and it made me realize that I am a traditionalist when it comes to pasta salad.  The perks:  great price point, outside seating, friendly staff, clean environment."}
{"text":"I probably passed this place 100 times when I used to frequent charlotte, but didn't try it until today. I'm used to crowded LA restaurants so it was nice to come somewhere that I didn't have to wait a long time for. A great variety of food on the menu and everything looked really fresh. The people working here were so nice! Oh and I love the bottles of their home made Greek dressing on the tables. Really feels like you are at your friend's house and it's her kitchen :)"}
{"text":"Kinda lets me down. Not great food on occasion. Adore the desserts and pinto beans though. Wish it met my expectations..."}
{"text":"Overnight this location went downhill.   I get the same meal every time and I guess they have decided to cut the portions in half to be \"more by the books\" I was told.  You shouldn't leave dinner still hungry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered take out tonight and we have nothing but wonderful things to say about this place!! I got the tossed Greek salad and he got the chicken kabob. We both split the hummus trio as well. I recommend those dishes because we loved it! Such a yummy experience!"}
{"text":"Lots of delicious and healthy choices. You can eat healthy and be completely satisfied. Clean, comfortable and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"What a terrific spot to enjoy lunch in the cozy dining area. The Greek salad with grilled chicken is excellent...fresh, light and filling. I would also recommend the roll up dinners for four. We get a variety of roll ups, chicken, steak and spinach. And their chocolate cake is amazing. This place always provides top notch service."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved it! We went to ZoÃ«s Kitchen for the first time while on a family vacation this past summer, and we were so excited to see that there was a new one opening up so close to home. We got take-out after church around lunchtime and while there was a bit of a wait, it was well worth it; it was delicious! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great food.  We went 2 days in a row because we wanted to try more stuff. 

Only criticism would be around the cleanliness of the tables. Both days the restaurant was not busy yet the tables were not being cleaned. 

Healthy, fresh, yummy and quick enough! Will be back again soon and often. 

Hummus trio, chicken gyro = perfection."}
{"text":"The food is great, and I have tried just about everything on the menu. My only complaint is when you order the hummus, they give you a tiny tiny amount of pita bread. When I ask for more bread, it is unrealistically expensive for just a few more triangles of bread- like pita bread is the most valuable commodity ever. What would it take to get a full pitta bread- a bag of diamonds in trade? I normally order the hummus trio and there is enough pita bread for 1/4 of the hummus. Honestly, the food is great- but every other place I eat at that has pitta, they give a nice big stack of it so you can enjoy."}
{"text":"Typical Zoes, this one is semi more clean than the others and the staff is quite nice. Nothing really bad to say"}
{"text":"Very good! I love the chicken kabobs and I think its called greek chicken pita.  The dressing they have on the table is very good  to add. Good price and atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Wow! Awesome Food Alert! Steak quesadillas and outdoor seating equals the perfect combo. Great, healthy, quick service. Hip location around a handful of other fun places to go to. Great cookies and salads too. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We visited Zoes the other night for dinner for the first time.  I love the bright colors they use on the walls.  It's very modern and very welcoming.  It's not fancy, though, by any means, so don't bring your date here.  (You know who you are.)  

You order at the counter and then are given a number for your table.  Someone then brings the food out for you.  

They have a pretty good size menu, so to read and digest it all standing at the counter was a little difficult (and full of pressure!).  Unfortunately, nothing really jumped out at me as exciting.  I went with the Chicken Roll-Ups, which were tortillas filled with chicken and veggies that are heated up.  It was good, but nothing exceptional.  There were no particular flavors that stood out that would draw me back to that item. 

For a side, I went with their pasta salad.  Now that stood out.  It was pasta with like sundried tomatoes, feta cheese, and fresh basil.  It wasn't greasy at all and had a great combination of flavors.  

Would we return to Zoes?  Sure, probably if we're in the area and want a quick bite to eat.  I'd probably try their kabobs (the menu says it's their \"favorite\"), a salad, or their pimento cheese sandwich (they sell huge take-home tubs of it, so it must be good!)."}
{"text":"Good fresh food and it's tasty, Stopped in for Lunch as my wife and I like it better then panera and we were only looking for something relatively quick for lunch. I had the chicken Pita and my had the new feature salad that looked amazing for the price. The food came out with Hot chicken in my pita and on the salad and the greens in the salads were fresh and crunchy. we also got the hummus plate which is nice way to start a Med lunch. I Love the dress they have at the table for your food i could drink that stuff its so good. All in all I will stop at Zoes anytime i can we tend to get there food rather often at my office when we have catered lunches from Reps and I just found out there is one around the corner from my other job. We'll keep coming back because they food is fresh fast and doesn't seem to have been fast foodized like panera has."}
{"text":"Much more casual than expected.  (Everything is served on paper/styro plates/bowls.)  The food is very average.  None of it is bad, but not great either.  I had a Greek Chicken pita.  It was somewhat dry and bland and pretty small for $8.  The cole slaw was unique, but good.  Service was very average as well...not overly friendly by any means.  My wife got the salad sampler with chicken salad.  It was just okay as it didn't have a lot of flavor.  

Overall, Zoe's was very average and slightly over priced for what you receive.  For close to $20 for 2, I would much rather got to Pita Jungle for healthy wraps and pitas."}
{"text":"I ordered the cauliflower bowl with salmon. Cost me almost $14.  When it comes out it has 3 tiny pieces of salmon and extremely small portions for the price.  This dish is over priced for these portion sizes and much better value elsewhere! ***by the way the below reply from Zoe's Kitchen was just PR to look good...I replied back to their yelp email and got no response ever***"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time the other day, mind you my background is from the Caspian Sea so I know all about middle eastern, greek & armenian food!!!! 

I just had a greek salad with chicken, I thought ok it's my first time I can't go wrong, how hard is it to mess up a salad. Let me tell you that it was very delicious, all the flavoring were right on point & chicken was not dry, the feta was yummy as well! I can't wait to go back& try something else.... We need more places like that!"}
{"text":"Blah for bland.
Got the chicken slaw pita which immediately fell apart the minute I picked it up. I had to douse it with pepper and that bottle of oil they provide you with at the table for some kind of flavor. Would it kill to add a bottle of hot sauce on there too? Somethin'?
Not memorable."}
{"text":"Easy to read board when ordering the menu is a little overwhelming. I ordered a cauliflower bowl with double chicken. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"I went in here for the first time with two of my friends and the service/food is really good! The food is very fresh. Also, Matt was awesome! He talked to us and helped us pick out our food (all while being incredibly patient with us). I will be returning!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Zoes is really a hit or miss. Some days I feel like the food is AMAZING and others it feels like overpriced cafeteria food. My latest trip to this location disappointed. If I were to spend the money again, I'd go to Panara across the street"}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick bite or take out order that is healthier. Parking can be tricky during tourist season on the street, there is also parking underground and also across street for mall. Staff is always super friendly, and the food is fast and good. They make a great red hot sauce if you ask for it.  Never had a bad meal here. Fun place to people watch if you have the time."}
{"text":"First time eating here & wow was it good! Went around lunch time & the food came out in a timely manner & the place wasn't packed at all. Had the steak cabob w Italian sauce & it was sooo tasty! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Very good food! I Enjoyed the beef kabobs, salad and, grilled vegetables. I enjoyed it so much I went back a couple weeks later and had the same dinner."}
{"text":"Really liked this new spot for lunch. The staff was friendly and courteous and the food was tasty and a little different than regular lunchfare. There is a nice, healthy selection of sides when ordering a sandwich. We tried the limeade that was recommended by a friend. It was delish!

I gave it 4 starts b/c thought it was a little pricy for lunch. However, the location almost makes up for it. Can't wait to go back with my kids for dinner."}
{"text":"Zoe's was very inexpensive and yet provided many delicious as well as healthy options for customers. The staff was very nice and courteous. The food was pretty good and the menu consisted of primarily Greek cuisine but also had other options. The ambiance was also very nice and colorful. Zoe's would make an excellent mid-day lunch or dinner option."}
{"text":"I'm going to be fairly consistent with other Yelpers on this one. 

Zoe's is \"ok\". I popped in for lunch today as I was tying up some loose ends with my car dealer (Camelback Toyota--a review for another day).

I needed something quick and was in the mood for \"fresh\". Of course, I hopped on my Yelp app on my iPhone and immediatey saw Zoe's.

The menu is pretty basic. A bunch of salads, and sandwiches. 

Today, I chose the Steak Rollups with a side of potato salad. The rollups were good. Not great. It seemed like something I could've made at home. The carmelized onions were a nice touch.

Something seemed a bit off with the potato salad. The ingredients and concept seemed nice. No mayo, always a plus. But, it was clearly lacking salt, or maybe even some sort of a citrus element. Perhaps, even some rosemary, but then again, I am no chef. Just a hungry man.

My food came out within a few minutes, and the service was great.

If I come back, I will try the pimento cheese sandwiches per Joel. 

For a great thirst-buster, try the Hibiscus Green Tea. It's fantastic!

Bottom line, it's ok. I've had better, but 2 stars would be unfair."}
{"text":"Yet again - I miss the days of working down on Camelback...

1 - Egg Salad Sandwhich!  DELISH!
2 - Chocolate Cake - Totally Different - Totally DELISH!

Always clean!
Always friendly!
Always bright!"}
{"text":"The food is consistent in taste but I encountered two issues: 1. My food was cold even though I dined in and the food came relatively fast. 2. The value has changed with the menu...you don't even get bread with a kabob meal anymore, you only get bread with salad. The kids shrimp kabob was not worth the cost at all. The restaurant seemed cold (literally) and impersonal. Not sure I'll be sprinting back, I can get more value at Panera."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favourtie places to eat.  I am not sure if they have a location near my house.  I have been eating their chicken pita and the pasta salad.  That is some good stuff.  This trip was good.  I tried their lemonade and it was good.  You have to ask for it specifically because it is a different price than the soft drinks.  I tried a beef kabob and it was good.  The pasta salad has basil in it too.  The only thing I forgot was my dairy pill because they did not skimp on the cheese.  Great place and you should try it."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Chipotle, except not Mexican, with orange and green Ikea decor, and much better tasting.  Offering mostly sandwiches, salads and chicken plates, it's a good choice for someone looking for something quick and fresh.  The Gruben with the turkey, spicy mustard and sweet cole slaw is very pleasing.  The rice pilaf was very greasy and oily - I don't think I'll be ordering that again.  They also have a kids menu and a limited breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I always come here for lunch and it's fantastic. Great Mediterranean food that is healthy and quick. The service is always great and the food has always been spot on. If you are trying to grab a nice lunch on the go, then eat at Zoe's Kitchen."}
{"text":"I like the analogy that ZoÃ«s Kitchen is a greek version of Panera and great standby for those days we don't want to cook but want something quick and healthy. The service is always friendly and they have a very busy bustling lunch but they cycle people through pretty efficiently. Dinners tend to be less busy. 

Our favorite dishes are the grilled chicken dinner (because their braised white beans and roasted veggie sides are awesome), veggie pita pizza, and steak stack. However our #1 favorite dish was the salmon kebabs that we were devastated (as in the kind of devastated when I found out Alias was cancelled) to find out were discontinued. I voiced my dismay to the staff and they encouraged me to tell corporate, which I did. I told them I'd miss the succulent salmon kebabs with the great grilled zucchini, etc. I was impressed with their customer service because they replied right away that they were very sorry, that they recently switched distributors and the quality of the salmon wasn't reliably good so they'd rather not have it on the menu than be disppointing. They were seeking out alternative vendors, but they appreciated my input.  I was glad they seemed to take my concern to heart. The lack of salmon kebabs has admittedly decreased the frequency of my visits, but I'm not mad at them. I've heard their rollups are a favorite. Their limeade is also fun and very good. Skip the chocolate cake though.

I think the artwork in there is fun and colorful."}
{"text":"Well this was my last time going to this Zoe's location...I was giving them another shot after messing up my order in one way or another the last 2 times I've been here - they did it a third time. First time they actually forgot to include half of my order, causing me to drive all the way back. The next order shorted me on a steak kabob and this time they gave me an order of kabobs with just steak no seasoning, sauce or vegetables...These things would be forgivable if the orders weren't $12 each. At those prices you expect things to not be such a hassle. 
I'll drive the extra few miles to Rea Road from now on if I want Zoes Kitchen."}
{"text":"It's tempting to go to the McDonald's right next to Zoe's but I know my heart thanks me for the missed opportunities.

Zoe's is great to grab a quick healthy lunch. A variety of sandwich options and hot plate options, you'll find something to like. My faves are the egg salad and grilled chicken hot plate. I'm more in love with the rice pilaf than anything else.

The food is not extraordinary. It's just what you expect grilled chicken, greek salad and sandwiches to taste like, except if you order anything with feta, ask for it with LIGHT feta. I have to scoop off the feta when I forget. 

Some say its pricey for lunch and I think its just about right. $8-$12 for lunch is about right. So if you're looking for a healthier alternative, check Zoe's out some time and swing by McDonald's for a soft-served ice cream cone at least."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The steak kabobs were the best I have had.   David took care of us and made us feel like family.   I would suggest anyone try Zoe's if you want great food and a friendly atmosphere.  YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in and had chicken roll ups.   Loved them!   Can't get enough!   Monster cookie for desert and melted in my mouth.   Don't have Zoe's in Denver, but hope it happens soon.   Went to Zoe's twice in our three days in AZ!!,"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is so good and healthy. The service is good. I highly suggest you try it."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of Zoe's. But for me this location is just okay. It's definitely a hit or miss with customer service and cleanliness. But what remains good is the food. Like Nikki says I don't know why there's potato salad in the bottom of the Greek salad but I really...really like it. One of my new favorite things is the turkey stack simply because of the feta spread! Man, it's good. And that limeade is just the right amount of sweet and tart....I can't get enough. 

I think if they get a few things worked out I could be a fan of this location."}
{"text":"You cannot miss This place. Their bright exteriors attract customers to come in and once you have tastes their food, you are sure to go back again and again.

When I looked at the menu, it looked a little pricey but the quantity and quality they serve for that money is amazing. Tried Mediterranean Chicken and Chicken Pita Pizza and both were delicious and AMAZINGLY FRESH. 

This new place opened at walking distance from my house but I am moving now :( Would have loved to try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"One of my all-time quick lunch spots in Phoenix (both this and the McDowell location). Love the Grueben (grilled turkey, swiss, slaw, spicy mustard, rye) and chicken roll-ups (tortillas, feta, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, salsa). To me it's a great marriage of Mediterranean and American, with a little Southwestern and Mexican flair. I also really like the limeade; go for the large cup and get refills anytime you visit for 99 cents. Chocolate cake is great too. It's a little pricier than average lunches and portions are slightly smaller, but way tastier. Note that parking is way easier here; it's become very difficult at the McDowell location. Another tip - if you're on Foursquare, sign in your first time and get 10% off."}
{"text":"The chicken roll ups were really good.  The restaurant was very clean and was managed by great staff.  The manager was very friendly and seemed to be paying attention to his customers.  I really liked the outdoor seating because it was a great day for lunch outside."}
{"text":"They have labels for vegan and vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place awhile. Always consistent quality. I sent back a chicken skewer once and they took great care of me, other than that always good. I should have reviewed this place before just haven't. It wasn't until I came today that I found a reason. They have a great manager Stephanie that just really made our experience."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Zoe's. I'm happy to see a location in this area! 

I always mix it up when I come here. But no matter what I order I always grab an extra side of the potato salad. It's so good! I love that it's not mayo based! Try it one time and you'll be addicted like me. From the menu, I love the chicken rolls, Greek salads and most recently the skewers. I love that you can mix them up. Most recently, I did one salmon and one shrimp with a double order of potato salad. Both skewers were very good! I love that they come with fresh grilled veggies. 

The best part about ordering the skewers is that you get a lot of food. So you won't have to be worries about being hungry. 

Don't forget to sign up for the rewards. They will send you deals for your meals and tell you about new menu items! I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience!!!  
I love Mediterranean food but my husband isn't a big fan but we decided to give it a try.   This is my new favorite spot.   First of all what a great experience with customer service, you can tell they take pride in their restaurant and the relationship with their customers.  Very helpful with us being that we were first timers, loved our food and the place was spotless!!  We will be back and I wouldn't be surprised if it became one of our weekly stops for family dinner night!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, nice alternative to fast food. Need to work on cleanliness. Great convenient location in midtown n"}
{"text":"I like the concept for Zoes Kitchen. Basically it's healthy Mediterranean and Greek cuisine...FAST. 

But I've got to agree with previous reviews, this place stays super busy. I visited on a Saturday afternoon (I know, I know...I should expect it to be busy) and this place practically had a line out the door when I walked in and still had one as I was leaving. So just prepare yourself... 

But you can always use that extra waiting time to review the menu. You will need it, because the menu is massive. Which in the case is a good thing because they offered tons of choices including pitas, sandwiches, kabobs, and salads.

I decided to go with the Chicken Roll Ups with a Greek salad. After you order, they give you a number and bring out your food to your table. I appreciate that they keep the Greek dressing on the table. That way you can use as much (or little) as you like. 

I was surprised that even though they were busy, it didn't take long for my food to arrive:

Chicken Rolls Ups: They come stuffed with chicken, caramelized onions, feta and a dipping sauce. I really enjoyed them. I added some of that yummy Greek Dressing and used the dipping sauce and they were delish either way. I just wish they included a little more feta cheese. But I'd definitely order them again.  

Greek Salad: It comes with feta, olives, peppers, onions and tomatoes (none for me). They also throw in a side of pita bread. Classic flavors here folks. Really fresh and tasty, especially with their Greek dressing. Yum. 

I'm looking forward to trying more of the menu items. I hear the kabobs, pasta salad (without mayo) and humus are divine!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at your Matthews NC location and received horrible service! Was there at 1 pm. I understand having to wait for food being a busy time, but my fiancÃ© who ordered the same thing as myself food came out first. I had to go inside after waiting 15 minutes to see why mine was takin so long. His food went cold waiting for me to get mine. When I asked to speak with the manager, she looks over her shoulder and snaps at me that she's busy and doing the best she can. All I wanted to know was why ours didn't come out together. For $30, you would think we would both be able to get a hot meal together. The girl who brought out our food was sweet as can be and did apologize. Stating that their manager was off today. What kind of manager doesn't schedule extra help especially for a new store?"}
{"text":"YUM! Great price, and you don't feel disgusting when you walk out of the door. What more can you ask for from a fast food place?! Well...I do wish that they wouldn't serve Lay's potato chips and gave you an option of chips instead..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and the wide variety selection they offered. My whole family was able to find something they loved! The food quality is outstanding and I highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Went to Zoe's a couple of weeks ago. The food was good. Consistent with other Zoe's locations. We had the pita and hummus trio. Basil hummus was the favorite. Also shared a salmon power bowl. I was a bit reluctant to order salmon, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was very tasty. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick eats in old town. Great selection spanning many food genres. 

Try the cookies after lunch or dinner..

+++ And they have the magic soda fountain!"}
{"text":"How can you not love this place second time here in the last couple of weeks I get the Mediterranean salad Trio bowl with grilled chicken the steak roll ups in a balance bike to go along with everything else that I got

You have to try this place and limited items that you can get and don't forget to buy one of your Zoe's refillable cup so that way you can get your learning and everything in it. Lisa is a wonderful excellent host is just got to give props out to them and the quantity and quality of the food is gray

So if you want to try something different make sure you stop by Zoe's Kitchen on Indian School and 44th Street give them a try for fresh fare you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The service here was very slow (both for ordering and for the food to be brought out). On top of that we were double charged. Cashier swiped our card once, said it didn't go thru, and then swiped again. I was able to clear it up with the cc company but this made us unhappy. Parking is also very hard."}
{"text":"We really enjoy ZoÃ«s food, but the last several times that we have been to this location, we have had really disappointing service. Today we order soup and salad at 1:25 on a Saturday. They were not overly busy. 25 minutes later, we still didn't have our food. Then it came as soup and a sandwich. It's too bad because ZoÃ«s was a family favorite. I'm a pretty patient person but slow service has just been repeated too many times."}
{"text":"Two poor experiences at this low rent excuse for a healthy chain. If you order a pita, you are begging for salmonella unless you really take your sandwich apart and check for pink. They make the pita's in the worst possible style. They try to bend a double chicken breast inside a pita, forgetting to take out that strip of fat that separates the two breasts. It is when you unfold the thing you will notice the problems. Get something else or better yet, skip this place entirely. The manager on my first visit discussed and suggested the chicken with slaw pita, but the greek showed up later as I returned home. That mess was so loaded with dressing that the pita busted and that is how I discovered the weird chicken. Staff was nice enough to offer me a free pita on my next visit after I called, but although they got the order correct, this was not an appetizing item either. The rice is boring and bland as well."}
{"text":"Well this place is back in the mix after finally delivering a decent lunch. Using my $20 lunch certificate, we sampled the regular hummus, which came with enough pita and had a good dollop of oil and paprika to make this a good version of this item. The chicken rollups are pretty easy to make (seems to be just chicken slices and feta in a tortilla, but they were good when dipped in the hummus, but the salsa provided was not homemade. Chicken salad sandwich was very average as was the pasta salad side dish. Tables outside were not cleaned and wiped down and they need to figure out how to stop birds from shitting all over the place where people eat. A few tables are easy targets, but also could easily be fixed. At least pay more attention to cleaning the tables, so indoor dining is suggested at this location."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we got one of these on this side. It's healthy fast food with tons of perks! 

One of the things I really like about Zoe's is that for every receipt you upload to their app you score a goodie. Whether it's a drink or extra side you can't go wrong with being rewarded for eating there! 

I've tried several things my favorites are the roll-ups. Both the chicken and steak roll ups are awesome! And they both come with different dipping sauces that kick the favors up perfectly. My favorite side is the potato salad it's not mayo based and is made with small red potatoes. 

Overall I never feel bad after eating here and the staff have always been very friendly and helpful. I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Fresh food....This was my first time at Zoe's Kitchen. I had no idea the food would be so good. I ordered a chicken pita and salad, everything looked so good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Looked healthy and fresh, but our order came out after two other orders for people after us in line. They also forgot the side pita bread for my salad. Salad was good and fruit was fresh. Altogether, not a bad place but okay service."}
{"text":"Zoes staff today was SUPER nice, can't stress that enough. Had a great meal thanks to them. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Picked up lunch here recently.  Tried the lamb pita with a greek salad and a beef shish kabob.  

The pita was pretty good.  More like a gyro than an actual pita as pictured on the website.  Not sure if they gave me the wrong one or if that is how it is done here.  The flavors were pretty good.  Veggies seemed fresh.  However, the meat was a bit dry and seemed precooked a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.  Same with the kabobs.  The flavor was pretty good but the meat was dry and also tasted precooked long before I placed my order.

I like fresh food but don't call it fresh and not make it fresh.  I got a real problem with the flagrant use of the word fresh by the food industry.  We seriously need better regulation.  

That aside, this place reminds me of a Pita Jungle with 7 pages less of a menu and about the same rate of food.  

2-3 stars for me.  Would I come here again?  Probably not on purpose but I wouldn't refuse it if fate brought me back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there yesterday for the first time. We noticed their sanitation grade as we were sitting at the high top table and were talking about how low it was for them to have just opened. I said \"well can't be bugs it's brand new\" I was a little over halfway done with my sandwich and the girl was sweeping. She called another employee over there to kill the roach on the floor with the broom! 
My husband said \"guess we can cross this one off our list!\""}
{"text":"Not to happy with dinner. Came out cold.  Was to hungry to send back & get recooked again.. The weird thing is it took to long to come out cold.  Don't think I will return to this location again."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place got iffy reviews honestly. The line moved quickly even at busy lunch hour! 

Friend and I stopped in for something decently healthy. The lady at the counter was very helpful and directed us to items we might enjoy. Neither of us were disappointed. Food came out in a timely manner, the lighting was great for lunch time dining and the atmosphere was relaxing. I had the harissa salmon pita and will be coming back for it. Friend had the trio salad and the serving size was so big she took some home for later. :) we will be back!"}
{"text":"OMG the Gruben  is AMAZING!! Probably the best sandwich I've had in years.  My husband had a veggie pita and loved it.  The freshness of the food was amazing and we were so happy with our lunch  were so excited to see a healthy,  delicious restaurant in the area.  Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I  really don't know what's going with zoe's kitchen, but you can't serve pita bread cold with an hummus salad , not good at all."}
{"text":"Amazing steak tool ups. Nicely priced as well. Great Greek salads and the dressing is unbelievable. Give them a try if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, however my salad not so much. I'd give them a 5 for service and a 1 for the food. I'm a huge fan of Greek Salads and I don't think I've ever had a bad one until today. It was basically a few pieces of cucumber, 2 cherry tomatoes cut in half, some onion, 2 peppers, a Tablespoon of feta cheese (at the most) and a shitload of bagged spring lettuce. There is no dressing on it at all. They have bottles of dressing with all oil and 1/8 vinegar. The girl was kind enough to bring me a lemon dressing on the side. A very very boring salad that I ate because I was hungry but truthfully I could have walked up the block and purchased a better Greek at Trader Joes for half the price. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I eat here often, I love the chicken salad and the potato salad. I the lime aid is the best. A must try is the chocolate chip cookie, for take food it is a bit expensive."}
{"text":"I actually love Zoe's in general. We are currently sitting waiting for food. There are 2 of us with 2 very straightforward orders. We ordered food over 20 minutes ago. There are literally 7 people in the restaurant on a Saturday night. The waitstaff brought 1/2 of our order out about 10 minutes after the second order. When they finally brought out the second order it was cold. Wow can you say horrible service????? 
Super disappointed with this location and will be reaching out the manager."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Dallas I spent 3 days (out of my 4 day trip) lunching at Zoe's. I just couldn't get enough of their spinach roll-ups. When I heard Scottsdale had a few Zoe's with the same delish spinach roll-ups I shouted a yippee!

It turns out they make the spinach roll-ups just as good here in Phoenix. And the hummus app we ordered was pretty tasty as well! They also have this crazy soda machine where you can get a billion (or ok a couple dozen) types of soda out of one faucet. Pretty cool even if I found it to be a bit confusing.

I'm glad the good peeps in Dallas and Phoenix get to enjoy Zoes on a daily basis, but we Chicagoans want in too! Bring the spinach roll-ups to the Windy City please!"}
{"text":"I love Zoes! 
Their coleslaw is to die for, and the housemade hummus is creamy and wonderful! 
I've had nothing but delicious food here, and can't say enough about the freshness and flavor of all of the dishes I've tried.
Their chicken salad tastes like the yummy chicken salad I've eaten in NYC, and the tuna salad (with mayo version) is wonderful! 
So far, Zoes is consistently great food with very nice personnel!"}
{"text":"Wow I just paid  $18 for a salad and humus.
I can't say the food was poor, but I was surprised to find a cup of risotto  in my tabouli salad. Oval all I thought the value proposition was really bad. I wish I had eaten at Sauce next door, where the food is a little better, and the cost more reasonable."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Zoe's yesterday when I found myself at Blakeney Shopping Center during lunch time. I had originally thought about splurging for lunch next door at 131 Main, but because I needed to get back to the office, decided on getting a take-out from Zoe's instead.  I ordered the Tossed Greek Salad. First off, this thing is huge! Seriously enough for 2 meals... and calorie-wise, it's also 2 meals.

It is loaded with feta, black olives, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and lots of chicken. It also comes with pasta salad, carmelized onions, red onions, pepperoncini peppers, and a side of pita bread. They are happy to customize it though and will leave off anything that you do not want.  

They were pretty busy & told me it would take 10 mins for my takeout to be ready but it was ready sooner than that so that made me happy."}
{"text":"My wife and I both really liked the chicken and steak kabobs. She really liked the salsa verde. The staff were very friendly and the chocolate cake is a new favorite. The cookie looked awesome and my daughter really liked it!"}
{"text":"Very average experience here. Walking through the area every restaurant was busy except Zoe's, which should have been a tip off. We missed the clue and stopped here for Sunday lunch. 
Mediterranean chicken was a dry small serving of chicken without much marinated flavor and a healthy salad with a side of white beans. Nothing bad or outstanding about it other than the chicken was cooked dry. 
My wife has the chicken salad which came with a huge platter of fruit.  Except for the fruit it was underwhelming too. 
There are so many better choices here if you can get in.  That's why it's so quiet at Zoe's."}
{"text":"Yummier Panera, what a treat! Chocolate chip cookies definitely on fleek."}
{"text":"Food is always awesome and fresh. Its a new staple in my life. You can't go wrong with so many fresh choices. Def a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Ok MAYBE I came in on an \"off\" day but I had the most irritating experience. I work in the service/restaurant industry so maybe I notice more than most. I walked in and I would say a good..10 tables needed bussed inside, I decided to sit outside and literally every table had old plates and cups on them, I had to bus my own-that should never happen, especially considering they weren't busy? At all. I got our food I got the Greek chicken pita- it was so greasy it fell apart during the first bite and wasn't even salvageable lol I just got a fork and ate it that way.... It was enough for me to opt out of Zoe's in the future."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Have my taste buds really started to fail me?  There are very few good reviews for this location, and I simply don't get it.  And the thing I don't get even more than the bad reviews, are the lack of people in this restaurant.  I went back again yesterday, had a delicious meal, and there was not a sole there.  Ok, so it was at NOON!

I get the Protein Power plate.  Yes it is healthy, but it is also delicious.  The chicken and onions come on top of a plate of Zoe's slaw.  The Zoe's slaw is awesome.  A light coleslaw that has tons of Feta.  To be honest, this is all that I have had here, but when I want a healthy meal and I have already hit up Pita Jungle twice that week, there is nothing better than a little bit of Zoe's.

People support this establishment, it is realistically priced, has good quality food that is tasty and nutritious."}
{"text":"Maybe not the absolute best Mediterranean food you will find,  but for fast good food it's  a must.  Super awesome service also make it a plus."}
{"text":"Horrible service,  will never be back.  Came in and It was no line walked right up, no hello or welcome to Zoes and it still took 6 minutes before someone asked if they could help me, mind you two employees were right up front doing nothing,  maybe they just don't like people of color, but I'll never be back @ this location, ever ! Good food but wrong location"}
{"text":"This is a good lunch spot for somehthing healthy and quick. The food is fresh and I really enjoy their slaw - no mayo here YEAH - I'm not a huge fan of the mayo.   I don't adventure out much here for me its always the protein plate - chicken, slaw, and onions.

You can definitly tell its a chain but they keep the place clean and the service is great...if I'm in the area I'll stop by - but I won't drive outta my way to come."}
{"text":"This location serves us rather well. Never anything too complex or difficult to work with on a any front. The service is friendly and fast, the food is always consistent, and they have great outdoor seating. 

My favorite things to get here are the steak rollups, braised white beans, and the hummus/pita plate. I don't normally order anything with steak in the name, but the addition of mushrooms in these bad boys make it a nice entree. Paired with the rosemary braised white beans make for a nice meal. Also, the hummus and pita plate is a great app or even a meal. 

Biggest gripe about this location, and the age-old tale of The Met, is the parking situation. Forget about the adjacent garage for their side of the shopping center. Either look for an open space on the street or just park across the street in the Target garage. Much easier. 

Zoe's is A-OK in my book. Even with their crazy \"o\" in their name that my computer can't seem to locate. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I am a 5+ year Zoe's lover (Phoenix and Charlotte locations) and I am very disappointed in my last 3 visits to this location! Dressing missing from one order, missing pepperoncini's and olives from my salad on another order, and today they were completely out of pepperoncini's, the pita tastes old, and the lettuce was quite sad looking. Hope this isn't a trend!"}
{"text":"Zoe's was okay! Definitely a fast food atmosphere. The food was pretty good but not the Greek I was expecting."}
{"text":"Very good, healthy food. Had the spinach roll ups w/ chicken. They were very tasty. Came with a side of hot sauce. The real star was the grilled vegetables as the side order. Great flavor! Carrots, broccoli, onions and mushrooms with a grilled flavor that was amazing.I could of just eaten a bowl of this it was soooo good. Chocolate cake pretty good but you could taste the sugar granules. Wife had soup (chicken orzo) and salad and said it was very good. Cool coke machine here to get your fountain drinks. I had iced tea which was good. Will definitely return as I want to try the chicken kabobs.
update: had the chicken kabobs several times now. 2 skewers w/ rice and salad- best meal around for under $10. Zoes is our new fav spot!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy and refreshing meal during a hot summer day, look no further than Zoes Kitchen.  While so many of their menu items sounded delicious, I opted for the Greek Salad with the citrus balsamic vinaigrette.  The veggies were fresh and crispy, the feta tangy, and a small scoop of potato salad on the bottom for a twist on the traditional salad.  I scoped out the plates on other tables and based on appearances alone would highly recommend the kabob platters and hummus salad."}
{"text":"Great food. I come here all the time and always get steak kabobs. The sauce on the kabobs is very good. Lots of healthy menu choices but you still get good potions for the price. Fast and very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Normally, I'm not a fan of franchises, but Zoes Kitchen has it down. Impeccable everything, completely healthy and delicious, every damn time! Zoes is a perfect lunch spot, with counter ordering, fast service, light healthy , perfectly appealing food. Service is always friendly and the food is always fresh. They use no mayo in their tuna or their out of this world slaw (something I literally crave)! The prices are quite ideal too! Obviously, i'm stoked on this place! You will be too :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have never been disappointed with anything that I have ordered. The customer service is beyond great. Steak kabobs are my favorite. I recommend this place to any and everybody."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Husband and I loved it. 
We shared the Power Grain bowl and Mediterranean Salad trio bowl. Great flavors"}
{"text":"This is a good place for lunch with your Mom friends and kids in tow. They have a good variety of sandwiches and salads as well as other items like hummus and pizza. I had the chicken salad sandwhich and my toddler had a cheese quesadilla.  It's very affordable too. I'll go back here again someday!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer -- Love love love this place.. 

the food is a perfect blend of fast food, that is great for health minded folks.  
It is made fresh to order.."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Zoes, the food is good and the limeade is delicious.  However , the 2 star rating is due to very bad service and the uncleanliness of the dining area.  The female taking and delivering orders had two attitudes- flat or rude.  Out of the 10 or so tables 5 were left completely dirty the entire time we were there forcing us and other patrons to clean off a table prior to eating.  The food was good, but it's hard to enjoy yourself in a dirty establishment while being treated rudely.  Get it together people."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Zoe's a handful of times and have yet to be disappointed. The food is fresh and delicious, the customer service is great and you can't beat the location. Who doesn't want a lunch break after a long day shopping at Fashion Square? I'm a big fan of the tuna sandwich and tomato soup combo. Yum!"}
{"text":"Zoe's is a great place to get a health conscious meal at a reasonable price, also the lemon cookies are great. Everyone working there seems to be chipper except one older lady who seems to be like she really doesn't want to be working there."}
{"text":"I go here at least 3 times a week. I usually stick to the Protein Power Plate and the Steak Kabob plate. 

Both items are awesome, the service is great, everyone is super friendly! 

Seth is a great manager and keeps the place running like a fine oiled machine! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food!  Fresh ingredients, delicious soup, gorgeous hummus, yummy chicken skewers.  Best 2:00 pm lunch I have ever had!  Great service w friendly staff.  I will be back for dinner! And when I am in Scottsdale, I'll plan my day around returning!"}
{"text":"Went  here for dinner this evening. Waited about 15 min for my entree which came out with different sides than I ordered.  The staff member said she would be right back with the correct sides and never returned. I also ordered an appetizer hummus trio which I never got. Finally I went and asked for a refund after about 20 min of waiting. No apologies ... here is your refund...... it may or may not show up on your card.  Definitely would recommend not going to this restaurant. Very unprofessional staff who were busy talking to each other rather than helping customers. There are plenty other options with great service close by."}
{"text":"Had the Greek Chicken Parmesan last week....meh.  It's a grilled chicken breast with hearty marinara, serve on a bed of orzo (???).  Would have been delicious if not for the overcooked orzo.  But, the greek side salad is really one of the best I've eaten. The lettuce (romaine and a little iceberg) was fresh, topped with"}
{"text":"Well I was passing through Scottsdale and decided this place looked pretty good.  I was very happy with service and even more happy with the food.  I had the steak kabob and pita and wow,  tasted so fresh and vibrant.  If I ever happen to be passing through or visiting Scottsdale again I will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch! The food is great (greek salad, hummus, tzatziki, veggie pita pizza, spinach feta roll ups), the staff is friendly and the wait time on the food is never bad. Decently priced for what you get. Get a reusable Zoes cup for soft drinks, etc. if you plan to go here often!"}
{"text":"Zoe's kitchen is ok but as part of their rewards program, half of their emails don't work at the store."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service I have been here for over 40 minutes I just got my food numerous people that have come in after we have been served"}
{"text":"Had dinner . Tried their beef and chicken kabobs.  The meat was a little  tough. Flavor was  average"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for lunch. We both ordered the same thing. Hers arrived in a few minutes. It took about 1/2 hour for my food to arrive. The manager explained that they ran out of something and it would take a while to cook it. He told me this after waiting about 25 minutes. He did offer me coupons for free meals. Unfortunately, I'm from out of town so I couldn't use them. I gave them to my friend and I hope she has a better experience next time.

I thought the food was decent. I got chicken skewers and rice. The chicken was cooked well and was flavorful. The rice was surprisingly good.

Bonus points for the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.

Sadly, the service was so lackluster that I wouldn't return. There's just no need. I'd rather go to a place that served real Mediterranean food as opposed to this Greek-style \"mall\" food."}
{"text":"I order online at work at least 1-2 times a week. I try something different each time. Man! The food is amazing... flavorful, cooked perfectly. Priced right. I love it... and will continue ordering it each week."}
{"text":"This was the second time that I ate at Zoes Kitchen. The first time I had the Protein plate which consisted of grilled chicken on top of some cabbage and onions I think...not for sure, but it was good. Today I had the Steak kabobs and they were amazing. They came with vegetables and potatoes. Each with their own seasoning and cooked to perfection. I will most likely be coming back very soon to get the same dish."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and get the rustic lamb pita. It's nothing amazing. Meat is dry and cold (sometimes overcooked), bread is stale, the veggies and seasoning on top is good. The rice pilaf definitely isn't fresh, it's like a mush ball of rice. I'm disappointed of the quality since opening."}
{"text":"Food here is great and I love the location close to all the night clubs and shopping centers. I ordered the Mediterranean tuna pita sandwich and it came with a side dish.  Not bad for under $10.00. Girl that took my order didn't seem like she wanted to be here and asking for a fork seemed like an inconvenience, but I'll still come back here because their food is the bomb and all with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"this place is good. i wouldnt say it is authentic mediterranean food but then again what fast food joint is? they allow for a comfortable place to eat your food which i like. the food id consider somewhat healthier than most quick eats places. there is ample parking since it is located inside a strip mall. their salads are decent, the meat is decent, the sides are decent... i cant say the food is the best, but what do you expect from a fast food place?"}
{"text":"I went to the Zoe's Kitchen location that just opened across from Arrowhead Mall in Glendale on Sunday, August 13.  I placed an order for the Harissa Salmon Pita.  When I got home, I noticed that I received a pita with lamb instead of salmon.  I called and told them that I received the wrong order and that I will be coming back to receive the correct order.  Before I left my house, I looked at the receipt and noticed that I was charged for the lamb pita and not the salmon (which costs more).  When I arrived, my order was ready and the cashier told me that the salmon pita was inside the box.

When I got home, I noticed that the meat looked exactly like it did before - like lamb or steak - which was dark brown in color and tougher in texture.  I called and asked to speak to the manager.  When I talked to him and explained what had happened, he \"assured' me that the meat was salmon and went on to talk some gibberish about how the marinate they put on it probably changes the look and taste of the \"salmon\".  I told him that I know what salmon looks and tastes like because I love salmon.  That clown must think I am Boo Boo the Fool!  Because it was after 6:00 pm and I didn't want to have to make another trip to Zoe's, I told that delusional manager that I will not be ordering from them again.  I barely ate the lamb posing as \"salmon\" because I do not like the taste of lamb.

I now believe that the reason I was charged the price for the lamb was because there wasn't any salmon available and instead of being HONEST, the manager wanted to be SNEAKY and pretend that the lamb was actually fish so that he would not lose any money.  If he continues to run his store like this, he will be replaced - or there will be no store because of lack of customers.  What other shady stuff is being done at that restaurant?

I have been to the Zoe's Kitchen in Scottsdale at least three times in the last few months.  And yes I was served REAL salmon and it was delicious!  But I am reading that the Scottsdale location has gone down hill too with employees screwing up orders and a manager who just doesn't seem to care.

What is going on?  Why are customers being treated poorly and why was the manager trying to INSULT my intelligence? This is NOT how you run a business properly.

I would give my experience a BELOW ZERO if I could instead of the unworthy one star."}
{"text":"Really glad have been contacted by a customer service rep. They offered me a gift card and a chance to give me a better experience. Every restaurant makes mistakes but very few fix them so promptly and with such a good attitude. I am very impressed!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that my review is not based on Zoe's food. I LOVE the food here which is essentially the only reason I come back (try the orzo tabouli salad or the chicken salad). That being said, Zoe's has MAJOR issues with their to-go orders. I would say about 75% of the time, my order is wrong. The staff is always polite and they always offer credits but there comes a time when it becomes too often to just write it off. Zoe's, it only takes a simple repeat of the order to get it right, please work on this because I'd love to leave a higher rating for the food!"}
{"text":"Food is always great. I come here for work at least 1-2 times a week always order chicken kabobs with a Double Greek salad. Can't miss always delicious. The one time they messed up an order Marty the manager made it right the next time. They always go above and beyond to make sure you're happy. Thanks guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Good for a fast healthy option that is reasonable priced, although you have to know what to order.
I really like their tabouli, tossed greek salad and roll up entrees. Everything else I've tried has not been so great, the chicken is always overcooked so I've stopped ordering it, their tuna salad is super bland with an odd consistency, and the sauce on their chicken marinara tasted like it came from a can."}
{"text":"Zoes is my favorite place to grab a quick & healthy lunch {alone or with a friend!}. They have Wifi which is great if I need to get a little work done during my lunch hour as well. Their menu has a variety of healthy options but for some reason I can't get away from their Quinoa Salad + chicken & caramelized onions. It is literally to die for! I usually devour salads but this one is hard to tackle, the quinoa is very filling, not to mention, they pack on the veggies!! A few goodies in the salad include: {quinoa, lettuce, tomatoes, feta, cucumber, black olives, green onions & broccoli}. The chicken is SO tender and perfectly spiced, along with the caramelized onions that make anything better! Last but certainly not least, I drizzle it with their Zoes Greek Dressing{on the tables} and it is H.E.A.V.E.N. Looking for a healthy lunch spot? This is it! If you get it to-go, make sure to ask for a side of their dressing because it doesn't normally come with it!! 

{Fun Fact: I even tried to re-create it at home and it was good, but didn't quite compare!! I can't figure our their perfect chicken secret!}"}
{"text":"Good food and good customer service. 

Staff is always very friendly and food always tastes great. I recommend the Greek salad. 

Pros
- Good food
- Good customer service
- Fast service

Cons
-idk"}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot to come for lunch... and I do often!!! 

I eat here multiple times a week- fast, friendly, consistent and yummy. 

The staff is exceptional and always deliver the little details that are important: napkins forks, dressing- etc.  I order to go a lot as I am always in a rush, and I never have to worry about double checking anything. 

My favs: hummus trio, chicken salad sandwich and quinoa salad. All delish :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Zoes Kitchen, their online ordering makes it really easy for take-out. Everything I've had so far has been fresh and tasty. My favorite is their Mediterranean salad bowl which has an orzo tabbouli salad, pesto farro, quinoa, tzatziki  and I usually add some grilled shrimp which is always cooked perfectly. Service has always been friendly and nice and their interior is clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"First time at Zoe's kitchen which just opened around the corner from my house.  My wife said it was one of her favorites so I definitely wanted to check it out.  I know they just opened and were probably with new staff but at 730pm on a Monday it took nearly an hour to get a chicken pita and a hummus salad which I ordered ahead of time online.  Other than the wait the food was excellent and will definitely go back again, but will probably wait another month or so."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating area - food was excellent and super fast.  I had the chicken pita pizza and it was delicious and it comes with a side greek salad - for only 8 bucks you really can't beat it.  I highty recommend if you are in need of a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. The chicken pita was so fresh and tasty. The quinoa salad was filled with fresh vegetables   I was worried that the dressing would be to heavy,  but it was exactly how it was described ...\"light and refreshing\".   As a treat ordered the chocolate cake.  My goodness what a treat. The chocolate cake was light and moist. Will come back"}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch while buzzing around Phoenix. I have heard a lot of good things about Zoe's and since I was there,I thought I would give it a go!
Parking can be tight, at lunch time at least. Lots of people have the same idea.
I got a simple lunch,but it was very good.
Limeade was my drink of choice, quite good and they say sweetend with Cane sugar.
I got the Zoe Club Pita. Was fresh tatsing as good.
Chicken, Ham ,and swiss cheese, with lettuce ,tomato and some spicy mustard, I asked for extra spice.
Not a bad experiance at all. The place is clean and modern looking."}
{"text":"I had my reservations about a chain but I have to take that all back!  My sister suggested this place and at first I was bummed by some of the negative reviews on Yelp. Once inside it looked clean and the planters outside with fresh rosemary bushes were a mood lifter! 

I've been eating vegetarian for the last month or so and I was excited to have some options here. I ordered the hummus platter and a side of roasted veggies. The hummus was smooth and topped generously with olive oil and kalamata olives. The salad was fresh and the dressing on each table was similar to one I make at home. Baby girl ordered chicken noodle soup and it had chunks of real chicken and carrots. Not a condensed soup concoction; that was nice. We also got a side of fruit and it had fresh ripe fruit! Amazing right! There was sweet pineapple, cantaloupe, grapes and strawberries and it didn't have that weird funky taste that most fruit cups have to keep it from turning brown. 

The employees were friendly and helpful while ordering and I'm looking forward to going back! 

They have a check in offer on Yelp for % off your total."}
{"text":"What a disappointment, dropped in for lunch with a friend today.  Nice atmosphere, fairly clean , good parking, terrible service. When we arrived the cook and servers were confused about whose food was whose and arguing back and forth about the orders they had mixed up.  very unprofessional in front of customers.

We should have left at that point but we weren't in a hurry so we ordered.  After 20 minutes my friend got her sandwich and then after waiting another 15 min i went to the counter and found my order sitting, bagged up to go. I guess I was supposed to just do a take out( my receipt clearly states it was Dine In).  The servers kept walking around with plates trying to figure out whose food went where.  Poor organization, lousy customer service, it seemed clear they wanted to be somewhere else.

My friend liked her chicken salad sandwich, i didn't care for my lamb pita and neither of us were impressed by the bland so called roasted veggies.  There was just noting worth spending our money or time here.

So the food was so-so but the service was disorganized and sub standard.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, you need to get yourself a kabob plate or a salad. 

Or you'll be risking a bland landmine. Seriously. Step over those tuna sammies and order some salmon or chicken kabob plates. 

This place is healthy. It's not where you go to feed your inner fatty. Or outer fatty. I can say this because I have been both in my life. I love food. If you want a sandwich, go somewhere else. If you want some lean protein and veggies that you didn't have to cook yourself, come here. And, like, maybe eat a little hummus too, so that inner fatty can get some enjoyment out of life."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I try to eat very healthy and were in the area and hungry for dinner. We saw Zoe's  kitchen and thought we would give it a try... The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the girl at the counter was pretty friendly. The food however was bland and terribly unimpressive. I had the Chicken Roll-ups and they were cold, pre-made and lacking in any culinary skill what so ever.  When I ordered them I asked if i could get spinach instead of lettuce and she said they are pre-made every morning so I can't change anything... Also, They claim to be a \"healthy alternative\" and they ONLY have white flour tortillas and do not offer wheat. In my fruit salad there were 2 ROTTED grapes and when my boyfriend showed them they said \"oh, ok, sorry\" then went back to whatever they were doing...

Honestly, there are many better alternatives to go to and spend $7-$10 a plate... I do not recommend going there at all"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit Zoe's a lot. The salmon kabobs are really good and I love the Greek salad that comes with it.  The hummus is pretty good as well. My husband really likes the Orzo \"Tabbouleh\" Salad. 

It's definitely popular with families and can be extremely busy during peak hours. The service is usually fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Another great lunch at zoes. Friendly staff. Every time I have been here it had been packed. But the wait to order and delivery of my meal has been very fast. I will definitely recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, fast, and casual. Quality always good.  Service staff very friendly and welcoming.  This is one of my favorites in the Ballantyne area and now one of my families favorites also."}
{"text":"Nice healthy alternative fast food joint.

I'm a fan of the quinoa salad. The lemon vinaigrette is delicious. Ask for extra!

Gruben is good but only eat it while it's hot.

Pasta Salad lacked flavor but still good for the price you pay.

The Greek Dressing here is a must have!

Pimiento Cheese Sandwich is bland."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! It's like healthy fast food! Flavorful STEAK kabobs, not a fan of the chicken kabobs. My go to place for something fast and healthy when I'm too lazy to cook!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Lindsay and Zoe's for hosting a Yelp event recently and allowing us to try out some healthy food for free! The location itself is small and orange and the food was good, not great. Zoe's seems like a great stop for your lunch break and the prices are reasonable. The staff was friendly enough but overall this place isn't memorable. I wouldn't drive out of my way to visit it again but if I was nearby I would stop by for some spinach wraps with chicken and rice!"}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place by a client and loved it immediately. Extremely fresh food and great selection. I had the chicken kabobs twice and can't get enough. Hummus was also fantastic! Highly recommend anyone try this place!"}
{"text":"yum scrum! i am a fan.

i get two chicken skewers and a veggie skewer. seriously so bomb diggity. and the lunch prices are right up my alley at around $8. 

the soda fountain is fun too"}
{"text":"Supposed to be open until 9?? I called at  8 40 for a take out and was told they are no longer accepting orders. False advertising"}
{"text":"Not sure why we keep coming back. The kabob platter is good and consistent, but overall flavors are just-OK. I've had this catered for lunch, which is very good. Not really mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Just spent $50 on dinner, using grubhub for delivery. Showed up without my tabouli salad. Couldn't get to the delivery guy in time so I called Zoes. I was told, by what I'm assuming was a manager, that they contract out to grubhub so I would need to call the delivery driver. Called the delivery driver (sweet kid) and was told he had other orders and didn't have my salad so I need to call the 800 number for grubhub. Soooo I call grubhub...lady tells me to call zoes. I explain everything AGAIN and she puts me on hold for 10 min while she calls Zoes to see where my damn salad is.  Finally, she comes back and tells me that she's refunding me for the salad and I now need to call Zoes back and reorder... ummm no! That was the biggest cluster #@$% I've ever dealt with. HORRIBLE experience made even worse because everyone wanted to pawn the responsibility off on someone else. Aaaand someone's still hungry!"}
{"text":"There is something wrong with this location. We gave it a second chance tonight. The location needs new management or staff training. No one in the restaurant -  over 30 minute wait for our order of two items. No explanation. No apology. Unfortunately, we had the exact same issue last time too. Never has this issue with other Zoe's locations - so this leads me to think that there is something unique about the leadership of this location."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with Zoe's Kitchen because I heard rave reviews about the restaurant from some friends. The food was okay - not bad but also nothing special. I ordered a chicken kabob that came with a side of rice and Greek salad. The chicken was a little dry and not that flavorful, but the rice and salad were good! 

The best part of my experience at Zoe's was the big chocolate chip cookie, which is the only reason I would return to this restaurant. The cookie was huge and had an incredible amount of chocolate chunks in it."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food while visiting the store twice. The staff is super friendly too! We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Take out was disappointing.  I had a Pressed Sandwich with Grilled Vegetables.  The Sandwich was just all right and the grilled veggies were a real miss.  The \"Grilled Vegetables\" consist of 3 pieces of Broccoli, Onions and Small Slices of Carrots (if anything else was in this extremely small portion, I could not see or taste it). NO FLAVOR.... I was not impressed at all and think you might be better off trying one of the other Mediterranean places in town."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Zoe's for a long time. I wasn't overly impressed by the food then. When my  friend suggested them as being good with reasonable prices, I said fine.  It was clean and the staff pleasant.  I had the veggie kabob with two sides.  The white bean side was tasty.  The fresh fruit was nice and fresh.  The veggie kabobs were meager as my friend described them.  They certainly were not undercooked and and  was so little of them that I was really amazed.  My friend had the Mediterranean Chicken.  I think she would have enjoyed them if the chicken hadn't been overcooked.  We had done quite a bit of walking and I knew were were both hungry.  For her not to finish the chicken, it must have been really overcooked.

Yes, we could have brought all this to the manager but we didn't.  After a day of looking at real estate and original art, we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something quick and reasonably healthy, this is the place. This is my go-to if I need a fast lunch. The protein power plate is great when forgoing carbs and the hummus and pita bread is fantastic when you're not. The chicken salad is slap-your-mom good. Yeah, for reals. You can get a pint to take home. 

The parking is reasonable in the garage next door but this particular location can be crowded and slam packed if you go during peak hours. 

If you're a regular, then downloading the app is worth the freebies!"}
{"text":"Lets just set the record straight here. Zoe's serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican.

When I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far. 

The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way \"bad\", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of \"I've had better\" when thinking about my experience.

If you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If you're interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely won't be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one! (but don't take me at my word on that just made up fact).

Happy Yelping Phoenix, now where's my hummus?"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast and affordable are two things that don't often intersect these days, but somehow Zoe's manages to bring it all together under one roof! We had pre-ordered our meals to ensure we had enough time to eat lunch and picked up our food at the counter. 

GREEK SALAD: A light and heart healthy alternative to my usual pizzas and heavy plate lunches. Big portion of greens so hopefully this will help to fill up the bigger sized bellies.

HUMMUS : Beyond the salad I highly recommend getting the hummus with pita bread! The hummus has just the right level of lemon flavor which I often find lacking in other mediterranean joints. Bravo Zoe's!

TOMATO SOUP: Whatever you do, DO NOT order the tomato soup. I could taste the straight from the can flavor and this was definitely the low-point of my meal.

The decor at Zoe's is modern casual with open seating. Their soda machine from the future was very perplexing and I'm glad someone else was there to show me how to use it! Great fast casual concept and I do hope it comes to my hometown of Honolulu some day soon!

{"text":"Love their steak kabobs brown rice and veggies! There beans with pita bread are also very delightful. Some of the best salads I have ever tried as well."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's, the steak rollups and Greek Chicken Pita are my go to items"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to spot when wanting something fresh and Mediterranean.  No more.  Seems with the change in menu they also changed their standards for quality, cleanliness and service.  Food is just not the same - horrible steak roll up which was burned and the meat lacked flavor, roasted veggies were greasy, pita bread was hard as a rock and the beans over cooked.  The place was a mess - while we were two of only three customers in the entire restaurant, table after table was dirty with dishes sitting from diners who had finished and left long ago.  The tables that were clear of dishes were not wiped down.  Utensils had black smudge and was poorly stocked.  The employees did not seem to care and - with the exception of the person that took our order - were not friendly.  Too bad.  With Cava just up the road, ZoÃ«s has now been removed from our rotation."}
{"text":"Been there a few times .. It used to be better. Food was cold when we got home. We only lived 3 mins away from there. And of course they missed my soup .. Hopefully they will get back again"}
{"text":"Zoe's kitchen...more like blowies kitchen! I'm giving it one star because I can't give below that. Now I'm not saying that Zoe's kitchen is bad in general I'm saying that this location is abhorrent...like a genetic mistake. I've been to other Zoe's kitchen's that were great all over the country but this was a real experience. At other locations they haven't had any problems making very easy accommodations to tweak an order but this place refused to do that. The cashier was rude and all the employees did the hole time my friend and I were there was gossip and I mean mid order.

The floors were disgusting and from when we sat down to when we left there were dirty dishes on all of the tables. Not once was a table cleared. Then, this poor guy literally did 2 laps around the \"restaurant\" to find a place to sit, then he went outside and sat down. Then he had to come back inside I'm sure because of the orgy of flies flying around due to all the dirty plates sitting outside. 

Wow..."}
{"text":"The food was great. We ordered two steak sandwiches to go with a kids grilled chicken finger with fruit. The order took about 30 minutes and the order was incomplete when we got home. My advice would be to add more staff during lunch and provide discounts and coupons when guests have a poor experience. The gentleman that handled the order didn't seem concerned at all that 30 minutes was a bit much. Add more people and follow the chick fil a model, when you have a poor guest experience, make up for with a nice staff and free food."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken salad and fruit on a bed of lettuce. It was a beautiful plate but not very good. Chicken salad was very dry and pastie with very little flavor. When I asked for salad dressing the young man told me it was on the table. They offered one type, a Greek dressing which did not go at all with fruit.  So I ended up eating the fruit and chicken salad and leaving most of the lettuce.  Pretty expensive to leave most of your plate. I had asked the young man if he would clear a booth off for me and he did but didn't bother to wipe the previous diners mess up.  So I had to wait for him to come back to ask him to actually clean the table.  My first time here and most likely my last."}
{"text":"Ordered a spinach and mushroom paidini and add chicken ($4) from the web for instore pickup so I could run to get it on my 30 minute lunch. Not only was there no chicken, the lady seemed annoyed when I brought the sandwich back (I paid for the chicken!) She wanted to just throw some chicken on my sandwich but I asked for it on it, which was again met by annoyance. After waiting another 15 minutes, sandwich finally arrived out, not a single word of apology, she just went back to chatting loudly to people in the kitchen. The first cashier did give me a complimentary drink and was kind, but he couldn't make up for the other girl's behavior, I won't be back. 
P.S I was late in getting back to work"}
{"text":"Love Zoe's, great food. The one star is for their catering service, for which they charge $25. 
I placed an order, 2 days in advance for a lunch meeting. 
My usual experience with catering orders from other restaurants is they show up early, and have plenty of time for set up etc. 
I waited an additional 20 minutes past my delivery time to call only to hear that the delivery driver was running behind and that she \"meant\" to call but became too busy.
The order showed up minute later - but I think a 20 minute late lunch catering order with no call is unacceptable. That will be the last time I place a catering order for over $100 of food for poor service."}
{"text":"Many pieces of greens in the salad were dryed out and rotten. Cucumber was frozen. Literally frozen into ice. Staff was friendly, but quality of food and ingredients very poor. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"Just picked up dinner and my order was missing an item and the ladies there were so apologetic, helpful, and quick about getting everything I needed. Super friendly staff in my experience and my food was great!"}
{"text":"If i could i would give it a lower rating but this is as low as it allows. More is the pity. 

The place was empty. The order was not complicated- it was exactly as written on the menu board. Still it came incomplete, half unprepared and the other half missing. When i asked for a menu to check if i was wrong i was told by the salesgirl who was only too eager to get out of there that they didn't have any. 

There was no apology and no real effort on anyone's part to remedy the situation. There was no one around to bother. 

A utter disappointment and WASTE OF MONEY. I'm shocked at how rude and uncaring the establishment is. 

Oh and for the record I was right. Didn't need a menu to confirm they didn't give me what i ordered. I have food allergies so being super careful is a given. I KNEW i was not mistaken. Rather, they were beyond uncaring and incompetent."}
{"text":"The following pretty much sums up my experience at Zoe's:

Me: \"Hi, I'd like the turkey pita please\"

Zoe(or sum other dumb bitch): \"So you'd like the feta with feta?, would you like something to drink, or maybe a side of feta?\"

One word..... Sick! (and I actually like feta... well, used to)
I will not be back.

Oh, and some extremely old dood hit on me while I was waiting for my lunch. Now, while I don't exactly blame that on Miss Zoe, I am convinced that he wouldn't have been there if it weren't for all that feta.

How is there more than one of these shitholes in the valley?? Someone please explain. blech!
2 stars because my Sun Chips hadn't been tampered with... at least to my knowledge."}
{"text":"My husband and I haven't been back to Zoes since the opening until today. Today was a sunny day and it sounded right to sit outside and eat at Zoes. We ordered a chicken salad sandwich with fresh fruit and a chicken kabob plate. Oh, and a limeade...which was very sweet and delicious.

This time around the food seemed average. The chicken salad didn't have pizazz and the chicken kabobs were dry. They should include a drop of hummus or yogurt dip on the kabob plate; however, the vinegar sauce on the table added a bit.

Some of the staff were friendly and some not like what I remembered the first time around. Fast service and ideal for those of you in a hurry."}
{"text":"Clean and appealing interior. I've never been to one before and hope they infiltrate Cali bc lord knows Daphne's needs a run for their money. Had the Gruben and it was great. Good turkey alternative to typical Ruben and probably healthier."}
{"text":"The food is really good, I have food allergies with Gluten and Dairy and had some of their pita dips and creams and had stomach irritation, so would stay away from that.  The real annoyance at this location particularly is when I walk in around lunch time anywhere from 12-2 P.M. the place is not busy, but I inevitably end up waiting at least 2 minutes form someone to notice I'm waiting for someone to take my order, employees will walk by and smile but no one will help.  And this has happened numerous times.  The other annoying thing is once I get my order, their either out out of forks or no ice, or lids are low.  I mean I must be coming in after the lunch rush or something because you'd think this would be a rush hour and people would be ready to take orders and have the place stalked."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed opinions about this place and I wanted to check it out to make sure if it was good or not.
My coworkers LOVE this place so one of them decided to celebrate her birthday lunch at Zoes.
We kind of work far away so we decided to place our order ahead so save some time. 
We got there and the food was waiting for us. 
We had a great time and everybody enjoyed their food. 
We were a party of 5 people. 
I had steak kabobs, grilled veggies and hummus with pita chips. 
Oh my god everything was so delicious!!!
My kabobs came with some sauce that I don't remember but was good!
After my first visit I came back with another coworker and had the same dish the only difference was that this time I had the pesto hummus that was simply amazing!
I like to know anytime I need some healthy option to eat I can come to this place and eat without any guilty!
For some reason I can't find the pictures I took of my both meals but believe me, they looked good and were amazing!
The staff is always nice and friendly!
I feel that it is a little overpriced for the amount of food you get but I believe that is the price you pay for healthy food :)"}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday afternoon. The atmosphere was great and the weather was perfect so we ate outside! I had the Chicken & Slaw Pita with white beans as a side. 
The beans were nice and hot.  They were firm but soft and had good flavors. The pita was stuffed to overflow! The chicken was cool, seasoned to perfection and it had great big hearty pieces inside. The slaw was crisp and crunchy and had a good bite.  To wash it down I had Hibiscus Green Tea on ice! Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"First time here, honestly the good was pretty good. But there was a server ASLEEP in the front booth next to the cash register. Which was very weird and uncomfortable. Also they were completely out of falafel due to a broken freezer... this place needs some help in the service department."}
{"text":"Healthy, nutritious fast food.  They even have a \"500 Or Less\" menu (500 calories or less).  Might be lower in calorie but I assure you not in taste or yumminess. I LOVE you ZoÃ«!  Will you marry me.. (Jeopardy music playing in the background).

5 stars for what it is... Fast Food."}
{"text":"Umlauts. We need more of them. That adorable but professional little diacritic belongs in more words, if for no other reason than to decorate it and make it more interesting. Glam it up with a glyph, as I like to say.

Oddly, that's kind of how I feel about ZoÃ«s. It's quite similar in concept to many other places (a regular old \"e\") but then all of the sudden that little diaraesis shows up and BAM, you've got something a little better. It's an \"Ã«\" and voila!

Sammiches, salads, sides--you've seen this movie before. But there's enough variety and care presented that it's not just another lunch shop. We stopped in with our big group and they had everything ready to go. I got the chicken salad sandwich, and I gotta be honest, it wasn't my fave. In my brainiverse, chick-sal-sans should have some texture and chunk to them. This was quite finely prepared and had more the consistency of a tuna sandwich. Not my cup of tea, but I know others with the exact opposite taste. So just know before you go.

The salads looked really great, and portions on them were pretty large. Two of our dining companions decided not to come, so their lunches were sitting and just asking for me to try them. Greek chicken pita, and I'm back on board. In fact, by the looks of things, I'd say stick with pitas or wraps for that extra umlaut bump. The sandwiches are nice, but served on simple bread and don't quite have the pizazz.

Grab your own beverage from the fountain machine of the future (the bajillion option touch screen kind) and settle down in the bright space for a quick, convenient lunch."}
{"text":"Okay so me and my family decided to go out to lunch and we saw that this ZoÃ«'s Kitchen was open. At first sight it looked nice but as we got into the restaurant more we saw that there was uncleaned tables and a mess on the floor. My son's food didn't come out until the rest of us were in the middle of our meal and two out of four of the Chicken roll ups were cold. I find this completely unacceptable. We were less than pleased with the service we had reseved. Plus its over priced it was $2.50 each just for drinks. If I wanted to spend so much money i would have gone to a well established restaurant."}
{"text":"For a quick spot this is a great option. Portions are generous, flavor is great, and the menu has all the Mediterranean favs. 

It's not a place I would go out of my way to eat at but if I were out and about running errands, and in need of a good bite to eat I would definitely stop here over almost all other options. It's the chipotle of Mediterranean food. A quick in and out, or easy take out spot. Clean tables, and a friendly staff. The limeade is a must try."}
{"text":"The food was good and the price felt fair.  Everything seemed fresh and the dining area was clean and relaxing."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly. If you're a health conscious eater this a good place for you and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"They had some nice updates to the menu, and I was eager to try them. The restaurant was very clean and the workers had great customer service.

I ordered the Chicken Mediterranean  Salad Trio Bowl. I never order salads, but this was definitely worth it. All the flavors blended very well, and it was filling.

The food is good, and I like that it is a healthier option, but like anything that's healthier it will be more costly."}
{"text":"Walking in yesterday (Sunday 6/25) at about 45min before closing. The cook was singing loudly in the kitchen and saying how they were out of everything. (unprofessional) My boyfriend and I ordered. I had a sandwich and rice pilaf and he had a different sandwich and pasta salad. we waited about 30min for our food, we ordered BEFORE 2 other couples that came in and got our food after they did. We grabbed our to go orders and went home, opened up the box and I started on the rice OMG the rice was soooo hard, since it was the end of the day im thinking the kitchen was out of rice or it was the last bit of it and they scraped the pot because that rice was 1/2 mashed and 1/2 extremely hard and dry .. I threw the rice away and ate the sandwich (which was cold by the time it was served to us and made it home) HORRIBLE experience at this Zoe's and that sucks since I had told my boyfriend it was amazing and it was his first time trying it! :( I go to the one by my job in south park about once a week and have NEVER EVER had an issue. my advice: if you are out of something ask the customer if they would like to pick something else, DO NOT scrape the pot and end up with a huge mess."}
{"text":"I come in now almost everyday for either lunch or dinner. And I normally get the same thing, but one night while I was trying to make my mind up on what to eat, I hear a slang Spanish conversation between a young Spanish guy up front to another Spanish speaking guys and girls in the back. The were very derogatory and slight racist and extremely loud. Rule of thumb: You'll  be surprised who knows and doesn't know Spanish."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight and always love it and have a great experience. The food is so healthy and fresh and everything I try is always better than the next. I usually get the Orzo salad (my favorite) but tonight I tried the protein platter and the slaw under the chicken is a great mix. It is a quick in and out lunch or dinner and thats what I always count on! Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious. You have many choices from bowls that are filled with protein to other traditional Greek dishes.  This service is exemplary and the place has delicious desserts as well"}
{"text":"Very, very healthy menu.  High-end, quality ingredients.  Clean restaurant and conveniently located in the downtown Charlotte area.
Parking is a bit away but worth it.  There is no drive thru."}
{"text":"I've drove past Zoes kitchen a gazillion times, and have never noticed it. How? I have no idea.  Thank goodness for my sister's friends' recommendation to try this little place out! 

Zoes kitchen is a cute little restaurant where you order as soon as you walk in and they bring your food out to your seat - much like other places such as Noodles and Co. or McAlisters.  They have plenty of options to choose from.  I'm definitely not a Greek food junkie, as I usually run the other way when I hear 'GREEK FOOD', but I was very pleased with the taste and quality of my meal.  I had the Greek Chicken Pita with feta cheese left off and pasta salad as my side item.  The chicken was dry but from past experience, I just assume that Greek chicken is cooked that way.  The flavor was really light and tasty - perfect for brunch - but the portion was enough to make me extremely full.  The pita bread was on point. The pasta salad was delicious despite the fact that it had feta cheese all over it.  It almost made me regret keeping the feta off of my pita. All of this food for just 8$? I'd go back ANY day. 

My only quibble is that there wasn't a ton of seating inside.  It was noon on a Saturday, so it was pretty busy.  We got lucky and found a seat right away but it was dirty until the waitress came and wiped it down for us.  If you don't want to be an unlucky customer with no table to sit down at, definitely try to go at a different time! 

Otherwise, awesome food, awesome prices. Get the pasta salad. Don't leave off the feta cheese."}
{"text":"Although it's a chain, the food, location and service are all quite good.  I regularly have the veggie kabobs, which comes with a small greek salad and the white beans.  All of them are great, but the beans stand out as especially good.  Pair that with some hummus and pitas and it's a good meal for me and my 3 year old to sit on the patio and enjoy a nice evening."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. It was crazy in Uptown, everyone out at the Panthers Pre-Season Game. We went the opposite way and decided to finally have a relaxing sit down dinner at Zoes.

Place was nice and quiet for it was like close to 7:30 PM. People coming in to grab meals to go and several patrons placing orders.

The Steak Kabobs were delicious. Cooked to your liking. 
The hummus was creamy.
Rice Pilaf good but a tad salty. Have to watch my salt intake and sugar levels for I have gained a huge muffin top.
They have wine here too."}
{"text":"Very disappointed today. I usually order pick up from Zoes because it is close to work and they have fairly healthy choices. I always get the Greek salad and hummus plate. I am sad to say my salad was just lettuce and dressing today. No feta, no onion, no bell peppers. I am far too busy at work to make it out to return the salad and have it remade. I may give them another chance because of convenience."}
{"text":"They're  ok. The shrimp and zucchini kabobs are gluten free and very good. The potato salad is good too."}
{"text":"The food isn't horrible, but it's not great. Good for a quick bite but if you have an option to go elsewhere maybe that's a better idea. Biggest turn off for me was the lack of customer service, asked the guy at the counter what a certain dish included and his actual response was \"I don't even know what's in that or what that rice is called.\" And then the silverware they give you is dirty. Not sure if I'd come again."}
{"text":"I went to Zoe's again late last night for dinner after the gym.  We probably walked in there a little after 8:30pm, knowing they closed at 9.  Any normal person would probably give us a dirty look for coming in so late - but as always the staff was exceedingly friendly.  They manager greeted us with a smile, made sure we had everything that we wanted and didn't make us feel the slightest bit guilty for coming in close to closing time.  There was another young man who delivered our food (his name might have been Creet), who was so friendly it was actually surprising!

Overall I can't say enough about the staff at this Zoe's.  They go above and beyond to make your experience a good one.  Whatever they are doing, kudos.  It is literally a pleasure to eat here.

The food, as always, is fresh and delicious!  One of our absolute favorite and consistent restaurants.  The chicken kabob platter is my go-to, sub the salad for grilled veggies and add hummus.  BAM."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch! Stopped here while in town on a biz trip from NYC. Was planning to go somewhere else, but spotted this place and looked at the menu. I got a half an egg salad sandwich on multi-grain and greek salad. Just what I was looking for! Inexpensive, tasty and the egg salad was NOT drowning in mayo. Hallelujah!"}
{"text":"I JUST had lunch there today and REALLY enjoyed the food...  which says a lot being that they push health consciousness at this spot.  

The food was not over seasoned or pretentious.  I had the Chicken kabob entree (which you see in one of the pictures).  It cost about $8.99 and was well worth the money.  It came with a Mediterrranean salad, rice pilaf and slices of pita bread and two chicken kabob skewers.  The meat was grilled perfectly and had a nice, simple taste. 

I was a little overwhelmed by the menu, as this was my first visit and was unsure of what I wanted...  If I had that same plate with a little hummus with it, I think I'd probably have done cartwheels right there...  so until they come up with THAT plate...  I will save my acrobatics.  

Rest assured though...  (In my Arnold voice) I WILL be back..."}
{"text":"Holy delicious !! 
If you are trying to eat clean, but are craving bad foods... EAT HERE ! 

Zoe's food is so fresh and is seasoned perfectly that it tastes like a cheat meal. 
Ive only ordered take out, but it was a huge order and they got everything right AND it was still hot when I got back home. 

Coming back ASAP"}
{"text":"Well this is my first Yelp review and it is not a positive one. My husband, my son and I were excited to try Zoe's for their vegan options. When we got there the service was pretty poor, and they were out of falafel, which was our vegan option. All tables were dirty and there was no where to sit. I can't comment on the food, but the service and cleanliness was terrible."}
{"text":"My chicken entree came with a piece of chicken that was no more than four ounces.  I ate it in five bites.  The entree included more orzo than one person can eat and not enough sauce to cover it.  Less pasta, more chicken please.  Salad was good."}
{"text":"Was disappointed they no long carry my favorite sandwich, egg salad. I still made a purchase, chicken salad sandwich... Still won't stop me from going but have hopes they'll bring it back."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week whenever I'm feeling guilty from binging on burgers and barbecue, and I always feel a little healthier after eating here. Everything I've had here is decent at worst and delicious at best. A few highlights are their spinach & chicken kebabs and grueben sandwich. Their pasta salad and braised beans are tasty sides, but their potato salad was a little bland. That being said it's the healthiest potato salad I've ever had, no mayo or eggs to be found. Their portions could be a little larger and their prices a little lower, but overall it's usually worth a trip to Zoe's."}
{"text":"Zoe's has a nice half sandwich and soup special. The Mediterranean-style chicken noodle soup is tasty and perfect for a cool day. My turkey sandwich was plain, but the ingredients were fresh and it hit the spot. Take advantage of the fresh pepper grinder to add some spice to your food.  

My favorite thing at this place is the fresh limeade. This is basically like lemonade that is made with limes. It had a nice fresh and sour flavor, which reminds me of the natural limeade that I have tasted while traveling abroad. I encourage you to try it.

Zoe's is a nice place to visit for an affordable, simple lunch with a homemade feel. It is a great alternative to fast food and larger chain stores that people typically frequent for a speedy lunch."}
{"text":"They catered an event I was at, and I've never had Mediterranean food before. I had the pita with the basil pesto hummus, it was okay. The. I tried falafel and I've never had such a awesome taste and texture in my mouth. So good!!"}
{"text":"Great meal and service.  Hubby and I split steak kabobs and hummus. Steak was tender and juicy and flavored just right. Potatoes are to die for!  Hummus was smooth and creamy and perfect."}
{"text":"Living so close to Zoe's makes it hard for an addiction, the food is great every time.  Whether is the simple Greek salad with grilled chicken (simple is an understatement and it is a must to add Zoe's Greek dressing over the caramelized onions yummy), the protein plate or the kabobs - Zoe's is always a delicious meal!! And I don't know what it is - if it is the marinade or the how the chicken is cooked, but the grilled chicken is to die for..literally. I am definitely a regular and will always be!"}
{"text":"ok went and ordered the humus which i found bland  and the kids chicken and cheese queseadilla which is probley the best thing i have had"}
{"text":"The food is great from my experience but like the other negative reviews, the service is terrible and very discombobulated.  How hard is it to make a consumer feel warm and fuzzy? Pretty hard I guess.  

The food is good, but you guys need to figure out your service issue.  I've had negative experiences with managers and associates, so I'm now sure what the problem is.


Love your food, especially for catering!"}
{"text":"Working in the biltmore is really not too great for your waist line. There are tons of fast food and not so fast food places that offer not so healthy options. So, that being said, a friend and I decided: no more chipotle, let's try that zoe's joint I always drive by.

The price: somewhat inexpensive. Not taco bell inexpensive but decent, like $7/person. The food: eh? I got the mediterranean tuna salad pita with the cole slaw for a side. The tuna was a little... unflavored. If i really wanted to have plain tuna, i would have gone to the grocery store and spent 99 cents instead of $7. The cole slaw though was actually kind of good. I've never had slaw with feta cheese in it!

So to sum up: decent prices, okay food. Will I go back? Probably, just because it's better than Arby's or McDonalds."}
{"text":"So... I have watched this place deteriorate steadily over the last few months. The food has become less reliable and service/wait times keep getting worse.  My last visit sparked this review.  

Weekday lunch at 12:30. Nobody in line but we waited at least 5 minutes before someone took our orders.  Pretty standard order of chicken kebab with roasted veg.  We sit down and after 10 mins one person in our party gets his salad. Another 10 mins go by before we see anyone else emerge from the kitchen. One of us asked when we might get our orders. The girl was very nice and went to check. She came back and asked what our orders are, despite us having an order number sitting on our table. We gave her all of our receipts and a couple mins later she told us our food would be right out. 10 mins later we got out food. 

Chicken was dry, side was missing, whatever. 40 minute wait despite not being busy, bad food. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I love the food here, so I wish I could give a higher rating...but my issue is with the takeout service: I order takeout here all the time - at least twice a month. I usually get either the chicken salad sampler (salad) or the sandwich. Both delicious if they are made correctly. 3 orders ago I picked up a chicken salad sampler - only to find upon getting home it was missing the LETTUCE. It is a SALAD. 2 orders ago, ordered the salad again to find my order was missing the salad dressing (nooooo!). And last order I think was the last straw. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a pita, and I came home with about 1/4 the amount of chicken salad necessary to fill the pita- the rest was stuffed with dry lettuce? Great food, lazy takeout service."}
{"text":"I have had Zoe's Kitchen catering during meetings several times now, and I have to say this is the best buffet-style catering and one of the best casual Mediterranean dining experiences I have ever had. The kebabs (particularly the shrimp) are well-cooked, and deliciously seasoned. Their spreads, particularly the hummus, are quite good...several levels above hummus you'd find at the store. Even the rice pilaf, which does not look like much, is surprisingly delicious."}
{"text":"How can I politely say that all this place has is \"chick food.\" 

I have been here several times, and tried their limited vegetarian options. I found that the one with the mos flavor was the grilled feta. The feta gave it a nice flavor however the basil was lacking as were the tomatoes. It was original to use a fresh cheese like feta for a grilled cheese.

The meal includes chips and a side. I usually go for th pasta salad as it is the most filling. The flavor of the salad is bland and I usually empty half of a pepper shaker into it. 

I have tried to spice up my food with the Italian dressing that is found on each table. I found it best to turn the bottle upside down and let the oil separate out, this way you can get just spices and vinegar, it goes well on the chips. 

Overall the meals here are a bit pricey for the lack of flavor and portions."}
{"text":"The Greek salad here isn't your typical salad. It's served on top of a bed of potato salad (red potatoes). I was caught off guard the first time I ordered it, but now I've come to like it- even though I eat it separate from the salad. Overall, the Greek salad is decent size, plus the Zoe's dressing is light (vinegar/olive oil). 

My work has also ordered catering from here (30 ppl) before and it was awesome! We got a variety of items:

-Greek Salad
-Chicken/Beef Kabobs
-Veggie/Chicken Roll Ups (my favorite!)
-Cucumber orzo salad 
-Rice
-Hummus Trio

Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it and everything was super fresh. In addition, it was something different than your typical Panera/sandwich catered lunch. I would highly recommend ordering it again."}
{"text":"Everything I have had from this place is great, the chicken pita, tuna salad, and the chicken salad. The potatoe salad is very good! Try the cookies as well, I'm always sure to grab one. The place is a little noisy but very clean. The location is busy and a little tight."}
{"text":"The spinach roll-ups were delicious! You can add chicken if you wish too! 

The baked feta is perfect for two people to share but I would not recommend doing that as a carry out item. 

The dining-in option is nice as they do have wine, beer, and variety of sweets for dessert.

The staff is friendly and they have allowed me to order for pick up over the phone or online."}
{"text":"Starting the new year off right with healthy Mediterranean food.  The Mediterranean salad is flavorful and filling, I will definitely order this again. They offer, paleo, gluten free, vegan, ketogenic and vegetarian meals."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday Night to Zoes Kitchen before heading out to the bars. 
There were several items for vegetarians such as spinach rolls, hummus and pita bread, grilled vegetable kabobs, and tomato bisque soup. I ordered a cup of tomato bisque soup and side of pasta salad. It was pretty good. The pasta salad was pretty tasty as well. My husband ordered the spinach rolls and he loved it. He even loved my tomato bisque soup. One of our friends ordered the grilled vegetable kabobs. He said he liked his dish but he wished the vegetables were at least warm. The grilled vegetables came to him room temperature."}
{"text":"It's a shame the Metropolitan location is so far away from where I'm located, I'd be here a lot more often. It's easily my favorite one in Charlotte. The decor is modern and clean. I think the theme here is healthy fresh fast food, and it's quite delicious too!

There are plenty of options for everyone. My favorites go to are the kabobs and wraps. I'm not much of a fan of hummus usually but theirs is not spiced too much and manages to get me to like it!

The service is really pleasant, fast, and informative. Did you know for example that they make their chocolate cake fresh each day and gets tasted to make sure it's delicious? Neither did I until I asked one of the employees about their cake! This is a great spot for a quick lunch, if you're near the area try it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality home made fresh food, no microwaves, no fryers. Wish we had know about this place yesterday so today would have been our second trip.  Dont waste your time going to all the local chains give this place a try and youll love it"}
{"text":"My god this is the worst place I have ever been in a long time. Typical chain garbage. Got chicken kabobs, and veggies which were still damn raw, Rice tasted like bagged rice that got re-heated. Gross. Then I got this tomato substance with my kabobs, similar to Delmonte Canned Salsa. WTF??????????? None of the food we ordered was correct. I will say too, the chicken was similar to pressed meat! GROSS!

My wife ordered Cauli Rice but got regular. This place is just stupid and bad! Gross Corporate food. AWFUL!!!!!!! YUK! Basically it was NO BETTER than McDonald's. Really! Stay away."}
{"text":"Stupid new look menu and very very rude customer service but it looks higher management want it in this way"}
{"text":"Zoe's kitchen was our favorite lunch place back in Florida (St.Johns Town Center in Jacksonville). When we moved here and found out there was one close to us we decided to give it a try, unfortunately my experiences back home are better than those here. Many items were taken off menu. I was rudely told to pick something else because my old choice of a club pita was no longer available. So that comment alone was already enough to ruin my experience. When we got our food it was not the portions it used to be, the potato salad side I got was mushed up and all oily substance like the end of the pot of it,  without them giving me another serving of it. 
I'm truly disappointed considering it used to be our go to place at home and now I have one so close but with poor service and attention to detail"}
{"text":"I love Zoe's. The vibe is awesome, the employees are wicked friendly and the food is good and quick.

While the food is healthy, there isn't many more elements of healthy about this place. Not much earth  friendliness here.

I do love the artwork by kids that adorn the place. I love the local news options to pick up and read (Camelback paper & the Phx NT).

But... the prices are a bit high. The chip options are limited (plain Sun Chips, Baked Lays or regular Lays).

But we'll be back, just not often."}
{"text":"wow this place is amazing!!! They just opened a location near my work and I tried the turkey stack and it was amazing! their fruit side is actually legit with oranges, apples, pineapples and grapes. I will definitely order more from them"}
{"text":"Ordered catering from this location for a meeting at work. Scheduled delivery time is 11:45AM (for a 12PM meeting). Food arrives at 11AM, already pretty well \"cooled off\", and I see a note on the order form \"have ready for 10:45\". So the food was finished being prepared an HOUR before it was supposed to arrive. I order catering A LOT. Generally if a delivery time changes they call, or at least offer an explanation. I call to speak to the GM and he tells me \"not to worry- that no one can get sick...that prepared foods can sit out for FOUR hours without someone getting sick\" THIS IS NOT TRUE. Look it up on the USDA website. it says \"no more than 2 hours\" --- I got nothing more than a half hearted \"sorry\" and that's all. Basically just threw away 150$ because I'm not serving this to my staff. We will not be using them again. Makes you wonder what sort of foods are being left out at the store for FOUR HOURS before being served."}
{"text":"Grabbed Zoes on my way home last night, I was in and out with my order in 10 minutes!  I wanted to try the chicken orzo soup but I knew I needed more than that, so I got the steak stacker as well.  The soup was actually spicyish and not very heavy on chicken or orzo, when I got to the bottom I saw it was loaded w/black pepper.  The sandwich was good, but messy.  I have also had the vegetable wrap and the greek salad in the past and all was good.  Only thing I was never crazy about was the steak roll-up.  Overall a solid choice for healthier fast food."}
{"text":"I split the salad and a pimento cheese sandwich with the mrs and they were both fantastic. The outside seating was plentiful and the food came out quickly, once ordered. I will go back."}
{"text":"I left a review a few weeks ago commenting on the food quality and I came back to update my most recent experience. The food quality was wonderful and the service was great as well. I am very pleased being able to continue coming here .. some of my favorite cuisine!! Thanks for listening Zoe's Kitchen! :)"}
{"text":"In a pinch I went in too try Zoe's kitchen . First let me say the food is decent at best . But customer service and staff was friendly . Had the spinach chicken pitas with some fruit . Place was clean which is a huge plus . Would not make a special trip but if It was nearby I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"First, the food was very good. This was our first time eating at Zoes Kitchen and everything we tried was great. Good mix of flavors and textures, well-thought-out menu, yum.

The people were friendly, but very...very...slooooooow. Why it took 27 minutes to get our food at a \"fast casual\" restaurant is beyond me. There was a quick apology when the food arrived, as there was with everyone else who walked up to the counter wondering why their order was taking so long. Others got a free drink cup for their wait, I got to send my family home when I saw ALLLL of the to go bags waiting on the counter, just knowing we weren't eating any time soon. 

Not sure if this location is short staffed or if the management is terrible, but our first experience at Zoes was not a positive one."}
{"text":"Great healthy food! Can't get enough if this place. Love the chicken and steak kabobs."}
{"text":"Quality of the ingredients is 4 stars, flavors and seasonings is 2 stars.  If you want bland fresh food this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Zoe's after hearing from a friend that it was really good place to grab a quick, more healthy bite to eat. Their menu has enough options, but not too many to be overwhelming. Their side dishes are unique and yummy, and a nice change to chips or fries. I ordered the lamb gyro with the pasta salad. The lamb was ground, which was different for me, but still good. The pasta salad was made with basil, feta, and tomatoes which was a nice twist and flavorful. My mom ordered the chicken kabob which came with veggies and she loved it. You get a decent amount of chicken on the kabobs and we were both satisfied when we were finished."}
{"text":"EDITED: Changed to 2 stars because my order was off. No salad dressing, I ordered extra pita and recieved 2 small soggy pita triangles, and my cucumbers looked like were cut hours ago (color was changing in the outer edges and were rubbert).  I eat at the Zoes in Kierland at least 2-3 times a month. There is usually a wait, which is to be expected during the lunch rush, but the service and food is always spot on. Today I went to the 16th/Camelback location to grab dinner. Parking lot was empty, 2 tables with diners, 1 to go order waiting. I place my hummus and salad plate order- to go. Waited 25min in an empty restaurant  for a scoop of hummus and shredded lettuce. Although its a block from home, I will not go to this location again."}
{"text":"I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time."}
{"text":"I ordered the hummus trio and the Moroccan chicken piadina. The hummus was delicious and had so much flavor. It was served with a generous portion of pita bread, cucumbers, tomatoes, and bell peppers. However, the piadina was an absolute LET DOWN! First, it had barely any chicken. Aside from a few small pieces I saw I honestly thought they forgot to even add chicken. There was way too much sauce and it seemed like a skinny cabbage quesadilla compared to the picture of the Moroccan chicken piadina online. I doubt I would eat at Zoe's kitchen again aside from ordering some basic appetizers."}
{"text":"Right around the corner from some great shops & a Trader Joes.  I stopped in here after browsing West Elm that was just across the street.  

I grabbed the salad plate and added chicken.  Delish.  Pita/hummus appeared fresh & tasty.

I wish I could have one of these in my neighborhood.  It was like Mediterranean Panera."}
{"text":"The menu here offers the healthy options as well as some melted cheesey goodness options. Such as grilled cheese or pizza. 

I'm a big fan of their hummus, caramelized onions and chicken. Order anything with these items and you won't be disappointed. 

The prices are cheap for the amount of quality food you receive. 

Great service as well. 
Thanks Zoe's!"}
{"text":"Zoes Kitchen gets crazy busy during lunch time, but don't let that scare you from giving this place a shot. The service is fast, friendly, and efficient. From the time we ordered at the counter, filled our drinks up with one of the three fresh brewed tea options (while slowly walking away and starring at this crazy futuristic soda machine), and sat down at a table, we only had to wait about seven or so minutes for our healthy meals to arrive with their delicious aromas.

They do have a Simply 500 menu that lists all their items that fit the criteria of 500 calories or less. It is not listed above the order counter so you'll have to ask to see one. My mother ordered the Spinach Roll-ups that came with a cup of fruit and I went for the Veggie Kabobs. Both of us enjoyed our meals, but we both agreed that we wouldn't drive down just for Zoes, if we are in the area it will be on our minds as an option.  It was neat to see the art projects from the kids at Phoenix Children's Hospital that Zoes displays throughout the restaurant walls. The total for two meals and two small drinks came to $21.64"}
{"text":"Had dinner here. Didn't realize it was counter service  but was pleasantly surprised. The chicken kabobs were good and I really enjoyed the white beans with rosemary. The employees were very friendly. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"There are definitely some things I like about ZoÃ«'s Kitchen. But I just made a to-go order and I was so disappointed in a few things and that's why I'm writing a negative review. First, we ordered a hummus starter. They gave us 3 little pita triangles. 3! And like the smallest pieces of pita you have ever seen. Secondly, the kids meals are a joke! Maybe other choices aren't so bad but here is a photo of my daughter's \"pizza.\" Like seriously, 2 little quesadilla triangles?! That plus a side (in our case chips) for $5!?! It's a complete rip off. 

Even though I do like several of the food choices they offer, I ALWAYS walk away thinking: we spent way too much money for what we received."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken salad sandwiches at this location...even bigger than the other Zoes.  Limeade even better too.  Real plates as well, better windows and seating.  I'm making the move over to this location!!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite place ever as someone who prefers locally-based establishment but quick and convenient for a relatively healthy meal option. Prices are reasonable and you order at the counter and have food brought out to your table where you wait with a number. I think I've only ever ordered the Greek salad and hummus combo with the basil pesto hummus. The salad is nothing special but good and their Greek dressing is a vinaigrette that sits on all tables. The hummus is good and the portion of hummus and pita is huge. I would prefer if the pita was warmed up a bit or even toasted, I don't like just cold basic pita, but it does the trick as vehicle for the hummus. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if you need to eat quick and don't want to do fast-food before or after running errands at the Metropolitan this is a reasonable option."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. This place seems to always have a good size crowd but never over crowded so getting your food is always quick and easy. This is a great place to come pick up a quick meal and a healthy one. Love this place! The Chicken Roll-ups are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's HUGE! I think I got a lamb pita. It was cool. The lady also brought me pita bread with hummus since it was my first time. They have pitas. Wraps. Salads. I think some other stuff too. The pita was really good. Lamb is my favorite. If you haven't tried lamb before, you are missing out and need to try it! One of the best meats out there. I was glad I got to try this place. The prices weren't too bad either. Had I thought about it, I would have seen what kind of desserts there are if any. I wouldn't say this is my most favorite but it was a good try."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's in general and it's one of my \"go-to\" places for a quick healthy lunch when I'm out and about, but this particular location is just poorly run.  I've given it numerous opportunities and it continues to fail.  

The Zoe's ordering app is normally a great option if you're needing to get in and out quickly, but this location for whatever reason is unable to meet the expectations set when placing an order through it.  We're talking up to half an hour late when the app promises it at a specific time.  That disconnect just shouldn't happen. 

To go orders are wrong more often than not whether they are called in or ordered online, even with simple orders.  I've ordered Greek chicken salads on multiple occasions where the chicken was mistakenly left out.  I don't know how it's possible to miss the most important part of the salad. 

You may fare better if you dine in rather than getting food to go because you can make sure they actually give you chicken.  Whether you choose to dine in or take out, good luck.  I, for one, will choose neither and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch / dinner spot if you're looking for a fast healthy meal.  The chicken kabobs an chicken roll ups are phenominal"}
{"text":"this place has improved , I been going their since my brother got there kabobs he got me some they are awesome. I also like there spinach rolls , Greek Slade and their lam pita . There rice pilof is good to but a tad salty . The staff is always friendly as well ."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick place to grab lunch with my husband the other day and he suggested we try ZoÃ«'s Kitchen and I am really glad he did. It was awesome! It really hit the spot. I had the hummus plate, which came with pita bread and a Greek salad. It was perfect. I cannot wait to go back because everything on the menu looked great."}
{"text":"They're always friendly with amazing service and very helpful + they have a tremendous amount of vegetarian options that are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I recently stopped into Zoes after passing it for well over a year during my trips to Trader Joes!  Zoes atmosphere is laid back, crisp, and bright.  It is a corner shop with big windows that beam in sunshine. The menu is full of different healthy options that include numerous vegetarian friendly choices.  Similar to Panera, you can also do a \"pick two\" option where you can sample smaller sizes of various sandwiches, soups and salad.  As other Yelpers have alluded to, the Greek salads are amazing.  In fact, I am so hooked that I purchased a bottle of their homemade dressing (just $3.99).  

The staff are very friendly and are happy to answer any questions you have.  After placing your order, they will hand you a stand with a number on it.  Just take a seat and your food will be delivered shortly!  The beverages are self-serve and my favorite part - unlimited!  

Some of my favorite choices are:
Shrimp Kebabs - seasoned perfectly with just enough kick.  The rice pilaf served with this entree is cooked to perfection and to top it off the platter is completed with a small Greek salad.
Hummus and Pita - the hummus is made from scratch and the pitas are warm.  Need I say more?
Chocolate Chip Cookie - I can honestly say that this is *the best* chocolate chip cookie I have ever tried.  It is crispy on the outside but chewy and gooey on the inside and packed with large chocolate chunks/chips (yes, both).  
Greek Salad - served with red onion, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and delicious feta!  The Greek dressing is already on the table so load it up!  

Zoes also sells its famous chicken salad.  As a new pescatarian, I have not tried it, but as a former carnivore, I can say it looks damn good!"}
{"text":"Sophie B. nailed this one on the head.

I came here long after hearing how great it was, after many drives past the swanky slick exterior & logo, and...

WTF? I ordered something that had chicken. It was so crap, I can't remember what the name was. A heaping mound of exotic, square-cut iceberg lettuce served as pallbearer to cuts of perfectly overdone chicken. There may have been a grain of salt or whisper of an herb at some stage; I can't recall. Overall, a marriage of supreme disappointment. 

My lunch buddy had something just as memorable. And just as overpriced for what it was.

ATTENTION RESTAURANTEURS:  If I can make it better at home, then I'm staying home!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after church looking for something for all. Grandson under 4 good healthy section for little guy. Vegetarian daughter did okay except she didn't enjoy her order. The rest of us our Food was good. Person who brought food to table was rude and short. Just threw the food on table for us to sort out. Food was just okay. Would not go out of our way to go there again."}
{"text":"Has the tossed greek chicken salad. I found it to be filling. I personally love feta cheese and this had a lot of it. If you aren't as into feta, you may want to ask for less or consider a different salad."}
{"text":"This is a really easy place to stop in for lunch.  However, I have never been completely satisfied with any of the dishes that I've had.  They are pretty run of the mill and sometimes a little bland.  I guess it's healthy, so that's a plus.  The place is clean and bright and the staff is very cheery.  The prices are pretty good.  Parking in the Best Buy/Trade Joe's parking lot can be tricky so if you're not fortunate enough to grab a spot directly outside of Zoe's, be prepared to drive up to the 2nd floor of the deck and take the elevator down.  It's much easier and less stressful than trying to park on the first floor."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!!! I have got to say that EVERYTIME I come here they do not disappoint!!  I got steak kabobs and it was AMAZING!!  Delicious with hummus!!!!"}
{"text":"Zoe's is a good sandwich place with a relaxing ambiance (both inside and outside). 

My turkey sandwich and \"potato salad\" salad were very good. I use quotes because \"salad\" isn't the way to describe how the potatoes were prepared. The small red potatoes were presented in a small bowl, chopped, with great seasoning added. And unlike most potato salads, there was no mustard or sauce mixed in... which was great!
 
Added bonus: The staff cleans up your table so you don't have to bus your tray."}
{"text":"I always get the protein power plate because the caramelized onions are on point . Zoe's is a great spot to get healthy food that is cheap and quickly prepared. They sometimes offer free hummus for your first time there as well. My friends got the falafel and said it was pretty good as well. It was the Cali'flour bowl."}
{"text":"Zoes is awesome! Healthy food, great service and great prices. :-)"}
{"text":"Good things first: The restaurant looks super clean and very modern with good colorful furniture. The staff were great and quick to serve our food. Now the bad news, the quantity is very meager and very little. We went in hungry and came out hungry. The ingredients were fresh and my salad was not at all sloppy. But it made my plate look as if I am dieting. Unless you want to eat less for 8-10$ I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped in to grab a quick lunch with the husband. They had many healthy options. We chose the spinach wrap and a chicken dish. They have many vegan and Mediterranean foods. Clean and inviting atmosphere. One of the best things though, was the manager Marty. After we told her it was our first time there she brought over the hummus platter for us to try, on the house. She was very attentive and came over a couple times to chat and see how we were doing. She was walking around picking up trash and cleaning her store. If I were the owner, Marty would be the kind of manager I would want running my asset. Would highly recommend for a quick, healthy and yummy bite!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here all the time for my comfort food! I always see the manager, nick and he is always friendly and willing to help me as well as all customers! Great service!!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious!  As someone who is wary of Mediterranean food in general, I felt like I was taking a risk when I decided to come here. Any feelings of apprehension disappeared when I walked in the door.

The atmosphere is fresh, clean, and modern.  There are pictures on the wall drawn by children that put you at ease.  The cashier who took our order was so friendly and polite (even gave us free pita and hummus since it was our first time).  The food was brought out in a timely manner.

I had the Greek chicken marinara over orzo and it was amazing.  My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.  My friend let me taste his fish of the spinach wraps with chicken and it was fresh tasting and yummy - I'd order that next time, myself.  A bite if my friend's dude quinoa salad was light and crisp tasting as well, I'd get that next time for myself.

Excellent good place that puts you at ease and feeds you well.  Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Cute and casual lunch option.

// LOCATION // Just outside the Scottsdale Mall 

// SERVICE // You order at the counter, are given a number, and seat yourself. Drinks are self-serve as well at their awesome digital Coca Cola soda dispenser

// FOOD // 

     + Chicken salad sandwich: Fabulously fresh. It same consistency as tuna salad which kind of throws you off
     + Pasta salad: Fresh and refreshing without being overly dressed
     + Beef roll ups: Ate these 3 hours later and they were still super tasty. The meat is very tender
     + Greek salad dressing: Simple yet delish with olive oil and red wine vinegar. There is a bottle on every table so that you can help yourself"}
{"text":"Light, fresh, reasonably priced Mediterranean fare in a cute atmosphere. 

Friendly service (order at the counter, grab a number, and your food will be delivered), tons of seating, and yummy food.  My husband and I both ordered shrimp kebabs, and I substituted veggies for the rice. Everything was fresh and tasty.

They also have the cool giant some machine with a vast selection.

It's right near our gym, so we're sure to be regulars."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots! I think it's really underrated. Their food is consistently delicious and fresh!

I love that they don't use mayonnaise in their sides: potato salad, pasta salad, coleslaw.

I'd recommend the roll-ups. Their chocolate chip cookies are also one of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the location in Scottsdale regularly, but had not been back in 2 years or so. I just tried this location the other day and was disappointed. It took 10 minutes to get a salad, ( Around 2 pm, with maybe 5 other people in the place- already eating.) The salad also had cold wet mush potatoes under the lettuce.  The seasoning was terrible and did not go with the salad dressing at all- which was maybe why the dressing cups they gave me looked like that had not shaken the bottle up because they were all oil and no vinegar.  Also, if you are not a fan of red onions- be sure to ask for your salad without them. They started chopping them up really fine ( instead of leaving them in rings you can easily remove if needed) and the salad was at least 1/4 onions.  Really gross."}
{"text":"Fresh off a boxing workout my nephew and I were seeking out undiscovered, casual food spots in the Ballantyne and StoneCrest areas, last night we stopped in Zoes and it was perfect.  

Casual, counter-served, yummy mediteranean (did I spell it right) food, tons of healthy options , easy atmosphere and kid-friendly.  The shrimp kabob entree was on point and definitely filling!  For $12 I got the kabob, rice, salad and pita bread which I think is decent.  Would I pay that for a lunch meal, probably not, but it was a good look for post-workout dinner. 

My heads up to you would be:  The kabobs are indeed grilled so be prepared for some char on the meat, veggie and skewer.  If you're not down for some char, this isn't the kabob place for you."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy Zoe's, but not only is this location short staffed but they can not get an order correct! You wait 15-20 minutes for your food, and the order is just plain wrong....take your time and money and go to the one in the Metropolitan... at least they have their orders together."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite place for lunch. Many items on the menu I want to try. All of the ingredients were fresh and had a fairly healthy menu. Super excited to try this place and will absolutely be back. Plenty of booths and tables as well as an outside dining area. Wish I had tried this place sooner."}
{"text":"First time here...slightly disappointed. Ordered the #livemed. Waited about 7 minutes. Girl brings out order with my name then asks did I order the side live med or full live med??  At that point it didn't matter my lunch is only 30 minutes so I guess it's the side live med that was prepared!!! Didn't know there was an option of side or full. Silly me. Guess I should be happy my lunch was only $5.80 including the drink(that should've tipped me off)"}
{"text":"After the fabulous CMYE at Zoe's in Phoenix, I was delighted to see another restaurant open up in my neighborhood!

I can't really tell you how great the entire menu is because the only thing I ever order is spinach rolls with chicken and marinated slaw.  While I'm always tempted by other offerings, I also resort to my usual, and I'm never disappointed.  Well a little disappointed when my plate is empty, but not before.  I'm also a big fan of their limeade and never pass that up either.

But the best part of Zoe's is the staff.  Everyone is so incredibly hospitable.  I don't know where they find employees like that, but I'm glad they do!"}
{"text":"Good but once was enough. I had the quinoa salad with chicken, It was good but just nothing special. It also came out in about 10 seconds which I guess is a good thing, but made me feel like it was slapped together. Not that the salad tasted pre-made, just that everything on the salad was pre-made. I know, just like every other restaurant. I guess Zoe's is just not for me, I felt like it was a poor man's Flower Child for about the same price."}
{"text":"Get the lamb meatballs and cauliflower rice. Drizzle some tzatziki and harissa on top. Mix together for a magical culinary ride."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. We ordered steak kabobs entree, chicken kabob entree, chicken sandwich, and chicken roll up. Everything was stellar, the rice was perfect. The salad was fresh and colorful, the steak and chicken salad was absolutely delicious. The chicken was a tad dry so taking one star off for that, but I will be back. It is a very no frills interior and you order up front, however the food is amazing and I was impressed with how delicious everything is. Also, the cookies in the front of the register are the best cookies made by a chain restaurant. Hands down, get a cookie. The steak kabob is way better than the chicken kabob. Overall  very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"For $10- this might be the fastest and healthiest option you can find. 
I really LOVE this place. The entrees are diverse in that the Grains, salmon, rice, combinations are SO delicious.   They sauces that come with add FLAVOR. 

The entire menu is Packed with delicious options. The Bowls are my FAV.  I tries them all, and all 3 are solid.  

Place is CLEAN and staff is typically friendly.  They have locations across the valley that all are well run. 
Is not usually busy here, so Service is Quick. 

Give em a Try! ..I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give it 1 star but that's not an option. Every single time I come into this location my order is given to me wrong. The last 3 times I've gone in they mess it up and the people who work there are extremely un-attentive and have horrible customer service. Safe to say I will never be returning to another Zoe's."}
{"text":"I always feel underwhelmed when I go here. The sandwiches are average, and the prices are way too high for the mediocre food quality. The atmosphere is cool, but I would rather go to the next street over for Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Live right near this location and we love to in for fresh healthier options but the last two times I've picked up to go they have screwed up and this time was really disappointing. I just went in 15 minutes ago and ordered the Greek salad with chicken and an extra side of potato salad. I was charged for the extra side but instead I got the potato salad on the side. The salad was the wimpiest most pathetic salad I've ever seen them serve and there wasn't any pita bread included. I don't know what's going on with Zoe's but I might need to find another option for my nearby go-to.  It's unfortunate!"}
{"text":"So I heard big things about this place from several different people, to say honestly I really wasn't to to impressed. I mean the food was good, but I guess they fail on presentation, I mean it kind of reminded me of a hospital cafeteria, and the bags of chips with your meal...I was like I could of got this at Subway for cheaper.
Overall this place was okay, I see why they call it a kitchen because I could of pretty much made the food in my kitchen, and saved the gas and money and made my turkey pita sandwich and pasta salad at home, and had enough left over for the whole week. 
My opinion of this place would be a hometown subway, trying to be something its not. Zoe you are not True Food. Give up, be what you are a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and fresh, and the customer service is great. Good healthy fast food. Finally!"}
{"text":"It was perfect. My boyfriend and I were in a hurry, wanted something quick, healthy and light and Zoe's delivered. Not literally, we ate in. Service was amazingly quick and friendly. We ordered the Chicken Roll-Ups, which were delicious and wonderfully complimented by their salsa, which the server brought extras of! All in all, great experience, I'd love to go back, but I live in Cincy. Oh well. Rock on Zoe's."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, can get VERY BUSY at lunch with limited seating, but you really can't go wrong here.  Definitely get the app on your phone and you can get free food with each visit.  Bonus:  the chocolate cake really tastes like my mother's homemade version.  It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this with, I love Zoe's in Blakeney.  I eat there at least once a week.  I was in the South Park area, so I thought I would stop in to their newest Charlotte  location.  Unfortunately, as of 3/10/14 they are still trying to iron out their grand opening kinks.  We were there at lunch and it took a good 15-20 minutes to get our food.  My chicken roll ups were not prepared correctly and the potato salad (which is normally my favorite fresh side!) was drowning in their dressing.  The staff and management were aware of the timing issues and comped our meal without us even asking which was greatly appreciated.  Customer service goes a very long way!  If I'm ever back in the area, I will definitely stop in and give them another try.  I'm sure with some time and experience under their belts they will get things up to normal Zoe standards!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Zoe's. I love the logo and the font used on their restaurant marquee. But I just don't get it.  The building space at this location is bizarre, for one thing. Long and awkward and it's like a walk of shame to get to the bathroom if you've come in through the south entrance. The menu is also bizarre insofar as - there wasn't anything on there that I thought, \"wow, i really want to try that.\" It's been several months since I went, so I don't remember what I ended up with, but my friend and I both agreed that whatever we had for lunch was too much to pay, not really what we wanted to eat, and not really comfortable in the atmosphere in which it was presented. Styrofoam serving options bring on the guilt that is generally felt when one eats at McDonald's and throws away more garbage than one consumed.  I haven't been back to Zoe's and I don't think I'm missing much."}
{"text":"Zoes was a good experience. Red pepper hummus, turkey stack sandwich and an iced tea. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. I grabbed my drink an they brought out the hummus and sandwich as they were prepared - all within a couple of minutes of sitting down. Easy music, relaxed casual setting. I'll be back in the future. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This past weekend, I squealed in delight to learn about the Simply 500 menu that Zoes recently launched. Well, they didn't actually launch it since the items have always been on their menu, but they've finally made it easy on on the calorie-conscious to figure out what to order while visiting. Sadly the hummus wasn't on the menu (probably because of the pita), but there are several delicious items, including the spinach roll-ups! I uploaded the menu and posted it to the Yelp listing. Take a look! Your waistline will thank you."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!!! The food is so tasty and FRESH, which is key to my lifestyle."}
{"text":"Love love love this location! Always fast and friendly with my pick up orders. They've never gotten my order wrong or forgotten anything. One of the top places on my list for lunch when I'm at the waterfront!!"}
{"text":"Was glad to finally try Zoe's, food was good, employees were very nice, and we used real silverware!!! I hate eating with plastic ware, so thank you,,,,, I had a turkey sandwich on grilled sour dough and potato salad and shared a slice of chocolate cake. My vegetarian daughter enjoyed her lunch too and it was all very reasonably priced. Good fresh food, good quality and good portions, will be returning...."}
{"text":"Ordered through postmates.  Zoe's cancelled my order (because they couldn't understand how to use the postmates app)  Then as I tried to reorder, they continued to say they didn't have an active order for me.   The person who answered the phone was not helpful and not friendly, and the manager even less so.  In the end, I finally got my food (an hour later than planned).  The food was good, but I will never order from Zoe's again.  Their poor customer service and inability to use the postmates service they are signed up with has turned me off for good."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at Zoe's  have the tomato basil soup along with theGreek salad and their famous dressing you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The food was really good, if you like Daphne's chain restaurants you'll love this even more."}
{"text":"I had a chicken pita with a potato salad here and it was delicious! One of the best pitas I've had. I did feel it was a little pricy for a pita which is why I only gave it 4 stars. It was also very healthy... Wasn't smothered in ranch or taziki sauce like many other places."}
{"text":"Okay, so based on the owner's comment (which was very kind of her) and my co-worker's obsession with this place... I tried it again.

I ordered the Chicken Kabob entree (two skewers, rice pilaf, Greek salad, onion/peppers) with a side of hummus and pita bread. It was surprisingly better than I expected. It didn't blow me away, but definitely not a bad meal. I think I'm used to heavier spices and more flavor, which I didn't taste with their food.

I don't know if it was enough to continue ordering from Zoe's, but I wouldn't be against it either (as I was in my previous review). I definitely think everyone should give it a chance at least."}
{"text":"First time eating here and all I can say is that I hope they are able to franchise in Georgia soon.  I had the chicken Kabobs, rice and Greek salad.  Food was fresh, tasty and a good value."}
{"text":"I go here all the time for food. I've been a customer since they first opened in this area. Everything Has gone downhill except the price! The quality of the food isn't the same nor the service. I'm typing this as I sit in this location. I I ordered a kabob entree one steak one chicken. Requested veggies for a side and was told they were out, so I got rice pilaf instead. When my plate arrived I barely had any steak and the chicken pieces were so small and about four tiny pieces. I told the employee my rice was freezing cold he said \" to be honest with you we don't have a microwave and they will all be that way (cold). The staff was playing and joking around the entire time. Earlier this same day my co worker came to have lunch and there was hair in his food. I'm not sure what's going on but .... it's ridiculous"}
{"text":"Try the steak sandwich really good!  Taste better then it looks.  Came with a side of fruit all for a round nine dollars I think. The only thing is they don't have avocado, the whole time I was eating it all I could think is how much better it would taste and make me feel if only it could have a few slices of avocado on it.  I like to add avocado to sandwiches and salads to make my self feel  like I'm being healthy.      soooo...that being said, I would probably frequent this place if they allowed you to add some healthier options to the sandwiches to make me feel less guilty about what I'm eating.
."}
{"text":"First off this is a fast food type place not a sit down restaurant. Kinda Boston Market type place. That said it's pretty good, pretty healthy and pretty quick. I had the chicken kabobs which come with a Greek salad, rice and pita bread. If you go in thinking fast food you'll be satisfied if you're expecting a nice sit down meal keep walking."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's.  I always get the same thing.  But it is always delicious.  Zoe's is always clean and a pleasant place to eat for lunch.  If you're stopping by at peak lunch hours though, it might be best to call ahead - they have a separate line for pickups, and it's always much faster.  

Chicken roll ups with mozzarella instead of feta and no tomatoes, please."}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I were running errands around the metropolitan (Office Max and Marshals) when we were getting hungry - almost hangry! I have never been to Zoe's before and he always raves about it, so it was the perfect opportunity. We walked in and got in line. When we stepped up to order, the cashier (I believe Jessica) was welcoming and nice. I ended up order the chicken & steak kabobs with rice pilaf and potato salad while Zach ordered the steak stack with potato salad and an order of cole slaw. They had a little selection of beer and he ordered the Sierra Nevada Sidecar and they actually did not have any, bummer. He ended up getting the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. We got our table outside and it was a beautiful day! Once the food arrived, it felt like we barely talked. A combination of us both being so hungry and the food being so yummy! The steak (they didn't ask how I wanted it cook) was a little chewing but still delicious and had a sauce on it. AMAZING SAUCE! The chicken I think was just salt and peppered (but still very well cooked not over done) but I got to choose a sauce to dip it in. The rice was perfectly cooked! I honestly did not know if the kabobs without a good carb side would be enough, which is why I ended up getting the pilaf - which was a wise decision! The potato salad was good, but they have a Greek dressing on all the tables and I put a little dabble on top and it completely made it better! I finished almost all of my meal except a few bites (which Zach was more than happy to finish for me!) 
All of the employees were nice and friendly. 
I would have given four stars, but because they did not have a beer they displayed I am giving them 4 stars. I wish I could give 4.5!!"}
{"text":"I used to love the grilled feta sandwich which is no longer on the menu but can still be ordered. Thing is: it's not as good as it used to be. The grilled onions and basil ratio was greater and it made a difference. Now, it's just OK. There are other good things on the menu (like the roll ups) but that sandwich used to be cravable... (I'm sure it was the basil - basil is crack to me!)

Zoe's IS a really good option if you're looking to cater a work meeting... it's healthy and different from the standard giant sub alternative.

Lame that the \"free wifi\" doesn't start until after 2. I get that they don't want people clogging the tables during a lunch rush but it's still lame..."}
{"text":"Family friendly, courteous staff. Well maintained restaurant and the food is amazing. I will always recommend Zoes to everyone"}
{"text":"I ordered the quinoa salad that was okay but nothing special and a bit pricy for my taste based on the portion size. This is a great place though if your looking for a healthier eating out options. People that work here are
Friendly and helpful.."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, and (lots of) feta! As someone who had previously self-declared herself as not a big fan of Mediterranean food, I'm proudly and happily eating my words. I had stayed away from Zoe's for a while because I just didn't 'get it.' I'm glad my curiosity and hunger got the best of me and allowed me to check out what I had been missing.

Zoe's is a brightly colored and airy feeling quick-serve restaurant where you place and pay for your order at the counter and then the food is either brought to your table or directly to you for take out. You can also call your order ahead and just pick up right at the counter.

I was slightly overwhelmed by the menu on my first trip but had quickly checked out yelp and saw that the kebabs were highly raved about. The kebabs come with rice pilaf and greek salad. This is a very healthy portion of food. I usually eat one kebab and the rice and then pack up the other kebab and salad for my lunch the next day. All of it is very delicious and filling. 

On my other visit, I tried the pick two option of a tuna sandwich and greek salad. The tuna is made with capers and no mayo. Come to find out I'm not a fan of capers but that didn't completely ruin the sandwich. 

I cannot wait to try more items on the menu - rollups! steak kebabs! pita pizza! 

Service has always been friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I've had Zoes a couple times now and it keeps reinforcing my distaste for them. Doesn't matter what location you're at, the food is overpriced \"hipster\" crap. This time around, I figured I'd give it another shot as their Mediterranean Chicken looked good online. So I put an order of it in with a side of the hummus taster and cauliflower rice. I was less than impressed when I got my food in a cardboard box, wrapped up in tin foil. The chicken was just somewhat edible with an OK flavor. A bit too thick for my taste. I ate one out of the two pieces because the second piece was chewy. The Cauliflower rice was absolutely disgusting, and there was no indication it was going to come cold on the menu. Then I get 4 lousy slices of tiny pita. Okay, I get it was a sampler side, but the pita amount should match the hummus amount. If you're looking here, don't. It's a waste of money that will leave you hungry."}
{"text":"The fella and I have been here a couple of times for lunch, and I've been seriously impressed with their customer service and friendliness both times. For a fast casual place, they make it feel more like it's waiter service. It's also slammed at lunch, so get there a little before noon if you can!"}
{"text":"I've had ZoÃ«s kitchen once before but I haven't tried this location so I came over. I ordered the steak kabobs and it was so good with pure fresh ingredients. The costumer service was great and the employees were extremely nice. Everything about this restaurant was great and I'll defiantly be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by Zoe's, but enjoyed the food. I had never been to one. For lunch, it wasn't that busy, but the rainy weather probably contributed to it. This is a fast casual place specializing in Greek/Mediterranean food. 

After contemplating the menu, I landed on a power bowl with baked falafel. The bowl options also included a choice of cauliflower or rice. The power was a variety of grains. You can also include your choice of protein. 

The bowl had nice flavors. I didn't really read everything included. There was a tomato onion salad, fresh cucumbers, tzatziki, a red flavorful sauce and of course the falafel.  The flavors were nice and the tzatziki was on point. The major downfall was the falafel.  It was dry and there wasn't enough sauce to save it. I was still hungry after, too. 

I like the bright colors inside. But the booth we sat at had a huge tear on the seat. It just didn't make the best first impression aesthetically. Staff was friendly,  but it was a meh experience.  

I'd try it again, but would get something other than the falafel bowl."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Steak skewers and potatoes were awesome. Little expensive for 2 people at lunch. 26$. I wish they would of given at Least cafeteria plate and silver ware for eating inside. Shame about all the trash when a business brags about being a healthier alternative. I guess that just applies to your health and not the environment. .... Exposed ceilings are cool also but how do you monitor the dirt and dust falling onto food ? Ramsey would be pissed"}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the chicken kabobs with the Greek salad. There dressing is amazing."}
{"text":"The premise of Zoe's is awesome - fresh, Mediterranean food with a Southern twist. To be fair, we love the ZK at Birkdale Commons. But, this location is different. The kitchen does not prepare dishes according to the menu. When asked, the staff refuses to provide a hand held menu to verify. The staff flat out refused to provide the menu. They refused to correct the issue, and we were the only customers there!!!When the missing ingredient is finally brought to the table, the ramekin is half the size of the normal portion. To add insult to injury, we are told that there are cookies and cake up front, if we are interested; not please take a cookie or piece of cake on us as a way of apologizing..."}
{"text":"Omg guys, yas. Friendly people, awesome choc chip cookie, tasty chicken orzo soup. Lemony/ zesty and big shredded pieces of chicken. The lamb kebab was tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Very Tasty! Small and really busy at lunch time. That's a good thing though. 

It could be bigger at this location 

I had the steak kabobs and they were really good. 
My wife had the chicken salad and fruit. She really liked it. 
They had a good kids menu and my son loved his sandwich. 

Overall really good spot to eat healthy with the family."}
{"text":"Good food. American/Persian/Mediterranean fusion. 

If you're looking for a healthy lunch, Zoe's is the place. 

I get the chicken/steak kabob substituting rice or potatoes with the Greek side salad.  It's a great lunch every time. 

The service is amazing. They forgot a kabob in my take out, and they don't deliver, but they offered to send over extra kabobs just because. 

I'm a happy lunch regular."}
{"text":"Food is fine if you don't mind the wait.  I waited 20 minutes for a simple sandwich and soup.  The soup was served first and then sat behind the counter for 20 minutes.  Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Just had a lunch date with the hubby here because i'm working in the area at st gregory and he was in the area too. we both loved zoes! we are fans. we had the chicken kabob entree and the gruben sandwich. i loved their side salad on the entree so next time i'm near a zoe's i will be having a salad- he loved the gruben and the rice that went with the kabob dish.
our lunch was very satisfying! thank you Zoe's for a healthy and delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"Fabulous menu great friendly service and amazing food !!!! Wish they had one of these in Tucson. Thankfully we make it here a few times a year :-) thanks for another amazing meal love the additions. Had the spinach wraps with slaw and hubby had the steak wraps. Oh also a cool trendy drink touchscreen fountain. I know I'm easily amused. Anther cool thing is the awesome art on the walls from the children's hospital."}
{"text":"I usually go to Sauce next door but figured I'd give Zoe's a try.

The restaurant has a nice, modern decor but I thought the music was playing a little too loud.

I ordered the grilled chicken and slaw pita made as a sandwich.  The seasonings on the chicken were very good but the slaw seemed more like shredded lettuce.  My side of potato salad was ok but nothing super exciting.

This seems like a good place to get a healthy meal and I'll come back to try a few more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered for take out. Got the shrimp Kabobs with rice pilaf and roasted vegetables.  The Shrimp were large nice sized, zucchini grilled with some crisp left I like that. The rice was tan in color, not any flavor. The roasted vegetables were good I like crisp crunchy vegetables so the broccoli and carrots were perfect. It had some purple onions which I happen to love! and mushrooms. I got the tazhti sauce but never used it.  4 stars the rice was not anything. I will return."}
{"text":"Well, they got me with the super-sized free meals, however, when I went back to re-order what I had, I realized they are pretty pricey. Very good food, but pretty much out of my budget right now."}
{"text":"I love ZoÃ«s food but am very disappointed tonight. Our appliances are not working at home so we had to go get food near our house. Zoe's closes at 9:30. We pulled up at 9:15. One of the girl worker's walked so fast over to the door AS WE WERE WALKING UP and locked it. She didn't even look at us as we were clearly irritated. Bad look Zoe's. I am a many times a week customer and now I don't want to go back."}
{"text":"I love the fresh food here. I got the Pimento Grilled cheese grilled with grilled onions. It was very flavorful and unique with the rye bread. They have lots of sides and I got the grilled veggies. Not sure if I liked them as much as the fresh fruit that my friends got. Will go back again and try more."}
{"text":"We went for a girls dinner and I ordered the Greek chicken pita. It really could have used another good chop or two on the chicken. Some of the pieces were way too big. Overall the flavor was yummy. I got a side salad and pita bread and those were good with the Greek dressing provided on the table. It's a nice spot for a little lunch or light dinner. Overall good."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to go to when
I want healthy food fast! I ordered the chicken kabobs with the rice pilaf and roasted veggies ! It was so flavorful and light!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Much better than Pita Jungle, in my opinion. Fair prices too, for good portions."}
{"text":"Must try! This place exceeded our expectations. We were visiting old town Scottsdale for just the afternoon and saw on Yelp an overwhelming amount of places to eat w/ good reviews. Our Trolley driver told us the locals never cook, they just eat at ZoÃ«s....now we know why! We ordered the Steak Kabobs, trio hummus starter, and Greak Chicken Pitas....all AMAZING! Especially the new pesto hummus. For desert you have to try to chocolate cake, aka 'Crack Cake'. Lol. Marty the GM was so awesome in answering all out questions on dietary requirements and also sharing the company culture. Just wish we had one of these places in South Florida!"}
{"text":"Whoa, some of these reviews are mouth hanging open shocking to read! I've personally enjoyed every experience I've had here and will continue to return. Lunch time can be a bit crazy so just beware. Everything from the hummus, pitas and salads are delicious! I don't think I would call this place \"Mediterranean\" but it's good food. The tabouli salad I ordered today was gigantic and very tasty! All my co-workers who hadn't been before have loved it after a recommendation from myself. It can get a little pricey but to me isn't price difference wise to somewhere like Paradise Bakery. The food options are really good and I like that it's a healthier choice than some of the places around the area. I also love the Greek dressing they leave on the tables (which you can buy to take home as well). All in all, I am a fan and will keep returning!"}
{"text":"I had a hard time deciding what to order because everything looked so good.  I had a half of their homemade chicken salad sandwich with a side greek salad.  It was so good I can't wait to try their hummus, kabobs, numerous salads, piminto cheese, etc.etc.  

And for those like me who don't cook, they have a great selection of to go orders (like kabobs to feed a group)!  I could actually pull off a dinner party with your help.  Great idea Zoe's!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I'm sorry for not rating it sooner!  Everytime I am in here the employees are always smiling, always quick and have yet to mess up my order.  I used to work closer to this location and used to eat here almost once a week, so it was nice getting back in there today and seeing the familiar faces.  It's not often that a restaurant retains the same employees for long periods of time, so they must be doing something correct behind the counter as well!  I will forever enjoy this food and location!"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food was not good, seemed old and reheated. We love the one in Birkdale but this one was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Zoe's has been growing on me with each visit. I have tried much of the menu and have found my favorite to be the chicken and steak roll ups. They come with your choice of a side and salsa for dipping. 

Another great thing about Zoe's is the family dinner pack up. It feeds 4 or 8 and is reasonably priced. Quick, easy, and healthy meal for you and the gang. 

During the evening hours it clears out and has a welcoming calm vibe. Great for winding down and enjoying dinner. 

Park on the street if you're lucky enough to get a spot; if not, park in the Target garage and walk over."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of enjoying the Power Grain Bowl with Chicken.  The presentation was incredibly fresh appealing. Cucumbers, large cuts of seasoned chicken breast, grains, and two sauces satisfied my quest for a healthy and quick meal.  
The staff was very friendly and I could taste the love. Wow!!!"}
{"text":"Zoe's is a great place for healthier, delicious lunch options. I love the Gruben on sourdough with a side of rice pilaf. The price is decent, the staff is always nice and I love the decor."}
{"text":"Not impressed with kabobs, delivered cold to touch and tough.  The portions,  were very, very small. Left hungry. Also, soup tasted like it was out if a can of Campbell's. Gross.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"A good place for some fast Mediterranean style food."}
{"text":"It's all about the chicken salad...

I know that those people that reviewed Zoe's before me were not the biggest fans.  However, I think that Zoe's is a perfect place to go if you are looking for a healthy casual lunch.  Everything is made fresh daily, and it's pretty quick if you want it to be.

I go in phases with ordering different items.  My first few times at Zoe's, I had the 'protein power plate.'  For $7.45, this is a great option - especially if you're into the low carb diet!  It consists of grilled boneless skinless chicken breast served with grilled onions over a plateful of Zoe's special slaw.  Pretty tasty - if you like feta cheese.  Don't make the mistake that my friend Allyson B. made and order this if you are not a feta fan :)

My next phase was with the greek salad and grilled chicken... they give you a big portion, so it's very filling and Zoe's special dressing tops it off.  There is one surprise with this one though - Hiding underneath the salad is Zoe's special potato salad - assuming you like potato salad, you'll enjoy the surprise when you take a bite.  If not, you may need your napkin after that bite!

After the greek salad phase, I took advantage of Zoe's 'dinners for four.'  I highly recommend the chicken kabob dinner.  My boyfriend and brother did too!  For $26.95, this was a great deal - it fed the three of us and we had leftovers.  It came with eight chicken kabobs, a huge container of rice pilaf, greek salad, and pita bread.  Great for a night that you don't want to cook!  (They also have baked chicken and greek chicken marinara dinners for four available).

... and my latest phase is the chicken salad and fruit plate.  I am addicted!  It is a light, yummy, healthy, fresh lunch and leaves me feeling just satisfied enough that I haven't had the urge to order 'Yaya's homemade chocolate sheet cake' for dessert.  

So, four stars for Zoe's Kitchen... I've experienced friendly service and great food at both locations.  If you do go to Zoe's and try the chocolate cake before I do, please let me know if it's as good as it looks?!"}
{"text":"This new Zoes location has been open only a few weeks but it's already become a regular lunch destination in my rotation!

I'm a huge fan of Zoes' Greek Salads, chicken salad, hummus, and fruit salad.  I love their large portions, casual atmosphere, and modest prices.  I also love their \"dinners for four,\" which are perfect if you're bringing dinner over to someone's house, and they are always a hit!

Todd, the manager of this location, is super nice, as is the rest of the staff... oh, and I know it's already been written about in some of the other reviews, but you have to order a drink and use the new Coke machine!  It's incredible how many options there are.  My latest fave drink concoction is my version of an Arnold Palmer: 1/2 unsweet tea, 1/4 raspberry lemonade, and 1/4 regular lemonade.  Delish!

Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for 10% off your order!"}
{"text":"I ordered their new spinach and cheese pianida (sp?) and the taste was fine, but when I opened the tortilla, there was barely anything inside! I told the manager and they made me a new one. My daughter ordered a chicken pita but the pita was so dry that it completely fell apart. The chicken was very dry as well. She wouldn't really eat it, but since I already complained about my dish, we didn't send it back.  The topper was when I went into the ladies room, it was so disgusting with one toilet out of order and another had poo literally all over the toilet seat. So gross!!! I should've known better than to eat in there. We will not be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting the Scottsdale location for a while and LOVE it.  This location is new, and is having some growing pains, hence my four stars instead of five.  I'll update this in the future if they get better.

The good:  Food is fantastic!  Top quality, great taste, healthy options.  Everything we've had here has been exceptionally good.  The space is rather huge so it was easy to find a pick of tables even though they were pretty busy.

They are struggling with service speed, and knowing what to do with certain things like coupons.  I'm sure this will straighten out in the future."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Zoe's on Saturday. I had heard about it but had never tried it and was hungry so I popped in. I had the chicken pita which I didn't like. The caramelized onions were gross and there wasn't an tzatiki sauce on it. Plus it basically fell apart with the very thin pita it was in. My husband loved his chicken pita however so I guess it just depends on your tastes."}
{"text":"I love that this restaurant is casual, but healthy. And the food is delicious! They give you adequate portions, instead of the gi-normous Americanized super sized ones. Healthy, all natural, and delicious - oh, and also fast! I don't know why there isn't one in every town."}
{"text":"When in the mood for fresh and Mediterranean this is definitely the place to go. Their spinach roll ups or chicken roll up are a must try. 
The have sandwiches and salads but I normally get the salmon kabobs. Their rice and beans are the perfect side with the kabobs. They also have steak and chicken kabobs as well. Kabobs come with meat and grilled zucchini' and lettuce. 
They now offer family meals which include pasta and chicken which I can't wait to try the next time my fam is in town.for those who love hummus they also have on their menu. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very laid back."}
{"text":"Good but not great! My Mediterranean chicken plate was about $10 and I got two small tenders. They were flavored well, I just feel like I was shortchanged. Good Greek side salad, the beans were good. Like I said, good but not great. A nice alternative to the normal lunch choices."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Seasoned very well. Fresh. The hummus is wicked good :). The steak kabob entre is off the hook!!  Also the chicken pita is killer with the SLAW!!  You are crazy if you dont eat here once a week or more!   Service was excellent!!  $$ and worth every penny.!!"}
{"text":"Poor service, way to expensive. Would have got more for less at pita jungle. Had like three little trailed of peta and  like 4 veggies. This place sucks. Should have went to peda jungle would have got more for less!"}
{"text":"Man, what has taken me so long to check ZoÃ«s out? They're veggies are super crisp, just how I like them. The rice is delicious as were the steak kabobs with Tzitki (sp?)!

I grabbed a family pack for 4-6 people to go. Holy moly, so much food, definitely enough to feed 4-6 grown adults. I could have grabbed the smaller pack for who I was feeding. I will also mix up my kabobs next time to switch it up.

The lemonade is remarkably tasty as well. Admittedly, the pita must be as fresh as everything else because they did harden up the next day. I seriously lived on ZoÃ«s for days with this pack. I like the pesto hummus the most although, as far as hummus goes, I can't say this is one of my favorites. That isn't to say it wasn't decent, just not my fave. 

I will most def be back to make a few more selections. It tastes fresh. They also have catering."}
{"text":"My favorite place when I want a quick health lunch and I was too lazy to prep myself. The food is always great and staff has always been polite and helpful. I'm a fan of the Salmon kabobs with Greek salad and roasted vegetables. Of course it's more expensive than McDonalds but it's cheaper than adding a new prescription."}
{"text":"I had to get the battery changed in my car and was hungry so the dealership recommended that I come here to eat lunch. I ordered the steak sandwich, which had hummus spread, grilled onions, and tomatoes on it with a side of grilled veggies. I was a little disappointed at first bite because my bread was a little overly soaked in a fatty substance I'm assuming they used to grill the bread. This made my sandwich soggy and soggy makes me really sad. The sandwich itself tasted ok it seemed to be missing something to elevate the flavors and to give it a crunch. The meat also looked really sad and had no texture to it either. The grilled veggies on the side were good. They didn't seem to be seasoned at all but simply grilled. They were cooked well and no complaints there. So good job to the veggies for tasting like veggies!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Zoe's twice, and I'd have to say that this place is awesome!  I am a pretty healthy eater, and I appreciate somewhere that won't make me feel terrible post meal.  This is the spot!

I have had both the chicken kebabs and the quinoa salad.  Both are awesome.  I also added chicken to the salad.  The Greek dressing that's on the table is delicious- this is what I topped my salad with. You can tell it's all fresh- that's exactly how it tastes!  You can also smell the chicken grilling when you are outside.  Actually my visit today was after I got a smell when I was in the plaza, shopping at Trader Joe's.  One thing I need to try when I'm looking to splurge is their cookies.  There was a huge chocolate chip cookie that really tempted me at the check out.  Like woah.  

This location is in a busy plaza, which I'm pretty sure others said, but something to keep in mind.  It's also kind of cramped inside.  I was there with a stroller and felt annoying because I was weaving in and out of people.

If you want quick and healthy check it out!"}
{"text":"I wind up coming here quite a bit because it's in such an excellent location.  The lunch menus are great -  you get a sandwich, plus a side, plus a bag of chip and drink all in the deal.  It's a great alternative to all the unhealthy  take out and drive thrus right in this same area.  Check it out next time you're in the neighborhood - I think you will enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is yummy! I was told by my co-workers to try it and I was not disappointed. The service is good and friendly. The food delicious! Everything I have tried has been good. The kabobs are my favorite, either the steak,  chicken,  or shrimp they are all great."}
{"text":"As stated in previous reviews, it's best to call ahead at this location to decrease wait time."}
{"text":"Zoes is probably the healthiest place I can eat in my neighborhood, besides going to the grocery store myself. Reasonably priced and delicious, this is also one of my favorite 'Greek' places to eat. The staff at this location are always friendly and prompt to serve. I tend to call ahead and get take out ( and it tastes just as good as ordering in). I usually order salmon or shrimp kabobs with either greek salad or grilled potatoes.  I also enjoy the turkey stack sandwich. It sounds simple, but their turkey sandwich is so good ( includes feta and the toast is grilled just right). Wine is also sold by the glass here. Great place to bring family and kids. The chocolate chip cookies are so good, I haven't even tried any of their other desserts."}
{"text":"The food is really good here.  My friend had the lamb and rice and it was super flavorful. There was a confusion with my order and I ended up with a Greek salad with pototes.  It was super good though I should have gotten something else too."}
{"text":"Super dooper meh. Most generic mediterranean food ive ever had. I mean everything was fast and orderly but the food itself lacked flavor or really anything to write home about."}
{"text":"I just moved back to AZ about 2 months ago and I'm happy that I found Zoe's. In my line of work I do a lot of catering so I am experienced with good caters, bad caters, and then the excellent caters. Zoe's exceeds my expectations and gets and A+

Pros
Variety of options to choose from 
Healthy and tasty food
Free Delivery over a certain $ amount 
On time delivery 

Cons
wish the skewers had more veggies 

All around Zoe's gets my business, Thanks Joe for all of your help with my orders!"}
{"text":"Adorable little healthy place! Food is excellent and service was impeccable. 
The pita is fresh and grilled, rice pilaf is tasty but not salty.  The chicken kabobs are tender and juicy. Salad dressing comes in a bottle on the table- be sure to shake it before you use it! Must try- fresh homemade limeade. Very tasty and not too sweet! Most fun? Their awesome fountain drink machine- fun and techy. Definitely not your run of the mill fountain machine!

Yummilicious Factor = A-"}
{"text":"Customer service here was the best! The staff recognized my Levine NIC pass and went out of their way to wish us well.  Awesomeness and Thanks and great food!"}
{"text":"This is unacceptable.  Responded to the request made by Zoe's Kitchen on THREE separate occasions and no response.  What happened to good customer service?  There must be more issues with management."}
{"text":"Tried Zoe's Kitchen for dinner one night, it was mid-week and after 7pm so the place wasn't too crowed. After checking out the menu I went with the chicken kabobs and put in my order to go.

The meal had chicken kabobs with grilled peppers, onions and tomatoes on a bed of rice pilaf, and came with a pita bread cut into 4 and a Greek salad.  The Greek salad was fresh and great tasting, even without the dressing. The chicken kabobs were tender and moist, I took everything off the kabobs and just mixed it in with the rice pilaf and it made a great meal.  Perfect for a simi fast dinner."}
{"text":"I like Zoe's Kitchen. It is a little corporate-y, and it is clearly a chain that is trying a little too hard not to look like a chain, but the food is awfully good. I like it that it seems like almost every item of food has feta cheese in it. I'm a fan of the feta.

I also like all their vegetarian options, and it's not a bad place to meet a friend for lunch. There are some surprisingly cozy little nooks where you can tuck away and talk, which is nice. It doesn't hurt that it's right around the corner from Trader Joe's, too. I am always looking for an excuse to go there."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Zoe's location! The staff is always very helpful and friendly, food is always fresh and the chocolate cake is absolutely delightful, I eat on it first while waiting for my entree. Super clean and always a lovely quiet place to come do some work away from work while enjoying a delicious, healthy and comforting meal."}
{"text":"The live med salad is absolutely the most spicy and interesting salad I've ever had. The delicious contrast of the grain, squash ribbons and spinach is a perfect balance of texture and flavor. It's unlike anything I've had and I can't get enough. I try to convince everyone I know to order it. If they do, they never regret it and it becomes their new favorite too. I love foodie healthy eating!"}
{"text":"Love this place...great for lunch or picking up dinner to take home. Food is fresh & flavorful. I've introduced my boyfriend and friends that live in the area and we go back again and again."}
{"text":"I love ZoÃ«s but this one is terrible. Several times I have come and that have my order wrong, given me wilted lettuce or tried to give me a piece of cake that was the equivalent of crumbs. Today I gave them yet another chance... The smell when you walk in is/was GAWD awful.. the sanitation grad dropped 1.5 from the last visit and they said it was due to the AC... now it's muggy and smelly. This is the closest ZoÃ«s to me and unfortunately I think I have given them all the chances I can!"}
{"text":"First time ever trying Zoe's and I was kind of disappointed. First off the portion size is very small for the amount of food you get, I got the cauliflower bowl with salmon and it was $13 (see attached picture for portion). It literally had 4 baby pieces of salmon and they were dry.  The food itself was already probably a 4 out of 10, a little bland (I can make better at home). It was also a cold dish which I didn't realize, so that threw me off."}
{"text":"I might give it one more try.  The service was fast, the sandwich was relatively good but could have been more flavorable considering the price point of this restaurant.  Then came the food with a bag of plain lays Potato chips.  I think Subway offer more flavor for less money.  On the upside the coleslaw had an interesting twist with the feta cheese.  They could have cut it up better, looked like a shake out of the bag job.  Don't go out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"It was a very nice atmosphere and the simplicity of the food made it very easy to cater to any culture. There were plenty of options on the menu. So great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Unless you check your order and like cold \"Hot \" Food then this place is for you.  NOT ME !  Three chefs in the kitchen and no one knows what there are doing !  Not happy waiting almost 25 minutes for my \" cold order\" but almost another 12 minutes for a remake.   I'll go else where next time.  Thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"I stopped to pick up lunch yesterday to take back to work and I normally love this place. I could eat here everyday for a week and have plenty to choose from. However yesterday was not that great. The food was good (as always) but the customer service was definitely lacking. I got there really early (around 10:20 and they open at 10:00) and I was the only one. They were busy preparing some catering orders I could see however. I ordered the chicken roll ups with a side of slaw. As I was filling up my drink I noticed that she had rung up steak roll ups instead of chicken. I quickly walked over to her and interrupted her conversation with a guy who appeared to be training her in something. I told her that I hadn't ordered the steak and I wanted chicken and was it too late? She appeared aggravated and called back to the kitchen to tell them to make chicken instead of steak and then went right back to talking to the guy. No offer of refunding me the difference in price or apology or anything. Then I proceeded to wait at least 12 minutes for my food to finally come out. So I don't know if having a customer that early puts them off their game or what but I will certainly think twice before going again before their normal lunch times!"}
{"text":"All of my friends and family know just how much I love Zoe's! So needless to say I was ecstatic when they opened one up on my side of town finally! Hubby and I decided to stop in for dinner tonight. They have a lot of new things on their menu so we decided to try an appetizer of their Lamb Kafta meatballs. They were three perfectly sized meatballs sitting atop a sliced cucumber on a bed of tzatziki sauce. Each meatball was frosted with just the right amount of Moroccan harissa sauce. So so yummy and I could've eaten another order. I ordered the Tossed Greek salad which is my favorite salad of theirs. I love the mix of fresh veggies with the feta cheese and chunks of chicken and caramelized onions. And the  little bit of pasta salad they throw in there really adds a creaminess and surprise element. Tonight however the taste seemed kind of off and after I was done I realized it was because they used the cucumbers from the tzatziki sauce rather than fresh cucumbers.  I really didn't care for that at all. Hubby ordered my favorite sandwich, the Rosemary Ham Piadina with a side of pasta salad. He really enjoyed it and - just like me, loved the fact that there is no mayonnaise in the pasta salad. It is so easy to eat healthy when healthy tastes this good!"}
{"text":"How did I live without you for so long Zoe my love?  I can't decide what my favorite dish is here and that is a good sign!  Right near some of my favorite shopping too!  The chicken salad is good (ask for feta on it tho trust me) and the shrimp salad and turkey reuben is TO DIE FOR!!!  I am still daydreaming about the pimento cheese....yum.....  They run fun promos from time to time like free Zoes cups (bring them back in and the drinks are just 99 cents!)  The decor is a little IKEA meets McDonalds but you can stomach it for lunch trust me!  :-D"}
{"text":"The reviews of Zoe's Kitchen so far have been more than generous. Yep, it has cute decor but other than that it's some of the worst food I've ever eaten. I would give it zero stars, but Yelp won't allow that so I had to give it one.

My partner and I ate here and both wound up getting very ill. We each missed a day of work and he was so sick they have to put him on an I.V.

Stay away."}
{"text":"The food is good at Zoe's but it is always slow, especially if you are ordering to go. If you want to get something quick from here, order a few sides. Overall, good food but I much rather Le Kabab for service, speed and flavor."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I get the steak kabob and it hasn't let me down one time! It has been fantastic everytime at every location I've been too! Also, the pre made chocolate cake you can buy at the counter is delicious.  Not only is this place delicious, but it's healthy too!  Healthier than most places around anyway!  Prices are decent too. Enjoy"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is one of the best \"healthy\" alternatives for fast food.  The chicken is amongst the freshest and most flavorful, without being deep friend.  The greek salas with chicken is a must! 

Delish and nutrish!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and very healthy food, but what I am most impressed with is how friendly the staff and manager is here. You all do a great job at explaining the menu and helping pick good healthy items to eat. I usually get the power bowl which is usually fully and always healthy. If your in the area give it a try. It's more on a healthy Greek side with great tasting food."}
{"text":"ZoÃ«s is my favorite place to go. The food is always tasty and healthy and there are variety of sides and dishes. Salad dressings on all tables are made in house and are great addition to the dish. Flat breads are good too but it's been a while I had it here and from what I remember they didn't blew my mind but they were good."}
{"text":"I have frequented Zoes since they opened in my office building, and always had a great experience. I have to give kudos to Eric how hand delivered a free goodie after I was overcharged during my last visit. Thank you!

Some notes of interest:
The staff is extremely friendly
The food is extremely fresh and tasty
The Zoe's app/online ordering is AWESOME
They have an outdoor seating area overlooking the Southpark towers fountain, Fairview Rd and the SouthPark Mall (and yes, there are umbrellas for shade)
They serve beer and wine
They offer cheap refills if you purchase the Zoes cup
They reward you for loyalty when you submit your Zoes receipts (you get goodies!)

Don't let the lines scare you off. There are lines because the food is delicious and they have an awesome location for a lot of office workers that just walk to get their lunch. If you're in a hurry and just need to quickly pick something up, order ahead, and get in the special line for to-go orders, where you simply confirm your order and pick it up. They do not charge your card until you arrive and pick up your food, so you can pay with alternative methods or add things on if you like.

Also, they have the best Greek salad I've ever eaten, it's delicious! My favorite is the Tossed Greek Salad, that comes with grilled chicken and onions, and pasta salad over the salad. Don't worry carb-avoiders, you can subsitute or remove the pasta salad!

Reminder: Submit your receipts using the zoes app for free goodies!"}
{"text":"I think we might have had way too high of expectations for this place. I liked how nothing had nasty mayo all in it, but the selection was very minimal and they didn't give me an option for my side so I was stuck with potato chips. The lady was super friendly and the food was okay, but nothing more than I would expect to pick up at the grocery cafe store on my lunch break. Probably won't be back here even though the prices are good. But I'd honestly be happier with Subway."}
{"text":"Personally, this wasn't the Mediterranean experience I was looking for. It's very American-ized. The \"Protein Power Plate\" left me hungry for more...more FOOD that is. Prices are low, but portions are skimpy. I've eaten Zoes at catered events before too and it's always very good, but nothing I seek out. Think of it like a Panera-style Mediterranean spot. Good, not great, and not all that authentic. I'd seek out an original spot before this."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! It was pricey, but worth it. I haven't been in months and I returned last night. The recipes have definitely changed. I ordered a chicken kabob plate & was disappointed. The rice is not the rice they used to serve & my chicken was extremely dry. The only good thing was my fruit cup & their homemade limeade. Good thing the portions have also gotten smaller or I would've wasted so much food. I won't be going back until they change their recipes again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food so far I've only eaten one thing the cauliflower rice salmon bowl. I'm sort of obsessed with this bowl it is so delicious has quinoa, salmon obviously, cucumbers, That amazing Greek sauce that I can't seem to get autocorrect to spell for me as I can not and of course cauliflower rice. The only issue that I've had with both my visit to this location specifically is the amount of time it takes for me to get my food. It literally took me 27 minutes to get my rice bowl from ordering to walking out the door. So, frustrating, I mean a family of 4 who came in 5 minuets after I placed my ordered; ordered (mind you it was there first time ever there so they didn't know what to get), paid, round up the 2 kids and sat down got their meals before I did. Based on what I could see of the kitchen staff I feel they either forgot me or just chatting more then working. Now, this is just a observation of what I could see and that wasn't the whole kitchen. The front staff said they had to cook fresh salmon but this is twice now this has happened. I will go back mainly because I'm in love with the food but I will preorder because I am sort of a big deal and I Crap to do."}
{"text":"For what this is, I have zero complaints.  None.  The falafel salad with riced cauliflower was really tasty. It hit the spot today, especially with a bit of their table dressing on top of the falafel.    Zoes is really close to where we live and we sort of just take it for granted. I am reminded of how lucky we are to have it when our friend from California comes to visit and raves about it.   At Zoes, it's all good.   Having my bestie, Amy, with me makes it even gooder."}
{"text":"We went for lunch at 11:30 , 30 mins after opening and was told they are out of Orzo soup , tomato & orzo entrees  . Attempted to order soup & sandwich combo was told no vegetarian sandwich option . Think after cashier realized she was telling the customer no excessively,  she said she will make exception for Sandwich pairing . Asked for hot tea told they don't have, settled on iced tea label was switched on unsweet tea. Most  of the food was bland very, very bland , lentil soup was good . Tried two locations and both times left unimpressed. We won't be back ."}
{"text":"Love the food but I've ordered to go multiple times and when I arrive after the time they have told me I've had to wait an extra 20 minutes for my order. Never been disappointed with my food (once i actually get it) but something needs to change with their estimated time on to go orders."}
{"text":"Zoe's is usually really good. The first time we came here I ordered the salad that I always get. When the salad came it didn't have feta cheese or the grilled onions so I went back and got that to add to my salad. The second time I went it was up to par again. Love their salads!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that it was pricey, however, I really enjoyed my meal. I got the turkey stack with a side of fruit, fountain drink & 2 bottles of water for $20.
The staff was pleasant & the dining area was clean. No long wait times & food came out fast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend drove me down to this restaurant on a whim one Sunday afternoon, after I'd mentioned that I was in the mood for some healthy Greek. \"Authentic healthy food? Zoe's? NO.\" 

I'll admit I was a little hesitant. And kind of a jerk that day lol. I thought Zoe's was some knockoff wanna-be California \"health-freak\" joints that I'd become too familiar with back home. 

Fortunately, I was wrong. 

I ordered the spinach wraps with added chicken and he got the chicken kabobs with a side of greek salad, brown rice, and a bit of pita bread. My wraps were delectable, crispy, and soooo filling. I am also a big fan of Zoe's greek dressing, I believe it's made from scratch and I'd totally buy a bottle if they sold em. 

Sorry for doubting you, Zoe. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of your menu."}
{"text":"Very nice and fresh . I got the shrimp kebabs that were nicely spiced with good rice, cucumber raita, Greek salad and pita wedges. Was certainly a good deal."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. It's fresh and such a great change from typical quick restaurants. We were here because my 8 year old wanted to have her birthday dinner here.  
The hummus sampler platter was great to share - the cauliflower bowl I had was divine. Kids meals are small
- much better for littler ones - not hungry tweens.  
My only issue is wandering around dirty tables looking for a place to sit. Luckily they keep a tub with wet towels by the trash can so I was able to wipe up a table for us."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's Kitchen! This location at Metropolitan is great! The staff are super friendly and food is superb!  You cannot go wrong with Zoe's!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at both the Blakeney location and this one and I've come to realize that Zoe, whomever he or she may be, likes one thing to be predominant in their kitchen.  Fresh ingredients!  I love the fact that you can get very health conscious meals here.  That's important to me and to many others I would imagine.  Whether a lunch time meal or dinner you can always get a good hearty meal without overdoing it with calories or fat content here.  

Also something I love here that I wish other places would be forced to do is that their menu includes nutritional information so that you can make a educated decision on what to eat based on your specific dietary requirements.  So many times I want to try a new place (or old) and go to look up their menu online, only to find it void of any nutritional information.  That stinks.

Zoes Kitchen's interior is light and colorful which is also very pleasant and appealing to me.  

Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Second review for Zoe's....different location....same great food!  I can't get over just how good everything on the menu is at this place.  Sometimes with a chain you might have the same feel of the place but the food may be different depending on whose back in the kitchen.  Not Zoe's.  I continue to be amazed at the freshness of ingredients and the several healthy options they provide.  Service at all locations has always come with a smile and quick to the table."}
{"text":"This location is not good. New management in 2017 isn't good. Called Corporate as I work nearby and miss when it was fantastic with the 2016 management and staff, but it hasn't gotten better. My entire office is boycotting this location until it improves. Small portions, long waits for food, food preparation has gone downhill. I suggest you choose a different location other than Southpark. Rea Rd. is very good."}
{"text":"I'm not usually in this area but after a particularly disappointing lunch where I had to send my food back so I had not eaten, I was on my way home and Zoe's caught my eye. 

I've Never heard of it but I knew it wasn't around when I lived down here so I decided to check it out. 

Their menu seemed decent and healthier for you than most quick places. 

I decided to get the tuna sandwich with fruit (see pics) I declined the bag of chips that also would have come with the meal. 

Well as you can see it was nothing special and I'm not particularly fond of shredded lettuce, it belongs on tacos, but the sandwich was actually decent. 
Ice cold and not overly done tuna, fresh soft bread and good fruit. They even had Caffeine Free Diet Coke at the soda fountain. 

Now like others have said I could make something like this at home,
but I wasn't at or near home so I didn't mind getting it here. 

If I'm back in the area I would probably go back to try that chicken salad Gabi is talking about and maybe some of the chocolate cake, it looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here and absolutely loved it! The lemon cookie was not that great but overall I loved the place! I'm visiting family in the Charlotte area and stopped by for lunch. After my meal I told the manager that the chain should open a restaurant in the Brandon FL area where I live. There is a restaurant in Tampa about 15 miles away but for a person who loves Mediterranean food it's too far to drive all the time. I want a location that I can stop by and grab dinner! 2 thumbs up! I just wish I had taken a picture of my meal but I was too busy eating to take a picture!"}
{"text":"I've only had one visit to Zoe's so far and it was last Sunday afternoon. For the most part, it seems like a great place. The location is in the middle of a huge shopping location and within walking distance from all the entertainment of Old Town. The theme of the food is Mediterranean, which I love. It wouldn't surprise me that if I pay more visits here, that I would bump my rating up to four stars instead of three, but I have to base my review on my one visit. I bumped my rating down to three because I came here primarily for the shish kabobs. You see, I've been really into shish kabobs lately and I have to say my standards are really high after having some really excellent shish kabobs at another restaurant not too long ago. The steak shish kabobs that I had at Zoe's were really chewy. The flavor was not bad (could be better), but I was really hoping for something tender; the kind that tears up easily with not much effort from my spoon and fork. Although, it left me kind of disappointed, I wouldn't be opposed to going back for something quick to eat. I just won't order the steak shish kabobs."}
{"text":"So if Panera Bread woke up one morning and went all Mediterranean on you, you'd have the exact concept of Zoe's Kitchen: fast food with a distinctly healthy bent that tries to pick it up a notch, and has the price tag to match it.  It is a small chain based out of Alabama with about 50 locations throughout the South.

There are a number of salads and sandwiches on the menu, along with a number of entrees for those who want more.  Secret tip #1, however, is in my experience you get just as much food with a sandwich as you do the full meal, so save a buck or 2 there.

Yes, most sandwiches are wrapped in a pita and there is a hummus appetizer with pita chips you can also order (though I find it pricey for what you actually get).  Lots of skewed meats (shrimp, chicken, and even a beef) in a handful of different formats finish out the main dishes.  

What shines here are the sides.  No french fries here!  I am partial to the marinated slaw- it has just the littlest kick with same tangy feta bits mixed in- original and yummy.  Roasted veggies are good too, so long as they don't come out too cold.  My dining companions also like the pasta salad.  Portions are small, even for a \"side dish.\"

I will also champion the grilled shrimp salad.  The greek dressing goes well with the skewers of shrimp that are grilled just right.  Nice and healthy with a distinctive Greek twist, Opa!

Sadly, that's where the compliments end.  The roll up entrees are quite unappetizing looking and tend to not be flavorful.  They are typically not served piping hot either.  Also, this place is mainly self-seve though you do get you food brought out to the table.  Get your own refills- the at least tends to fit with the heart-healthy attitude here.

Finally, no main dish here is under $7.  That's just over the edge for a lunch that is otherwise served fast-food style.  Perhaps that's the price you pay for healthier options?  I'll go there sometimes, but I'm not ready to sing its praises from the top of the Acropolis."}
{"text":"Ok, so their Tuna on the pita is horrible! That stuff is filled with so much SALT, it would almost send you into a cardio-shock! Who mixes a boat load of salt in tuna?  What idiot does that? 
I came here since I work out right next door @ PlanetFitness.
My 1st time eating there and will be my last.
I can tell you with food that tastes like that, either this place will be shut down soon, or people in Charlotte really have no quality of taste.

The vegetables as the side were ok, but that's about it. I'm not interested in trying anything else.

There is a Thai cuisine right next door, Bangkok Ocha. Food is delicious. #1. I'm sure they are getting much more business, after Zoes moved in. There used to be 2 stores in this spot that moved to make way for this junk."}
{"text":"Nothing but great things. I eat here weekly due to the great staff and fresh food. During lunch hours they seem to still manage under pressure by getting customers in and out while still delivering good customer service. The food is really healthy and made fresh. I would recommend trying."}
{"text":"Thank you for making my day miserable. It did not start good and thanks to you it did not end well. I took a picture of the sandwich you sent. I don't think it needs any explanation. Thank again. And yes it is sarcasm."}
{"text":"If you like bland food, this is definitely the place to go!!!  Ok, those of you who like bland food will never admit it and that's ok, but if you are looking for ethnic or even interesting food (or Greek/Mediterranean like it says in the categories), don't go here.  Their food lacks spice.  If you are looking for a lunch place and you like chicken salad sandwiches and plain hummus, this is your place.  Also, if you like the food at Hob Nobs down the street, this is comparable."}
{"text":"Great food at a decent price. The sauces are on point and the staff is very knowledgeable. The place is very clean and with ample parking the lunch rush is very easy to negotiate. Looking forward to trying it out for dinner."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant off and on for years. They have had many iterations of management teams through the years. I have decided that yesterday would be my last time until new management takes over. The guys that run the store and the kitchen do not seem to care one way or the other about your food or your experience. They are NOT NICE and frankly made me uncomfortable to ingest the food I bought. I watched the guy putting the soup I ordered into a container. That is until he ducked down and disappeared from view for about two minutes with my soup. Then after those two minutes he popped back up with my soup in his hand, stared at me intently, then handed it across the counter to the cashier. I was so creeped out by his actions that I did not take the soup and got my money back. I did not trust what he had to duck down to do for two minutes to my soup. Especially after the cashier was so impatient and curt to me. Nope! Nope! Nope!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a road trip from the Grand Canyon to Scottsdale, and after a long drive we were tired and hungry.  I actually planned on trying a different restaurant on Yelp, but when we got there it didn't look appetizing, so we walked by Zoes and decided to give them a try.

I was initially hesitant because it sort of looked like a Jamba Juice or other chain restaurant (which we normally avoid) but the food looked good and we were really hungry.  We both ordered kabobs I think, my husband had fish, I had vegetable.  There was a wait on the vegetables (they had to roast them or something) and the cashier brought out a hummus on the house while we waited, which I thought was really kind and unexpected, considering it is not an expensive place.

Everything was fresh and healthy and we were pleasantly surprised, especially considering it was only about 20$ total for the two of us.  I worked for years in a nice Mediterranean style restaurant, and thought the food was quite good.  Also, compliments to the staff, who were all very helpful and nice.  Perfect place for a quick and casual meal, and also a healthy one!"}
{"text":"Waited well over 30 minutes for one turkey sandwich take out.  Every time i inquired about my meal I was told we are trying Ma'am.  We are just running behind.  The issue was people that had placed to go order were given their orders before.  

The food was horrible too, kind of like it was rushed to be put together.  Second time for bad service and sub par food."}
{"text":"My food was good but my gf ordered an egg salad sandwich w pasta salad and was delivered a tuna salad sandwich with fresh fruit. When they fixed the mistake, there was eggshell in her sandwich. No bueno."}
{"text":"Mother's Day, of course Mom picks the spot and it was the new Zoes location in Matthews. My wife and daughter have been to Zoes before, but as a first timer I must say I was very impressed. The staff was great, friendly and helpful in recommendations. The store was clean and most of all the food was great; very fresh,,,, Great job, keep the great service and great food coming."}
{"text":"Thus has a really tasty and fairly complete selection of gluten free items. I loved the lamb balls appetizer. The limeade was a great drink though s bit sweet. You might try diluting it with tea. I really liked the salmon kabobs though I expected a bit more salmon on it. One skewer had thee chunks of salmon the other had only two. 

On the whole the pricing seems fair. I think I will try the family carryout. It seems like a great deal with more than enough food for four or five people. The decor id somewhere between Chipotle and Panera. Serviceable, clean and modern but not comfortable. Go for the food."}
{"text":"I tried this place and I was a little overwhelmed by the menu i order the salmon kabobs it was really good I also really enjoyed their hummus as well"}
{"text":"This is so close by to a plethora of business offices and medical offices. It definitely has been my choice of lunch many times. If you're wanting a balanced lunch I recommend the hummus and salad plate. It comes with your choice of hummus - I stick with original. And comes with pita of course! The salad is yummy and the tzatziki. I also order a side of chicken for the salad and hummus which tops off the great meal. I can barely finish the serving they give me but I always leave satisfied and not yucky full. I feel a good fresh healthy full!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for this location to open since I love Greek and Mediterranean food, I read the Yelp reviews and most were favorable so we went there today for lunch around 1:30 PM. The place was not crowded. We placed our order and received our number and found a table. We kept waiting and waiting until our food finally arrived. I would hate to have to wait when they were crowded. I had the Greek Chicken Pita and my husband had the Steak Roll ups. Both of us agreed that the food was bland and nothing distinctive. The  tzatziki sauce on my pita was very tasteless. My husband had as a side the rice pilaf which he described as just rice.I had hoped for a great lunch but was disappointed. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I've gone to Zoe's all around the valley but the one by Fashion Square Mall  on a Sunday evening they acted like they really didn't care. The pita chips were stale and the lamb meatballs seemed like they had been sitting because they were dry and not hot. I'm not a complainer, but having experienced Zoe\"s on multiple occasions this was disappointing, I will go out of my way to go to another one other than this one"}
{"text":"I love this place because it is healthy, quick, and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. There is a register to pick up phone in orders and a takeout order usually is ready within 15 minutes. It is one of the healthiest places around and sure does beat fast food. The menu options are really great too."}
{"text":"This was my second time going in two days! Yesterday I ordered the spinach roll ups with roasted veggies as a side. I am a pescatarian and usually aim for a plant based diet 75% of the time. I viewed the menu and did not see meat listed as an ingredient in the spinach roll up. Yet, It had chicken inside. I was very disappointed. I also ordered the harissa hummus and it was disgusting. Today, I went back solely because of the side and my options were limited. I ordered the veggie kabobs with grilled potatoes and pasta salad! I will say the GRILLED POTATOES ARE BOMB!!! My other items were ok. I was fulfilled and was able to enjoy my entire meal. The staff was nice and restaurant seemed clean. However, at the time their CC machines were down. It was not an inconvenience for me. I would go back if necessary."}
{"text":"I used to love ZoÃ«s. When I worked in southpark I ate at that location at least 3x a week. My usual order is the spinach roll ups with marinara instead of salsa and the pasta salad with lemon yogurt dressing. 

I was shopping at target across the street feeling hungry so I called an order in here. The guy on the phone told me it would be 1.00 for marinara and .40 for the yogurt dressing... Seriously for condiments that you serve for free. He couldn't even provide me an explanation and did try to consult a manager. It just is what it is. I've never heard of this and I've been to every ZoÃ«s in Charlotte multiple times. 

I ended up cancelling my order. I've even went to this same ZoÃ«s after that order and just got the pasta salad and there was no charge for the yogurt dressing. Seems fishy. Either way that experience just turned me off from eating here unless it's a last resort. I'm sitting in here now with my husband while he eats not eating anything. Guess I'm protesting. I'm only giving three stars because I do love their food, but not the shadiness. To their credit though I was so disappointed that day I placed the order that I tweeted about it and ZoÃ«s tweeted me back. I never followed up, but we'll see."}
{"text":"Just order a salmon power grain bowl and this place literally gave me the 3 small chunks of salmon for a whopping $13. I live walking distance from this place and can honestly say it's been one bad experience after another at this shit show of a place. To top it off when I called back to complain they offered for me to walk back and get the 4th piece that was forgotten. It's unfortunate that this type of place brings down the wonderful waterfront and the best part of this whole situation is there are way better places around so never going back is an easy decision. Be warned if you are contemplating going here just go next door to sauce where customer service is top notch and the food is worth the price. A bunch of clowns running this show. So sad."}
{"text":"One of the 'newer' options and one of my faves in Scottsdale by the Waterfront to grab a nice, healthy- light lunch! My mother and I both fell in love with this spot. It's casual the menu is pretty open for anyone looking for something healthy and not so heavy on the stomach. I got the Turkey Club with the slaw (which I might add doesn't have mayo) which both were amazing! The guy working that day was so sweet and being that it was our first visit, he gave us a complimentary hummus appetizer- which was delish as well. You can really taste the olive oil that everything is cooked in but it's not overwhelming at all. 

If you're in the area, give it a try. Definitely one of my more favorite Fox Restaurant's."}
{"text":"So this restaurant has some great healthy options to choose for a good lunch or dinner meal. Tends to the Greek/ Mediterranean style of food, so if that is what you like, this place is great for you. I enjoyed my meal, everything tastes good, decor is nice and lots of options. I had a Mediterranean lentil soup..very good! And chicken pita with Greek side salad. My husband also had a Greek salad with lamb kebobs...done medium well, cooked to his liking! No problems with the food, so I would recommend. There is free parking structure nearby and and accessible ramp into the establishment for easy access. What I definitely did not appreciate during my visit was the girl who took my order. She was extremely unprofessional, very angry about something... slamming doors and storming around like an immature kid... I felt like I was being rushed to make an order, and then had to watch her fume the entire time I was there. 
Needless to say, I was really looking forward to having a great experience at Zoe kitchen as there were good reviews on the food. And my food was tasty, but I was very uncomfortable, ate as quickly as I could and hightailed it out of there!  My star rating dropped to 3 because of the experience I had... Note to management: please, please service is very important, and nasty attitudes need to be put in check! Note to everyone else: it's worth a try for the food options. Hopefully you get better service experience than I did."}
{"text":"Zoes kitchen is consistent, tasty, healthier then most, and fast.  Finding a good restaurant in Steele creek is no easy task, but this hits the spot. Food tastes fresh and the portions are generous. Only downside is it's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for in this case."}
{"text":"First time ordering take-out, and eating there ever. We were not disappointed! I had the chicken orzo soup & a side Greek. My boyfriend had the steak kabob. I don't think we had a bite left, lol. We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Shocking!!!! I am surprised at the bad Zoe reviews. Maybe it's what your ordering? 

Well maybe not so shocked it is healthy food peeps! It's not slathered in something or deep fried it is fresh. For a chain I rather like Zoe's. I have a great palate and do not eat a lot of sauces and such I like to taste the food. 

I enjoy the Mediterranean tuna with capers, calamata olives, and red onion. served on Zoe slaw. I am not a big fan of mayo so this oil based tuna is way better to me. 

Other Yummy choices...
The chicken kabobs ask for well done a little dried but brown and tasty with rice and a salad. 
The tuna or chicken salads on 7 grain wheat is yummy, albeit a lttle plain I like it. 
I love the spinach quesadilla and the yummy salsa with just a lil kick. 
Try the chicken roll ups tasty with a lil salsa!
The cake is delish! 

Rock out with your chicken out Zoes I will see you tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Zoe's, I so like you. I mean, I do. But I don't think this is going to be a forever kind of thing. And it's not that's I'm not a forever kind of girl, or that you're not good, because you are... it's just....

Yep, that's basically how I feel about Zoe's. I want to love it and do like some of it, but it falls short of love on every level.

The Greek dressing on the tables here saves EVERYTHING you may not like/love on your plate (braised white beans, I'm talking to you! You're gross! Pull it together, man!) and enhances the things that really shine at Zoe's like their Greek salad.

The ordering is easy, food turnaround time is quick and the indoor/outdoor seating is ample and pretty comfortable but the food and lack of variety is what Zoe's leaving me 3 staring them instead of 4. I understand you're Mediterranean place but give me something more than 2 pizza on the menu - can I get some pastas? Maybe some more veggie options (and none of that Spinach roll up junk - it was the size of a taquito and for $8 I was a little bitter)?

All I'm saying is that I like you but I don't love you and in this city full of amazing culinary fishes, I don't think I'll be B-lining to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Honestly, my visit there was perfect.

I'm not a foodie, and I've never tried this type of food before. My mom was visiting, and was lured in by the smell of grilled vegetables and spices.

The service was really great, friendly and sincere. 

We both had the veggie kabobs with a side of the pasta salad and beans with pita bread. 

I was wary about what kind of side beans and bread would make, but it was delicious. Flavorful and really comforting, especially on that pillow-soft bread.

Pasta salad was a really interesting new direction for me with its feta cheese and shell pasta. Not what I was expecting, but surprised in a good way.

The kabobs stole the show, mushrooms being our hands down favorite. 

The soda machine is the coolest thing I've seen done involving a drink, topping the previous winner (drinking soda out of a Sippasaurus). 

Chocolate chip chunk cookies are huge, soft, chewy, and wonderful. We're going steady now.

I really recommend this place! Thanks for showing me and my mom a great time."}
{"text":"This gonna be my next favorite spot beside Panera Bread.  So much different variety of food and it's healthy stuff.  It's a Mediterranean food. They have different type of pita, wraps, and salad. For the meat eater there are different type of Kabob. Great place for lunch in the uptown area and always crowded."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here.. The staff is always nice, the food is always hot and fresh, I'm a huge fan of their rice and although I don't come here as often as I used to because I moved to the middle of nowhere (Surprise, AZ) they still treat me as if I come here everyday."}
{"text":"Went for lunch two Saturdays ago. Healthy choices at decent prices. No complaints. Ordered two quinoa salads and sodas. After about 10 minutes the cashier came to us and apologized, but they had run out of ingredients to make the seconds salad. Asked if we wanted to place a different order or wanted to wait an extra 10 minutes. My friend and I were catching up so no issue waiting. She came back a few seconds later with a complimentary serving of hummus and pita bread and apologized again. It wasn't a big deal to us, but the gesture was appreciated. When salad came, it was as delicious as always. Great customer service and hospitality make you forget little things that could be annoying if not managed right. 

The restaurant is large, bright and I like the little pieces of kid created artwork that you can buy for a few bucks to support a good cause (I think its Phx Children's Hospital)."}
{"text":"Why oh why did I always pass you by???   Of course, now that I have tried your delicious fresh food - I want to stop everytime I am in the neighborhood!!  I even make excuses to BE in the neighborhood.

The chicken salad is one of my favorites - full of flavor and not so much mayo.  The hummus & pita are a great filler on those days I don't know what I want for lunch.  And the greek salad is simply the best - definitely ask for those onions on the side though if you are going back to work.

It's nice to have such fresh food and so close to uptown.  We often order from the office and pick up for our lunch.  Never had a bad experience or wrong order.

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Family loved the 1st visit here but their quality is lacking big time! Had the Lamb Kafta appetizer yesterday. Lamb was overcooked and seemed to be cooked from frozen instead of fresh, cucumber sauce was watered down. The salmon was tasteless...again..not fresh! Was really looking forward to this healthy option restaurant."}
{"text":"I see that the general consensus on the board is that the food is fast, fresh and simple. It sure is. I mean, not a French fry in sight. Strangely, for a place called \"Zoe's\" that wants to peddle kabobs and pita there isn't a tub of hummus or tzatziki in the building, and the plate was a bit dry without them. Ever hear of Maddox? His piece on Crappy Children's Artwork was likely inspired by the decor. Yiiiiich!!!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good here. My favorite is the salad and hummus plate and I have grilled chicken added. They also have a good soda selection... Sounds silly but I love diet Dr. Pepper 

Generally the staff is awesome, but there is a girl who works there that can be really rude. I have walked in and walked out when she's been there. They forgot my chicken when they brought me my food (which already took longer than normal) and when I realized there was no chicken I walked up to the counter and told her. She looked me up and down and said \"are you sure you didn't eat it already?\". Yes, I'm a little chubby... But who does that?

Other than that it's a great place!"}
{"text":"I don't get the Zoe's hate. I like their (very basic) pasta salad. The only sandwich I get is the chicken pita and I LOVE that they slice the chicken breast down the middle lengthwise and stuff all the toppings in it. That way you don't have rebel chicken pieces escaping to your plate every time you take a bite of the pita. They certainly don't skimp on the feta and I love their Greek dressing. The chocolate cake is overhyped IMO. I have had it twice and both times it was very dry and crumbly."}
{"text":"Update: I have now tried most of the menu and love the \"gruben\", the turkey stack, the chicken orzo soup, the chicken salad, and the salad & hummus plate with chicken - the caramelized onions are so freakin good.  I would stay away from the chicken roll-ups. I will never understand why people put iceberg lettuce in hot things like this....it gets totally wilted and slimy, blech."}
{"text":"Business travelers looking for a fresh healthy satisfying choice.... This is it! Located close to the hotels on South Park Rd. Large selection of healthy meals... Chix  soup  loaded with  veggies, meat and orzo.. Not too salty . Salad is fresh crunchy and satisfying . Hummus amazing.. I did not cheat but they had huge chocolate chip cookies in the counter that looked delicious."}
{"text":"Ive been to Zoe's a few times in the past, but this review is about their catering. 

My mother in law has us over for dinner last night, but didn't want to cook, so she placed an order with Zoe's and dinner was made! 

We had a Greek salad which was HUGE! Fresh and tasty! One drawback however, they forgot to give us the salad dressing, no worries though, we whipped up our own. 

Next up the rice pilaf, it was pretty good. Maybe a tad over cooked, but the flavor was good. 

Lastly, the chicken kabobs! HOLY YUM! They were cooked perfectly. I don't like tomato's in the slightest, but I went ahead and tried one from the kabob and proceeded to eat 4 more tomato's, these things were insanely amazing! 

Good job Zoe's, thanks for making dinner a snap! :)"}
{"text":"The place was very clean and the staff was friendly. I ordered half a turkey sandwich and half Greek salad (posted a picture). It was huge. I couldn't believe how much was on my plate for $7.  
I will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at this restaurant. My first time was decent at best - the items are a little over priced. This time though - they were legitimately over priced and staff did nothing about it! We were charged more than the listed menu price ($0.20) for an item - when we showed the staff the difference she stared at us like we had three heads when we asked for the difference back. She said \"Ummm no, the price has just gone up\". There was NO customer service acknowledgement at all, no apology, no \"we will have them change the menus\"... nothing. Who knows how many items are mispriced and they aren't saying a word. #shameonzoeskitchen"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and absolutely loved it!! The food was delicious and there were so many options. I ordered the spinach roll up and added grilled chicken and it was so yummy. It also came with a side and I got the pasta salad. The pasta salad had tomatoes, basil and cheese in it so it tasted like a caprese pasta salad. The meal comes with a dipping sauce and the Greek dressing on the table was also a good dipping sauce for the roll ups. Not only was the food great but the service was also very good. Overall, I was so happy with my experience and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I went there for first time not to long ago and it was so good. I got the shrimp Kabos and their to die for"}
{"text":"I am currently on the meta-fast weight control diet. I went there yesterday and enjoyed a 6 ounce chicken breast with green and a little bit of peppered vinegar. It was fantastic! Thank you I will go there again for my leaning green meal."}
{"text":"So when visiting stores in Metropolitan complex Zoes Kitchen is a good place for lunch and a nice alternative to 95% of the places in town.

They serve good food that is good for you.  The Kebobs looks great but for this visit it was a turkey sandwich which was very good.

Salads are also tasty.

For dine in patrons they bring your food to you.   During warmer months outdoor seating is nice, though a ton of traffic goes by which isn't so nice."}
{"text":"Don't know where ZoÃ«'s thinks Mediterranea is but they ain't been there. Their menu features an orzo \"tabouli\" salad...I am not inserting quotes for effect here, that's literally what the menu says. Meaning: they don't have tabouli. I ordered the steak kabob, which here's a pro-tip ZoÃ«'s, I don't think it's very Mediterranean to slather it in a sugary glaze. That's more of a fatass American thing. The hummus was your basic grocery-store mass-produced stuff."}
{"text":"The server was really nice, good was good and good location. Drinking beer at here in summer is gorgeous.
I ordered chicken kebab and my friend ordered beef kebab. Both was really good and flavorful. We went there in Sunday lunch time was not packed. The restaurants next to this place were all packed and we were asks to wait for 1 hour..."}
{"text":"It's healthy, it's easy, it's fast, it's cheap. This is a great lunch spot during the week. The staff is extremely friendly, and they will substitute anything and don't get mad when you want to make 100 modifications (sorry...and thanks). Chicken kabobs and white beans are the best thing on the menu in my opinion. And that pop machine is LEGIT."}
{"text":"For this location to be where it is, you'd think they'd have it together a little more. The food takes way longer than it should and the restaurant sometimes doesn't seem the cleanest. The food presentation is much better at other locations as well. The dining room might have had 10 total guests in there and for some reason I kept seeing orders get sent back because they were wrong - how does this happen?! Step it up Metro location!"}
{"text":"I stopped in the other day and grabbed a half a pint of their chicken salad to go figuring I could make a couple sandwiches at home. I honestly was not that impressed. I am not one for a ton of mayo but theirs was kind of dry.

Service was great and it wasn't very busy. I have ordered here for catering and love their Kabobs. I think I'll stay away from the chicken salad in the future."}
{"text":"Has been a go to place.  Today was awful.  Lunch served on dirty plates, chicken orzo soup served in cup, paid for a bowl (manager fixed), new bowl had beard hair in it from cooks. I will not be returning.  Health hazard."}
{"text":"Zoe's Kitchen is one of our favorite go-to eateries when we are \"out and about\" and have a desire for chow that is a little different, heart healthy, fast and very affordable. The place is always clean and comfortable.  We highly recommend the tasty kabobs. The choices are nicely seasoned and grilled salmon, shrimp, chicken, and steak.  Vegetables are fresh, firm and grilled as well. The chicken salad is a hit as is the lamb pita sandwich. Our general beverage of choice is the homemade limeade. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Salmon Kabobs with brown rice are the absolute best!!!!!!!!!! However, the tuna salad sandwich was not great.

Pretty pricey for a quick option but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and just light enough for hot summer days. Very good customer service! I will definitely be returning very soon"}
{"text":"After a long run, my friend and I wanted something healthy and fresh for lunch! It was the 4th of July and all of our healthy spots were closed. Luckily Zoes was open! People kept telling me how good it was and I'm disappointed it took me this long to try it out. The menu was so big, inexpensive and perfect for all types of diets. I ordered the chicken salad and fruit plate. It was amazing. I want to order this again! It had cucumber, pineapple, romaine, grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, green apple, pita slices and chicken salad. It was refreshing, filling, and the perfect summer treat! The staff (young man) working the register was SO NICE. He could tell I just finished a workout and brought me over a giant cup of iced water. I didn't even ask for it! I will be back to Zoes for sure! There was indoor and outdoor seating, it was clean inside and a fun bright environment."}
{"text":"Upscale fast food. Think if Panera did Mediterranean. I appreciate it for the type of restaurant it is while remembering it's still fast food. A reminder is that a Wendy's is across the street. Would you rather eat there? Better food for the busy masses."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I have heard of it before I moved to Charlotte but none were close to me. There menu has soo many choices! I love the spinach chicken wraps with the sautÃ©ed veggies. I tend to leave the chicken out and just get the spinach with cheese and peppers so yummy! They have nice outdoor seating and bring you food to you when it's ready. Prices are a bit high for a fast food type of place but I think they somewhat worth it. I tend to park in the parking deck , or either try to grab one of the 30 minute spots right outside of the restaurant. Overall a really nice restaurant with healthy lunch and dinner options!"}
{"text":"My Greek salad was fine but nondescript.  I was especially disappointed in the children's menu.  Pb & j on white bread...really?  we feed our dogs better.  I was hoping for some more nutritious options."}
{"text":"My very first yelp review and it goes to Zoes Kitchen. It was also my first time eating at this restaurant and the food was excellent. I had the steak stack sandwich with roasted veggies on the side and my boyfriend had the steak roll ups with rice pilaf on the side. Everything was seasoned perfectly! The atmosphere was nice and clean. The only reason I didn't sit at one of the outdoor tables is because it was cloudy and windy. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The quinoa salad is wonderful here; it was my first time ever here and I wanted something light.  They have a nice selection to choose from and atmosphere was casual but pleasant."}
{"text":"Yes, their food is very good just like it is and all the other Zoe's kitchen. But here, their service is some of the worst I've ever experienced. The people that work there are very in capable of doing their job. They move at a extremely slow pace and have very rude people that work there as well. The line is usually out the door not because of the busyness, but because the cashiers move at such a slow pace. If you go there, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"The best word I can think of to describe this place is 'meh'. I went here for lunch and I was underwhelmed by the menu. I ended up getting chicken salad with fruit. It was a small scoop of mediocre chicken salad on top of a bed of undressed greens with some grapes and two strawberry slices sprinkled on. When I asked for some dressing they told me there was some on the table. They must have been talking about the oil covered squeeze bottle containing a tasteless vinegarette. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Honey, they are winning with me. How, did you ask? 2 free entrees just for enjoying their Grand Opening. They required downloading the app but that's alright... I'll do it on the work phone and let it track us from there.  

If you come by in the morning until mid day you'll see the elders walking around for exercise.  It's smart and cute."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious! Try the steak stack grilled sandwich, it was amazing!! The vibe is fun and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Went there with the family last Friday night.  Service was good and food came out quickly.  The staff was friendly and place was clean.  I had the chicken kabob that came with rice and salad. It was very tasty and was a good value. The rest of the family enjoyed their dinners too.  Food looked and tasted fresh.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey sandwich with a side of fruit. The food was not good at all and for the price you would expect it to be better. The place was really busy so I was surprised at how bad my experience was. I haven't been back since but I at least commend them for having a healthy menu."}
{"text":"The most delicious and healthy food in town! I used this company to feed members at our meeting. Everybody just raved about the food. Great eat in, takeout and catering!!"}
{"text":"Seth and team are super-heroes. 

If you want to be treated with respect and professionalism, it doesn't get much better than Zoe's on Camelback. Insanely delicious, and healthy food. 

Love you guys!!! Thanks for being amazing."}
{"text":"So, here's my thing with Zoes Kitchen. I love that they have a lot of clean eating options especially for a fast food place, but the food is really just middle ground.  There's nothing really wrong with it, but it also doesn't blow my socks off.

My go-to order is the Cauliflower Rice bowl with Chicken.  I love how low carb this dish is, so it's fantastic when you're trying to be uber clean, but in the end it's just kinda basic.  All the elements are there (tzatziki, cauliflower rice, cucumbers, chicken..) but everything is just a little bland for my taste.  I usually have to add hot sauce or some more seasoning when I get home.  But again, this is a super clean dish and I love that I don't feel heavy after eating it, so it's why I come back to it when I need to pick up something quickly.  

If you are short on time and want a healthy fast food option, I really do think that Zoes is a fantastic place to pop into.  You may have to razzle-dazzle it a bit on your end, but you should be satisfied knowing that in the end you're getting something fresh and clean to eat."}
{"text":"So delicious!!! Quality every time I visit. I love the chicken kabobs and the rice and salad that comes with it. Also the pita bread and hummus is a definite choice. Also better and cheaper then that one greek place up in Dilworth."}
{"text":"Good Food Served In A Timely Manner.  Cashier and Manager Were Friendly.  Very Clean Place To Sit And Eat With Reasonable Food Prices."}
{"text":"I've eaten probably 36 lunches here in the last year, maybe more. I love Zoe's. It's better than sauce (the chicken at sauce weirds me out) and cheaper! Winning. I love everything I have tried here and everything always tastes fresh. There is a manager whose name escapes my mind but he is there everyday I swear and he is awesome. The service here is impeccable and it's quick and easy."}
{"text":"New menu is fantastic, food is always great, but the staff seemed frazzled and couldn't find certain items we wanted to order on the computer. Some tables waited forever for their meals. Kid's option of chicken fingers should not come with a pile of onions on top- that is not kid friendly. Lastly, there was an unbelievably annoying dinging sound coming from a computer near the drink machine that made my daughter ask me \"Would you rather listen to that dinging sound or jump out of a window?\" And we agreed we would rather both jump out of a window."}
{"text":"Beans, get the beans!!!  

I lived within walking distance to Zoe's in Raleigh and I do here as well. I love it.  I'm fairly certain they put crack in the beans. I can't stop eating them....

The Greek dressing takes me back to Santorini, my favorite place in the world.  I'm also a huge fan of their tuna. This ain't no mayonnaise laden crap. This is high quality tuna and you TASTE the tuna, not mayo. Gross.

The steak kabobs are another favorite. The hummus is amazing and garlicky.  

Each and every salad I've ever had, and I've pretty much eaten my way through the menu, is delicious. 

I just wish they had a frequent buyer's card or something dammit!"}
{"text":"Oh Zoe's, how how i love you. Oh how i\"m happy they have one in Scottsdale.  What's not to love there?  The tuna is ridiculous.  So fresh and I have no clue as to what they put in it, but oh my. The hummus?  I'm convinced it's laced with crack because it's so addictive. From salads to wraps/sandwiches, you cannot go wrong.  But what is NOT to be missed are the white beans.  Oh my god, you KNOW they aren't food for you but they taste like heaven."}
{"text":"I need to start by say that I have a thirty minute lunch. With that being said, when I order something (It's always Well ordered in advance) it has to be ready so that I can get it and go. I ordered 40 minutes before I left my job. 15 mins later I'm there.. and my food is not there. Like the guy at the register remembered my order but it's not in the to go stack. The cook remembered making my food... he asked where it was.. same thing I wondered. Some guy who I'm assuming was the manager never apologized. I said I have to go now... he said.. We can make a sandwich in two minutes. I said I ordered soup as well. He didn't say anything else. How about a freakin apology for giving my food away? How about an offer to make it and bring it to my job? That would have worked as well. Nope... none of that. So I won't be going there again...I was a military cop and I'm a Veteran.. I can go for a long time without food. Clearly at Zoes I'm going to have to. No turkey and no MRE for me. I currently work in the Financial sector but I've been doing customer service all my life. An apology would have gone a long way."}
{"text":"My office is not too far away from here and a Zoe's employee stopped in to drop off a menu along with some hummus, pita, and a free entrÃ©e coupon a little bit ago... I really couldn't NOT eat here when a company's so eager to be tried. 

My To Go order was accurately taken and ready within the allotted time given. Now if only I could find a parking spot in time. Scottsdale drivers are crazy during lunch. Somehow, I managed to make it into Zoe's in one piece. 

The cashier was super friendly and upbeat, which was nice after nearly being run over by some lady with giant Lady Gaga sunglasses and a cell phone superglued to her face. He let me know that my Zoe's cup that I'd gotten from a Yelp event meant I get 99 cent drink refills. Heck yes, hook me up! They have one of those fancy Coke machines that lets you create all sorts of drink flavors, but I'm boring and got a Sprite. Unfortunately, not everyone is as boring as I, so the line can get a little long for a drink as people slowly decide on their half Cherry Vanilla Dr. Peppers with half lemonade. 

My egg salad sandwich was good, the pasta salad was tasty, and next time I'm getting something healthier and probably more generally accepted when I say I'm going to a Mediterranian restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was sooooo good! A couple of friends and I stopped here on our lunch break and the manager Zeek was super helpful to us helping us decide what to get. The customer service was outstanding from all employees and the restaurant was squeaky clean. 10/10 recommend and I will definitely be going back! Thanks Zeek!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. To say this is a Greek restaurant is a stretch. Greek salad with potato salad?  The food was ok, but not up to what not I would typically call Greek."}
{"text":"Quality food, but horrible menu (no plan, very chaotic) and my mediterranean chicken was 70% onions (and the grilled veggies was 25%  onion.  That being said, the taste was good. 

I like the portion size. 

Slaw was great!

Staff was mildly disinterested."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak roll ups with grilled potatoes. It was great serving size for price. Extremely fresh food. Good customer service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. I had the salmon pita and it was the perfect size and the sauces were awesome it came with a side of potato salad that was also very tasty. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"A quick, fresh, and fairly healthy meal conveniently located in the Waterfront.  Zoes is a big step up from most of the options in Fashion Square's foot court, and you'll get in and out of this quick-service spot much quicker than you would at most of the full-service restaurants.  The prices for the portion size and quality of the food is more than fair.

I had the chicken rollups.  Pretty good.  Two small chicken wraps, cut in half to make four pieces, which are about two to three bites each.  There's also a nice medium salsa for dipping which is the perfect compliment to the dish.  I also had a side of brazed white beans which weren't bad, although whomever prepped it went a bit too heavy on the rosemary."}
{"text":"Fresh food fast is how I would describe Zoes Kitchen.  

I've been hooked on greek salads lately and this is one of the best.  The dressing is simple (and sits on your table) and flavorful.  The salad itself contains romaine, a few tomatoes, chicken (optional) onions, kalamata olives and feta.  A very good combination in a big bowl all for $8.75 plus tax.  

There are other options on the menu from sandwiches to pitas to kabobs, all with a greek flair.   

To drink they have a wonderful hibiscus tea as well as the typical soda fountain sugary stuff and a nice beer and wine selection.

The place is decorated very colorful and they display art from local schools.  

This is a good place to eat before/after you are at Target across the street or nearby Best Buy and Trader Joes."}
{"text":"Mediterranean? Are you for real? What is Mediterranean about this place? After shopping at Target one day I was hungry and did not want Target food, so I came here. I was excited to try it out because I've seen this place here for a while. It even has a nice outdoor seating area which I was excited about! I ordered a sandwich and a soup my friend ordered a sandwich and a salad. None of our food was up to par. So sad, I think I would have had much better food had I walked across to street to eat at the Wendy's. Their food has no flavor, it is a fast food restaurant aimed to look like a restaurant. This place reminds me of ordering something from Noodle and Company...Don't expect anything authentic or at all a Mediterranean experience. I don't think I'd come back even if I was really hungry, I'd rather go somewhere else since there are plenty of options nearby."}
{"text":"Great spinach roll ups! I really enjoyed my meal here, the food and the service were both good. They make their own dressing and leave bottles of it on the table to try, which is awesome. I loved that this was a fast food option without the guilt - they even stated on their menu which meals were under 500 calories."}
{"text":"Loved the food! (First timer here) ...  the service was also very good... Nothing fried on the kids meal! Yeiiiii.... 
I had the steak stack with greek salad... Will have this again, and again..."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Zoe's kitchen. In fact, I was here earlier today. My first Zoe's kitchen experience was in Virginia. I ordered a sandwich, soup and a drink. To be honest, I wasn't blow away by it. This was a few years back.

Anyways, moving to Charlotte I decided to give it another go since I was aiming to eat healthier. I ordered the chicken kabobs and they were outstanding. Then I went back and ordered the steak kabobs and they too were outstanding. Good size portions with salad, rice, and flatbread. Delicious. 

The service is fast and super friendly. There isn't a long wait for your food to come out and it's always solid. I can't remember going to Zoe's and thinking that it was ever different. 

Prices are reasonable and the dining area seems pretty spacious. They even have outdoor seating. There are a lot of intriguing menu items that I have yet to try, but don't worry I'll be back. And if I don't end up getting some variety of the kabobs I'll try something else. A+"}
{"text":"Zoe's Kitchen is great!  I frequented the Midtown location 2-3 times a week when I worked in the area.  Anne, the manager, runs this location well.  The food is always fresh.  You can eat something different every time you visit.  My fav is the Grueben.  Quite yummy!  This is a great place for a healthy and fast alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"My second visit here. The first time was during their grand opening week. Have absolutely loved the power grain lamb bowl and the cauliflower rice bowl! The flavor was delicious and the perfect portion. I also got a chocolate chip cookie which was to die for! Definitely give one a try!! 

My only complaint was that the service was extremely slow. It took 25 minutes for us to get our food, which is how long it took our first visit, but I expected faster service this time around since it's been a few weeks. Loved the food, and want to try it again, I'll just hope the service is a little speeder."}
{"text":"This is a good choice for uptowners to grab lunch, but I suggest going online to place your order (even if you're eating it there) as that is much quicker than standing in line.  Staff is quick & friendly.  The food seems fresh & freshly-made and is good without being too pricey."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, I guess because I've been waiting for one to open closer to where I live. When it first opened it was different and new. Now I think they just don't care any more. The staff changes, and the ones that remaine have a don't care attitude. The last two times I was there the manager messed up my order twice and made me and others waiting very frustrated. I will never go back, I'm sure they could careless. But I do, because you want nice businesses in your community. I'll go else where."}
{"text":"Poor service! That is the number one thing that stood out to me while dining at this particular location. The taste of the cuisine met, but did not surpass, my expectations once it was finally delivered to my table after the fifty minutes I spent waiting on my meal. DO NOT come here."}
{"text":"From the outside it was hard to tell if this was a sit down restaurant or order at the counter. It was the order at the counter type which is what I was hoping for. They have many Mediterranean options and sides, apps, desserts to choose from. I got a chicken pita and side of roasted veggies. The chicken pita was delicious at first but then fell apart as the sautÃ©ed onions were too much for the pita to hold. It turned very messy very fast. But it was still delicious! As we're the roasted veggies on the side. I got the limeade they had at the counter not expecting it to be as sweet and sugary as lemonade, but it was just that. Should've stuck with water as I was trying to be more healthy. Anyways all in all it was very good food, just pretty messy."}
{"text":"Healthy, fresh and pretty fast.  I like their \"goodie\" program.  I seem to get something free every time I upload a receipt.  Cool!"}
{"text":"Very nice, fresh choices.  Love it!  My children find things they like on the menu that appear fairly healthy.  The app program where you upload the receipt always pays you back with something special.  They \"sorta\" pay you for eating there.  It's nice!"}
{"text":"Cute modern decor, but food is simple.  I ordered the feta cheese sandwich with pasta and it reminded me of something you can easily make at home."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food and service my last 2 visits. This establishment prides itself on quality and timeliness.

The chicken kabobs are the way to go! Well seasoned and flavorful! As for the sides, the rice pilaf, grilled potatoes and slaw are delicious to me. You can get the potatoes hot or cold, I prefer hot. The slaw which has feta mixed in has a unique but good taste.

FYI The tzatziki (yogurt based) and the skhug (mildly spicy with cilantro) are my favorites to go along with the chicken kabobs. 

Give this place a try as they have healthy  options along with vegan and gluten free items."}
{"text":"Great food but I waited entirely too long for a to-go order of 2 sandwiches, with no service recovery. Disappointing.

Came in again several months later after my first bad experience for a quick lunch looking for a healthier option-this time 2 people were in front of me to order. It took 15 minutes due to the girl at the register clearly struggling. She finally said \"I just can't do this\" and someone came to relieve her. It then took 20 minutes to get my food (the order time is on your ticket) and the only response I got from the food runner was \"he had a lot of tickets back there.\" Never saw a manager or had any service recovery AGAIN."}
{"text":"I had dinner here and no issues, the steak kabobs were yummy and the place was very clean, I even had some wine with dinner. If you've never had this kind of food, this is the perfect place to give it a try."}
{"text":"I am trying to embrace the fast, fresh, and healthy concept.  My first attempt was the chicken pita and although I have no doubt it is healthy (healthier) I didn't get enough flavor to stick to that.

Not to be deterred I tried the steak kebabs.  I wish I had started with these kebabs.  I yearn for lamb or goat but the steak is tasty.

I like the macaroni salads bold basil and strong black pepper, although it is more than some would tolerate.

I need to try some more items before I can decide to keep the 3 star or push this place to 4 stars.

The goodies you get for taking a picture of your receipt are alright but nothing to go crazy over.  Sides and drinks mostly.

The staff are very nice and helpful.  And the place is very clean.  It is halfway between 3 and 4, so depending on my mood and the weather this could be a 4."}
{"text":"I can hardly contain my enthusiasm that Zoe's has opened in Rivergate! I can see this as our new go to spot for nights we don't want to cook, but still want to be healthy and also don't want to smash the piggy bank.

The best part of this restaurant is the food (isn't it great when it works out like that?). I was a little hesitant at first ordering the salmon skewers with a side salad and veggies. I was worried it wasn't going to be enough to keep full until our late dinner. I was so impressed with the amount and quality when the plate came out! The side salad was easily half the plate and the roasted veggies were flavorful. The salmon was a little over done and the zucchini on either end was charred which was a bummer but not a deal breaker. 

As happy as I was with my meal I think my boyfriend's steak roll ups were the real winner. I snagged a bite and was immediately in love with the steak and cheesy goodness that is essence of the roll. Even with my delicious meal I must admit there was some food envy.

The only drawback to this restaurant (other than the charred zucchini) was the wait time. Even though we came late in the afternoon with one or two orders ahead of us it was still a 20 or so minute wait for our food. Not a big deal since we weren't in a rush it just makes me a little hesitant to go there during peak hours."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes and got burned (not roasted) vegetables. I don't mind paying more than your typical fast casual place, but if so, food should be fast and flawless. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm gonna try to keep this review simple and to the point.

I was first of all extremely happy to see a Zoe's coming to steel creek as there aren't hardly any options for healthy eaters in the area, and the few in the area all of which I've tried out have been disappointing! 

Trying to keep my Steele Creek food bias at bay, I ordered my meal precisely, asking that my veggies not be over cooked or over charred. My request was met which I was extremely pleased by... I devoured my hummus app first, then I moved to my side of roasted veggies because they looked gorgeous and crisp with life the way I like them! 

Then I ate my veggie skewers, I enjoyed everything but the huge portabello chunks because quite frankly with how lightly cooked (per my request) the   veggies were...the giant pieces of mushrooms were oddly either extremely cooked or to my suspicions...not fresh and wrinkly/smushy... so I left those alone (even though I love mushrooms and cook with them daily) now I've made it to the salad which, upon first glance I did see that a decent amount of the lettuce had browned, I am picky about fresh food so I decided to dig around and pull out the bad pieces thinking it could be salvaged. Upon digging I noticed a few black things... when I looked closer one of them was some tiny black almost beetle looking bug and the other was a fruit fly.... so I altogether passed on the salad! 

If Zoe's was die hard organic, and the food extremely fresh, I could understand perhaps seeing a tiny bug and move on...but this isn't an organic farm to table restaurant, and especially since it is brand new in the area I do expect for food to be prepared thoughtfully, freshly,  and with a keen eye!"}
{"text":"Good food and decent menu. Prices are very high for what you get. I am all for value, but this seems very pricey for what you get vs quality. Top quality Mediterranean  Food. I will probably visit again, but not often."}
{"text":"Zoe's is great!! The Gruben sandwich is the best and my husband loves the chicken salad. Its always clean and the staff is very chill, which is peaceful. Try is out sometime, its different, no other place that Ive been to thats like it."}
{"text":"This new lunch spot is going into my regular rotation. I stopped by here with a friend here for lunch and found that they just happened to be handing out coupons for a free lunch. Talk about lucky! We were debating between giving this place a try or going to Olive and Ivy (they have a market with cheaper options for lunch) but the mention of \"free\" made the decision for us. I did check out the prices on the menu, though, and both our meals would have been less than $10 which I try to keep as my upper price limit for a workday lunch. 

I got a chicken pita which was very tasty but it kind of fell apart since the pita was so thin. It was a substantial amount of chicken and there were also veggies with a vinaigrette on them which I really enjoyed since I don't like the creamy yogurt sauce that most Greek places use. It came with a pasta salad that I was informed by the menu had no mayo but still appeared to be creamy. A quick taste test assured me that the creaminess was cheese... I am not sure if it was a very mild feta or a soft fresh mozzarella... but either way it was delish! My friend got the spinach roll-ups and they looked fantastic. I will definitely try those next time. They came with a side of salsa to dip them in so that is right up my alley. I did not use the space-age soda machine since it was surrounded by a gaggle of kids in awe of its features and options. Instead I had the hibiscus iced tea and it was lovely. 

I like the decor of this place. Clean and simple seating, but with some funky art on the wall to keep it from looking too corporate. Even though it was order at the counter, they also had people roaming around to pick up dirty dishes and offering to refill drinks. Everyone working there seemed friendly and happy so that always helps to make a good experience. Overall the food was nothing mind-blowing... good but not exceptional. But I got very excited about this place just because I need more options nearby for lunch that are healthy, cheap, and fast. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ordered a Lamb pita, they use lamb meatballs instead of the shaved lamb meat. The sandwich literally had two lamb meatballs on it the size of swedish meatballs and they were cut in half, NO JOKE!. I couldn't believe it, almost $10.00 for a sandwich with .75 worth of meat in it. My buddy had a salad with chewy rubbery chicken. Needless to say we won't be back, and they won't be around long I have a feeling. Go down the street to Greek Wraps."}
{"text":"ZoÃ«s is the top fast casual restaurant in the south east. If you're looking for a fun environment, with great food, and the friendliest staff: ZoÃ«s is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I went here the other night and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I am somewhat skeptical about chain Greek places however this one was good. I ordered the Mediterranean chicken that came with 2 sides. For the sides I choose rice pilaf and grilled veggies. The chicken was a little on the dry side but other then that it was good the veggies were a lil over cooked however that didn't bother me either overall my food was good. However, they have the best red pepper hummus EVER! I LOVE THEIR HUMMUS! With just a few minor difference, but overall good.

12/9/17
I had to go back for the hummus but also ordered the chicken kabob it was delicious. My new favorite."}
{"text":"I was recently provided with a coupon to sample the menu at Zoes Kitchen. This fast casual concept delivers with fresh, tasty food in an upbeat pleasant setting. The patio at the Metropolitan location was particularly lovely last week when we had a bit of cool weather. You go inside and order and pay at the counter, then a runner brings your meal to the table.

The menu focuses on Greek cuisine, with lots of fresh salads, sandwiches and signature \"roll-ups\". I tried the tossed Greek salad, which was delicious with the right combination of chicken, olives, red onion, cucumber, feta and caramelized onions. I appreciated that the salad was not drenched in dressing - you can add more of the Greek dressing if you like since it sits on every table. Zoes also offers online ordering and you can pick up a grab and go meal for 4. With offerings like kabobs, Greek chicken and the roll-ups, this sounds like a great idea for those times you just don't feel like cooking or going out. Zoes makes its own limeade, which I sampled and enjoyed as well as desserts which I will have to try next time. I look forward to returning here again to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I really want to like Zoes, love Mediterranean food. The ones in Chandler and Scottsdale were good, so we decided to go to this new one in Arrowhead since it is closer. We're a family of 8 and most liked their food, I have to admit. However my Greek salad was below par, without any dressing and they did a weird thing. I had ordered tomato soup (fine) and a steak kabob separately from the Greek salad. However, I found part of the kabob in my salad! No idea what happened with the rest of it. I asked about it, but got a look from the manager like 'that's OK'. I don't think it is. If I order separate items, they should be served like that, right? We may give them another shot, but issues like that should not happen."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and fresh ingredients. I got the spinach roll up with side of beans, husband got the steak sandwich, and sister in law got a salad. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"if you want hair in your food then this is the place to be! this is the second time I have been here, and the last. the fist time I came I received my spinach roll ups cold, so I took it back to see if they could reheat it. when I asked the female who worked in front to reheat it she was very kind and said yes, she gave it to the white female cook, the female cook rolled her eyes like I was bothering her to do her job! I received them back and I took a bight of the roll up and lone be hold I found a long piece of hair in the roll up! I quickly heading to the counter to see if I could see where it came from. an I looked closer and the same cook that rolled her eyes was not wearing her hat nor a hairnet! I was afraid to confront the female cook because she looked like she was going to take her anger out at me! the second time  I came was today. I enter through the back of the restaurant and I take a quick glance trough the small window that leads to the kitchen to see if the cooks where wearing their hats, the Hispanic male was wearing his hat so I look over to the female cook and once again the white female was wasn't wearing her hat nor a hair net! and she was also on her phone instead of attending to the costumers! So  I quickly walked out and decided never to comeback!"}
{"text":"I was pretty underwhelmed by my Zoe experience. 

At noon, the restaurant was about half full and the available tables dirty with crumbs. I ordered the greek salad with grilled chicken. The menu said mixed greens but I got chopped iceberg lettuce, heavy on the yellow heart and watery - Note to Zoe - buy a salad spinner and skip yellow lettuce. The salad was bland and yes there is a dressing sitting on the table but it was pretty average. The feta was out in force. Yes, it's a greek salad but the scattering of cucumbers and strangely, caramelized onions. 

I stuck with tea. both green and unsweetened. Again, nothing to right home about a step above Lipton but not by much. All and all, I'll pass"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Not sure if it changed hands or what but it was awful this trip. Chicken kabobs had no veggies on skewer, rice was old and crunchy with hunks of clove in it, couldn't even eat it and the pita bread and as hard as a rock. I also noticed The olive oil and vinegar dressing on the tables were very inconsistent and it looks like they were trying to cut corners and cheapen the mix. It didn't look or taste right. Definitely not consistent with the former Zoe's. Sad."}
{"text":"We've had Postmates bring us food from this Zoe's on a few occasions and the food is... ok.  None of it is terrible, but each order I've gotten made me think of another local restaurant that does the same dish better... think basic Greek Salad.  One would think that Zoe's would knock this basic salad out of the park, but that's just not the case and hasn't been on multiple occasions.  The Greek dressing is mostly oil, not NEARLY enough spices and the \"cucumber raita\"... well, it's just terrible... I mean, how can it even be so bad, bland, watery and tasteless?  Each time I've have this salad it has made me wish that we'd chosen another (far less expensive) local Greek chain instead... and I think for the price, that's a real shame."}
{"text":"The cauliflower rice bowl with added grilled chicken...  my new favorite on days when I'm working out and need something filling and light.  Try it, you won't be sorry  :-)"}
{"text":"Great healthy and fresh food. I love the salmon kabobs with roasted veggies and humus."}
{"text":"I was forewarned by a friend that this seemingly cute panera-esque (appearance wise) restaurant was the lemon equivalent of a car. You are hyped up to drive this beauty and then suddenly you hear a noise- it should be a warning but you decide to push along anyway and then damn it gives out- and you are stuck on the side of the road.... that sums up my experience perfectly:

Midway shopping at Trader Joes I put down the Guacamole Kit I was holding and decided I didnt want to cook- I wanted something that was already prepared...over to Zoes Kitchen I went. 

Appearance-wise this place is bright- kid friendly, casual and clean.

The service was quick and friendly.

The prices seemed fairly reasonable $7-10 

Upon looking at their offerings I asked myself \"what type of food is Zoes Kitchen?\" They seemed to be struggling on whether to be a Greek, Italian or Mexican restaurant- I say do one but do it well. 

The lady at the counter recommended the chicken roll up's- served with -salsa??? I decided to give it a go- and also ordered the Pasta Salad side.

The Pasta Salad was pretty good. I didnt get a vinaigrette flavor as Krishan mentioned  but I could taste the Basil and Feta. Overall I was pleased. 

The roll ups were just plain gross! They had a very mushy inside. It almost tasted like they put lettuce in there and it was all hot and soggy. I pulled out the chicken to at least try to salvage my dinner but it was hard and very dry.  I normally will just kind of finish a meal even if it's not my favorite- but this was not the case - it was inedible. Id like my $8 back ....

I don't think I would give it another shot..."}
{"text":"I ordered the spinach roll ups which come with a side,  I chose roasted vegetables and a fountain drink.  That consisted of broccoli, carrots, mushrooms,  and onions.  They bring your food out to you because it's cook to order. When I got my plated I realized it had chicken in the roll ups, which is optional, but I didn't want that.  I was wondering why my total came up to $10.50. I didn't make a big fuss about it because it was only a $1.09 difference. Next time they ask if I want a copy of the receipt,  I will say yes! Overall, my meal was delicious and I would probably come again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"ZoÃ«s Kitchen was a quick find for us after shopping at Fashion Square. I really enjoyed their vibrant fresh look. Chairs are bright colored with local children's art work hangs around the joint. I would say it is reasonably priced for its location. The meal for two came out to $22.00 and we left feeling satisfied and refreshed. 

My nicely seasoned Chicken Roll Ups were very good, included feta, tomato, and lettuce. ZoÃ«s salsa was fresh and had a hint of spice to it, very good flavor for people who don't like too much hot. Fresh fruit as a side was such a delight because it was all my favorite fruit. :-) Pineapple, green apples, grapes, orange chucks, and cantaloupe.

The boyfriend ordered ZoÃ«s Club Pita. I will say that this was a very meaty option with good flavor. He added a bit of the homemade dressing from the table to the sandwich and seemed to like it. He mentioned the dressing had a more vinegary taste. Roasted veggies were so good I had to steal some from his plate. Not overcooked and seasoned very well. There were onions, carrots, broccoli, and mushrooms. I wanted to take some of the veggies home to plate with my own food.

Dessert we shared an oatmeal cookie. It was so chewy and had lots of raisins. :-) Next time I will try a chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"I just simple love this place, Amanda the manager is so awesome an accommodating.  I love the App and I love getting free stuff. This is my best go to place over Chick-fil-A and Chipotle. Plus the food is much healthier."}
{"text":"The food is usually relatively good and fresh but lately not so much. You need to revisit the new falafel recipe- worst I've ever tasted and it's been rock hard the two times I ordered. Live med salad and tomato soup was good. Pita bread also hard."}
{"text":"I love ZoÃ«s! The food is fresh, simple and most of all delicious. I'll be honest, the first time I had ZoÃ«s was when I first moved to Charlotte and I was a little underwhelmed. My parents were visiting and we had ordered a family meal, to-go. Maybe we had waited too long to pick it up (we were also new to the area and I remember my husband getting lost on his way there) and it cooled a little too much. I was hesitant to give it another try after that; but a friend had suggested we go there for lunch since we were going to be nearby. I ordered the Greek Salad with chicken for me and the grilled chicken fingers for my son. I was absolutely hooked after that. I now crave that salad multiple times a week and have to stop myself from eating it everyday. My son,who is very picky about the proteins he eats, also ate all of his chicken. I've since been back about once a week, usually for the Greek Salad; however, I've tried the spinach  roll ups with chicken and the chicken kabobs. Everything is just delicious and the chicken is always flavorful and tender. I have also purchased their prepared chicken salad and their Greek dressing to have at home. Everything I've tried has been excellent. The staff is also incredibly friendly and very helpful. Whenever I go with my little one (which is on most occasions), they are always rolling a high chair to a table for me as soon as I finish ordering. I'm so happy I gave ZoÃ«s another try because I'm hooked! One yelper did mention that it gets crazy during the lunch hour and he wasn't kidding. We generally try to get there before noon or after 1:15ish."}
{"text":"So this might be the 4th or 5th Zoes I've written a review for. If you read any of my others you'll get the gist of the basics here. Med/Greek-influenced dishes with lots of oil and vinegar. Skewered and grilled chicken and shrimp are an add-on (and personal favorite at that) for most dishes. If you exclude them you can make a vegetarian dish out of almost anything here. Or if you're vegan it's not so difficult to say \"no cheese\" either. At Zoes, they are pretty open and considerate about your dietary needs.

For this particular Zoes, I go for lunch as it's not far from work. I've yet to see a crowd in here at lunch time so they move pretty quick. Staff has always seemed polite and helpful. When the weather's nice they have a beautiful outdoor seating area. Lately I have taken to ordering the Protein Power Plate. Not as much protein as the name seems to imply but it's a delicious helping of grilled chicken on a bed of vinegary, crunchy cabbage and cheese crumbles. Top that with some sautÃ©ed onions. It's an excellent low calorie and quick lunch."}
{"text":"Really like me some Zoe's. I can't believe I've neglected reviewing this location for so long honestly, as it was my first regular spot to partake of their wonderful Greek inspired eats.

The menu has changed only a tad since I first started coming here. They still have one of my personal favorites from the days of old: the orzo tabouli salad. I would get it with chicken kebab skewers. I'd also get the quinoa salad with kebabs. There's a very delicious, very simple \"protein Power plate\" that's a grilled chicken breast on a bed of cabage and onions. Superb if you're doing a Paleo diet or something like it.

Prices can be a bit high, especially when you consider most of this stuff could easily be made at home with a little effort and ingenuity. But they have a lock on flavor. If you're a dieter or calorie counter, this is also a great place to eat. Vegetarians, vegans, gluten and dairy sensitive will similarly not be too disappointed with the options.and if you want a sweet treat, there are some monster cookies on the counter tempting you as you order. \"Oh okay I'll have one!\""}
{"text":"First time we've eaten here, loved it! We had a hummus trio and a greek salad with chicken and the spinach wraps. Everything was very fresh and tasted wonderful. The restaurant and restrooms were clean, prices were reasonable, the staff was friendly and service was fast. Looking forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"Zoe's is the place to go for chicken salad.  Every time I've ordered the chicken salad it has been delicious.  Our family gets the chicken salad for birthday parties and it's always a big hit.

Tonight we ordered takeout online.  One plus is that the food was ready on time and ready.  I order a cauliflower bowl with chicken and my husband got the chicken roll ups and pasta salad.  

The cauliflower bowl was pretty good but the chicken was over cooked.  It was hard for me to eat the meat.  The chicken was dry in the chicken rolls ups as well.  The pasta salad was good. 

We probably will only go back for the chicken salad because over $20 was too much to pay for Dry and over cooked chicken."}
{"text":"Love Zoes Kitchen! I've been to locations elsewhere and always enjoyed it. Then again I am just partial to greek food in general. The salads are huge! I can usually make two meals out of mine. Start with the hummus, so creamy. Although this place is quick, it gets packed for lunch during the week so come prepared for a little wait!"}
{"text":"So this is my second day in a row I've stopped into Zoe's for lunch after my workout. I'm obsessed with the Mediterranean Salad Trio Bowl with either chicken or falafel (chicken was MUCH juicer but I also get that falafel tends to be on the drier side) also, today I went on their website for nutritional content and I am blown away by the low calorie and carb count and 34g of protein?! Yassss! And the price isn't bad, either. So impressed with Zoe's delicious, healthy and great prices!"}
{"text":"I am seriously so sad to do this review. You can see from my last review how much I enjoyed this place. Me and my husband came on a weekday for dinner. They weren't busy at all. We were the first ones up on the counter and there was hardly anyone in the dining area. 

We ordered our food. I got the shrimp kabobs with rice and beans and my husband got the salmon bowl. We waited and waited. I understand waiting for fresh food but we waited around 20 mins or so. I looked up and saw there was a whole row of fresh food under the heater but no one was running the food. My husband finally went to the counter and they gave us my food but not his. He asked about his food and they said they haven't even made his salmon yet. I hated that I got my food before him because we wanted to eat together. My shrimp was so sad. They were super dry and overcooked and way crunchy. Please see my pic for proof. My beans were awful. You can see in my last review how much I enjoyed them. They were bland and super watered down. My rice was ok! My husband finally got his food and he honestly thought he got the wrong dish. The portion was tiny. He ate the whole thing and was still hungry. It did not look like it was pictured online. 

I can understand a few issues and I don't mind waiting at all for fresh food. But it was really upsetting that we chose to eat there together for dinner and we couldn't even eat our dinner together because we didn't get our food at the same time. What made it worse was that we waited so long for our food and it wasn't even good. It seriously makes me so sad that this goes from 4 stars to 1 star. My shrimp was awful and you can see in my past pics how great the shrimp as looked. Beans were no good and I use to rave about them. So upsetting. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife asked me to write a review for this ZoÃ«s Kitchen. She said she ate lunch here today (7/5/17) and they usually make a good salad but today for some reason it was not right. She said \" I usually have rave reviews about ZoÃ«s Greek salad but today it was very poor. Not even one olive, two grape tomatoes, four cucumbers, one green pepper and no cheese.\" I suggested she call ZoÃ«s and give them a chance to make it right being she eats there often.


Update (later today).... They made it right."}
{"text":"Zoe's has always been one of my favorite places. This past weekend my co-workers and I called in an order (we were working all day) when my co-worker came back with the order my order was wrong. I was a little upset since I was working and had no time to run back over. I called Zoe's explained why I was upset, the girl I talked to was very understanding of my situation. They jumped on it and the manager hand delivered my order to me, obviously this is not something they do on a regular but I was very impressed by their customer service. Thank you Zoe's."}
{"text":"ZoÃ«s is an awesome restaurant to grab some flavorful and healthy bites. I used to love going here but this location has disappointed me recently. I keep going back and hoping for a better outcome but it seems like something always goes wrong. Incorrect orders, waiting for unusual amounts of time due to mistaking my order for to-go while I'm sitting at the restaurant with my number on the table, not communicating that they're out of certain ingredients when I'm ordering and serving without them, and the food hasn't been the same at all. I'm assuming the people that work here don't care too much about the restaurant. I don't feel like trying this location anymore but you should construct your own opinion."}
{"text":"Zoes always has great food... This review is about the insanely slow food turn around. I have been to this location at least 3 times that maybe has 5 customers! It should not take over 20 minutes to get a 2 orders, and one is a salad.. Lets pick up the pace, or driving the extra couple miles to Biltmore may be faster.."}
{"text":"I know that this happened a few months back....but why did you change your menu???  My staple now (with the new menu) are the roll ups.  They are really good...and they do come with sides.  But I even feel that the rice doesn't even taste the same anymore.

I will still be a regular for sure....but I am sad to see some of my fixes are gone :("}
{"text":"I would rate this place 3.5 stars. I came here with the Hubs on a Sunday afternoon. I frequent the Trader Joe's next door so I have had my eye on this place for a little while now. It wasn't busy at all and we were waited on immediately. They are a quick order restaurant. 

I ordered the chicken kabobs which came with a Greek salad and rice pilaf. My husband ordered the steak roll ups with rice pilaf. His came with Tazaki sauce which is different than the standard white sauce. I'm not sure what else is in it but it's delicious. My chicken was dry. The pita was warm and soft but not he best I have had. It's a little pricey for a quick order restaurant so I don't plan on coming back. However, the staff is super nice and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Great fresh food, the pitas are probably the best thing on the menu. I have eaten here a handful of times and have not had a side dish that hasn't been good. My one complaint would be the line can get long during the lunch hour and the seating is not big enough to seat everyone. But if a fresh healthy lunch is what you are looking for this might be for you."}
{"text":"This is our favorite go to on nights we don't have time to make dinner and refuse to eat fast food. It is always fresh and consistent. We frequent the 7th ave and McDowell location more than this one but the food tastes the same. 

Our favorites: 
Greek Salad
Chicken Salad Sandwhich
Steak Roll-ups
Protein Plate 
And for our son-Ck strip kids meal-baked ck strips, no breading and rice"}
{"text":"I'm trying to eat clean but love eating out. This can be a struggle. I chose to go to Zoe's because It sounded like Id be less tempted to go all crazy on carbs. My turkey sandwich was delicious and filling as well as their tomato soup. My mother and nephew ordered some pita sandwiches that were stuffed more than full and they loved it."}
{"text":"Zoes is one of my family's favorites. It is a healthier option for when I do not have the time or energy to cook a meal. The service is great. I would recommend the Pita and hummus, the steak roll ups, the chicken, and the Zoes club. Also, with a family of 4+ you can't go wrong with the zoes family meals, for just 29.99 you can feed a family of four! Zoes will always be my family's go-to spot for healthy take home dinners!"}
{"text":"A great healthy choice for people on the go. This location is ideal and parking garage makes it easy access. It is pretty crowded around lunch but food goes out pretty quickly.  Food is pretty good, but I can only speak for the few things I have had.  Chicken salad is a must have.  They sell by the pint, so you can take some home as well!  The steak roll ups is my go to anytime I'm in the area.  They have carmalized onions and mushrooms as well as some cheese thrown up in it!  

Overall a really good, quick food stop.  They also sell wine and beer, so you can go sit on the patio on a nice day and enjoy the views!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot. Good healthy fresh food options. Free WiFi. Nice staff. I've sat here for a few hours working and nobody has ever bothered me. Bonus I can shop before or after ."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch around 1:30. You go up and order at the counter and they give you a number. It was crowded with a long line but it moved fast. I ordered the chicken roll ups - its 2 flour tortillas filled with chicken, caramelized onions, feta cheese, and lettuce then rolled up and sliced in half so you get a total of 4 rollups. It also comes with a side- I got pasta salad. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie which is literally the size of my hand with 2 kinds of chocolate and it was great. The food took about 5 minutes to come out and they bring it to you. Overall I really liked the food and will definitely go again - I felt like I got plenty of food - I even got a to go box to take some home."}
{"text":"This place is fun! 
The food is great! They have vegan menu.
The service is awesome!
The price is average."}
{"text":"I felt that I had to write a review as I am LOVING their new menu.  So many choices.  My husband and I came here for lunch last Wednesday and everything was great.  The service was fast and courteous, the tables were clean, and the new menu is awesome.  We got the Hummus trio, Mediterranean Salad Trio bowl, and Live Med Salad with Chicken. The food, as always, was great.  My personal preference on the hummus is the classic (so next time I'll get that instead of the trio) but they were all good.  Served with Pita, Chips, and cucumbers.  We ended up splitting everything because neither of us could decide what we liked best.  We enjoyed it so much, that we got take out (ordered on the new app, so easy) and brought to a friends house for dinner.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This place is just ok, I like the grueben a (turkey rueben) sandwich but the chicken soup lacks any flavor. I've tried other sandwiches but none were tasty enough to mention.  They do a good iced green tea.

It is always clean and the service is fast. 

It's healthier than most \"order at the counter\" joints but I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today at this location for the first time and my husband takes a bite into broken pieces of GLASS in his food!! He ordered the Gruben sandwich and it was in the slaw part. He spit out a chunk of broken glass, dug around on his plate and found more little broken pieces! We told the manager, she apologized then said \"Oh I'm sure you're fine.\" Im glad she was so sure of that! Not much empathy from her. Then said they mix the slaw with their hands so this shouldn't have happened. Uhhh ok?!?! She offered to refund us on the sandwich and not the rest of our food. Us and the other couple we were with did not want to continue eating our obviously so we asked for a refund for all of our food, you would think she would've done that in the first place without us asking. Luckily my husband did not have any cuts or swallow any of it. Not going back! Very very odd response from this manager!"}
{"text":"After dropping by Zoe's a few more times, I think it's completely fair to award them additional star. Why? Let me 'splain...

1) Super fast, super fresh and delicious. This goes especially for their Turkey Stack - a grilled sandwich filled with turkey breast, mozzarella, feta spread, lettuce, tomato, sourdough and rosemary oil. Get yourself a Turkey Stack.

2) The employees are really, really sweet. Forgot your fork? No worries, they'll snag one for you while you start on your sammich. 

3) Nice outdoor seating. People watching can be enjoyable at the Met - trust me. 

4) Their desserts magnanimous. I haven't indulged in one yet but the cookies and brownies look ah-mazing. 

Definitely on my short list for a tasty lunch when I'm zooming around the Met."}
{"text":"The food is good, never had anything I just hated. The chicken plates are yummy. My fav thing here is the salad dressing. I normally go here just to buy that dressing. Greek Dressing."}
{"text":"I worked near the Scottsdale Fashion Square location & loved it. Was really excited to get one close to home. Went in with my 14 month old, have to find kid friendly places. I really liked it. Big, open space. Lots of kids, so no judgement here. Food was great. Like I remember. I've been to other Zoe's that weren't so good. For being new to the area, I think they're doing a great job. An amazing alternative to all the burger places around. If you're looking for fresh, fast, light fare. Its great option! It is a little on the pricey side though. For a salad, for myself, cup of soup(for the kiddo) & a combo soup/salad & a cookie, it was nearly $30. My mistake not asking how much the cookie was, think it was nearly $4. Ouch!"}
{"text":"I don't really get why there is potato salad in the bottom of the Greek Salad, but I like it.

Zoes Kitchen is a relatively quick, healthy meal option in the Metropolitan/Midtown area. It will probably take you longer to find a place to park than it does to get your food. Again, my rule of thumb for this parking deck is bypass the first floor and drive up to higher level. Not worth the hassle or frustration. This deck and 485 = #alloftheroadrage in Charlotte. Also, keep an eye on the front for street spots. (I can never park there... I don't parallel park)

My good friend Paul is apparently the \"Norm\" of this location. He comes here so often that all the workers know him by name. It's like having lunch with a celebrity.

I can't seem to stray away from the Greek Salad. I always add chicken and drown it in the dressing. It's healthier than ranch or blue cheese... I can be excessive, right? I can usually split the salad in half and make two meals out of it. I love that they have a hibiscus green tea drink option. Although, they also have Mr. Pibb and I love the laid back, less ambitious sibling of Dr. Pepper.

Zoes is probably more like a 3.5. I still feel like it's a little pricey for what it is, but the workers and service at this location are great. They also have a nice outside dining area. So, I'll round up to a 4."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy ZoÃ«s Kitchen very much; excellent food quality with prompt and excellent service. With that previous experience in mind, I stopped by this location (Camelback and Fashion Square). I walked in and it was not busy in the least. As I approached the counter three employees just stood there, did not greet me, back turned and completely inattentive but engrossed in conversation. The verbiage was something about 'girl you should have seen...'
I waited as I was wondering if they were busy. One finally craned her neck behind her as I asked how long I could park in the spot just outside the door because the sign  said '15 minute parking'.
I was debating whether to dine in or order out. Finally, one of them said: 'you're ok, go ahead and order' - she then promptly turned back around and one of the other employees walked away. So there I sat for an additional one or two minutes dumbfounded as no one responded to me. That may not sound like a long time but with no line at all, it is. 
Finally, a fourth employee whom I had not previously seen exhaled loudly from a booth behind the front counter: 'damn that was good' as he finished his meal and packed up his plate and walked past. He looked at me, ignored me and as he walked past, I noticed that his  pants were hanging half way down his behind with his underwear and part of his bare ass showing out. This is IN UNIFORM mind you. 
At that point, I decided to leave and never return and to mention to anyone I meet to stay away from this place.
I will return to ZoÃ«s by my house but I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Love this place and the staff, can not speak highly enough of this place or the people who work here,  The food is some of the freshest I have ever gotten out at a restaurant...  The salad is huge and is delish, I had the Quinoa Salad, & i can not rave about this enough...  My Son got the steak kabob & it was cooked to perfection, His Girlfriend got the Greek chicken pita & loved it... We also got the Hummus trio which made our meals perfect...  Did I mention how wonderful the staff is? If so it bears repeating, never seen people who are happier to be serving others... Great place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome. I ordered the med chicken and it was delicious and prepared nicely. This is one of my newest favorite places. The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming. The staff is always friendly and helpful. We need more places like this in our area. I am a customer for life."}
{"text":"visited 9/15/07

we went here because Duck and decanter was closed...

yes it reminded me of a Greek Chipotle to...

had the chicken Wraps they where ok. ate for dinner would have been better as lunch...

interesting mix of Greek and salsa...

I wish the plate was as nice as the resturant..the paper plate thing...

oh the green tea was good."}
{"text":"I was quite indecisive about last minute food and decided to try Zoe's. I had the food one time before and was satisfied so I thought to try again. I had the chicken kabobs and it was great. The Greek salad is an average salad nothing fancy. You're able to dress your salad yourself which I thought was nice ! The environment is bright and cheery, as well as the staff. I think the food is just above your average place of what you would expect from a Greek place. One of the things that sticks out and is unique is the good combinations and what their menu offers you. The prices are true to the food. I would recommend this place for someone who wants a quick bite of the \"modern\" Mediterranean food. The spinach gets wraps are awesome!!"}
{"text":"The reason why I am rating 2 stars is that this location has lost so much when it comes to customer service. My family and I would love to come here because the food was great and we always felt like our business was valued. Our most recent visit has taken this place from wanting to exceed our expectations to \"I wish you wouldn't have come in so I can go home early\" attitude. It would be nice if they would smile and make you feel welcome but I would take common courtesy. Instead, we felt like we were a bother and heaven forbid we ask a question, because it was answered with shortness of attitude and a rushed feel. We were the only ones ordering but we were bothering the young lady who took our order. Food was good, we did have to wait for 20 min for 2 salads but with everyone acting miserable to be there, we were just happy to get our food and leave"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm looking for a quick healthy lunch, and am tired of salads from the grocery store, I swing by Zoe's Kitchen on Camelback. For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas, however last time I went in, I realized they didn't have them on the menu anymore. The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful, and explained it was now basically the spinach roll-ups (add chicken). I must say, they are even more delicious!

Is it your cheapest lunch option? Probably not. I'm a frugal person by nature, but it definitely beats eating Fast Food. So it's worth the extra buck or two to know you're not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs. I've introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoe's and they all love it too. Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live!"}
{"text":"I tried Zoe's for the first time last night.  It was \"ok\" but not \"great\".  

There are *very few* vegetarian options, so I settled on a grilled cheese with tomato.  Ya know, when you go to a restaurant and actually order grilled cheese, you might hope it would be something special... maybe with a little flair.  This didn't have it.  It looked identical to something I could have made in a frying pan at home... and it came with a bag of plain 'ol Lays potato chips. 

I guess the saving grace was the side of  \"marinated slaw\".  Fresh shredded cabbage, scallions, feta cheese and a light vinagrette.  It was pretty tasty but not good enough to justify the nearly $10 I spent on the meal (with a soda).

Sadness!  I wanted this place to be some great (easy food) alternative to the Chipotle across the street ."}
{"text":"I love the South Park and Ballantyne location but I have a new issue. They changes the Quinoa salad. It was wonderful but some management genius decided to save a buck and make it look skimpy. Why mess with perfect. I don't get it."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after driving by this place a few times and was happy with what I had.

The decor here is really cute.  Simple, clean and bright.  I went with the Greek Chicken Pita, and it came with a bag of chips, a side of pasta salad and a pop.   Total bill was $9.02.  Not bad!  The chicken was tasty, pasta salad was okay at best.  I took home my extras and had them as a light dinner. 

Food here is fresh, healthy and light.  Servings are healthy in size and would gladly return in the future."}
{"text":"UPDATE: my sister received a call from the GM and he was very very nice and apologetic. He wants to do everything he can to make the situation better and we certainly appreciate that."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Zoe's with a friend yesterday. It was our first time trying the restaurant. Everyone there was super friendly and nice. We ordered the Hummus Trio for an appetizer, I had Chicken Kebobs with Steamed White Beans and Roasted Veggies (with Tzatziki and Isreali Skhug sauces). My friend had a Cauliflower Rice Bowl with Chicken.

The Hummus Trio came with Basil Pesto Hummus, Harissa Hummus, and Original Hummus. Dippers included pita bread, pita chips, cucumbers, bell peppers, and grape tomatoes. All of the hummus dips were super fresh and excellent.

My meal was very good - the chicken kebabs were spiced just right, and the Isreali Skhug sauce was my favorite. I could have eaten bowls of it. The roasted vegetables were good as well. My friend loved the Cauliflower Rice Bowl with chicken. The portion was so large she ended up taking half of it home. And neither of us left without taking hummus with us!"}
{"text":"Yum! Zoe's Kitchen is a healthy, inexpensive and casual spot for lunch. 

My boyfriend and I split the Chicken Roll-ups and the Steak Roll-ups - both were very tasty and came with dipping sauce and a side. And the homemade chocolate chip cookies were delicious - soft, chewy, and lots of chocolate chips."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm always greeted with a smile and friendly service. The food is ALWAYS fresh and delicious. I've tried several menu items and I love each of them. I've dined in and had takeout and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food online, which was convenient. I loved that there are plenty of healthier, vegan as well as gluten free options. I showed up 5 minutes before the website said my food would be ready. So I checked out, and proceeded to wait. After waiting for nearly 30 minutes, I noticed several people coming and going with to-go orders. So I went up and asked about my order, apparently it was ready, but they forgot to give it to me. I was patient and never got mad. Luckily, the hostess remembered me and offered to refund my money, which was a very nice gesture. The food was delicious and definitely good value. I just hope in the future they have a better way of organizing  the orders so none get lost. I will definitely give Zoes another try in the future for having great food and customer service."}
{"text":"This is very upsetting, the customer service has been terrible the past few weeks. Order food for pick up, and only 1 of 3 orders were correct. Very disappointed in the customer service here, now you have to figure out if you order something and pick it up, you are going to have to double check before you leave. If they keep this up they wont have a busy lunch and then they can most likely get the orders right by then."}
{"text":"start your lunch/dinner with their yia yia's chocolate sheet cake--it is very good!

i prefer their sandwiches and orzo salad!"}
{"text":"Got the tossed Greek (no feta - I know, who gets a Greek salad with no feta?  ME.  I hate feta).  

Great salad.  If I lived in the area, I'd be back often."}
{"text":"I moved to AZ from the South, and there is no sweet tea in the desert...except at Zoe's Kitchen. Their sweet tea is very close to what you get back East! 

I like the healthy fare here, and the Yelp deal of 10% off that I was able to use. My fave meal is the steak roll ups, no onions, with a side of fresh fruit, and the sweet tea. YUM!  An excellent perk is that your drinks are always 99 cents once you buy their large plastic cup and bring it with you on future visits. I wish they had additional options...the menu seems a little lacking for options. 

The employees here are nice and parking is pretty good."}
{"text":"What have you changed?  I usually love Zoe's but today not so much.  The coleslaw tasted funny, the chicken was dry and even the lettuce seemed hot from the AZ sun.  Oh, and if you're not going to cut the chicken breast anymore buy some heavier weight cutlery so you can actually cut the chicken."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and nice staff. It is always busy and seating is not the best inside when it gets busy, but one can sit at the counter if a table is not a must. There is plenty of outside seating and the food is great. I love their mimosas!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet.

Eight bucks for a chicken pita with lots of chicken and absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  I mean, no flavor at all.

The place is mysteriously crowded.  I honestly can't imagine why.

This is McDonalds for people who don't want to feel like they are walking into a McDonalds. Like McDonalds, it's also a national chain, so I'm not sure why people are saying it's \"locally owned,\" or at least any more locally owned than your local McDonalds.

{"text":"It's nice to have a healthier lunch option for a counter order style restaurant. Zoe's is bright and cheery, food is very Americanized Greek food. The feta is super bland and tomatoes were not fresh but nice greens, hummus and chicken kabobs."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!! Their kabobs are amazing along with their greek chicken pita or the spinach roll ups with chicken added! Pretty much anything I've had from there is yummy!! :) I'm so glad they opened this location that's closer to home for me"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch I had a pita with the greek salad and fruit as a dessert, the place is very busy during the lunch time. Food was delicious and the service was good too."}
{"text":"Had a salmon pita with a side Greek salad and it was hearty and delicious. The space was nice and the service was great. My cousin ordered a lamb pita with a vegetable side, but he was still hungry, so he went back to the counter and ordered a soup."}
{"text":"Who knew tasteless and Mediterranean went together.

I apparently didn't 

Instead of the dreamy hummus and usually great kebabs I expected the meal was quite spartan. 

I mean you can make food healthy but you don't have to kill every ounce of flavor to get there. The dressing couldn't salvage the flavorless wreck.

My dining companions made quick work of their food but I warrant that more to the 3 hour long Cloud Atlas movie was just endeavored in.

So yeah if you like crudites and happen to be a rabbit come to Zoes!"}
{"text":"My favorite right now. Food is great as well as customer service and management. It is little pricey but worth coming."}
{"text":"If you are looking to avoid standard fast food, this is the place for you! 

The food is light and airy without heavy condiments and priced around $7. The \"Greek/Mediterranean\" style leans towards vinegar/oil type seasoning and clean simple flavors. 

I had a warm chicken sandwich and ordered a Taboule salad to go but here's a tip - it's not a Taboule it's Tabouli Rice .. something unusual and new to me but not the couscous I was craving. 

It's kind of a \"layman\" version of Mediterranean food - something to please everyone except maybe folks that crave the more serious stuff. Good place to stop in and avoid fast food, I'll grant it that but it's a day place in my book - light airy colors and seating for a friendly rendezvous.

#NoteToSelf read menu more carefully! This place has a great location for lounging when out windowshopping in uptown Charlotte so I say A+

There is an App for Zoe's Kitchen and from what I can see you can get free goodies each time you visit. I also see there is a way to scan your latest receipt to get credit which is just up my geeky alley! Look for \"SUBMIT A ZOE'S RECEIPT\" and tell them Nancy sent you:)"}
{"text":"Even as a frequent customer, Chris and the entire staff still seem to improve service with every visit! They make sure to pay attention to every single detail of my order, including the fact that I ask for no plastic knife because I have so many piling up at home! I have visited multiple ZoÃ«s but none of them compare to the RiverGate location. It is cozy, clean, welcoming, and efficient to the best of its ability. The staff is always so friendly and helpful and I feel like I've gotten to know them on a more personal level. So happy to have such a wonderful location in the Steele Creek area!"}
{"text":"Yum! Been looking for some healthy Mediterranean food!! Found it ! home made dressing from scratch ... you've got to try it !!"}
{"text":"I love Zoe's Kitchen and I recommend it to everyone asking for a healthy alternative. I never have complaints, but the last two times I've had food from here I've been disappointed. Normally their food presentation is really nice and everything taste amazing, but my last couple of orders kinda looked like if they wanted to get my order out of the way. I've had the turkey stack last and it was just falling apart and the lettuce was all over the place. I had never had this happen before, so I was really shocked. I normally try to find the best out of things always and hopefully you take this a constructive criticism. I will keep on coming back but I'm gonna have to stop visiting if this isn't addressed. 

Also, feedback on the app. I'm always checking for my rewards and I never seem to have one. I always scan my rewards card and it seems to just say I only have 10 strips earned. I eat here pretty often that I would asume I had more strips. Something for thought or to check in on."}
{"text":"We like Zoe's kitchen because of the healthier, fresh food options . If you're familiar with this chain this location is the same as the others. 

I enjoyed looking at the artwork on the walls by younger kids while we waited for our takeout order,  the gentleman in the front was pleasant, helpful with menu questions , and even brought our take out food to us as we were chatting and looking around . 

Ordered a chicken pita with a side of pasta salad , what I really wanted was that giant chocolate chunk cookie starring me down but I resisted . 

I'm glad Matthews has a Zoe's kitchen now so we don't have to drive uptown near Target to get some greek \"fast food\""}
{"text":"Eh, to have tried more authentic Mediterranean food, I am floating around 2.5-3. I was shocked by the prices, might as well go dine at a restaurant with a waitress , get the full experience,  vs this quick option . 

I felt the selection was OK, I can't say anything popped out to me. I ended up ordering the tuna pita, it was OK. Everything was just ok, not really much of a distinct flavor to get excited over.  I will say the options for healthier food , and vegan/Vegetarian options was great . Other than that , I may have to go to Zoes again it give a more extensive review...."}
{"text":"I love food....I had the steak roll ups and some potato salad.  Steak tips had mushrooms and carmelized onions in them and this delicious dipping sauce that I kinda felt like drinking it was so dang good.  
The coolest coke machine ever is here (we need some in Text) it is a touch screen coke machine. 

I was watching th people in front of us do it first so I didnt feel too stupid taking my turn.  It was way cool...wish I would have gotten a picture.  The area is great, next will have to try a different place in same area!

They also have pictures up around the entire restraunt that were drawn by kids at the Childrens hospital was a very cute touch!"}
{"text":"So disappointing! We thought we had found a gem and have been several times since they opened. However, when picking up an order today, we saw the oil out they use for salad dressing. It's canola oil with only 25% olive oil! Their salad dressing bottle specifically says \"olive oil blend\" but clearly it's more canola oil than olive oil. It seems so deceitful. Also, very disappointing for a restaurant that claims to be health conscious. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Charged us $15 for a small fast food. Food wasn't good and based on the place and the quality, plates should be $6 not $15. That's what you would expect to pay for a really nice food and a nice restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is our go to healthier eat out spot.  I LOVE the Live Med Salad, my favorite item on the menu.  The hummus is always good too.  Fast service, great place!  We even do call in orders on occasion and items are ready when we get there."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick healthy meal (don't you feel like you're always looking for that). The only thing better would be a drive thru! I've ordered the salmon kabobs, chicken kabobs, and steak kabobs all at separate times... steak is always the best! Also forget the calories and try the chocolate cake!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here looking for something different for lunch.  The atmosphere is good but I'm quite disappointed with the sandwich. 
I ordered 1/2 tomato basil soup and 1/2 tuna sandwich.   The soup is a generous portion and the sandwich looked good.  When I tried to find the tuna I was shocked.   Barely any tuna on my sandwich.   I tried to spread it around so I could eat something besides lettuce and bread but there just want enough to spread across 1/2 a piece of bread. After spreading it as much as I could, I tried a bite.   As you could imagine, with that little of tuna, my sandwich tasted like bread and lettuce.   Not what I wanted to spend $10 on for lunch 
Quite disappointed. Go to Which Wich instead."}
{"text":"It's been busy. So I've put off this review for 2 weeks. If I weren't so busy I might have waited only 14 days. Jk. It's a nice little healthy Greek/Mediterranean food place that you wish you had a block away. Well, we actually have this place just a bit farther than a block away. I've seen this place driving by but never tried it since our heart (for healthy dine-out meal) belongs to Panera Bread. Zoe's Kitchen was a nice change. Good food, good service. Wimple interior, simple plates and cups etc. The best part was that it's not exactly the same as everything else that's out there. I'm sure it's not exactly a hundred percent Mediterranean if you ask a guy who lives in that area but it's even better because of that. Yet it's not Panera, Chipotle, and of course, McDonalds. I don't knoe if it's like that everywhere but the calorie descriptions helped me choose my meal too. All in all, a good place."}
{"text":"Anytime I can eat a lunch that combines pasta, grilled chicken, avocado, and tons of fresh vegetables all in one salad, chances are I'm going to be a fan. I recently had lunch at Zoes and while I wasn't totally blown away, it was pretty darn enjoyable. 

The space itself is pretty busy, and because you seat yourself it can be a challenge to find a decent spot (especially if you're with a big group.) After ordering, I was happy to see a few different unsweetened tea options including a few tropical varieties. So good! We got a few bowls of hummus for the table which was standard, but the pita bread was soft and yummy & I loved the olive oil drizzled on top. After filling up a little on that, I ventured into the chicken chop salad and the combo of everything in it was filling and satisfying. It also was giant, which is helpful when you know you won't be eating again for a while. It's packaged so that it's convenient to take with ya if you don't feel like eating the entire thing.

My lunch mates were so-so about their meals but I really don't have any complaints about mine. I'd definitely eat at Zoes if we had one in St. Louis. The employees were friendly, the ingredients were fresh, and we were in and out within an hour. That's what I call a major lunchtime win."}
{"text":"@ZoesKitchen is a great addition to the Scottsdale Waterfront shopping area!  Now I can have a good meal over here for under $20/plate!  

I had the Greek marinara chicken plate.  Marinated, grilled chicken breast on a bed of orzo with a nice marinara sauce.  A good portion of Greek salad on the side.

I also tried my wife's spinach wraps - reminiscent of spanikopita.

Service was outstanding.

The atmosphere is casual and nice."}
{"text":"A pseudo-Greek cafeteria. Good variety on menu, but a tad pricey to my mind for lunch. Staff friendly, but sometimes a bit obsequious. If I was in the neighborhood, I'd go back...but not worth driving there on its own."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my food. I placed an online order and my food wasn't ready when I arrived at the time it was promised to be done. They forgot to put chicken on my salad. Some of my lettuce was brown and it made me sick. This is the second location that me or a family member has gotten sick at. My father got E Coli from a location in downtown Phoenix. I question the freshness of their food."}
{"text":"Good healthy food at a quick pace. Great for takeout"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times but since I am trying to eat more healthfully and my daughter wanted to take me to lunch for a late Father's day present I picked Zoe's Kitchen. Tastefully decorated and rather hip, it suits the Metropolitan area nicely. The staff was very nice and extremely perky. They answered every question with a smile and explained that all the food was made fresh \"in-house\" daily. I had the hummus platter with pita bread and a Greek salad. It was great. the hummus was as good as mine and the pita was perfect. I appreciated that the salad was made of very fresh mixed greens and not just some chopped iceberg lettuce. My daughter got a turkey sandwich and said it was great. We will both be back."}
{"text":"Long line, bustling 'fast food' joint that takes a loooong time to get. B- salad. Bigger serving than I like. I was disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Typical Zoe's Kitchen -- good food, nice staff... But there's not a lot of parking (unless you're lucky and get a close spot). 

Nice and healthy"}
{"text":"I love the blakeney location so I was super excited when I heard one was being opened around the corner from my work, however it was quite a let down. There is not enough seating and all the tables that were empty were scattered with dirty dishes. I ended up sitting on a big bar like table. The food took longer to arrive than it did for me to eat it, most of it was cold. The people next to me finally got their food and they asked the waitress to clear the dirty dishes next to them and instead of her walking around them she reaches over top of their food and picked them up, then she noticed there was a hair in her plate. I think I'll stick with the one in blakeney when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I've had this place before when it was catered to my work.  And it was always chicken kabobs...which I don't really like.  The salad was always pretty decent, but overall...I couldn't judge off of that.  

I came here for lunch and arrived about 12PM.  The wait no line or wait.  I ordered the salmon kabob and steak kabob (which you can mix).  It came with a side Greek salad and a side (I ordered pasta salad), also either pita or cucumbers.  The salmon and steak kabobs were soooooo good.  Amazing!  I was very happy with the flavor and mix of veggies that accompanied the meat.  The salad was great also.  I didn't like the pasta salad a lot, but was too full to eat it anyway.

I was very impressed with the salmon and steak!  Make sure to get there before 12:15 PM on weekdays!! It gets packed."}
{"text":"Just sat down and first impressions are not good. The seating area is very dirty. Hummus is okay but pita bread is not very fresh. Not really looking forward to the main course if this is a reflection of what I have to look forward to. Had to edit the review down to one star after the main course came."}
{"text":"Healthy and inexpensive food in the Waterfront - YEAH!!  THe people that work here are extremely friendly, helpful and customer service friendly too.  They keep it clean and accomodate picky, higher maintenance people like myself

The food is much better quality than the places surrounding it so not sure why its not busier.  

I love the Greek salad with chicken. The chicken, the potato salad, grilled veggies, dressing... yum, I salivate just thinking of their salad. And now, they upgraded their pitas to the soft ones.  HEAVEN!!  ITs a toss up between them and Pita Jungle for best greek salad.  Depends on the day so please check them out

My hubby loves the kabob and unlimited refills on drinks. Also, they substitute a nice size side salad in case you dont want the beans or rice.

This is a place that you need to try!  If shopping at fashion square, its worth the small walk to leave the food court and eat at Zoe's"}
{"text":"The food was fresh, they make a really good Arnold palmer (mix lemonade with their sweet tea) The food is great for healthy lunch on the go or a great place to spend an hour lunch break. Clean atmosphere and staff is friendly. Win win."}
{"text":"I remember a few years ago when ZoÃ«s Kitchen was the first restaurant I had been to that had the futuristic, touch screen soda machine!

I really, really love ZoÃ«s Kitchen. You wouldn't think from the name or decor that the food was Mediterranean, but it is and they do it well. There are just a lot of little things that make the atmosphere great, such as the children's artwork on the walls. The staff at this location is very friendly, service is quick, and the food is always tasty. I could swear that they put crack in their marinated slaw..."}
{"text":"Wow! I have been a costumer at this Zoe's kitchen for a while now and I always order to-go when I don't feel like cooking and this past visit that I encountered at Zoe's kitchen was amazing!!! I love the atmosphere when I walk into this place, the greeting is warm and welcome and they never fail to make me smile. I am beyond thankful for the workers at this Zoe's kitchen because I know that I will never be disappointed. So thank you very much  when I walked into this grab my order during my last visit I was greeted by my favorite worker, her smile was very warming and she even paid for my meal, she told me that she sees me in their restaurant a lot and she was feeling grateful so she paid for it. That definitely made my day."}
{"text":"I had heard good reviews about this restaurant from a friend at work so I tried it and now I'm a fan! The hummus and pita bread is the freshest I've tasted EVER! I highly recommend it! The Mediterranean trio bowl is delicious and enough for 2 people to share!"}
{"text":"I got another olive with a pit this is not the first time. This time it chipped my tooth I'm not happy. When did they stop using banana peppers? Zoe's your really slipping up avoid the olives also I asked for extra feta cheese and paid for it but there was less on there then normal"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience in the past but gave it another chance and it was pretty good until yesterday I have been eating here at least 5 times a month and never came across an olive pit in the salad I busted my tooth when I asked an employee to speak to someone I was told everyone was to busy I would have to wait for the rush to be over having to go back to work I left my tooth hurts I won't be back"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the quinoa salad and the freshly made hummus with pita bread! It is a great lunch combo with a glass of limeade! Sydni got the chicken salad sandwich with a  side of fruit. Miriam got the cheese quesadilla and chips! #stuffed"}
{"text":"I love me some Zoe's Kitchen. This one was as good as any other. I ordered takeout and my food was fine. My only issue here was the bathroom. I made the mistake of walking into the men's restroom. They're single stall facilities. It was the condition of the bathroom is what made me realize I walked into the wrong one. There was urine on the floor, paper towels on the floor, etc. Just an all around nasty bathroom. So bad, I realized I was in the wrong place. Did I commit a crime? #HB2 Anyhow, the women's restroom was much better and far more clean, but they should make it a point to check the bathroom once per hour, especially during high traffic time."}
{"text":"Update: Zoe's Kitchen is one of the best things since sliced bread. Get the steak kabobs.

Zoe's Kitchen is fine by me. I went here for the first time last week and had the steak kabob with potatoes and a Greek salad to go. The steak kabob was good, but could've been cooked a little less to increase tenderness. The Greek salad was nearly enough for a meal on its own. It took up the entire to go box after I removed the steak. The grilled potatoes were tender and had a vinegary flavor to them. So did the steak. My second visit, I ate in side of Zoe's. Despite previous reviews discussing slow wait time, there was maybe a 10 minute wait for them to bring out my food. The young lady who took my order was very polite and informative about the app, which I downloaded. I tried the chicken kabob with white beans. I wasn't impressed by either. The chicken was fine, but the white beans lacked flavor. I'll be returning to Zoe's and trying different options in the future."}
{"text":"This place was made for me!  It has become my top spot for lunch these days.  Awesome quinoa salad, chicken kabobs, pita, vegetables, pasta salad, coleslaw, etc.  If healthy is your thing then this is all you.  I did slip up once and got one of their chocolate chip cookies, which is to die for, and ended up eating the entire thing in one sitting (they are pretty big)."}
{"text":"FRESH!!!!!!!!!!   Some good Mediterranean food on the go.  My favorite is the quinoa salad with chicken kabob...healthy and delicious.  The hummus appetizer is delicious as well, great to share before your meal comes out."}
{"text":"Good service, great staff, but the food was bad since we found a stray hair and two mosquitoes in it. If it weren't for those details, it would have been fine."}
{"text":"Loved everything about it!!! I ordered the side Greek salad and it was big with peppers , Red onions, feta cheese, pepperonciniand i added grilled chicken to it and a side of Greek potato salad. Everything's fresh and delicious. You order at counter, they give you a number to place on your table and they bring it over. They clean up too. So good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service is outstanding here. That might be one reason I frequent this location so much. The food is out of this world. I like their Greek chicken pita, and braised white beans. That's my go-to order. You might like their sandwiches or salads, but whatever you get I'm sure that you will leave Zoe's satisfied and with a bit of their contagious southern charm."}
{"text":"Soooo, I stopped in to Zoe's on a whim this afternoon. My ravished pregnant self was excited to see a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich on the the menu. One that also comes with chip and a side dish (I opted for the fruit salad.) for a reasonable $6.95. The limeade also looked yummy, so I got that, too. While I did have to drive about 20 minutes back to my office, I still believe that this meal would have stunk even if I sat down and ate it on the spot. The bread was burnt, the cheese was American - blech! (even though I see now, I get a choice of cheese instead of all the cheese listed, I wasn't asked.), and the fruit salad was all green apples. Excuse me, one piece of pineapple. The only thing that saves this place from one star is the limeade. And even that could have been less sweet. Skip this place. It isn't healthier for you, it's not local and it under delivered. :("}
{"text":"Need of the hour. Healthy options with good chicken kababs. Loved their padiena , salad bowls and kababs."}
{"text":"Waitress was not very nice, even slightly rude.  Food presentation was awful, no seasoning and tasteless and portion sizes were just ok.  Falafel was dry and tasted several days old.   Never again."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten at Zoe's Kitchen has been great!!  My favorite is the quinoa salad with either grilled chicken or shrimp kabobs.  I also love their chicken soup."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but tonight I am very disappointed. I got the Mediterranean Chicken plate, and after a long day at work, I couldn't wait to get home to eat it. I began to unwrap the foil that they wrap the chicken in (to help keep it warm), which is nice, however when I opened the foil, all I had was 2 tiny pieces of chicken smaller than the pita bread they serve with the dish. I have eaten this same dish, from this location numerous times over the past couple years and have never had a problem. It is a delicious dish, but tonight it was not worth the money I paid for it. I hope this hasn't happened to others here, because it's very disappointing when you order food out, that you think someone checks at the restaurant to make sure everything is correct, including ingredients, sides and portions, and you get something that should've been half the price of what you paid. I guess I'll have to check my food before I leave there now, because whomever was working tonight did not do a good job.

Side note, we also ordered a side of hummus, which we didn't get any pita bread with..."}
{"text":"This is an ultra simple, fresh and healthy, locally owned sandwich experience. If that's all you expect, you will be pleased. I agree that eating so responsibly isn't as much fun."}
{"text":"The foods amazing here and you wouldn't think this was part of a growing chain of locations. Steak kabobs are delicious and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"Zoe's is good. Joanna W hit the nail on the head perfectly. I've had the Gruben and its really good as is the coleslaw (with feta in it).  I've been there 3 times so far, and each time I've gone there it was because it was close and it wasn't McDonald's (I love McDonald's don't get me wrong). 
While the food is good it is definitely not a destination spot for me. I wish they had some home baked chips instead of Lay's or Sun Chips.
Zoes is supposed to be healthy and I would say its not unhealthy, but I wouldn't call this health food. It would be great if it was healthy and earth friendly! Like stop using styrofoam. throw in a few cfl bulbs here and there, get rid of the Honda Elements and trade them for the Honda Insight. Imma just sayin'."}
{"text":"So many healthy options. I've never seen cauliflower rice in a restaurant and they did an amazing job.  We had the hummus trio, which was fabulous. The cauliflower rice bowl and the steak kabobs. If you are low carb or gluten free this is your place. Had a nice glass of wine and can't wait for patio weather. They have a nice patio with misters. My only negative was both the chicken and steak were very well done, hence a bit dry. The flavor of the meat was very good though.  Very clean and modern casual place. Nice addition to the west side!"}
{"text":"Awesome! We ordered a family meal with chicken and shrimp kabobs, roasted vegetables, grilled potatoes, a Greek salad, and hummus with pita chips. It was more than my family of four could eat. but really good. The veggies and potatoes were a little too oily, but other than that it was a great carry out meal. I ordered my meal online and it was ready exactly when I requested."}
{"text":"An absolute favorite destination of mine. I live in CA but work in Charlotte, and eat out at Zoe's multiple times each week. I'm a creature of habit, and am hooked on the salmon / steak combo kabobs. And don't forget to try the basil pesto hummus!  The food quality is awesome - hard to find healthy options that taste this good.  All ingredients are absolutely fresh (and my standards are high from my CA experience).  The menu is simple yet gives you ample choice. The place isn't fancy, just bright, light, and welcoming. 

The restaurant management is also truly impressive. You can see the attention put into keeping the place spotless. The staff all behave like owners - friendly, aware, and competent.   The staff turnover seems low. The dishes are consistent. All ages and ethnicities will feel at home in the casual and relaxing setting. These are all signs that someone running this show has a real passion for their business and their customers.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I love this place! they have the best cheese pimento spread ever , Tangy and good. There prices arnt the cheapest ,but the food is always top notch. I like the dÃ©cor too, you feel like it is a hip place to be and that they care about the materials they chose to build the place."}
{"text":"I recently had a Take-Out order that was incorrect from this location. Everyone knows how heartbreaking it is to get home after a long day, looking forward to chowing down a Greek Chicken Pita, and being sorely disappointed to find your order is not correct. 

HOWEVER, when I called Zoe's, rather frustrated, the employee I spoke to (I believe his name was Seth) offered to drop off the correct order off on his way home!

I was completely caught off guard. After such an offer I could no longer be upset. The night was saved!"}
{"text":"Look what I found! Potatoes... in a salad... that isn't a potato salad.

Zoe's is a lunch spot, a chow spot, a spot between meetings spot. It's a spot to fill your empty tummy spot, and you'll get your fill. 

I won't elaborate: I had the classic, the Greek salad, and it didn't disappoint. Here's the menu description: \"Tomato, cucumber, peppers, olives, onions, feta over potato salad\". That's what I ate, and I was super happy all of the goods were OVER the potato salad because the entree gained a kind of textural sophistication when the greens were gone and the carbs were waiting. It's a smart move, hiding the potatoes, it gives the meal some umph and it challenges the taste buds.

The establishment is clean, clean, clean. Come around lunch it can get hectic, so plan to come ahead. I loved the tea options, especially the non-sweetened stuff. 

I was also rather impressed by the vittles, the pita and hummus with olive oil. Good stuff. This place earns four honest stars as a lunch break beautician. Nice work, Zoe. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today with my mom. It was a great experience except for the price. I'm willing to come back and invite all my friends to check this place out."}
{"text":"Zoe's kitchen is always on point. I can always count on getting a decent healthy fast food meal here. Super fast, flavorful and convenient. I love the decor and the prices are reasonable. I always get the Chicken Kabob plate!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Nothing memorable. This was my first time. I tried the Harissa Hummus, Potato Salad, Slaw, Pasta Salad, Roasted Vegetables, and Lentil Soup.

Harissa Hummus: Good
Potato Salad: Vinegar based and not to my liking
Slaw: vingear-based and not much flavor besides the vinegar
Pasta Salad: Good, but did not seem recently made
Roasted Vegetables: not warm and underdone, much more so than typical stir-fry veggies
Lentil Soup: Good and flavorful

I future-ordered mine, so I arrived right when the order should be ready. Nothing was hot, or even warm. I thought at least Roasted Vegetables and Lentil Soup would be hot, but I guess it is just sitting somewhere as there wasn't even steam on the plastic lids for the food. I liked the humus and pasta. I wouldn't re-order the rest. It's not bad food, just kinda eh like a soup-can recipe that needs jazzing up."}
{"text":"This place Rocks! It was my first time visiting and its a new location so I had to rely on reviews from the Blakeney location.  So, I ordered the steak kabobs. It was so flavorful and it was served with grilled potatoes and roasted vegetables.  I also ordered the limeade drink.  Holy smokes.  The Limeade is like drinking a popsicle.  I loved everything about the food here.  And to know that it's healthy is the icing on the cake.   Not only was the food good, the customer service was beyond Excellent.  The manager, Shannon was awesome.  She was so accommodating and even gave my coworker a free sample of the limeade.   

I will most definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place. You pretty much get rewarded for everything you buy as soon as you upload the receipt. The food is great, its quick, the vibe is awesome- upbeat, colorful. 

It can get pretty busy but the wait is never too bad. 

I am obsessed with their toasted pimento sandwich, and their hummus. 
This is one of the few places I can go to with any of my friends for a quick bite- they make it really easy to be healthy, but they have enough options that everyone can find something. 

Its really inexpensive, too."}
{"text":"I was contacted today by Laurie via email,  she did apologize for a delay in her response.   I really do like Zoe's and plan on returning to my favorite location on  Mc Dowell & 7th Avenue. I do appreciate the follow up from Laurie and I do believe that the company strives for great customer service.  I'm looking forward to my next visit. 

.................

{"text":"I travel lots and try to keep expenses low, so I often frequent the Paneras, McCallister's and Jason's of the world.  Zoe's blows them all away.  Love at first bite!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Zoe's knowing it was a chain. Mediterranean food that would no doubt be watered down for the masses (as chains tend to do). But when my mom wanted to meet here for lunch I decided why not give it a stab?!
   I decided the best plan of attack was not to look at this place as a Mediterranean spot but as a salad/sandwich place in order to prevent disappointments based on authentic flavor comparison. I wasn't going to get a kabob anyways when I knew it wouldn't hold a candle in flavor to La Shish.
   So we ordered a baked feta appetizer and a ham and mozzarella panini-style flatbread sandwich to share. The sandwich came with a side and we opted for the Greek salad. Maybe there were a good deal of takeout orders but there was no one else in the actual line ordering food and yet it still took over 30 minutes to get the feta. I thought this was fast casual..most sit down restaurants don't even take that long for apps. The feta arrived rather awkwardly having about 5 little pita chips on one side of the plate. It was as if the other half had fallen off on the way to the table and they just figured no one would notice. However it happened, there weren't even close to enough chips to cheese and my mom will pile some stuff on a chip. We had to use the pita that came out with the sandwich (which wasn't too far behind) to eat the rest of the cheese. But I will say the feta was really good. The sandwich while not Mediterranean in flavor (but I wasn't expecting it to be) was also really flavorful. Ham, mozzarella, herbs with some sort of aioli (red pepper perhaps?) was a really nice flavor combination. The Greek salad was alright thought it really disappoints me when any restaurant uses powdery feta, especially one that claims to be Mediterranean, ESPECIALLY when I know they have a good feta that they use for the baked feta app. Come on guys! The Greek dressing on the table was also just alright. Kinda lacking flavor. To wrap the meal up my mom got a lemon cookie which she loved. 
   Overall the food was pretty good, although I will probably get something other than the Greek salad as a side next time. The service was forgettable, but that's not a big deal for fast casual other than the fact that the food took forever to come out. Probably wouldn't crave this place or go out of my way to come here but next time my mom suggests it I will be glad I meet her here."}
{"text":"Everything is ok but a new clerk always assumes what you are ordering unless you tell her otherwise, however she never takes advise patiently."}
{"text":"Okay ...Zoe's is constantly good!! There best thing to me is their salad! Taste so fresh every single time! 

I also love the pimento cheese of course coming from the guy who got kicked out of the Vermont cheese store for eating too many free samples! 

So I'll keep coming and the new flatbreads are good as well!"}
{"text":"Woo the food is amazing Mediterranean stile,
I test the lentils soup is ok
The manager \"Nick\" I think hi need learning customer service lessons.
The location is absolutely clean and warm 

Thanks to kitchen Lider and the kitchen stuff, grate job"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim this past weekend to get away from our normal Pita Jungle. Waited 20 minutes for my to-go order .. sadly when I got home my salad didn't even come with the chicken I paid for :( I'll stick with PJ"}
{"text":"I love the Greek salad! So yummy, very filling, and has potato salad on the bottom which is so good."}
{"text":"Unbelievablely delicious and we were blown away.  Visiting our son & wife to see Josie, our new granddaughter (2 weeks old) in Monroe.  My wife and I traveled from up north to see beautiful little Josie and help the new mom (truth be told Jane helping more than meself). The prepared meals Jane brought were devoured and it was Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.  What to do, what to prepare; and Josie demanding her feeding so dinner would be take out.
Our son said \"no brainer, we'll feast on goodies from Zoes' Kitchen; and fest we did!  We all got something different (with sides mind you) and I lucked out and order the Gruebeen.  
Out of this world, if near a Zoes' Kitchen do yourself, and your belly, a favor and order up Big Time.  Also fantastic napkins which are needed because this grub is finger licking good! Iggy Mo"}
{"text":"Food is good, not great. Healthy place to eat but not traditional Greek food. No gyros, basically only chicken and turkey pitas, and the roll-ups are made with tortillas. I was under the impression it was more traditional Greek food. I wouldn't recommend if you want real Greek food. Still a healthy, fast place to eat."}
{"text":"I love the steak roll ups with fresh fruit. Everyone is always so nice and place is always clean.  Wish there was one in the east valley!"}
{"text":"I love ZoÃ«s Kitchen but I just found the most disgusting surprise on this location, I am shocked they are even allowed to serve food in these plates. My soup plate was covered on a DIRT, yes DIRT CRUST. 
They should close the place until they get some clean plates to serve."}
{"text":"Where I love to get my grilled (pimento) cheese and tomato soup! Not to mention a killer quinoa salad! I also love that they have the \"chose your own adventure\" coke machine whenI can get an orange & grape Fanta zero or whatever else my hear desires. Also have great luck with takeout for a quiet night in! My only criticism is that their mobile app is lacking, but that is not the fault of the local operators."}
{"text":"Usually come here once or twice a week. Healthy options and still very tasty...will make you feel better about stuffing your face! Chicken kabobs are great, Comes w greek salad, pita, and rice for about $10! The turkey stack w potato salad is always my sandwich choice!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and the service is great! I love the Zoe's app... I'm eating a pita sandwich half off. Yum"}
{"text":"So delicious! The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the employees are super helpful. I got the Mediterranean Piadina and potato salad, those with me got a shrimp kabob meal, kids chicken meal, and a chicken kabob meal. We all loved the fresh flavor and were pleased by the portion size."}
{"text":"I came home expecting a nice meal after work, but instead found A BUG IN MY FOOD. Makes me think no one washes the lettuce. Absolutely no excuse for this. Also, sweet tea was WAY too sweet. Tasted like someone poured five entire bags of sugar in it. I will no longer eat at ZoÃ«s ever again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last week. Place is easy to find and actually pretty big on the inside. Staff is nice and I like how they have a outdoor eating area. I've always wanted to try this place and it was alright. I like the soda machine how it is up to date with a lot of options. The menu is pretty small but not too big. I got a salad with fruit and I thought the fruit was on the side, but it was in the salad. Overall I didn't like the salad but ate it since my mom paid for it. I don't eat bread or pasta so there was not a lot of choices for me at all which was disspointing. Probably won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I can always count on Zoe's! The salmon kabobs are so fresh and amazing. The staff is always friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Hooray we are so excited to have Zoes open in this location. Just went today the first open day and as always, food was fresh and amazing. Love Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Nice seating areas outside as well as inside. Food was delicious. Love their kabobs and giant chocolate chip cookies are the best!
Restaurant was clean and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's! The food is great and the service is very friendly. The protein plate never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Ordered Salad & Hummus plate with Chicken.  Salad was good.  Chicken was not included in takeout."}
{"text":"I first gave this place a try since it is so close to where I work.  It seemed like a nice little place to try out, especially for lunch.  The atmosphere is nice with a colorful interior.  It also has outside seating, which is great during warm weather.

Although I'm very pleased with the style of the place, I am not a big fan of the food.  I have tried this place a few times and the different things I have gotten are not something I would try again.  I have heard from a few friends that this place is really good.  I believe everyone should still try it out though in case there was a certain pa-zazz that I'm missing from this place."}
{"text":"For approximately 5 months... I've decided to go with healthier food choices when cooking at home and when i do go out I don't like eating heavy unless it's a special occasion or cheat food night where we allow ourselves an unhealthy meal or dessert.
With Zoe's I feel I'm eating healthy and tasty food when eating out. After eating at Zoe's, I don't feel awful like I just inhaled a fatty meal.  i love the Greek salad and the hummus..yum it's one of my favorites. overall I will be back and might try something different next time. I do wish they had another location that was closer to me? that would be great."}
{"text":"What a great  experience we  had  eating  here!  We  were group of  7 people  found it reasonably  priced   The lady serving  us  was  extremely sweet and  served us very well lifting our  spirits,  rarity  these  days."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful! The environment is very welcoming and the service is incredible! Matt was such a helpful employee, making sure to answer all of my questions patiently and with a kind attitude! Food was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Zoe's kitchen usually but today was by far the worst experience. We ordered two salmon kabobs and only one came out, instead of jumping the gun we wait and the other meal never comes. I graciously ask the server about my order and give it again with the sides 10 mins goes by and nothing. Finally, my bf has finished his meal so he request that we just take it to go. We go over the meal and sides again and they hand us the food and apologize by this time I'm starved!!!! I get home and realize it's the wrong order!!!! WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS FOOLISHNESS?! You guys had one JOB!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast Mediterranean food this is a spot for you.  Orders are placed at the counter. The menu is very clear what items are vegan / gluten free.  Someone brings your food to your table;  you're responsible for retrieving your own napkins,  silverware,  and drinks.  

I ordered the shrimp kabobs, which came with a side greek salad and seasoned rice.  The food arrived quickly, they forgot my rice, but that was remedied within a minute.  The food itself was good,  hot and nicely presented.  It wasn't life changing,  but definitely yummy. 

The restaurant itself was clean,  everyone working there was friendly,  and the prices were decent ($10.99 for my meal). If someone invited me to return I would, I just don't think I'd venture here on my own accord."}
{"text":"Zoe's is great and consistent.  Got it to go the other day, same great chicken salad sandwich.  And I sent my daughter in (since she thinks she's so cool when she can do things like that) and they were very sweet to her and she was happy.  I like a staff that's nice to kids!"}
{"text":"I love Zoes Kitchen. I food is fresh and delectable, full of flavor, bright fresh colors and decent portion sizes. My job orders catering from Zoes on a semi-regular basis and I enjoy their food tremendously."}
{"text":"Today, I order the Veggie Kabob entree. The kabob had grilled peppers, onions, tomatoes, portobello mushrooms and zucchini, all very tasty. It came with two kabobs, I wish there was a third. I substituted the white beans for grilled potato salad, which is like mashed potatoes and ABSOLUTELY LIP SMACKING, FINGER LICKING DELICIOUS! I also substituted the greek salad (since I brought a salad from home) with the Basil Pesto Hummus since the entree also comes with pita bread. OH MY GOD!!! YUMMY.. I LOVE BASIL.. I LOVE PESTO.. and I think hummus is pretty great too... but COMBINED??!!?!  HEAVENLY! 

I can't wait to try the tomato bisque soup!"}
{"text":"I liked my steak kabobs that I ordered. They were prepared nicely and tasted great. I like the greek salad and the house made dressing.  Also, I had braised white beans that have a flavorful seasoning.  I like that the food is prepared fresh and has a great taste.  Also, the atmosphere at Zoes Kitchen is pleasant, uplifiting, relaxing comfortable and the booth area is cozy."}
{"text":"This place serves good fresh food!  The service is walk up to order style but the menu is very selectable so you can order just what you want.  The Gruban is my favorite sandwich but I just had some great lentil soup.  

We are so glad they came over to the west side."}
{"text":"We ate there twice, the first time was the day after initial opening and the second was with friends a few days later. The food was very good both times and the staff was friendly. The second time an order mistake was made and they did a great job in correcting the problem. I can recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"It was ok. I have experienced better places that have the same food. I felt pressured to get certain items, being that it was my first time. What's weird is that they have kebobs but no gyros. Probably would not go back especially with Culinary Dropout and Olive and Ivy right nearby."}
{"text":"Lousy service

So I ordered for a group lunch and they do not deliver unless you have 24 hours notice - however someone else in same office had it delivered and placed order less than 1 hour prior. The only reason I ordered from them was because the coworker had done so and had it delivered. Other places deliver. But they already had my credit card. 

Was told by manager that they use an outside service and they have to give them 25 hours notice.  Well I am sitting across from someone that did not need that. Whatever. 

I go to pick up the items and drive across town to do so. I get there and pick up and go back to office. I get there only to find that they have failed to provide the soup for one of the orders. 

I called to have price corrected. 
Then as I sit there - one other order was a salad with chicken on it and special instruction to remove pasta - no-chicken left the pasta on.  I didn't even bother to call at this point.

I go to our Charlotte office pretty regularly we are a large company in the area. But we will not be ordering from here. 

As far as food is concerned is wasn't bad food. The chicken pita fell apart but was tasty - the salads were good 

The service was lousy"}
{"text":"Zoe's is special for not fearing the Americanized taste bud. I don't mean the food is super exotic... I mean that they don't serve deceitful food just because it's popular.

Many a \"healthy\" restaurant is so scared of people complaining about taste that they hide absurd quantities of sugar, fat, and salt in their dishes, just to avoid losing clients that probably shouldn't be there anyway. The rest of us end up with an entree that appears greener and more nutritious, but is actually just brimming with the same problem ingredients as the pasta everyone secretly wanted.

Not at Zoe's. Sure, not every dish is \"healthy\", but the menu is pleasantly accommodating to any diet. They replaced every one of the original sides that came with my kebabs in exchange for a heap of veggies without hesitation. You can pretty much build your own dish, and for people avoiding gluten, dairy, obesity, this, that, and the other... that's pretty cool. 

The meat is cooked simply, nothing is drowned in sauce, and they don't skimp on the greenery. Plus, calories and nutrition facts are all available if you're feeling neurotic. Kudos to Zoe's, because even if my veggies would have tasted better soaked in cheese, my stomach thanks you."}
{"text":"Love Zoe's Kitchen... everything is always fresh and so tasty. I am addicted to their chicken salad as well as hummus. I will say they are pricey.. I sometimes have to debate what to order because of the cost. I like the interior and its a good spot to sit, relax and chat a bit. Its also a great location with Target, Marshalls and Trader Joes in walking distance."}
{"text":"First time at the SP location (I usually go midtown),  placed a to-go order for the greek salad and hummus plate and picked up a small container of chicken salad. Chicken salad was delish as usual, felt the salad portion on the to-go was smaller than it would have been if I had eaten in and the pita bread didn't taste as fresh as usual. The hummus itself was super delish.. I had a huge craving for it and this cured it!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Zoe's Kitchen a lot, but out of the times I have been, the food, service, and atmosphere has been great!

I am a BIG creature of habit and when I find one item I'm a fan of, I will order it over and over again. With that being said, The Tossed Greek Salad is my favorite item to order there. From the grilled chicken, to the carmelized onions, the feta cheese, the pasta, olives, cucumbers, the pita bread and you can't forget the infamous Zoe's dressing, it makes for a great salad! I have also had Zoe's steak and chicken roll-ups, steak and chicken kabobs, fruit and the hummus and they all were amazing!

I highly recommend this Zoe's (all Zoe's for that matter) to any and everyone who wants some yummy food served with a side of great service."}
{"text":"The quinoa salad was delicious but my husband's chicken kabobs were dry and not flavorful. Our son liked his chicken fingers and Greek salad!"}
{"text":"I had put off trying this place with all the crazy feta's but was wonderfully surprised. I really like the fresh food. Now the staff at this one location is another matter. One girl at the register as I am waiting in line just cleaves. so I stand there for about 5 minutes until another lady helps me. What is with that. Where did she go.? She helped the person in front of me and then just leaves me hanging? Makes one wonder."}
{"text":"My husband kept telling me about this great place with healthy food where he would eat when I am not around to cook for him.  Today, he took me there.  
We parked in the notorious Met parking deck, and, after shopping at Marshall's and Best Buy, we strolled over to Zoe's.  The first thing that I noticed was a lovely outdoor dining patio.  The inside features cheery colors and three large pieces of art with words pertaining to Charlotte attractions.
We both ordered the vegetable kabobs.  My husband requested a side of humus instead of Greek salad.  My meal came with the Greek salad plus these incredibly yummy braised white beans.  I wonder what they put in those.  I hate to admit it , but they are a little tastier than the ones I make.  The kabobs needed a little salt, but were delicious as well.  A generous portion with too much food for this little lady to eat in one sitting.
We took our food back home to enjoy on our own sunny patio.  Had we dined in, we may have had a wine or beer.  Nice that they offer those drink options.
I put Zoe's number in my phone.  Good to have just in case that I am too busy to cook us a healthy meal."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  The only reason for the 4 stars is my recent experiences with takeout.  The food has never been ready when it says it will be ready, which negates the convenience of takeout.  Two previous times I placed an order online and walked in right when it said it would be ready and had to wait another 5-10 minutes!!  That negates the benefit of takeout.  Today I placed my order online at 12:00 and it said it would be ready at 12:15.  Knowing it's not always ready right on time I went in at 12:25 and it still wasn't ready.  The employee had to make it while I waited.  I've always only ordered the turkey pita (which is served cold) with a side fruit salad.  So there's nothing to be cooked at all!  I probably won't order takeout again because I expect the food to be ready when they say it will be ready."}
{"text":"I'm back home in New York and am still thinking about the delicious Greek salad with grilled chicken I ate for lunch while visiting my daughter in Phoenix.  For a quick bite, this place left quite an impression.  I had to ask the server how they prepared the chicken; it's the marinade!  Everyone loved their lunch and informed me they have dined here numerous times always leaving happy :) Fresh food and tasty dressing. Help is friendly and wonderful.  Great experience."}
{"text":"We recently went to Yelp's Ultimate pleY Date! and received a couple coupons to Zoe's. I'm really glad we did! I tried this place when it first opened but haven't returned because I am not particularly a fan of Greek food. So I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. =)

Perry was behind the counter when we went in and she was so friendly and helpful! She helped with some recommendations. I ended up getting a grilled chicken pasta and my boyfriend got the chicken kabobs. Both were very tasty."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Zoes and I enjoyed it! They definitely get 4 stars for the category they fall under (quick bites, cafes, affordable eats, etc).  They have a good variety and everything seemed to be relatively fresh!

I tried the chicken roll-up and I really really liked it.  The chicken was tender, had good flavor and it was the perfect lunch portion.  The hummus was also very good and fresh.  The pita bread was not anything special but I can let that slide.


The service was friendly and fast, the price was right.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Good, clean food. The menu is pretty large so even if this isn't your style, anyone can find something good here. I forgot the technical, menu name but I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich with a fruit cup for the side. The food was pretty good and filling but it's something that can be made at home. The fruit is very fresh. 

Check it out, see what the hype is about. Go on a pay day if you're on a budget- they are kinda pricey for the portions."}
{"text":"After craving a Greek Salad, I decided to hit up Zoe's Kitchen, since I hadn't been in over a year. I arrived around 12 on Sunday and although the line was long it moved smoothly. As most of my reviews/check ins reflect, I love pizza, so I decided today to try the chicken pita pizza with a side Greek salad. The pizza was ok, but unfortunately the sauce reminded me of jarred pizza sauce. And, something I don't think they did years ago, they delivered the salad undressed. I questioned the server and there are bottles on the table of the dresser. Ugh, not chilled, not fresh, just blah. I wish it was served with your order, allowing you to know it us fresh and not touched/drizzled all over. Overall, decent, but not sure it would be somewhere I would return on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Place really reminds me of a Noodles and Company. Not a big fan but I can understand why some  enjoy this food. Overall, just left the place feeling a bit bland, unoriginal, and blah.

The hummus had a liquid consistency and pita was dry. Just not my thing."}
{"text":"11am not busy. Had steak stack sandwich and potato salad.
The sandwich thinly sliced steak, sliced portobello, mozzarella, caramelized onions, feta spread, tomato, rosemary oil on sour dough. It tasted great. The potato salad was different but tasted great. It had no mayo but instead i think they used olive oil and vinegar and i really liked it. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"This hurts because I was initially a huge fan when this location first opened.  Service is great, but the food quality and portion sizing is going steadily downhill. Plus the chicken kabobs are always cold as if they've been sitting out for too long.  I will return as a customer when they get their act together."}
{"text":"Excellent healthy Mediterranean food!  I'm a fan!  My favorite is chicken kabobs with red pepper hummus instead of rice"}
{"text":"So happy they have a location in Old Town now! When my co workers and I try to figure out where to go to lunch, we ALWAYS consider Zoe's.  They are super efficient and the food is really consistent.

I had the steak sandwich last time and talked about it for the next two hours. Would also recommend the chicken roll ups. I've only ever gotten the pasta salad as a side but I'm sure the other sides are delicious too!

I was surprised to learn that it was a chain but don't let that scare you off!"}
{"text":"Worst experience..  They didn't have any food items I ordered..  They obviously don't communicate with there manager very well about it.  No steak no mushrooms..  Waited forever would never go back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is so healthy (at least appears to be) and the menu has so much to it! I have the chicken kabob and it was unreal! The actual kabob came with such yummy stuff on it and then the rice and salad underneath were both amazing as well! Good price for what you get and seems super healthy and quick! The food came out within minutes! The costumer service was also great! Super friendly and helpful with decision! Bring one to San Francisco please!"}
{"text":"Today for lunch a group of us went to Zoe's kitchen it was slammed. We understand why though! The food is awesome and the staff was amazing! Very attentive and Jeff took care of our needs!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location in Charlotte, NC. The food is always fresh and the staff are always pleasant. I've tried other Zoe's, but this by far is my go to spot. It's definitely out of my way, however anytime I'm over this way, I make a stop here."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken rollups to go.  As I took several bites of the roll up, I discovered a chewy substance to the chicken.   It was chicken skin!  Fried chicken skin is delicious, but grilled chewy skin....ewww.  I did call the place to inform them of the bad quality and Alycia said she was sorry and they had new cooks in the kitchen.   I won;t be returning to this joint.  Disappointing food and service."}
{"text":"Wow talk about great customer service! So after posting my original review the management of this location reached out to ask me to give them another try. The very first thing I noticed was a note on the side door letting everyone know it was heavy. I left a comment about this in my original review and the note made me feel like they were really listening! My order was not only completely correct, but came out super fast! I hope this new experience keeps up on my next visit, but I know they care about their customers after this trip."}
{"text":"If you're adult taste buds are looking for a fresh light feeling menu this is your place.  The food is delicious and nicely portioned.  I don't feel like I've over eaten, but full when I come here.  They have a nice patio area which is great for the weather right now (March-April) .  And the staff is friendly.  Airy atmosphere and the food comes out quickly but flavorful."}
{"text":"It's a healthy, simple and unique menu.  Food is fresh and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Can't believe there is a health food restaurant in Arizona.  Was very good.  Happy we went."}
{"text":"The quinoa salad is ok .the kabobs their put too much sauce and salt omg. If you try to control the salt . You need tell them  before their cook"}
{"text":"I do like Zoe's Kitchen but, it can be a hit or miss with basic seasoning. On the usual, the food is great, I love getting the salmon kebabs entree and then braised white beans are my absolute fav side here. I think the salmon kebabs are way more heartier than the chicken kebabs. We actually order a pint of the beans to take home and eat as a soup, very creamy and flavored with rosemary. Salads are always fresh. The chocolate cake is usually very dense, almost brownie like. They are very understanding when it comes out to replacing the listed side with a side of your choice. 

Parking is pretty crazy around here around lunch time, I'd suggest calling in and ordering so you can pick up and just get out. I docked a star because I think its overpriced for what you get. I'd rather go to Jasmine's Grill for prices and authenticity. But, Zoe's is very convenient and right next to TJ's so I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!! I can't get enough of Zoe's. 
The food here is DIVINE. Completely SUPREME. I love it. My faves:
-steak roll ups
-chicken roll ups
-the slaw
-rice pilaf
-hummus
-they have bomb iced tea.

Plus, you can order and pay for your food online, so if you want to pick it up you literally walk in, are handed your food, and walk out. So easy.

The people who work here are rad too."}
{"text":"So I was out running some errands yesterday and happened to be at the Best Buy next door... Zoe's sign caught my eye and in I went. 

The establishment itself is very... hmmm nice hues... empty... I guess it felt sterile to me -- but in a good way. I arrived around 2:43  and there were about seven or eight people chomping down. 

For being so empty, I was surprised how uninterested the staff seemed to be. Nothing more do I hate when the cashier/order taker speaks to a co-worker about other crap when you're trying to place  you're order... o'well I guess they were just bored. 

I ordered the half and half combo - Chicken salad sandwich and a greek salad with a glass of chardonnay. 

The sandwich was absolutely YUMMY. I love that the chicken salad was dry -- I can't stand mayonnaise--so when it's used sparingly I smile. I prefer Greek yogurt over mayo... that's how I roll when I make tuna or chicken salad sammy's... The bread was fresh and the tomato delish. 

The Greek salad was perfect as well -- crisp fresh romaine lettuce, sweet cherry tomato's, English cucumbers, tasty feta but HOLY GREEK GODDESS -- what's up with the chopped red onions? The guy at the counter should have asked me:

\"Mam, would you like sum salad with y'er CHOPPED red onions?!\"

Jeez... I breathed onion breath for at least 3-4 hours... I didn't feel so bad though, the woman at the DMV was rude and she deserved my onion breath! HA take that - karma can be a bitch! 

I would have loved the salad 100% if they shaved the onions or at least soaked the onions to kill some of that onion stank we love. Oh and their salad dressing which is conveniently placed in the center of each table was really nice and light as well. I also loved that they had salt and pepper grinder's at each table- nice touch. 

So should you find yourself at Zoe's, dig the chick sammy and try the salads, but ask for y'er onions on the side please! And bring a mint."}
{"text":"I love the salmon kabobs! It comes with a Greek salad, hummus, a few pita bread wedges & cucumber raita. Healthy & tasty is the best combination!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the Steelecreek area and I love  Zoe's Kitchen, but today was by far my worst experience ever. My co-worker and I, stood at the counter unnoticed for at least 3 minutes. 3 different ppl walked back and forth behind the counter and even ppl in the kitchen could see us waiting. Once we were finally greeted, the cashier acted as if we were taking too long to order. She snatched my card and shoved it back at me. Once we got our food, I was missing my pasta salad that I ordered and my co-workers food was over cooked. I asked the young lady could I get the pasta salad I ordered previously and she said it's not on my receipt. But I asked her twice during the time we were ordering if she heard me and she said yes. My co-worker was so aggravated with the service he ate what little bit of his food was actually edible and I shared mine. So not only did I have to share my food, I did not get all my food. I had to share my food, because it was going to take too much time and we would be late for work. He enjoyed \"MY\" food, but said he would never pay for the horrible customer service we received."}
{"text":"Terrible service...first we waited 35 minutes over lunch on a Saturday when it wasn't busy at all. Then a woman came to ask us what we ordered. Then I asked for a refund so we could just go somewhere else, but they lied and said it was sitting there prepared, and I said \"well how do you know if you don't know what I order is...\" then they said it would only take a minute ... but after waiting another 5 minutes while they were trying and failing to look up our order...I finally said \"ok seriously we are leaving, can we please get a refund?\"  And finally another guy ran into the kitchen and this time actually made our food..."}
{"text":"Zoe's is one of our usual go to quick dinners but this location has definitely gone down hill. They always seem short staffed so quick dinner is definitely not what you get, the quality of food is not up to par and as of lately always seem to be out of something, if not a few items.  Very disappointing.  I'm not sure what has changed besides the menu but this location needs to step up. One problem with chain restaurants is that when they have a good thing going they switch it up and go down hill, it's definitely a shame.

I also sent this review to corporate."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's! But don't try to go here in the middle of lunch hour. By 12:30 all the tables inside and out are filled and there's a line out the door.

But should you be one of those lucky ones who can go to lunch at 11:30 then it's a perfect place for lunch. The food is good, reasonably priced and fresh. There is low calorie fare as well as some items that have a little more than you would like but who cares it's your day off counting calories anyway.

The Steak roll-ups and chicken roll-ups are my favorite but having just tried the kabobs I think that's about to change.

One thing to remember is that if you have a smart phone, join the club, take a picture of every receipt you have from a meal there and they will e-mail you a coupon for something. Usually it's a soda or chips or a side salad, but the other day it was for 1 free entree . . . and that steak kabob was mine."}
{"text":"Food is fine...service has been bad both times I've been here recently. Food took forever once (which defeats the purpose of fast casual) and they forgot one of our meals the most recent time until I went and reminded them. They didn't seem to care much."}
{"text":"I went here once to check it out. Unfortunately, I probably won't be going back. I'm all for healthy food and would like more options when it comes to area restaurants but for me, Zoe's didn't cut it. Looking over the menu I decided upon the chicken pita. The food came quick enough, I think there was only one other patron in the place at the time. Anyways, the chicken was bland and flavorless. Hello, taste? Where are you? The pita bread was just as bad, it fell apart within moments. The only saving grace was the caramelized onions. A nice touch although not enough to save this meal. The pita came with a side of your choice (I opted for the pasta salad, pretty disappointing) and a bag of potato chips. Whatever. I thought this was supposed to be healthy eating? The decor reminded me of a fast food place in Europe: very colorful and bright. Perhaps one day in the future I may try Zoe's again, but for now two stars seems more than appropriate."}
{"text":"Consistently good!!  I've never had a bad meal here.  The service is fast and friendly.  The meals are 'Instagram-worthy' and taste just as good as they look.  Their rewards program is fun and actually worth participating in.  Highly recommend for anyone looking for a delicious, but guilt-free lunch."}
{"text":"This is a great quick service Greek restaurant for eating in or taking to go. Good healthy options & quality food. I go here for the chicken or steak kabobs regularly with a side of grilled vegetables. It always tastes good, and makes eating healthy pretty enjoyable. This gets 4 stars out of a possible 4 stars for the type of restaurant they are. I am a regular here, and will continue to be."}
{"text":"So after a quick trip to Best Buy, we finally made it to Zoes for lunch today.  It was a-ok.  Didn't exactly knock my proverbial socks off, but it was good nevertheless.  It was nice to have a speedy healthy (or at the least, healthy-ER) option amongst the many fast food places in the area.  

The atmosphere was nice & bubbly with bright colors everywhere and even childrens artwork on the walls along the booths.  I like the way the tables & booths are arranged in Zoes; provides a feeling of intimacy while still being open and airy.  That's rare (and welcomed) in an establishment like this.

Service was friendly and quick.  The guy at the register somehow ran my order & gave me a receipt but didn't actually run my card - then had to track me down at our table & re-do it.  Things like that make me uncomfortable (so I'll be watching my bank acct online), but overall not a huge deal.  

I went with the Lean Turkey Pita and grilled veggies as my side.  Gotta say it was yummy.  The pita had slaw in it, but it wasn't your typical \"mayo\" based slaw - was more \"light & airy\" and also had either feta or blue cheese crumbles in it.  The grilled veggies were good, too, but a tad heavy on the mushrooms (broccoli, red onion, carrots, and mushrooms).  Portion size of the veggies was kind of small, but for a reasonable lunch it wasn't bad.  Might be too small for dinner, though - but then again if you're doing the whole portion control thing, it's ok.

Partner had the Club Pita w/grilled veg.  That was tasty & came with a bit more \"stuff\" than my samich did (grilled chick, ham, cheese, lett, tomato).  I had a bite of his and thought the chicken was well seasoned. He also tried out their Hibiscus tea; thought that was quite nice (but note, it isn't sweetened, so you may need whip out the Splenda!). 

We paid about $20 for those two plates, the tea and a chocolate milk (for me).  While there are better values to be had, it's about average for Midtown and the type of food since there aren't that many \"good food fast\" style eateries around.  We would certainly go back when in the area, but not necessarily make a beeline.   Although I do wanna go back so I can try their shrimp kabobs - those just sound too yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy,yummy,yummy i got love in my tummy and i feel like loving you ! Everytime i go here that's what i walk in singing the food is so fresh and yummy. The chicken rolls are absolutley delicious and i had the greek salad with it as well.I have tried numerous selections from their menu and i have yet to have one complaint. My daughter loves the potatoe salad which is also killer, has a very distinctive taste! I'm a sucker for the lemon cookie i can't step foot in this place and not get one ! Something like you've never tasted before my mouth is watering right now talking about it.When im in a mode and don't feel like cooking i have ordered the family pack which i believe was right at $30 it is soo much food enough to feed 5 to 6 people if not more and it was a chance for me to explore other things they offered like the kabobs and such.If you are in the area check  them out next time i stop in i have to try this limeaide drink i hear is great as well!"}
{"text":"Love ZoÃ«'s! The limeade is great and I love the grilled shrimp entree. Although it can't be categorized as \"authentic\" Greek cuisine, each time I've come to ZoÃ«'s, my food has been seasoned well and the shrimp is always beautifully cooked (I HATE over cooked shrimp). Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick meal to bring home this weekend.  The food that I brought home was not good at all.  Everything appeared/tasted old and not as it is shown online.  The ham and cheese piadina for my child was just plain bread with a slice of ham thrown in with a piece of american cheese."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and usually it's pretty good. However I think it's a little pricey for what you get.

Unfortunately, this last time I went may be the last time I ever go because it was horrible. Everything about it was bad. I got one of the new bowls with salmon and my wife got the shrimp kabobs. It cost us $30 which if I'm going to pay that I'd rather go to a restaraunt where someone will actually refill my drink. 

It took about 25 minutes of waiting before I walked up to the counter and asked what the hold up was. My wife's food was sitting under the heating lamps and mine was yet to be started. I carried her food back to the table so she could start eating and the shrimp were so dry they were crunchy. Also the white beans were bland and we remember them being so flavorful before. Finally after another 5 minutes or so my salmon bowl showed up and it literally looked like a kids portion, nothing like the pictures. The flavor was pretty good but my salmon was very dry and I was still hungry afterwards.

Overall this was definitely not worth $30 and spending that much I'd rather go somewhere else where I can get good food and good service. I'm not sure I will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We love Zoe's! But, our latest experience is worth posting. On May 7, we called in a pickup order to this location (which we've done regularly for years). We had to call multiple times because no one answered the phone; it just rang and rang. Finally, we were able to place the order. When we arrived to pick up, the restaurant didn't appear to be all that busy. We walked right up to the counter and stood for a bit before anyone greeted us. After giving my name, she couldn't find our order sitting on the takeout shelf until I leaned over the counter and pointed to it. She didn't bother to check the order so I took boxes out one by one to ensure it was accurate. Sauce for the rollups was missing. Once home, we were sorry to taste the lentil soup which was a clump of lentils, too thick and gross looking for me to eat. We were just terribly disappointed as we've often had great experiences. It seemed so bad that we are concerned there's new (poor) management in place."}
{"text":"So I rarely eat here but am here waiting for my car to be serviced and wanted to grab a bite. I ordered the chicken kabob and it was a bit dry and salty. It wasn't that entirely bad just salty. I thought Zoe Kitchen was a health alternative place, they sure used a lot of salt. I know how kabobs are supposed to be prepared, no bones and grilled. Mine wasn't grilled, I think it was probably baked in the oven with rosemary seasoning and it had a bone in it. Would have preferred grilled. Their orzo chicken soup is pretty good."}
{"text":"I love how fresh the food is...I wish I didn't check the nutritional count, the sodium content for most of the menu items freaked me out. I guess that's what happens when you eat at chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Zoe's is always a staple in our home! Always fresh and a meal you can count to be not just healthy but tasty! When in a time crunch, Zoe's is the place to grab lunch or easy dinner."}
{"text":"a while back i went to a zoes kitchen as i did every Saturday eve after i work out at the planet fitness next door to it to have my greek salad  which i love but this one time i found a lady bug walking around in my salad and when i brought it to their attention they though it was hilarious and said i would not be charged for the extra meat!
well if that is what zoe's thinks about their customers so be it! i have not been back since not even an apology from them!
i think the cook deliberately put the bug in my salad because he thought i was a spic!
thanks bauba you saved me $500 a year to zoes kitchen!"}
{"text":"Do not be in any kind of a hurry!  Waited 20 mins just to get a Turkey Pita to go. And its not the staff.  My order was taken as quickly as it could have been with only 2 people taking orders. And the kitchen was going 90 miles an hour.  But understaffed.  Clearly the management either doesn't pay any attention or doesn't care.  The turkey pita was OK.  The wrap was stone cold as if it had just come out of the freezer.  And it was dry.  Turkey was OK.  If you are looking for a quick and satisfying meal try 6100 CafÃ© right next door."}
{"text":"I'm SOOOOO excited that they opened a Zoes closer to my job in Ballantyne!! I head to this shopping center often so it was perfect!! I ordered online for pickup and arrived in the store going straight to the pickup counter for my order. Everything went smoothly.... until I get to my car and do not see my side of Steamed Vegetables. So I went back in and they fixed me up a new batch. When I sat down at work to eat my lunch I found that they put my side of steamed veggies underneath my kabob. Why would they do that when I ordered that as an additional side? What if I was giving that to someone else or wanted to eat it later? How would that look with me walking around with a piece of foil with broccoli in it? Other than that, the food was as delicious as usual. I suggest the Kabobs, any of them!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant kept popping up in my feed. Very popular by my fellow yelpers so I finally decided to give it a try. I'll just go ahead and add this to the top of my list of healthy restaurants to visit near my job!!! I loved this place! I ordered the Steak Kabob with Greek Side Salad and Vegetables and the Salmon Kabob with Greek Side Salad and Vegetables. I substituted the carbs since i'm on a diet. I ordered both to eat one for lunch and one for dinner. Thats how excited I was to try this place. Best decision I made that day! The Salmon was a bit Charred which I LOVED! Seasoned perfectly with onions. But the steak was the star. I'm not sure what sauce they use to marinade the steak but it was so good I poured the excess over my vegetables. The greek salad was nice and fresh. I wasn't that impressed with the dressing. It was a bit bland for me. But with a pinch of salt it shined! I can't wait to return to try the rollups and the shrimp kabob which seems to have really good reviews. After my favorite healthy alternative in Ballantyne recently closed, i'm so happy I found this Zoe's!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come here for a salad after a great work out. I ordered an $8 vegetarian greek salad. Now, when I order an $8 salad of any kind, I expect it to be hefty. Especially when it is vegetarian. A salad of that price needs to have lots of feta, cucs, peppers, olives, onions, etc etc. 

This salad was mostly lettuce. It had many diced onions, about 4 olives, 3 cucs, 3 halved cherry tomatoes, 1 (count em, ONE) green pepper slice, and some feta. It was served with a side of oil. WHAT?! I paid eight dollars for this sad excuse for a salad. 

I was a bit pleasantly surprised to find some potato salad under the bed of lettuce, but how is that even part of a greek salad? So confused.

I won't be back to this or any other Zoe's Kitchen anytime soon..."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I got the chicken kabobs and loved the flavor of the chicken and the veggies. The salad was great with their house dressing and I really enjoyed the rice as well. Tasted great and was food I felt good eating. Prices are reasonable also. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Zoe's Kitchen just opened up near my house and I had heard good things about it from friends who have gotten it in other locations so I decided to give it a try for lunch. 

I got the chicken kabob entree. It comes with a Greek side salad and rice - they let you substitute the sides so rather than get the rice I got the roasted vegetables. All off the food was delicious. This is a great alternative to greasy fast food. But it's still fast when you just want something quick. 

I used the order online option. It said pick-up at 2:10. I got there right around then and my order wasn't up yet. I ended up having to wait about 5 minutes. It wasn't a big deal but it just seemed like a long time to make my order considering I ordered it a little before 2. It may have been a lunch rush or maybe growing pains of being a new location.

The staff seemed friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love Zoe's. After moving out of central Phoenix I often wished there was a location near my new place.  I am thrilled that the Arrowhead location is now open. Try the chicken kabobs !!!"}
{"text":"One of my joys in life is being able to eat out and not feel guilty about what I am eating. I get super excited when I find a place that can cater to my wants and makes me feel good about eating healthy. 

I am huge fan of Zoe's menu too. Online it shows you what is vegan, gluten free, and/or vegetarian. If you count calories, they have a menu for items under 500 calories too. I don't count calories but this could be important to some people. But my absolute favorite function of their online menu is the nutritional portal where you can view an allergy menu where you can select the allergens you want to avoid and it will produce a list of menu items. This was absolutely everything to me. 

Anyways onto the food! We follow a mostly paleo diet so I no longer dine on their hummus (which is pretty tasty) and I stick to certain menu items. The kabobs are my go to - shrimp, salmon or the sirloin steak. The steak has a glaze on it so if you are looking to keep your meal paleo, you just omit the glaze. The seasoning on the salmon is one of my favorites. It is their house blend. I have found that my favorite paleo sides are the roasted vegetables and grilled potatoes. The salmon and shrimp kabobs come with other sides but I have started to replace with potatoes and veggies and it is never a problem. 

The staff here is always friendly, the location is always clean."}

{"text":"Went here for lunch. Ordered the chicken kabobs, side of hummus, and a limeade. The order came out quickly, the food was good, and the place was clean and neat considering the amount of traffic going through there. Staff wasn't overly friendly but they were helpful and efficient. I would go back if I were in town again."}
{"text":"First let me say if this review was for the food only I would give it 3 stars.  The hummus and white bean side were both yummy, quinoa salad was spot on and the beef rollups were really good as well.  The only dud was the tuna pita which didn't seem very fresh.  Tuna was slightly strange tasting and the wheat pita was extremely hard.  My overall experience though was horrible! I used the online ordering feature to place my to-go order.  The app itself is great and gives you lots of options to customize your food.  It went downhill from there.  I placed the order at 12:45 and was given a 1:10 pick up time.  I arrived shortly after 1:10 and was told they were bagging my order. After waiting for 10 minutes they then informed me that they hadn't received the order which they later retracted and said the order wasn't ready.  After harassing and hounding the counter staff I had my order at 1:40!  The girl behind the counter (Emily - per my receipt) was extremely apologetic and refunded my money as well as gave me a coupon for a free entrÃ©e.  There were 3 people in the kitchen with only 1 that appeared to be cooking. The other individual behind the counter who may have been the manager did nothing to help the situation. There were a lot of people waiting at the register and even more people waiting for food in the restaurant.  Clearly short staffed and bad management.  Be forewarned if you go here you will need more patience than I have."}
{"text":"Always get hummus  (trio) comes with cucumber, pita! So delicious and fresh. The chicken sandwich is the perfect lunch. Very fast service always. Never any close parking but not the fault . Casual place for lunch."}
{"text":"I can get food faster at a sit down restaurant. And the staff is rude about how snail slow they are. Save your time, avoid this place."}
{"text":"I was excited when they first placed this location over in this area, but the fact that I eat here quite often just confirms that I'm a fat kid for Mediterranean food. 

If I'm just in need of a snack then my go to is ALWAYS going to be the Chicken Salad sandwich and a side of rice. If I'm super hungry or not planning to go out for the rest of the night then I will pick up an entree of Chicken or Salmon Kabobs. I'm allergic to black olives so they're always happy to accommodate my order with a double order of rice and yogurt dressing. 

This is a wonderful location and pretty convenient on the way home!"}
{"text":"Talk about eating clean! There's no room for grease on this plate. I ordered the salmon kabob. The entire plate was good. I do like my salmon cooked a little softer (I'm sure I could've requested that) but the veges and side salad made up for the dryness in salmon. 

I could eat this a few times a week. The food is flavorful and good size portions. My daughter ordered kids chicken rolls with the fruit cup. She's normally picky but finished her plate. 

Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I came here for a quick bite during lunch hour today.

I ordered a Steak Kabob with a fresh lemonade. The Kabob was super juicy and they are very generous on the meat portion. I could barely finished one of them. The Greek salad was just ok and a bit blend. I didn't care for it. Nevertheless, it was definitely a great lunch. Service was excellent. Cashier and staffs were super friendly. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Parking: awful, be prepared to search and walk.  Shopping center with Trader Joes and 6+ other stores.  3 spaces allowed for take-out orders
Service: good
Food: great, fresh and hot
Price: $10-$15
Seating: very limited and close to others, no privacy
Noise level: loud, not a place to unwind from the office
 
Great place, just wish they would have built in a better location."}
{"text":"Zoe's is a really good lunch spot. I personally love their spinach roll ups with chicken, but you really can't go wrong here. Most of the options are pretty healthy and their house dressing is really good. If you're looking for a cheap or quick lunch, this isn't the place to go as its about $15/person and the place is usually pretty busy."}
{"text":"I am now hooked on eating here a few times a week! Their chicken pita sandwich#1 is amazing with grilled chicken and feta slaw. I seem to be gravitating to that sandwich and the kabob with rice. I love that the food is fresh and reliable. This is such a great alternative to fast food. I just wish they were open later than 8pm."}
{"text":"Chicken kabobs were cold and whoever packed my plate forgot the Greek dressing & hummus. The service was meh. Limeade was yummy (only reason for 2 stars)  but how hard can that be to mess up? Guess I'll be heading to one of the other Charlotte locations for my Zoe's fix from now on. There should be a better experience offered for their price point on food."}
