{"text":"I went there with a bunch of people (about 20) and we had a blast, the service was good, and the music was good as well. 

it wasnt that busy, and their food was not the best- but Id still give it 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"Sorry folks! It's no longer there. It's now just a big hole in the ground for future condos! But try Shater Abbas south of where Shiraz used to be. It's in Thornhill and it's very good. It's on the left if you're going south, south of 407."}
{"text":"It food is not bad, but not worth the money . But Customer service for sure is terrible they can even answer the phone and handle the booking. They sound very board and bothersome withe your call."}
{"text":"Service was poor and food was alright and a little overpriced. Entertainment was quite nice.

Service may have been poor due to inadequate organization by management, but some members were particularly rude to customers. Not the first time we've experienced this."}
{"text":"This place is awful! The service is mediocre, the entertainment is cheesy, and the food is horrible. We ordered three plates of kabob and it took about an hour for our food to come. The rice tasted bad and the meat was cold. Both the appetizers and the main dishes were not prepared properly and had no taste. To make things worse we were billed $100.72 for three people! The restaurant owners have the nerve to charge an 18% gratuity for atrocious food and service.

Shiraz also has some novelties. If you ever go there check the vegetarian menu, they have a number of fish kabob dishes. Apparently the management doesn't know the definition of the word vegetarian. 

Overall Shiraz has bad service, poorly prepared food, a highly overpriced menu, and bland entertainment. I would never recommend this place to anyone. 
I've had better experiences with street food."}
{"text":"I really don't recommend this place. The food is not good, service is bad. The entertainment is so cheesy. Not gooooodd"}
{"text":"GREAT place... Awesome authentic food.. Perfect music... Great staff
I was really happy with the service. I was really amazed with other people giving less stars!! Maybe the manager is changed now or else..
I had kabob barg and it was perfect.. My husband had qeyme and it was delicious... I loved the more senior guests taking precedence and starting out dancing so the younger ones (who are usually more preservative specially if persian ;)) could feel more comfortable joining ... 

It definitely deserves more crowd"}
