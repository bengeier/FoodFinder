{"text":"When we got there, it was dead.  When we left, the place was rammed.  Conclusion:  Everybody in Toronto is trying to be just like us.  Stop thirteen on my Epic Birthday Bender of 2009 came when Emily H., Megan J., Jeremy T. and I figured a trek up Ossington was in order following our attendance at the closing night of The Theatre Centre's Debbie Does Dallas (a musical, believe it or not).  None of us had even heard of TODO before, and were knocked back a few generations when we entered around 9.  I don't think we're in 2009 anymore...  The bar looks like a couple of Ossington hipsters got together, rented some space, painted, tiled the floors and hit up their grandmothers for furniture.  Given the rate at which this locale has blasted onto the Toronto nightclub scene, I wouldn't be surprised if this was actually the case.  Good on em' - the place looks pretty cool to me.  My group grabbed a table at the very front of the bar and enjoyed an hour's worth of people-watching as partiers trickled in and the bar filled up.  Jeremy was pleased to see that they sell a wheat beer, and I recall having a difficult decision on my hands between many quality beers (I don't remember what they were, unfortunately).  A nice stop on a Saturday crawl."}
{"text":"First insanely cold night of the year. We head to Libretto late hoping to avoid the massive onslaught of hipsters on the pseudo-holiday Monday after Christmas. No such luck.  30min wait for a table for 3 and a cozy spot with plenty of seating available spotted just two doors south. Sold.  Todo lounge is outfitted with a funky vintage 50's-60's furniture mashup and a blue and gold blown glass lamp I wanted to steal. There's a communal piano that a patron walked in a immediately started playing charlie brown christmas on. We ordered a round of hot toddies without specifying anything and put our faith in the barkeep.  What we received was a reddish looking piping hot concoction of whiskey, tea, bitters, lemon and honey. It went down smooth and was a refreshing change to the sweet boozey drinks you find at most bars. At $5 each they were a bargain."}
{"text":"With a parade of eclectic retro action figures on display, vintage mugs as candle holders, a quirky little half moon shaped nook furnished with a cushy lazy boy that faces a TV set propped atop an old piano, all set in a cozily dim room, TODO no doubt looks like a place I would love to love. We beelined the length of the room gleefully to a high top table furnished with a silly looking office chair that had an extended base and a stool, but that is about the time we realized that it was all too good to be true.  The large chalkboard that we had expected to see a long list of tasty offerings on said plainly: panino $7. Fine, it also listed the ingredients of said panino, but that was it. When we inquired with the lone cheerful bartender/server about a menu, he chuckled sheepishly and admitted that the \"fusion resto-bar\" thing was a bit of a lie. We found that quite strange, but decided to stay for a beer anyhow. However, before I could spring myself off of the aforementioned office chair, I was told that the other chalkboard listing drafts was also misleading. \"We haven't gotten some deliveries for weeks now...\", he explained. There were actually only two choices on draft.  The two pints of Creemore we decided on came served in randomly selected glassware and were enjoyed while musing over the fun decor in the atmospheric candlelight before heading down the street for a late, but actual dinner.   I wouldn't hesitate to come back to TODO for a drink or five, but I will never come here hungry again!"}
