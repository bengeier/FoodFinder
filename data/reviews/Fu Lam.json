{"text":"Lunch buffet. Everything is pork. No chicken.  Poor selection. For the same price, should have just gone to Buffet Vichy"}
{"text":"Avec le temps de moins en moins de choix et le goüt se détériore et la dernière fois il y a deux semaines , certains plats était froid. En plus le prix a considérablement augmenté."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit two Fu Lam Buffet restaurants during Victoria Day long weekend. The foods were good, like the traditional buffet, nothing exceptional. I mainly enjoyed the grill section, crabs and dessert.   For any \"all you can eat\" lover like me, I will recommend the place. The customer service was good."}
{"text":"I gave five stars because I feel a lot of other yelpers have been unfair with this place and want to help boost their rating. It is what it is. It's better than the buffet down the street. It's always got a good selection and full platters of reasonable quality food and it's cheap. A good value for the money. I have trouble seeing how they manage to carve out a profit at this place honestly."}
{"text":"Although the ambience is good but the food was Very disappointing! Horrible food, disgustingly dirty plates and cutlery! Would never recommend it! Paid $27 per person for s**t."}
{"text":"Ate there a while ago, before they closed down, renovated the place and then reopened under the same name. They did and apparently still do have a nice menu selection and seem to have expanded it to include sushi and BBQ.  They also used to take leftovers from the noon buffet and then reheat them to be served in the evening buffet. Not cool. A friend of mine ate there once and found a piece of glass in her food. I'm sure it doesn't happen all the time but whoever broke a glass should have thrown out the food instead of risking someone's health. That's what happens when you cut corners. I hope things have changed for the better.  The food tastes okay, not great, but okay. Not sure if or when I'll ever go back there, but I suggest avoiding the place (or at least the evening buffet) unless the owners can prove they've cleaned up their act."}
{"text":"Chinese buffet for $15 all you can stomach! I walked in hungry and had a quick look around. Several dishes looked very appetizing... But when I sat down to eat my selection I realized that there was a lot of grease in the sauces. I verified with the waiter that there is msg in almost everything :/ fu Lam scores less than average for atmosphere, plenty of dining area but it feels a bit like a run down sports bar dining room. My stomach fooled me on this one. But if you go for the Canadian Chinese food in general you can get a lot of variety here and fill yourself up for really cheap."}
{"text":"It's my first time here,the place is clean and chic for a buffet restaurant...I came here cause I got the coupon 2 for 27$.The service is ok,but the food is not really good...not a lot of choice...and too much MSG!"}
{"text":"J'y suis aller avec mon frère un jeudi soir! C'était tranquille et tout était vraiment frais et délicieux à l'exception des sushis!! Le serveur était extra!!"}
{"text":"You can find a few Fu Lam buffets in this province. We arrived at this one on opening dinner hour, on a Friday afternoon.  The good: Food was just out and fresh. Lots and lots of sushi choices. Everything was hot. Service at table was nice and our plates were picked up on a regular basis. Restaurant was quite empty though, but it was quiet.  The bad: Music choice was a hip radio station, felt odd eating food with Beastie Boys playing in the background. Soft drinks came in cans and not glasses (I hate those). Deserts tasted like \"fridge\", which means they were made in advance and been in the fridge for a while (cakes excluded). Pizza is super dry! Ceiling was dripping at the entrance, so you had a bucket surrounded by three chairs with a sign \"Do not sit down\" on them.  If you get there at opening hours, you will have lots of choices, with everything fresh, in an empty and quiet restaurant. But avoid the deserts and the bucket at the entrance."}
{"text":"Called and made a reservation for Mother's Day, was met at the front by an older women who was in a bad mood. She told us that it wasn't there and then shoved a ticket at us to wait in line! She didn't even apologize and then expected us to wait an hour for their mistake. We were good customers but will never return to this place again! They need to fix their attitudes and learn how to provide good customer service!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for at this restaurant. It is run down and not very clean. I think the dry beef cube in the dark sauce dish it's from the left over roast beef. The only thing worth eating here are the fried chickens wings and salmon sashimi. Everything else is not good. Wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Crab is now only on the weekend, and the price has gone up. Otherwise the buffet is still ok with many choices. Like any buffet, the food is at its best when there is a high turn over.  Some things are too good to last."}
{"text":"Je dois dire que c etait le moment de vérité a savoir on le met dans la liste de on y retourne ou on le banni a jamais.   Et bien j avoue que j ai été surpris c était bon chaud mais la variété parcontre reste a améliorer pour cette raison je garde la note de 3 étoiles"}
