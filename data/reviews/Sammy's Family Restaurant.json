{"text":"The food is exactly what you pay for, so no complaints. The service is outstanding. Perfect for someone who wants to go out but is on a budget. I'm a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Excellent little diner, and just what we were looking for. Grilled chicken was nicely done,  and so were the ribs. Excellent service."}
{"text":"a perfect old school diner in Scarborough! The service was kind and fast. The food tasted delicious and filling. The atmosphere feels like your dining in the 80s! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Went here this morning for breakfast and was not impressed. The sausages tasted like cardboard, the eggs were coated in butter, the server was totally clueless and pretty much ignored us. Add to all that the ham was paper thin and the home fries were coated in large pieces of onion it was not worth the money. Oh and my mother got raw buttered bread instead of toast with her meal. 

I have been to many breakfast places before and this was by far the worst and we will never go back here again. I would rather go to Mcdonalds over Sammy's for breakfast. You know a place is bad when you have to wonder if the server actually remembers you are there. She literally walked right past us to give someone else coffee and did not bother to notice that our cups were empty before she put the coffee back and walked away. 

Horrible service."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. Smoked salmon egg benedict was excellent! Portions were big. Service was great, came by often to refill coffee."}
{"text":"Great service & food is egcellent.  I ordered the eggs florentine and was very happy with the quality."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusted, I will never return!

My wife and I sat at the counter for breakfast last week.  At one point an older guy who was bussing and refilling ice came out with two ice buckets. His right thumb was COVERED in blood. So much it was dripping on the floor.  I said \"Hey bud, your hand is bleeding!\"  He shrugged his shoulders motioned towards the kitchen and went back to filling ice.  He left a huge smear of blood on the bottom of an ice bucket and then stacked it INSIDE the first one!  

At this point blood was on the floor, in the ice, in the ice buckets, and on everything he touched and NO ONE CARED!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this little mama pops joint since forever... The old owner is back and it's better than ever. My cousin and I love this place, if you are in the Scarborough area then this is a must eat breakfast, brunch place! My fav is a thing with hollandaise sauce! Currently the salmon eggs Benedict! If your are super hung over and need a cure, skip McDonalds and grab a Harvest Breakfast here, it works like a charm! We usually go for brunch on Saturdays, but if you dare go on a Sunday time appropriately as it gets packed once Mass is out, there a few Churches around the area. Oh and the price... it's the best deal in town! If you are going there for anything other than breakfast I can't help there... All I've ever ordered there was breakfast, sorry."}
{"text":"Sammy's was an unexpected treat!  We were looking for a cozy place to have breakfast, and Sammy's filled the bill.  This is definitely a local place, in the quintessential small fishing village on Lake Erie.  As far as we could tell, we were the only out-of-towners.  Everyone else seemed to be local.

Okay - on to the food.  This is typical family-run diner fare.  Breakfast is all we saw.  Everything looked to be made from scratch, and the portions were huge if you are into that sort of thing.  My wife and I shared a skillet scramble which had the usual eggs and sliced veggies.  She is vegetarian, so we ordered it without sausage and I got a side order.   One meal fed us both with room to spare.  The people at the next table got the blueberry pancakes, and they looked fantastic.  Others were getting omelets which also looked very good.

Service was great from local people, and they had plenty of specials.  As we were leaving they put up the lunch specials on the board.  Among the interesting items was a lake fish sandwich with fresh fish (yumm).

This is definitely the place to go if you are looking for a relaxed, very good meal.  If you are looking for something fancy, or Masonite tables give you the willies, then you might want to go somewhere else.  Frankly I will take good food over fau-fancy furnishings and Cisco meals anytime."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This must be the best kept secret in the area.  The food, the service and the prices are all amazing. Our waitress was attentive, funny and took great care of us.  My daughter ordered the waffle and she brought out the can of whipped cream, knowing the my kid LOVEs whipped cream. My dad has ordered the deal parmesan, and mentioned that it was tougher than he liked. She took it back with a smile and replaced it with the chicken with a smile.
The breakfasts are huge, the meals all come with great salads, and it was all so yummy!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area so we decided to go here for breakfast. It doesn't look nice inside or outside, but it's not horrible.

The food is very reasonably priced and is alright for what it is. I'm not sure if I'd go back though, I'd much rather pay more and go somewhere better.."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a trip while in the area. I agree with all others, place is really great. Freshly made food, generous portions and friendly service. Too bad it's over 2 hours from my house or we would be regulars here. But when in the area we'll definitely return here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food  and  friendly prompt service  in the city.  The breakfast is delicious  and filling  The dinners are the same Burgers club sandwich are  the best.I have become a regular since moving in across the  road and there is nothing  that I have had that had been disappointing."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast and the food, service and quality are top notch! The prices are also good!"}
{"text":"Weekends are great. Awesome staff cheap food. Fills you up. Nice and home like.

During the week it's a bit slower but not bad. 

Solid 4/5

Bathrooms are nice"}
{"text":"Very nice place to get brunch if youre in the area. The venue itself was nice and clean, even if the exterior says otherwise. Reasonabley price breakfast foods; we ordered the eggs benedict and sunrise harvest, and with a coffee it amounted to $25, with very generous portions. The breakfast itself was very good. Sausage and bacon a tad salty but very satisfying. The eggs benny were nice and fluffy, but the pancakes were the best in my opinion. They arent dry and bland like normal, they were fluffy and sweet on its own. Reccomend going, and I will be back for brunch there!"}
{"text":"This was my first choice for breakfast fare for years on the east side AND then I ate there for lunch on a day off - and BOOM - now it's just a go to for good home cooked food and friendly service. 

I do still choose breakfast for the Sammy's Slam - two eggs, potatoes, bacon/sausage and pancakes/French toast - but now that's BC instead of leftovers the kiddos eat right off my plate and I don't notice lol.  The gyro skillet and the Irish skillet are delicious and beyond flavorful.  My hubby loves the steak and eggs too - it's really his go to. 

Great deals for daily Monday thru Friday lunch and dinner specials - dinners come with salad AND soup plus a veg and starch (with rolls and pudding) starting at $8.99! 

Lunch is a cheeseburger with mushrooms or hot peppers for me and their fresh cut fries rival any fair.  Dinner I generally go meatloaf or chicken BC the specials are too good but many can they make a mean chef salad too! 

Everyone is nice and friendly - always see someone we know - and the coffee is the best string hot bold coffee I've had since Europe. 

Two downsides and only location issues not anything that can be changed - parking - packed in the mornings and right on the road; bathrooms are super small. Again nothing they can really do but just a heads up - also the sloped entry walkway is a B in the winter/ice!"}
{"text":"$27 got us a Sammy's Slam, which was two eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 slices of bacon, and homefries for my hubby. I got an Irish Skillet, which was corned beef, who tries, and two eggs, as well as an ala cart side of polish sausage with onions and green peppers.

The food was all standard diner food. Not bad, but not stellar. We consider ourselves foodies and said we would come back again if weren't in the mood to drive since this place is in our backyard. Service was friendly too. And the place was empty on this Sunday afternoon - everyone was at the beach, haha.

Only real negative was cleanliness. Had to snag a new set of silverware off another table. And the mirror behind our table had sticky, little kid handprints smeared on it."}
{"text":"Perfect old school family restaurant. Their breakfasts are on point. Lunch specials every day. Very busy, food always fresh, wait staff is really nice and hard working. Everyone moves very fast, never had gaps in service. Wish more of these places were still around."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way home from the lake on Father's day. We live about 90 minutes away but, this was still our 2nd visit. Casual family feel. They don't mind if the kids are messy from a lake day. Decent food at decent prices in a small Diner. I would and probably will go back again."}
{"text":"First time going, the restaurant was very busy, very friendly staff.  Food was cooked fast and tasted good. Would for sure go back."}
{"text":"Our family has been going there for years. It's a comfy, familiar atmosphere where you go to get a good homecooked meal. And it won't break the bank. 

The service is always great. Even more so if you get Maria for your server because she's such a sweetheart and really takes care of her customers. 

Today I got the Tex mex skillet and blueberry pancakes. I forgot to ask to have the hashbrowns well done, so they were slightly mushy. But I was too hungry to send it back. It was tasty and so were the pancakes. My hubby got the shrimp basket. No frills, just tasty hot fried shrimp and fixings. 

So, yeah, anywhere that I can get breakfast all day long is golden in my book."}
{"text":"It's a classic greasy spoon type diner that has been dying out of this city. One only issue I have is that the chef keeps ruining my over easy eggs."}
{"text":"Came here for a Thanksgiving breakfast and was not disappointed. The staff was very friendly and attentive. As the restaurant name suggests, it's a family restaurant so you get a very warm and welcoming mood as you walk in and decor that makes you feel at home. 

The food was great too! A little pricey given my choice to add peameal bacon and fruits, but it was well worth it. It was Thanksgiving after all, so why not splurge a bit? The pancakes were very light and fluffy. I love how they give you kiwis as well, a nice change from the usual combinations you get in a fruit cup. 

Generous portions, great tasting food, and a genuinely welcoming atmosphere - what is there not to like about this place? Oh, and you're supporting a local business too! Would definitely go again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good and service is very friendly and the atmosphere has a homey feel to it but the only problem I saw like slightly dirty floors and the first set of silverware I received was dirty with some food on it and that bothers me strongly. But overall was a good time and a good eat."}
{"text":"Great tasting eggs and home fries. Generous portions leave you full and satisfied. Amazing value $. 
A friend of mine said great things about their salmon eggs Benedict. Served with 3 poached eggs!! Not 2, I said 3"}
{"text":"This past week, I went for Tuesday morning breakfast at Sammy's Family Restaurant, a true family-style restaurant in an old-fashioned Scarborough strip-plaza. (I like those old lights that hang outside each store showing 'restaurant' and 'barber shop'.) As expected, the inside is a little dated, but there are nice comfortable booths as well as tables, and pictures and plants for decoration.  There is also a TV (possibly more than one) that was showing CP24 news. The service was very pleasant, and quite fast considering there was a steady stream of people in and out, a lot of whom were probably regulars as the waitresses knew them by name.

The menu is pretty standard for breakfasts: eggs and meat plates, omelettes, pancakes and French toast. There is also a kids menu section, and a separate lunch menu that I didn't look at. I ordered the French toast, with fruit added, and some nice hot coffee. The three slices of toast were very good, and the strawberries / banana / kiwi were fresh and plentiful. Overall, a great filling meal for $14. Good food, good service, homey atmosphere, and certainly a solid recommendation."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here since I was a kid! It's the best little diner around Mentor on the lake.  The food, staff and atmosphere are great. The omelets and skillets are my favorite and I recommend this family restaurant to people all the time!"}
{"text":"On a road trip through Ohio, Sammy's made for a fantastic Saturday breakfast.  The bacon and egg on a bagel sandwich was perfectly executed, and refills of coffee were plentiful.  The potatoes were delicious, and very light in the oil department.  Beyond the excellent food and service, I would recommend Sammy's Family Restaurant for the people watching, especially if you, like me, are from elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Hubby is a breakfast person and my heaviest meal of the day is lunch; naturally, we are always on the look out for a good brunch place.

Sammy's has warm, welcoming and hard-working staff; they seemed genuinely happy to be working there. The food is diner quality, except for the flaming saganaki OPA! Lovely ambiance with the sociable patrons, comfortable booths and lovely decor (please see pics).

WE ORDERED:
- Liver and onions with bacon was pretty good; judging by the comments made by hubby, we will be coming back for this.
- Side Salad - lettuce was limp, not the freshest. I would recommend getting a different side.
- Saganaki - not only was this a yummy appetizer, the show was entertaining. Just make sure to let the staff know if you want to takes pictures or take a video beforehand; I forgot to tell our waitress, so by the time I whipped out my camera, the show was over. Oh well, live and learn."}
{"text":"This is an excellent little family diner. The building is old, but clean. The atmosphere is a bit old style, nothing fancy. The staff and service have been EXTRAORDINARY every time I've been here. The prices are very affordable. 

I've had breakfast here multiple times. The servings are large, the food is hot and my coffee cup has never gone empty! The food options are your basic diner choices for breakfast... just different combinations of eggs, meats, cheeses, potatoes, sausage gravy and pancake/waffle batter. If you're looking to be healthy, there's a couple options with mushrooms, peppers and onions and one with even broccoli! You will struggle if that's your goal though.

Their lunch/dinner menu is quite extensive. I've never had anything other than breakfast here and I'm not sure of the food quality outside of that. 

I would definitely recommend Sammy's for breakfast. You will most likely find it steady busy in the mornings. Walk in and find yourself a seat and you will be immediately greeted!"}
{"text":"Wonderful family restaurant with great food and friendly staff. The Greek food there is so good! And the hamburgers and sandwiches are awesome too."}
{"text":"Sammys is maybe \"off the beaten' path\" in Grand River but it is well worth the visit.
Very clean, well staffed and friendly waite staff, good food, big menu and big portions and a good price.
That describes a sucessful resturant and this is certainly it!"}
{"text":"This has been restored as my favourite place for prime rib special , eggs florentine for breakfast , spaghetti and meatballs and a smiling group of waitresses and friendly owners who greet you when they see you arrive"}
{"text":"Sammy's is an amazing place, with tasty homemade food and very nice people. A typical diner, with the good old treats you find on the road all over America. Delightful!"}
{"text":"What a great find! We wanted to avoid the crowds during Tall Ships and gave this place a try. I'm glad we did! They were extremely busy and had only two waitresses working on a Sunday night. Ever gracious under pressure, she took our order and she brought out our enormous plates of food. The portions here are generous to say the least - you will not go away hungry. The menu is vast - you will find something here to enjoy. My cabbage vegetable soup was home made and delicious. I have a feeling everything here is from scratch. Oh yes ... We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The food is great, large portions, and service always comes with a smile. I try to make it here at least once a month for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"I get a home-style family restaurant feel from Sammy's. The service is outstanding and the staff are very kind. Excellent place to get a casual meal. I've come twice and both times did not disappoint. The pricing is also excellent for what you get. Definitely come if you're looking for a nice, low-key, no-pretentiousness, delicious meal."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this cute place in a not-so-cute strip mall. Souvlaki dinner was huge and delicious! Traditional diner with cozy and updated interior, fair prices, big portions, good service - yum!"}
{"text":"Nice little comfort food restaurant. My friends and I ordered eggs florentine, chicken finger platter, cheese burger, and calamari with a side of fries and gravy. Our bill came up around $42. Large portions! Food is a little on the greasy side so be prepared for a food coma afterwards. Overall, great food for the price!

If you're ordering take out, they don't have an online menu and you have to rely on other reviewers' pictures of the menu. Their prices have changed a bit from the menus we've found online but nothing major. 

Would definitely like to go dine in next time and try a few of their other dishes :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Great food.  The value is outstanding.  Lots of food at a great price"}
{"text":"Read the awesome reviews and came here on a Sunday for brunch. Ordered eggs Benedict and my company ordered a Cesar salad with chicken. 
We waited over 30min for food. 
My home fries (each and every single one of them) were raw. And I only had two eggs on my plate vs three, what was stated in the menu.
The chicken on the salad was hard and rubbery, not even possible to chew. I assume it was previously cooked and overheated in the microwave; or maybe left on the grill atleast 2-3x longer than it should have been. 
We told the waitress right away. She apologized and said the manager was off and it was happening a lot (as in, a lot of people complained). She assured us that this would never happen with the manager here.
She offered to fix the food but confirmed it would take a while since the kitchen was really backed up. We decided we didn't want to wait any longer and ate the salad and and eggs...displeased we had no protein/sides. 
On our $27 bill; I had to ask for some kind of discount considering half our meal was inedible. the waitress came back with a $2 discount to make up for our raw/overlooked food. $2.00 is less than what the chicken and a side of home fries costed in their menu. 
Needless to say we won't be returning here and I would recommend  that if you want to check it out- call ahead and see if the manager is there. Otherwise expect to have my experience."}
