{"text":"Really good food. The burgers are awesome, and the fries are great. I always have the souvlaki on a bun, which they load up with toppings.   Honestly, you know what you're getting every time you go, and it's dependable. Great food, great milkshakes."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers.  The big one has onions and cheese mixed right into the patty... Delicious.  Friendly staff and everything cooked to order.  We've been a number of times and have never been disappointed.  50's diner style decor."}
{"text":"Visited on this hottest day of the year, based on other reviews here. It was a nice change of pace from other burger chains. Burger was very good, onion rings alright, fries not quite cooked enough and still a little sandy from the potato skins still on the fries. The floor was absolutely slippery, (hi temp and humidity or greasy, don't know). Very filling dinner for two big men ran us about 28 bucks."}
{"text":"Really awesome food, and the prices aren't bad either, very reasonable. I had the 6 oz. Rabble Burger with Fries. The portions were huge! The burger was amazing, lots of flavour, not dry, and there is a decent amount of toppings to choose from (their garlic mayo is amazing by the way, definitely try that out). The only thing I didn't like was instead of sliced cheese the cheese was grated, BUT that's not a big deal and it still tasted really good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of those diners that has been there so long, you forget it's there. What brought me here is cruise night. During the summer, people are invited to show off their vintage builds. Since I now know someone that participates in said cruise nights and they had good things to say, we decided to make an appearance.   It has 50's diner feel with the walls covered in classic celebrity photos, cars and albums. There's something to look at no matter where you sit, but it's not tacky. The staff and the menu seem like they're from another decade.   We were told the burgers and shakes are where it's at. We each ordered a handmade burger and poutine to share. This poutine could feed 3 people! It was massive. Fresh fries smothered in gravy with a mountain of cheese curds. That's right, no cheating with mozza! The burgers were juicy and the bun was so fresh, it soaked up all of the toppings. We made quick work of our meals.    The shakes. O-M-G the shakes! ANY flavour of ice cream and they make it a delicious shake. Thick and creamy, you gotta have one. It makes you feel like a kid again when you look through the glass at the childhood favourite flavours. MMMMMM! To top it off, it won't break the bank!   No excuses! Have a night out at Shake!"}
{"text":"Very good, Greek-style diner, HUGE portions.   Kids had the burger special with poutine, should have shared, but they both commented on the nice touches like chipotle mayo & poutine made with curds, not shredded cheese.  We had the pork souvlaki platter.  HUGE and very good.  Staff at the counter were very nice, happy to serve.    Stopped here at the end of a 4 hour car ride from Northern Ontario & washrooms are nice, decor very nice and interesting.  They also have a grassy area where our dog could do it's thing - a plus."}
{"text":"I went to Shake Rabble & Roll to grab takeout for lunch today, & wasn't sure what to expect.  I knew it was a 50's-style place, but that was about it.  I walked in & saw the requisite retro artifacts & decor.  The booths were cool-looking & the place had a definite 50's vibe going on.  The staff were friendly & prompt, & I ordered a Roll Burger Combo (no cheese or bacon), which came to $8.71 with taxes.  I was intrigued by this particular burger as it's made of sausage meat (6oz).  Yeah, I know, right?  Who's ever heard of a sausage burger?  Not a sausage split in half & served on a burger bun, but an actual patty made of sausage meat.  Their burgers are pressed very thin, which makes for a huge-looking patty with a shorter cooking time, but if you're not careful, can lead to dry burgers as well.  Good news though, my burger was cooked perfectly & had lots of juice left in it.  It was a very unique, very delicious burger that will have me coming back for sure.  The sausage flavour was unmistakable, but not overpowering or off-putting.  The fries were hot & very good, & the portion was a good size.  Not the best fries I've had at a burger joint, but well above passable.  It's too bad I had to grab my food & go, since it would've been nice to sit & take in all the cool 50's stuff, but it's no biggie since I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have not had a thing on the menu that we did not like. The burgers are excellent the poutine is enormous. Good souvlaki. They also have a good amount of ice cream flavours to choice from after you are done your meal."}
{"text":"Awesome!  By far the best burgers and fries in Whitby and Oshawa!  BIG portions, fresh cut fries, homemade onion rings.  Homemade 'Rabble' burgers are fresh, never frozen.  Fast, friendly service, great food and ice cream wrapped in a 50's style diner setting.  Best kept secret in Durham!"}
{"text":"This place is Boss. Fresh cut fries which are awesome, fresh variety of food - also awesome. An entire Ice Cream Bar. Awesome. Now frame the whole thing in the 60's with images of retro cars and roller girls and you have yourself a recipe for success.   The staff are always friendly and the food quality is great. Ive tried Burgers, fries, and souvlaki. My son absolutely loves the French fries, and he is an extremely picky eater. The Saturday afternoon/evening car shows are great to hang out at, go on a date, meet cool people, take pictures, or even have a 1960's diner experience just to feel what it may have been like.   This is definitely a cool place with decent prices and good food quality, and is totally worth checking out if you are in the area, especially on a Saturday Night."}
{"text":"OK, so first time we went here we chose not to come back. A year later, they've corrected their poor customer service - two lovely young ladies cooking and working the till. The food, if my son and I remember it was ok last time. This time, it was very good. We ordered a burger with cheese and bacon melted into the burger itself -- delicious -- and a pulled pork sandwich. \"That was one big delicious jumbo burger,\" says my son. I was skeptical when I saw them boil the bag of pork, but they then put it on the grill and fried it up a bit...well, it was good but adding sauce while frying and not during the actual cooking process results in dry meat slathered in sauce. They offer a variety of burgers. They are also quite popular as an ice cream stop too. Free parking. 1950s diner. Biggest competition is down the road and further up in Whitby...I think these guys will be alright and should find a loyal following. PS - the fries are fresh cut and uber yummy."}
{"text":"Burgers are ok at best but there are many better options in the area. Poutine was terrible. the fries just weren't good at all."}
{"text":"Pretty boring. It started off trying to be the new cool classic burger and ice cream place, but now its just for car buffs. There always seems to be a classic car rally/show going on.  The restaurant is cool looking but poorly designed for actually ordering and getting the food and condiment. The actual food is decent at best, not good for kids or picky eaters (like me) because some of their food have strange twists to them, like the cheeseburgers having some sort of mix of multiple cheeses. The desserts aren't anything to write home about. It's all a bit overpriced. It's the type of place that you go to once when it opens, then you try it again to give it another chance, and then you give up. That's exactly what I did.  The location is kind of weird. It's not somewhere I drive naturally, so I never really think of this place because it's so out of the way. It's right near the ghetto parts of Whitby, basically.  There are WAY better burger places, if you want an old school burger place, go to Starr Burger, it's 1000 times better!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten at Shake Rabble & Roll - the last time I ate there, it was under a different name. I didn't feel like going out for dinner, so I decided to order in from Shake Rabble & Roll through just-eat.ca.   Delivery charge is only $5 for any order and no minimum, which I like. I went with a club sandwich and added lettuce, tomato and garlic mayo to it and made a combo with a pop and fries. My order was to arrive at 7:15, but arrived about 15 minutes early! Bonus!! I didn't get to my food for about 15 minutes, but even when I did, it was still a good temperature and hadn't gone cold.  The club sandwich had a nice juicy, perfectly grilled chicken breast (nice brown color on the outside and maybe some flavoring, not sure), a few strips of real bacon, and my toppings on a soft kaiser. Wow. Flavor city. And such fresh ingredients. I wasn't expecting this type of quality, every individual aspect of the sandwich was as fresh as could be and they'd put just enough of everything on the sandwich. I'm not always a fan of chicken breast on a club but this one was oh so moist and delicious. One of the better club sandwiches I've had, I think, and I've had a lot! I can't get over it! Fries are great, nice and thick and I feel like I could be munching on them for the next few hours and they'll still taste as good at room temperature.  While it cost me about $20 all in including delivery, for a night when I didn't want to go out, I don't think I could have ordered anything better. I'm really looking forward to ordering from here again and trying something else! You can't go wrong with the club though!!"}
{"text":"Lunch with some good friends,,,  Atmosphere was fun and cute and felt like the 50's...kudos  Shake burger / Rabble burger / Canadian with Peameal   Frys were great and fresh potatoes - Gravy on Poutine wasn't maybe as PQ as it could have been but no arguments from the Westerner...   What did catch our eye - the Rabble Burger was with cheese and bacon - however the burger had no cheese or bacon on it - so I had to go ask even if it wasn't my meal - apparently the cheese and bacon are ground into meat very odd but ok,,, anyhow my buddy guaranteed not cheese or bacon or even flavour was to be had and this being the feature burger - seemed odd.. take note..  Burger meat was better than the typical fast food joint home made but oddly very thin and huge patties...  Ice cream looked good - but it was a big meal so no desert this time around.."}
{"text":"Elvis Presley?! James Dean?  Bright pink, silver, gold, orange and those vinyl cushioned benches...   Shake, Rabble & Roll...   Rabble Burger ($4.79) has this really strange patty.. It is big but thin... the thinnest burger patty I ever ate. It is grilled to extreme crispness.. and dryness. A crispy burger?!  Toppings are little boring just the usual tomato, lettuce, pickles... but they do have Pulled Pork Sauce.......  There is a good selections of Kawartha ice cream... I think I will probably enjoy the ice cream more than the burger!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place. I've come here for milkshakes and onion rings a couple of times. They have all kinds of interesting ice cream flavours like \"Birthday Cake.\" Those onion rings, though! They're so big and thick that they end up hardly giving you any because only a few will fit in the box.  The 50s decor is really cool... the booths are awesome, and they have a big Elvis cutout standing up against one of the windows. There are records on the walls, and sometimes you even see a classic car out front.  Coming here is always a rare treat, since I really don't live anywhere near Whitby. Even so, I think I'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"An old school diner. You know what you're getting as soon as you walk through the door.  Milkshakes are great, and burgers and hot dogs are satisfying."}
