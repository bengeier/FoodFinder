{"text":"Someone recommended us to go to this place for breakfast and brunch.

It's local not too far. The price is quite steep here, on par with eggspectations downtown?!?!

We ordered some eggs bacon sausage with french toast and fruits, and a eggs benedict plate.

Everything was average to poor quality, the fruits haven't fresh since last week and it's on my plate lol.

I did like the baked beans, that tasted good... my eggs benedict was not too good, it just lacks something... the hollandaise sauce was off, it was bland...

The coffee was lukewarm, The service though was impeccable, our waitor refilled our coffee 3 times and we were there for barely 30 min, to bad I only rate on food otherwise they would get one more star for service :)"}
{"text":"I have been there twice. The first time the meal took forever and they got the order wrong. The second time I waited for 15 minutes and no one even brought me a menu. The worst part is the place was practically empty. So I finally just got up and left. Never going back."}
{"text":"Service sympathique, familial, rapide. 
Pas de prétention, mais bonne ambiance chaleureuse. Et des prix tout à fait correct. 
Le contenu des assiettes est diversifié. Il peut être dense pour les grands appétit comme très fruité, suivant la préférence. 
Loin des restaurants concept, coco gallo est une valeur sûre."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is awful. Waited over 20 minutes just to get acknowledged at the table and get coffee. The order took over 30 minutes. But I still went back 6 months later figuring it was a one time error. But I'm sad to say that once I was assigned my table, no one came to take our order for over 20 minutes, while other tables around us were getting service. It was like we didn't exist. So we took off and that was sadly my last time there."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I have liked this place. The food is pretty good, the menu is varied, the portions are good, and the staff are usually chipper and friendly. HOWEVER, whoever manages the place NEEDS to figure out how to accommodate the weekend crowds. I don't know if that means hiring more staff or figuring out a better system (I'm no expert), but SOMETHING needs to be done. I can't tell you how often I've stood in an enormous lineup there staring at SEVERAL empty tables for AGES for no discernible reason. So I'm done. I'm going to find a more organized spot. The food here is worth the price but NOT worth the wait."}
{"text":"I heard that this place was supposedly a \"great\" brunch place, so i decided to check it out with a friend. My dish was average and the cocktail juice was overpriced. Nothing special about it. wouldnt go again"}
{"text":"C'etait bon! Pas extraordinaire, mais réussi. Premièrement, j'adore l'endroit car c'est très ensoleillé, il y a des fenêtres partout peu importe ou on est assis, petites tables grosses banquettes ou petites banquettes. C'est très conviviale, simple et les familles sont bienvenues. Pas de courant d'air glacé en hiver et l'air climatisé (léger) en été. Le menu est interessant et la nourriture est bonne, un peu cher des fois pour ce que c'est! Mes oeufs bénédictines étaient parfait: le muffin anglais croustillant, le bacon cuit a la perfection, l'oeuf coulant et la sauce assez épaisse pour qu'elle ne coule pas partout! Je prends toujours des déjeuners, mais y aussi des diners! Attention, malgré que ce soit grand, c'est plein la fin de semaine!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Generous. Fredh. One plate comes with main items, home fries,  fruit and coffee!"}
{"text":"Petit détour avec des amis en vacance. Nous sommes arrivés vers 13h30, le restaurant était vide et le service fut très agréable. C'était très bon et les assiettes étaient bien remplies."}
