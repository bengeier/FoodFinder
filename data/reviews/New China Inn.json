{"text":"I don't get what's up with the former low ratings, although they were older ratings, so maybe the ownership has changed since then? I don't know, but it makes me suspicious whether they are from real customers, or maybe competitors??? I've ordered from here many times in the past year, and found their lunches to be better than most other Chinese restaurants in the area, and I have tried many of them. Also, their portions are larger than most places. I usually get lunch specials only, and I've never been disappointed yet. Their Hot-n-Sour soup is far better (thick with lots of mushrooms & tofu) than most anywhere around here, and their egg rolls are rather large and very crispy. Like I said, I'm skeptical about the previous reviews, so take it for what its worth. Try one of their lunch specials with Hot & Sour soup and an Egg Roll, and then you tell me what you think."}
{"text":"Abyssmal. I stopped in here for a snack one day and ordered some dumplings. Though I sat down in the restaurant, they were served in a dismissing take-away bag. The dumplings were coated heavily in grease and the plastic container was filled with grease. Consider this restaurant's food for a guest that you want to leave."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm not kidding when I say that my food was actually disgusting. Everything I ordered was awful. The pad thai was bland and soggy. The crab rangoons had no flavor other than old fryer grease. The pork egg foo young was undercooked and had questionable dog food like meat. Even the two liter of soda was covered in stickiness. Gross. $25 worth of food directly into the trash. I'm disappointed and still hungry..."}
{"text":"I ordered this before I read all the reviews about it, which I guess was not something I should have done. The food was very greasy and I couldn't even eat the beef for how greasy and gnarly it looked. My rice was fine and the sauce and broccoli were good. But I will not order from them again. It was just not super good and had to throw half of  it away."}
{"text":"Food was nasty the crab ragoon were hard as hell and the rice was so dry and tasteless will never order from this place again have some pride in ur food will pass the word around if u want good Asian food go to w liberty ave"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! We ordered delivery online and our meals showed up 40 minutes late!  The delivery driver did not apologize or explain why our order was late.  To make things worse our food was completely cold.  The wontons and rangoons were hard as a rock and completely inedible.    We had to throw our food away it was that bad."}
{"text":"Ok Chinese. Quick delivery. Forgot rice and he returned 5 min later. Will order again."}
{"text":"Went there several times. But I have to say I really don't hate the food here... The food is really fast food and everything taste weird..."}
{"text":"Disgusting. No really. I love chinese and have never been so dissapointed. I ordered orange chicken and white rice. Chicken was rubbery and tasteless and a few hours later i couldnt stop vomiting and ive NEVER gotten sick from chinese style food before. Please find somewhere else."}
{"text":"After reading the previous reviews I'm a bit confused.  Maybe it's because I got delivery and didn't step foot in the door.  I actually enjoyed the food.  The \"smaller portion\" as their menu put it is the same size as other restaurants regular portions.  I got my old reliable General Tso's, nice portion of meat to rice and an egg came with the combo.  I even waited a day to write this to make sure that I wasn't going to feel all that bad.  I'll definitely go back here, especially for the price."}
{"text":"This place looks like your standard hole-in-the-wall Americanized Chinese food restaurant. The difference being that the food here is inedible. Vegetable dumplings taste like they are full of grass, homestyle tofu looked very old.   I get that they are trying to fill the niche of guilty pleasure, fast-n-dirty Chinese food (a-la Szechuan Express in Oakland), but there is no pleasure to be found here."}
{"text":"I've never actually been to the restaurant but I've ordered delivery from them several times. The food is very good, standard Chinese-American fare. The prices are reasonable, even inexpensive compared to other local places, and the people are always very nice."}
{"text":"Well I was quite pleasantly surprised by the quality of my meal at New China Inn. If you look at past reviews it's really a mixed bag but generally the older reviews are worse than the newer ones. Let's get general decor and ambiance out of the way first. This is mainly a take out delivery kind of joint so the space is purely utilitarian but clean. As a born and bred New Yorker it looks exactly like a  place like this is supposed to look; a couple of tables and a counter to order from with pictures of their 'greatest hits' (popular dishes) overhead. Just fine by me;  you don't come here on dare night! I was alone so I ordered one of my test dishes, house chow fun and it was great. No super hot wok char marks on noodles but very fresh as were all the ingredients. Try this place if you're in the neighborhood or want to order in or pick up. Worth giving them a chance and btw the guy at the counter asked me how the food was and seemed really interested in knowing.  I'll be back to try more dishes and update my review. I want to start comparing the Chinese take out places in Pittsburgh and this seems a good place to start."}
{"text":"I would rank this place closer to 1.5 stars.  I like their super large (and cheap) helping of crab ragoon, but not much else.  Everything else here has been pretty gross.  I had their duck once, and it was super old duck.  I'm sure it was cooked for at least 3 days and then stuck in the oven to heat up, so it was super dry, tough, and disgusting.  That pretty much sums everything up.  Every time I come here, I am disappointed.  Why I continue to visit is beyond me."}
{"text":"This is a solid neighborhood Chinese spot that will fill you up for 10 bucks. Stick with Chinese-American basics here and you can't really go wrong. The deep fried scallops were surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Literally amazing. The best general tsos tofu EVER. I love that they have great vegan options. Super quick as well."}
{"text":"Horrible rude service, lack of actual content, high price  This place is horrible!!! do not order from here. Hungry college student during finals, ordered the large Shrimp & Scallops dish. There was 4 scallops so thinly sliced I barely felt I was biting into anything and 4 small pieces of shrimp. The rest was completely overloaded with vegetables that weren't fresh, trying to make up for the lack of the actual ingredients.   on top of that the delivery guy was extremely rude telling me to\"c'mon\" and hurry up downstairs when he called. I called back to the store explaining the lack of the main ingredients and the guy was talking gibberish about something totally off topic, acting like he didn't know what I was saying.  You can get chinese food that actually has substance for a much cheaper price. Don't order from here, you'll be left feeling appalled and hungry."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst chinese food I've ever had. I had two orders, one being shrimp fried rice and the other general tso chicken with fried rice. The general tso chicken was soggy and the shrimp fried rice lacked flavor, no seasoning whatsoever. Additionally, I sat in store waited on food-- food was placed on counter and the waiter yelled food is ready and walked back to kitchen. Eliminating the possibility to ask for any soy sauce or additional condiments to accompany my order. Overall, poor experience."}
{"text":"Although my food was ok for the most part, the place is an eye sore, so just order and leave. Better yet, order from your car and pick it up when finished. smh. I was starving and had a long day so I settled for this place."}
{"text":"This is just a local Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood, so if you don't have a high expectation, you won't be disappointed. It closes late, so it is very convenient if you starve for Chinese food at a late hour; otherwise, go to other ones."}
{"text":"I'm amazed that a place that sells Chinese food doesn't know what chow mein is, despite having it on their menu!!! They gave me a bowl of vegetables drenched in watery sauce. I called to complain and the girl who looks about 10 years old who worked there informed me lo mein is noodles and chow mein is vegetables. NO! \"Mein\" means noodles!   I asked for a manager and she informed me he was out on a delivery. She refused to apologize or say anything, instead sitting silent on the phone.   The food was not very good. And the restaurant inside is DISGUSTING - so dirty!!! Between their stupidity and poor quality, I would never go there again.   By the way: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_mein"}
{"text":"I just got food here for the first time and the service was great. Staff was polite and friendly, my food took no longer than 10 minutes to be ready, and a cute little girl (I assume one of their daughters) gave me my order. I ordered orange chicken and vegetable fried rice. I'm dumb because I'm allergic to onion and forgot that's traditionally in vegetable fried rice :) but that's not their fault! They serve the chicken with some broccoli which was great. And after picking out the onions I enjoyed the rice too. I do believe this place is in need of more recent reviews, as all of the older reviews may be due to the establishment being under poor management. The restaurant itself is like any other restaurant on Centre, so if you think it looks old and small, consider the fact that literally ALL of the restaurants on Centre are like that! If you're looking for Grade A Asian cuisine, then don't go to a fast food Asian restaurant and expect top notch food. The stuff was good and made my belly happy. End of story."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery. Only Chinese place that offer wings & fries combo. Best french fries I've ever had except at fast food places.  Update: I don't know why I said the stuff above. Their food... sucks!"}
{"text":"Eh. I am not picky at all and I do not have high standards for American-Chinese food establishments, but this place isn't really that great. I ordered delivery and it came within half an hour and the delivery man was very nice and polite, but the food was not that great.  I love American-Chinese food; but if there's one thing worse than the food coma afterwards, it's when the food itself wasn't even really good to begin with.  General tso's chicken combination platter: this comes with a side of either white or fried rice and a soup or egg roll. The general tso's chicken tasted fine, outside wasn't as fried as I would've liked but it also wasn't overfried (which is usually the issue with most American-Chinese food places). The pieces of chicken are big, a lot of broccoli, and the white rice was good.  Hot and sour soup: I would not order this again. Waaaaaaaay too much oil, so much that it separated on top and also my spoon changed colors because of the oil. I've never had so much oil in hot and sour soup before. It's also way too watery/thin for my personal taste, usually I feel like hot and sour soups are thicker.   Egg roll: outside was still wet with oil and the inside was wet for some reason. I don't know why. It tasted really good and the outside was crispy but the inside was just wet and it was not fun to eat.  I don't have high standards for American-Chinese food restaurants, but this was actually kind of disappointing, which is a shame because their service was super great and friendly."}
