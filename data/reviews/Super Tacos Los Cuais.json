{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! too bad the food was good, but ive seen wood boards with more personality than our waitress, hardly said a word and stared us down like if we slept with her husband or something, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE  DONT COME. Servicio HORRIBLE PERO EXAGERADAMENTE HORRIBLE la mesera nos miraba con cara de Fuchi y no decia nada, una tabla de madera tiene mas personalidad que esta mujer. HORRIBLE si quieres buen comida con buen servicio NO VENGAS AQUI!"}
{"text":"Went in on a slow night , it was our first time , nothing really appealed to me except the awkward tables, service wasn't really too pleasant, I had found this place off google maps decided to try it out because I have a love for tacos. I ordered a carnitas taco , chicken taco , and two tacos de cabeza , it honestly all tasted as if it was seasoned with salt , no flavored except what came off there handmade corn tortillas , I just wasn't satisfied at all, it might have been there style of cooking that I'm not into but I know I've had better tacos elsewhere ."}
{"text":"Great customer service, hand made tortillas and tacos are huge, you need to try the tacos al pastor, bring cash they dont take credit cards."}
