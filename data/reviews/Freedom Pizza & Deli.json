{"text":"Tried the Turkey hogie - only ordered a half but it was huge.  I didn't think I would eat it all - but I did.   The price was very reasonable.  I'll be back with family to try to pizza."}
{"text":"We were looking to order out Pizza and my cousin recommended this place. We had never had it before but were extremely impressed. We got the buffalo chicken pizza and a regular cheese and pepperoni pizza. It was so good. The buffalo chicken pizza definitely had a kick to it but they let you know that before ordering it. The pepperoni pizza was excellent as well. Everyone really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Overall, the taste and quality was good and the pizza was hot when it arrived. Only complaint is that the delivery was 15 minutes late for our company meeting and the poor girl had to make many trips to bring in the pizza. She should have been given a wagon or something to allow her to make this in one trip. Also, the large salad that I order came in four different containers and it would have been nicer if they were able to consolidate that to one large container or even two would've been fine. The dressings were also in individual oz cups and that was somewhat difficult to manage. But, overall, it's a good place. I think it's fairly new so maybe they're still working some things out."}
{"text":"The sauce is Good Very stingy on the cheese
Not worth the price you pay for extra cheese"}
{"text":"I'm really glad these folks opened here. Flavorful cheesy pizza is something we needed in the area. They've become my go-to place for pizza delivery and I even sometimes stop in for a slice. (They don't have slices just waiting, it takes 8 minutes to prepare one, but it's worth it)."}
