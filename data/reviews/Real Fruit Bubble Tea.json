{"text":"Real fruit. Really Satisfying.  I came here on a whim due to my desire of having a snack. And let me just say, No regrets. Seeing the entire process of my drink was satisfying. The employees were friendly and patient. I ordered the Taro Sherbet and was satisfied with my choice. The drink was thick and filled with flavour! (And I only ordered the smallest size!) And there were some comfy seats inside, just in case you wanted to sit down. The place may be a little cramped but surly with the buisness it has right now, they could buy the store next door and expand! A friend who accompanied me ordered the peach ice crush. She enjoyed the entire drink. She would rave on and on about the drink throughout the subway ride.  The drink was fresh, chilled and poured like a perfect heavenly dream.  To put it in short.  Go here and drink the flipping tea."}
{"text":"Love how they use real fruit no powder. I am in love with there coconut banana slush with tapioca makes me feel like I'm sitting on a beach in Hawaii"}
{"text":"Slush, smoothie, ice crush, sherbet so confusing. The staff was kind enough to illuminate.  Slush - made with real fruit and ice Smoothie - made with real fruit and milk Ice crush - made with flavored syrup and ice Sherbet - made with flavored powder and ice (not the frozen dessert made with fruit juice, milk or cream, egg white, or gelatin)  Now I can make my decision. It's lunch time and I need something filling and healthy. Papaya smoothie it is! The staff constantly keeps a stock of frozen cut up fruit to put into their smoothies and slushs, so the end result is a thick, fruit filled drink. Not as sweet as I would have liked, next time I'll ask to add just a little syrup. Next time will definitely be more adventurous and try mixing fruits (as suggested by the staff). You can add addional fruit for 50 cents more."}
{"text":"You can often find Real Fruit Bubble Tea at any mall. I love the fact that they use real fruit for their smoothies. I had their pina colada and I could taste bits of real coconut in it and they have a pretty decent almond milk tea. You can add Tapioca/ grass or fruit jelly , whey protein, mango chunks or extra fruit for an additional 50 cents. Staff is helpful and quick. Even if there's a line up, the wait isn't very long. If I'm thirsty and at the mall then I'll definitely be back to try more of their offerings."}
{"text":"First time trying this 'Real Fruit' franchise and boy was it a mistake. I ordered the principal green tea milk tea, and it felt like drinking watered down powdered milk. Couldn't get through 3 sips."}
{"text":"We ordered the diamond mango and almond milk tea. The mango was ok, the almond milk was grainy and warm! When we ordered the diamond mango the girl taking our ordered sighed, said something under her breath and rolled her eyes (like really annoyed). We are giving them business, so why is she complaining?! We ordered politely and despite, 2 people in line before us..her reaction was this! Again, why give business to someone who is so ungrateful... Never going back there!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try this place today. I got the mango diamond slush with tapioca. I'm glad I heard the girls in front of me order with \"no sugar\". Good to know there is that option.  I did the same. I was not at all disappointed with my drink. You can see them make it with fresh fruit and water, and the little bits of mango in the drink are so delightful!  The drink did not need any sugar at all. The fruit was already quite sweet.    Note that not all drinks are made with fresh fruit so if you want it order from the \"fresh fruit\" menu, or ask the staff.    My drink was not cheap. I got a medium size which was over $7 but it really was excellent and ended up being my lunch today.   If I'm in the area, I'd like to try other fresh fruit slushes or smoothies."}
{"text":"Love it this is where I first discovered the drink mango diamond slush. I've been hooked ever since. It is a small location, look very clean from what I've seen. The staff is very patient and, understanding compared to some of the other chains I've been to."}
{"text":"Truly a 2.5 star place.  This location is inside Parkway Mall and not staffed the same as other Real Fruit locations.  The drinks here are watered down. Less fruit, more ice/ water and syrup to compensate.   Having tries their mango, Durian and signature milk tea, taste is off.  I guess local demographics are not as demanding and less competition in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a huge bubble tea lover and for me to give 2 stars to a bubble tea shop is surprising.   I was craving the diamond mango slush with tapioca from here and as I was in the area, I decided to make a pit stop. To begin, the service was super slow compared to the other locations! The staff were nice, however the service was really slow. From when I placed my order until I got my order, I had to wait about 20 minutes, no I'm not joking. Two people who came after me (not even right after me) ended up getting their drinks before me, which I didn't understand.  The drink itself was pretty good, it's my all time favourite at Real Fruit Bubble Tea.  P.S. they had a buy one, get one free promo for the diamond mango slush, which I didn't know about until I went home! They didn't even mention the promo, even though I had a friend with me. They only gave me the one I paid for.. disappointing."}
{"text":"Really really fresh fruit juice and you can actually see them peel the fresh fruit and then blend it. The bubble tea is not as good, but I highly recommend any fresh blended drinks especially the mango fresh fruit and papaya fresh fruit juice. Unlike other smoothie shops where they rely on frozen or powdered drinks, this place gets extra points for freshness."}
