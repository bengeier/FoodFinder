{"text":"Ambience is great with live music (tam tam and piano when I was there), well decorated slightly upscale place. Unfortunately, food was ok, menu items were interesting but taste was a bit disappointing. Overall, worth a shot if you don't expect great food."}
{"text":"food never never came in, had to leave. appetizers were poorly served, the night manager on Saturday night is a disaster and despite my comments, he made no effort to make things right. Will never, ever step a foot on that restaurant again and I hope you don't either."}
{"text":"The service was EXCELLENT and thats the only reason they're even getting 2 stars. I was dissapointed they didnt have skirt steak so I ordered the sirloin steak and it had absolutely ZEROOO flavor. My GF ordered the milanesa de pollo which didnt taste good either. The fries were good but who messes up fries? The place is nice & trendy. They don't serve alcohol. I went on a carriage ride later that night and I was told this place doesn't have their liquor license because they opened the restaurant near a rehab center so they were denied by the city."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in Montreal . Nice staff , smiling faces and food is awesome. We went twice (brunch and dinner). I really liked the Quinotto. Will come back again and definitely visit this place."}
{"text":"Le même décor que le DNA, mais un excellent choix pour faire changement d'un menu montréalais traditionnel. Service 5*!"}
{"text":"I'll go on record of saying it; this might possibly be the best steak I've had in Montreal: The ribeye, perched noble and proud was the focal point of the butcher block. Grilled with only sea salt, we were explained that pepper would overpower the subtle intricacies of the cut of meat. Ridiculously tender, we were able to cut through the steak like a screaming hot knife through butter. The skirt steak - a classic gaucho cut of beef - was grilled with salt and pepper then finished with coarse salt. Mixed with its own juices, the salt created a briny sheen to the steak which made it glisten and begged to be devoured. Again, tender and full-bodied, the meat was what I imagined making out with my highschool crush would be like.... messy... messy and delicious."}
{"text":"Went there for supper this week and was overall disappointed with my evening. The restaurant was empty and the service was extremely slow , took over an hour to get our main.  The food was just ok and overpriced for the quality and quantity. I do not mind paying for good food, but in this case I would have probably eaten better at the keg for cheaper. Would not return."}
{"text":"I've been seating for almost 30 minutes waiting for my appetizer (octopus salad) and still no signs of any food coming to my table. This is after waiting maybe another 15 minutes for a drink. It's thursday and it looks busy, but seriously having to wait this much for a fuckin salad???? .......so far, not impressed with the service."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé à ce resto pour la première fois lors de l'événement LeChop...un peu déçue de la qualité de la nourriture proposée. Un poulet grillé trop salé et une salade un peu fade...en plus d'une crêpe dessert sèche. Par contre, l'endroit est agréable et le décor est chaleureux."}
{"text":"Terrible service waited 30 minutes to get our order food was small sry and bland 200 dollars not sure why avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my cousin on a Sunday night. We were the only people sitting on the terrace and it was not busy inside. The service was very subpar. Our water was always empty, our server was rude and it felt as though the employees didn't want to be there. The food was very good but the portions are very small. I ordered the tenderloin with sweet potatoes and rice and I left the restaurant hungry. I won't be back."}
{"text":"i heard about the opening of this restaurant in Old Montreal last week, ( great location in the old port area) i normally do not try out a new restaurant for the first month, allowing them to work out the kinks, the anticpation got the best of me, i went with my wife and her girlfriend. we were greeted and welcomed with a warm smile, the decor is great, open concept, yet very private, thick glass partitions made you feel like you are private dining. yet experiancing the open feeling...not clostrophobic. The decor is modern and  very classy..so, the three of us decided to each try something different so we can share....we started with appetizers, and they were all great, especially the epinades...very flavorful and delicate to the taste.  oh, we started with drinks, my wife had a raspberry mojito...WOW. its was so good. i had my favortite, carparinia, it too was made perfectly..we ordered the rib steak, flank steak and rissoto. we ordered a bottle of argenine red wine, several good selections and reasonably priced. Argentinian cusine is know for the meat and fish...and this was bang on...very well prepared, marinated and perfect to med-rare. you taste the meat...not like other places where you taste the overpowering spices. i did not ask the staff, but i'm sure this menu was created by an argentine master chef. the service staff was attentive. overall, all our sences were well satisfied. we cant wait to go back again....this time...i will wait a few weeks."}
{"text":"I went there last Sunday for brunch, to celebrate a birthday and I don't feel we spent a very good time.

First the place itself, well located and the design is pretty nice. Specially, in the bar side. 

Then the service. We were very well welcomed. Then the service was soooo slow. (Too slow). We were a party of 8, 4 of us had something else than ordered. We even didn't try to mention it, as we had waited almost 1 hour to get our dish.

The food now. Well, very disappointing. Meat was average, eggs were dry, \"freshly pressed orange juice\" didn't taste at all \"freshly presse\". I wouldn't have to mention that they poured table water in my glass of sparkling water, and filtered coffee in my latte."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We tried to have a drink on the terrace last night.  we were left waiting for ages, finally our order was taken by the busgirl who miscommunicated our order to the waiter.  20 minutes after arriving we were served the wrong drinks.  after waiting another 5 minutes the waiter reappeared with the wine, they pour at your table, he went and served a couple sitting near us first, they had arrived about 15 or 20 minutes after us.  by now we were frustrated and thirsty, we just left.  we will never go back."}
{"text":"First place that hit the spot after 5 days in Montreal! I came in after wandering for an hour (I believe the French call it flaneur, I call it walking aimlessly on a hot, humid day that happens to be a National Holiday with a laptop in row struggling to find anything open that serves water and has a bathroom... Standards so low that I forgot about delicious food and wifi)! Anyhow, it was mostly empty when I walked in around 6pm yet it filled substantially in 2h. Noise super manageable. Waitstaff super patient and attentive without being intrusive (always a delicate balance when you sit at a bar). Food? Elevated Montreal cuisine in my eyes. Prices? Hell yeah. Several appetizers under $10. I had two and they were delicious. Decent portions, tasty and adequate amount of greens.  I was attempting to save on this trip but did not encounter such a place till the last day. Instead I spent time and money in the Plateau on some rather mediocre food that was slightly more pricey."}
{"text":"I thought the restaurant was very nice but the food was very disappointing. I should say I only came here for brunch. The food looked beautiful on the plate but we did not like any of the food on it. Nothing had taste and we had to go crazy with the salt and pepper shaker. Dinner may be better but with all the restaurants in Montreal, I don't think I will go back to risk another tasteless experience."}
{"text":"Over expensive. 
Bad service. 
So slow. It took 30 minutes to bring beer for us. An hour to bring the stake on a regular day. 
Stakes come with nothing, not even mashed potato or mushroom or veggies."}
{"text":"Was disappointed when the restaurant was DNA and again disappointed with the new concept. Doesn't look like they changed anything from DNA except the menu which makes the atmosphere for an \"Argentinian\" resto a bit off. 

It wasnt bad, just very average. The service was friendly, but a bit sloppy. Nothing felt authentic from the decor to the food. The food was alright. I had an octopus appetizer which was the best dish we ate, but have to say they skimped on the octopus and was left with mostly a plate of arugula.

Really was hoping to like this place, always love it when a new restaurant pops up in Old Montreal. But I wouldn't recommend it and won't return. There are many better restaurants in the neighborhood. (and that review below of the dining room looking like Frankenstein's lab... Thank you! We were trying to figure out a way to describe it and that is a perfect description!)"}
{"text":"I had a wedding \"after\" brunch at this restaurant and it was perfect.  They handled absolutely everything perfectly and with a smile.  Delicious food and a pretty. Room.  Thank you to Julie, the Dir of Event and the hostess, Audry."}
{"text":"Not authentic. From appetizer to dessert... Total ripoff tourist trap food in the old port. But the service was nice and friendly. Diningroom is exactly the same as DNA- not even a lightbulb was changed! It still looks like a frakenstein laboratory and is literally cold as hell with many drafts. The lounge area to the left is much better and if you must go- try to sit on this side. Bar service may be slow if you sit in the banquette area at the back though."}
{"text":"We had a nice grilled hanger steak with chimichurri . It was a properly prepared hanger steak that was an amazing-tasting piece of meat. The cut was OK and the taste was just OK. The chimichurri wasn't bad. The crepes with honey walnuts, and milk semifreddo was delicious. 

Atelier d\"Argentine is a bit touristy, but the food was good."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service and great location! Visiting from New York, was very happy to find this place. Highly recommend the gnocchi!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 10 and had a wonderful experience here for dinner on a Saturday night. It is a large beautifully designed space in Old Port with a nice atmosphere. Busy but not overcrowded or too loud. 

The food was delicious, everyone tried different things on the menu and they were all delicious. 
The table favourites were the octopus terrine, tenderloin, bacon wrapped Cornish hen and the crispy quinoa dish. 
We also tried a few bottles from their wine selection which wasn't large but our bottles were good. 

Lastly, our server was so friendly and very attentive. He went out of his way to take care of the table and was genuinely pleasant throughout."}
{"text":"Nice fresh breads, interesting appetizers but not adequate for its price.  Amazing cocktails. Overall it's chic, good food, amazing drinks, and expensive."}
{"text":"Ok, One of my favorite food is the Argentinian, so I really wanted to become this resto into one of my top.

The atmosphere is nice, it has a nice view of the Old Port. 
Being a meat lover I would say that the quality is good, I would say fair. 
But at the end, the price is over the quality you'll expect. (I took the Rib Eye). Don't make me wrong, I liked it, but I will keep searching for the top Argentinian food in Montreal"}
{"text":"(For the Rue Crescent resto)
I had no expectations, It was a sunny day and they had space on the terrace. I know that the Argentinian cuisine in a tourist place was risky but I gave a try. I'd took the \"table d'hôte\" with the rib eye and the spinach as entry. My wife took a lamb's burger... it has the charcoal wood taste That I like !!.The people at the resto were nice. I will come back for sure! 
The Sangria is overpriced but in a summer day we really wanted to try... 
 It's not easy to find good steaks but this place have them"}
{"text":"We go here at least once per month sometimes more. To be honest we go to the bar for happy hour5-8. The cocktails are well made and very reasonably price.  They also have some very nice Argentinian wines I recommend Catena.  Appetizers though probably not that authentic (from other reviews) are also good and priced reasonably. Personally I don't like crowded bars so I enjoy being able to sit and enjoy a nice cocktail if that is your thing you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"As an Argentinean I'm always trying to find a good Argentinean restaurant,  until now I couldn't find my comfort food in Montreal, an then I discovered L'atelier d'Argentine,  were each bite makes you travel to Buenos Aires and back.
The lamb is prepared excellently and the desserts are a delicatessen as well. All is acompaigned with excellent Argentinian wines that we can not find at the SAQ.
Everything about this restaurant is prefect."}
{"text":"Superbe découverte! Tous les plats sont divinement bien préparé. Le service est vraiment bon! Ils sont généreux en alcool dans leurs drinks. La rapidité, la la qualité des produits utilisés est vraiment bonne. Chaque plat nous semblait léger alors on ne se sentait pas trop lourd en sortant du restaurant. Je recommande fortement!!!!"}
{"text":"Read about their table d'hôte in Journale de Montréal. Thought it might be a good way to start exploring this restaurant. 

The starter and the main dish were mediocre. But for the desert... 

I ordered caramelized Apple crêpe with ice cream, and what I got was something like dried pita bread, a couple of slices of apple and no ice cream (seemed like a joke to me!). 

But why to advertise a promotion if not willing to deliver?"}
{"text":"Restaurant that used to have great tasting food and sleek service. Well, that was then. Tonight was way less than average. From poor service to the chicken not cooked enough ... Will never go back !!!"}
{"text":"Atelier d'Argentine is a relatively new restaurant on the Montreal dining scene set in the space previously occupied by Derek Dammann's DNA. Previously, the incredibly modern setting made sense - DNA was known for its experimental but always delicious haute cuisine.

Upon entering Atelier d'Argentine, I was surprised to see that not much has changed - not even to suit the style and feel of an Argentinean steakhouse. Same glass partitions, same industrial lighting, same steel décor. Hmmm.

In any case, I heard so much about this restaurant through social media and was excited to finally try it. A delicious piece of red meat is always welcome in my carnivorous diet!

We started with the fennel, watercress, citrus and sugar-roasted almond salad. It was delicious! So fresh, with great contrasting textures and just the right amount of dressing. Good start.

Next, we both chose the grilled hanger steak with chimichurri & criolla sauce. A medium-rare, properly prepared hanger steak can be an amazing-tasting piece of meat. It also doesn't need much fuss around it - usually salt and pepper are just enough to enhance the taste.  Unfortunately, this hanger steak wasn't so great. The cut was sub-par and the taste was... Seriously MIA. Here, the lack of spice really brought out the bland and somewhat stringy piece of meat. The chimichurri wasn't bad but the dish, on the whole, was unfortunate.

Finally, we split the caramel stuffed crepes with honey roasted walnuts, sautéed bananas and milk semifreddo. Like the hanger steak, the dessert was unimpressive and lacked finesse. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.

It seems that Atelier d\"Argentine is going through a bit of an identity crisis. It's trying to be a serious restaurant - occupying DNA's space leaves them with large shoes to fill - but it's also trying to be \"fly\" and \"happening\". On Thusday night, the restaurant hosts its \"Besame\" event: after 10pm, their menu becomes less expensive and the party atmosphere heats up. I'm not saying Atelier d'Argentine is attempting the impossible, but it's trying to do too much too fast. Before earning a positive reputation as a restaurant, it's trying to enter the Old Port party scene. I've never seen that end well...

Food 7/10, Atmosphere 7/10, Pretty people 7/10, Music 7/10, Service 8.5/10."}
{"text":"Being born, and raised in Argentina(Buenos Aires) and being surrounded by authentic Argentinian food. I needed to have a taste of my own to see how similar will the food be here, as it is cooked in my own country. 
On a Friday around 12:30pm we've arrived(2 people) at their Crescent location. The restaurant is huge, ample space with a very original but beautiful interior. Having said all this, only two tables were filling up the entire restaurant. While it's the beginning of the lunch rush. When most restaurants are quite busy and then you notice that the place you're about to eat at, is surprisingly quiet. That's never a good sign! I was hungry and my curiosity simply didn't stop me from wanting to sit down and see if I could get a taste of home away from home. 

Only during their weekday lunch hours they have a table d'hote for $16 a person. Dessert, and drinks are not included. Only entree and main dish.  BUT! You also must add an additional $2-3 extra to any chicken or beef dish. Along with $1.00 of an additional charge to some other dishes. Not sure why! So already you can forget about being $16.00 per person.  That did not sit well for me. 

Anyways.. 

As an entree we've tried two things. The classic and traditional empanada. Oh my! Talk about bringing back amazing memories of the classic empanadas. They were prepared just like in Argentina. A tender dough, filled with sweet, juicy tomatoes, fresh basil and a very flavorful and stringy cheese. Deep fried and cooked to perfection. I was very very pleased! 

Our second entree was little fritters of fresh spinach, along with a very spicy mustard sauce. The fritters were tender, and very flavorful. Crunchy and not at all oily. Perfect! The mustard sauce gave them the perfect touch of heat. 

About ten minutes later our main dishes arrived. 

I have ordered the entraña(Skirt steak) with their homemade fries. Oh my! Oh my! Outstanding as well. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium, with an traditional taste of the typical charcoal grill that everyone in Argentina uses. The perfect smokey, woodsy taste to a perfect tender, but slightly chew cut of meat. 
As for the fries.. Amazing! Crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. Lightly seasoned with garlic, and salt. Not at all salty! Just perfect. 

We've also ordered a beef steak, which was served with cooked vegetables. Once again cooked to an absolute perfection. As for the vegetables, they were just \"OK\" nothing to brag about. Everyone of our main dishes were served extreme hot, well presented and within a very reasonable waiting time. 

As for their dessert. That failed miserable. By far one of the most disappointing dessert I've had. Especially at the cost of $9.00 

In Argentina we have a very common dessert that you will most likely see in 9 out 10 menus. It's a freshly made crepe, filled with Dulce de leche, rolled like a cigar. With a light sprinkle of sugar and broiled till the sugar has a golden crust on top. 
All this being said, our dessert did not remind me of anything I've had during my many visits to an Argentina restaurant. In fact, our dessert lacked a great deal of freshness, and quality. The crepe was hard, cold, and stale. NOT freshly made. It was served alongside of ice cream. Which the ice cream had no taste at all and it was hard as cement. The dulce de leche was delicious, sadly it was ruined by a unripened piece of cold banana inside the cold crepe. The crepe had a broiled sugar top, which tasted nothing less than burnt. A horrible bitter taste to it.  

Overall, I think their main strength is their meat dishes and side dishes as well. The service was quite good, although our waitress lacked a bit of enthusiasm as I noticed her texting from time to time. Disappointing.

Would I go back? I can't say for sure yes or no at the moment. Sadly, Montreal does not offer Argentian restaurants with good quality foods and a lovely ambiance. If ever I'm craving a dish from my home country, I will think twice before giving L'Atelier D'Argentine a second chance. I do strongly recommend you steer far, and away from their desserts."}
{"text":"Went here since it was near our Airbnb and we needed to burn a few hours before our flight. The food was fresh, tasted great, an the presentation was nice. The plates are on the smaller size, but it hit the spot. It was only  $16 for a starter and a main dish! Also had a nice strong cappuccino and Bloody Mary. The service was excellent and they had good cold water! (A few of the restaurants the water was warm and didn't taste that great, I don't know might just be me) Anyhow, glad I stopped in, was hesitant with the reviews the place had."}
{"text":"Second time I have been here and the same good experience.  Here on business so alone...I sat at the bar and enjoyed a ribeye, rapini and a watercress salad.  All very good.  Good service from the bartender and food arrived in good time and temperature.  I enjoyed it this time as much as last and will visit again on my next trip."}
{"text":"I just got back from here and felt compelled to write a negative review after some very shady bait and switch tactics used by this restaurant.

After coming here for many nights and enjoying the 5@8 drink special, they suddenly decided to add some fine print to the menu where if you decide to sit, the drink discounts do not apply. We ended up with an enormous bill and then their payment machine was locked to giving no less than a 25% tip!"}
{"text":"I've visited L'Atelier d'Argentine with three of my colleagues. We all enjoyed the overall experience. The food was fresh, well cooked and the service was very quick. The menu would probably need a little updating as at least two dishes on it weren't available, the waiters came back to modify our orders twice. I would recommend this place for lunch, the price is very affordable (16$) for the quality of the food they serve."}
{"text":"Had to flag down a server more than once for service.  Brought wrong food.  Shady place. Food forgettable."}
{"text":"Food okay. Service bad. I was feelihn bad to ask anything to the waitress. She forced a smile when we had to tip"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and everything on the menu I ordered was spot on. Things always taste better in old Montreal. I had the prosciutto for app and steak sandwich. My wife had the quinoa crusted tiger shrimp and app water crust salad. Both tasted amazing and the pricing and atmosphere is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Food is a bit pricey for what they serve. The fish and mussels were just ok, nothing special. The service was great and the ambiance also. We had a round table and it was great to be able to talk to everyone."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw the decor here. It was absolutely stunning just like the waiters!!  The appetizers were good but nothing was traditional argentinean cuisine. The choripan was a breaded fritter and the morcilla de campo was just plain weird. I was expecting a traditional sausage but it was more like a grounded beef texture. One of my favorite things in this world is churrasco with chimichurri. I was expecting to find this here and what the server suggested was completely NOT like churrasco. The steak was juicy and flavorful but full of gristle. And I was expecting a full portion of chimichurri sauce and I got barely a tablespoon. It was not a bad meal but definitely NOT your traditional argentinean spot. To end with positive note the French fries were divine!!! Absolutely perfect crispy garlicky golden fries!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was selected for a work lunch during the week. Every person appeared to have the same underwhelming reaction to the food. 

We ate outside on the make shirt crescent terrasse which in all honesty isn't ideal but that's not necessarily their fault. 

What's important to focus on is the food. The meal itself wasn't very good. The food was so salty the majority of the options became inedible. The meat was breaded and fried to the point where the meat was oily. Essentially the meal was awful. I will say we had gone when they had just opened but the mistakes that were made in the meal showed a lack of care with what they were preparing. Also, wait staff was slow and unresponsive which could also be attributed to the recent opening.

Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and we were a large party. The staff was amazing and so polite, our food arrived in a timely matter and all together and was absolutely delicious. I'd recommend the braised lamb ravioli. And I am definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"The food sucked so bad! Not one of the two meals taken were good! But the staff was so incredible that's why I gave it the star for the incredible staff who truly care about what they do!"}
{"text":"NEEDS FIVE STARS. Fantastic Argentine food. My highlights were the cocktail list (try the pisco sour!), gispacho, the ribeye, and the interior decorating. Absolutely stunning food to match a stunning restaurant. Magnifico!!!"}
{"text":"Both food and service were horrible..our order took like an hour to come and trust me it wasn't worth waiting for..we have to ask to refill our coffees every time"}
{"text":"The decor is amazing but it ends there......

The service was brutal, our waiter was a complete moron he couldn't do anything right, he was slow and didn't know what was going on.

As for the food it was inexpensive and for a reason, it was bland and not very good, I had a rib eye steak that was small and not very tasty. The dessert was not very good either, it was a lemon square with literally a teaspoon of sobert.

Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Premièrement, j'étais invitée, je suis donc incapable de vous dire le prix. Je me contenterai donc du service, des plats, du vin et du goût.

J'y suis allée en mémoire de mon père, qui a vécu en Argentine plusieurs années.  J'ai prix un plat à base de pommes de terre, oeufs, oignons et chorizo. L'oeuf était coulant et devenait un peu la sauce. C'était très bon. Goûteux, léger

J'ai également goûté à la gaspacho de ma cousine. OMG, c'était bon!! bien relevé.

Bon choix de vin, excellent service. Rapide, personnalisé. J'ai beaucoup aimé, un gros coup de coeur!"}
{"text":"Went to an apparently new location on Rue Crescent. This restaurant seems to have undergone a recent name change from Kyozon to L'Atelier D'Argentine (although the credit card receipt still shows Kyozon). This was easily one of the worst dining experiences of my life. Highlights include the following:  1. Slow, inattentive service with very few customers there. 2.  Inedible food, bearing little resemblance to anything of any quality from Argentina. And 3. Dirty tableware.  The bottle of Malbec was good, if that was any consolation. Easily amongst my five worst dining experiences."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here today.  The service was outstanding and Guillaume was terrific.  The food was very good and they have a unique flair.  Very fresh ingredients.  The vibe is very cool, yet comfortable.  The location is great with a view of the St. Lawrence River.  Very clean!  Audrey the manager also stopped by to check on our experience, which tells me that this team is on the same page.  Love this spot!  Come check it out."}
{"text":"It has been a year, my visit to Argentina. I miss the country and I miss their food. So when I went L'Atelier Argentine, I didn't have any expectations. No restaurants can make food as authentic as its countries. But I was still excited! 

We had a nice welcome from the hostess, who even had a mini conversation with us, asking us how was our day; impressive! 

It's pretty dark, the lights were very dimmed, plus every table has a tea light candle on. There are tables with regular chair; there are tables with couches. We were placed at a couch. What I found interesting is whenever there is couch, is usually one sided in most restaurants, and the other side of the table is a regular chair, but here, in this resto, both sides of the table have a couch to sit. The surrounding are brick all. In the middle of the restaurant; a massive bar, with stools all around. It actually reminded me of the TV series Cheers, Ted Danson was missing... lol.

Our waiter is named Marvin; he was marvelous. I went to the restaurant with my dear friend, since it was Valentine's Day... we call it Galentine's Day, we had a special menu. We had spicy shrimp salad; unfortunately, it was not spicy and the greens had bitter after taste. My friend had a steak with chimchuri sauce. She enjoyed it. I had smoked tuna with fennel. My food tasted flavorless. So I asked for some hot sauce. My waiter forgot about it and got delayed to bring the sauce. Finally, he brought it, and it made a huge difference to my dish. Because of delay, our waiter gave both of us a complimentary glass of wine. I was blown by it. My friend was also surprised, since her food was good, but she got also a glass. We thanked Marvin few times. He said, he must take care of of his clients.

Decor and ambiance are pretty good. The service is beyond excellent. The food needs to be more flavorful as Argentina."}
{"text":"Possiblement la meilleure viande en ville!
Situé non loin du musée Pointe à Callière, dans le vieux port
Possibilité de réserver
L'accueil était très bon, le service aussi, à l'exception que deux des vins que nous souhaitions prendre n'étaient plus en réserve..
Les entrées (poulpe, choux fleur en salade) étaient exquises, la viande extraordinaire, et les desserts étaient très bons aussi
Il y a aussi des plateaux de viandes à partager à 2, ils avaient l'air excellents!
A essayer!"}
{"text":"Went there with a small group. Service was excellent, food was great, presentation of the food was spectacular. Food was really good, but not enough to be a 5 stars. I've eaten at several churrascarias (outside of Canada) and many were better (Fogo de Chao, as an example). However, I would say this is the best churrascaria I've tried in Montreal, by far."}
{"text":"Went here with several friends. Service was excellent and friendly, main courses were delicious (you gotta love meat), desserts were ok."}
{"text":"Review for 95$ 6 course meal with wine:

Incredible experience. Food was superb. Wine pairings were excellent and well chosen. Hearing the background of the dishes and the wines, their regions and style added to the experience. 

My only complaint: it's a lot of wine. Rolled back to my hotel. So that's not really a bad thing right?

I'd you are going to do this experience, come with an empty stomach and cab fare"}
{"text":"Simplement Wow à chaque fois! Que l'on parle de 5 à 7 entre collègues ou une soirée de filles ou un souper en amoureux, à tous les coups j'ai été très satisfaite. Les 5 à 8 bien connus du resto sont un must! Tous les cocktails sont à 6$ (et on parle de vrais cocktails! Pas ceux avec 99% de jus et rien d'alcool / on va même jusqu'au verre agrémenté d'une figue flambée!). Les tapas sont simplement divins et je vous recommande fortement celui au fromage bleu et poire pochée (5$ seulement!! Et bien garni!). L'ambiance au bar est chaleureuse et conviviale et le lounge est très invitant avec ses sofas, tables basses et chandelles. Le service est impeccable. Bref, c'est un des bons restaurants à Montréal qui mérite le détour et qui mérite d'être dans les tops 10 pour son rapport qualité prix et son ambiance! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Come for: Upscale relaxing lunch (sure dinner is good too) 

Pros: large space on a great corner by the wharf, well seasoned food, solid wine list, cauliflower soup, cheese fritters (the hidden delight are the seasoned tomatoes that come with it) 

Cons: food is a bit salty in some instances, gnocchi drowned in oil too much"}
{"text":"Really great spot to stumble into for breakfast before leaving town.  I loved the European cafe feel and the food was healthy and delicious.  I appreciated the gluten free options."}
{"text":"I went with a group of about 10 people on a Saturday for brunch & bottomless mimosas. The service was good - we were being constantly topped off with more champagne and orange juice which made the bottomless aspect of the brunch quite satisfying.

However, the food quality was sub-par. I and a few of my friends all got very overcooked eggs (to the point where the eggs were completely dry and flaky). Potatoes were under-cooked and crunchy.

At the end of my meal, I paid + tipped the waiter, and then tried to give him some constructive criticism about how the food quality was poor compared to the prices. He responded by saying \"when you come in a group this size, you should expect the food quality to diminish\". Seriously?"}
{"text":"Had the ribeye, which was delicious. My friend's filet mignon was also perfect. Food and ambiance was great, and servers were quick and helpful. I was in a big group (six guys) for a bachelor party. The manager even sent over a free round of drinks for our celebration! If I'm back in Montreal, I will definitely make it a point to eat here again."}
{"text":"Where to begin, our evening started out fine at Atelier Argentine for Grand Prixe weekend, but quickly deteriorated. 

We sat down and the waiter immediately informed us about a mixed grilled meat special for 100/pp. Ok we thought, we'll think about it. 2 minutes later he's back again pushing it. 3 minutes later he's showing us a photo of another mixed meat special he did for a table of 17, insisting this was a must order. Mind you we were a table of 3. 

Now we were getting suspicious. Why is this waiter pushing a 100/pp special when it clearly looks like we can eat well for around $80/pp including wine? I know why, because its Grand Prixe weekend and they want to make money. 

At this point we wanted to walk out because we felt like we were being forced to order the special. We didn't leave, but we should have.

Instead, we ordered a few appetizers and some steaks (much to the waiters dismay): sirloin, hanger, and ribeye. The steaks were barely competent. The ribeye was good I won't lie, but the hanger and sirloin had a burnt taste on the outside. The inside was cooked fine but you couldnt get rid of the charred taste with each bite. Hardly enjoyable. 

Now onto the last irritating part of the night. We ordered a $40bottle of red to start. When we asked to see the wine menu again for the second bottle, the waiter recommended a $95 bottle as a good choice. It was clear at this point that this guy clearly had no clue how to read his guests and was just interested in the restaurant making money during Grand Prixe weekend. Not to mention his face dropped when we opted to go with another $40 bottle since that was clearly our price range. His relatively out of place suggestion and subsequent disappointment was inappropriate and rude. 

Bottom line about this place, it's a steakhouse that isnt't very good at making steak and they really know how to make you feelike an a$$. I love argentine steakhouses but this place has warped values and poor food. Would only go if you like to feel like a schmuk"}
{"text":"This place could be soo much better with a few amendments such as:
1. clean the glasses (one of ours had lipstick stains all around)
2. Either fill the glasses up (martini glasses half full is tiny amount) or make them a lot cheaper! They were $14 for half a martini glass.
Now for the good though...bar tenders were excellent. Drinks were outstanding!!!
Dead place which im guessing is because once youve been you dont go back due to prices / drink amounts.
Not recommended (shame as amazing cocktails)"}

Par contre, très bon thé !"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Great place for a group or date. Food was delicious. Apps especially. Order the French Fries! They were some of the best ice I've ever had."}
{"text":"Nice not to pricey tapas style restaurant in old Montreal. You have to find the place, but once you do you won't forget.

Good service, nice plates, but I must admit that it was a bit noisy, so if you're looking for a good place to talk, I would look somewhere else.

Nothing bad really, but more for groups and not for meetings or dates IMO."}
{"text":"Great experience. Lovely ambiance, great service/staff, beautiful restaurant. Food-wise, it didn't blow me away. I was expecting amazing food but the appetizers were tiny and not that great (we ordered the empanadas and the spinach & cheese fritters). As for the steak, the sirloin had way too much fat going around the outside of it so I threw out 1/4 of it. Parmesan fries were good and the desserts were lovely (chocolate torta & pear/mascarpone...) Drinks were ok, I didn't like my strawberry mojito that much. But all in all, a good experience."}
{"text":"So I have a history with the Old Montreal location. I'd been there at least 5 times for dinner or 5a7 and loved mostly everything I tried food and drinks wise. The service was also pretty good in a chic environment. Alas, they've closed for good.

I've been to the Crescent location twice. Once for a family celebration when it first opened, and once last week for Mtl a Table. I prefer the Old Port location. The service here is less attentive, the decor is less chic, filled with a rowdier crowd (probably because it's on Crescent). The servers aren't as knowledgeable about the menu... I could go on. 

During my last visit for Mtl a Table, I was disappointed. The server kept getting messed up on details, we never received bread, and overall, there was a lack of finesse. 

I tried the lamb empanada, the hanger steak and the lemon chocolate tart for dessert. The food was very good overall. The steak was 2/3 of the size of a normal hanger steak that I've enjoyed at Atelier D'Argentine previously... we had to ask for the chimichuri sauce because it was supposed to come with the steak...

They have good 5a8 \"happy hour\" specials so maybe I'll give their happy hour or infamous boozy brunch a shot in 2018."}
{"text":"I'm typically not one to leave reviews but our experience here was so incredible that I feel compelled. 

We were recommended to go here from a friend during our time in Montreal so we decided to check it out. My boyfriend and I are both vegan which is a particular challenge from a restaurant that specializes in meat but they killed it. They made sure to ask all the necessary questions to fully understand our eating requirements and then just made us something. 

We shared a giant plate of grilled vegetables, a quinoa mix with these amazing mushrooms, and more. We couldn't even finish the plate because it was so filling, which is far from the regular vegan experience. They even made us poached pear with berries dessert. 

The waitstaff was so welcoming and perfectly attentive. The restaurant itself is modern but warm at the same time. We couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"Très belle place. Digne du Vieux port de Mtl. 
Service impeccable. 
Resto fait pour les amateurs de viandes. Boeuf en provenance des USA, mieux coté que notre \"AAA\" canadien. 
Nous étions 3 et avons pris un plat dégustation avec 3 choix d'accompagnements.
Les coupes de viandes sont différentes.
La texture est nouvelle et ne ressemble pas à un filet mignon ou encore à une bavette dont nous sommes habitués de manger. 
La viande fond en bouche. 
Sauces simples et efficaces. 
Accompagnements délicats pour équilibrer la portion de viande en plat principal.
Belle expérience. Belle liste de vin et d'alcool."}
{"text":"Never made it inside but had a great experience sitting along the sidewalk. The service, unlike it's competitor's across the street, was top notch and very engaging. We all especially enjoyed the selfentitled woman who ordered a ribeye ordered \"well done\" then after three healthy bites sent it back, refusing to pay for it because it was TOO DRY. The server Ibrahim handled it all acceptionally well and took the less traveled high road. 
Even though I did not go in, I saw enough to give this place a top notch review for interpersonal relationships...."}
{"text":"SO first of all I'm a yelp fanatic; BUT the quantity of salt served to us was #RIDICULUS. They are pretty much forcing us to snort salt because there are so many mimosas and champagne. Like wtf? But love this placeawesome for birthdays, friends, and happiness:) good job. Ily"}
{"text":"Service was fine until the waiter argued instead of trying to smooth something over. At the end of the main course, when one of the members of our party pointed out that their steak was overcooked (they had ordered it medium rare), the waiter went on at length about how the person could have mentioned it earlier. While this was true, the waiter's instant defensiveness and refusal to be even slightly apologetic left a bad taste in everyone's mouth, especially since the waiter went on and on about it. Some of us might have taken the waiter's side if he had behaved better--instead, he turned everyone against him and the restaurant. He attempted to compensate by bringing 2 disappointing desserts: a chewy flan and chewy crepes with a scoop of semifreddo that still had freezer burn on it. As for the rest of the meal: cocktails were good, empanadas were okay, steaks were fine but nothing special."}
{"text":"Cadre exceptionnel et service attentionné, tres dommage que le sommelier n'ait pas été la pour nous conseiller mais la manager nous a quand même offert un très bon vin. La viande est délicieuse, à essayer : les palourdes et les gnocchis !"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place as we were walking from our hotel to Old Port. We were looking to have a nice dinner in Montreal, so we decided to try it.  Our waiter was fabulous, taking time to answer all our questions and patiently explain various items on the menu. We ordered the short ribs with spiced apples and bacon wrapped Cornish hen (my American translation).  The short ribs were mouth watering, right to the last bite and the spicy apples accompanied them perfectly. The hen was very tasty, and the grilled sweet potatoes were delicious.   We got the Panqueques and Flan to finish the meal. I wasn't as thrilled with the deserts, only because the carmel had a bitter taste (supposed to be burnt...?), but they were both tasty. 

I would definitely go back and will next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Brunch was delicious Sunday and this stylish spot is now my favorite in Montreal. We started with beignets with dulce de leche sauce and assorted empanadas filled with beef, corn or cheese. The flavored were amazing and the warm pastries were delicious. My sumptuous salad was topped with smoked salmon and perfectly dressed while my friend's scrambled eggs were mixed with ham and served with rosemary potatoes and fruit which she raved over.
Only the absence of decaf espresso kept this beautifully plated and attentively served meal from being perfect. Loved this brunch!"}

{"text":"Had a sangwich at their food booth during the jazz fest.

This restaurant had a food booth set up at the Place des Arts during the jazz fest--in fact, it was one of the only booths in the area, save for some hot dog/sausage vendors. On consecutive days, had the tasty bavette de boeuf (skirt steak) and saucisse (sausage) sangwiches, both with chimichurri and criolla sauce. Somewhat overpriced at ~$10 CAD for half a sangwich, but I suppose that's to be expected at the jazz fest.

Overall, it was a decent place to get a quick bite during the jazz fest--a step up from the average cart vendor, without the obvious wait from sitting down at a brick & mortar."}
{"text":"Lovely place for a romantic dinner out.  Beautiful setting in Old Montreal.  The atmosphere was trendy.  Dim lighting, lovely fireplace.  The steak was fantastic.  Service was amazing."}
{"text":"Their service n street view are good but foods at lunch time are just even their price, about $16 for a main course w/ appetizer. Appetizers are good but main dishes we ordered are only 2 or 3 stars, steak was too salty and the lamb burger was not as expected - it has the smell of mutton(it's good except this part so maybe you will like it if don't mind the smell) I'll still give it a 4 stars cuz it was our first date in Montreal, musics are good, not too noise inside the place and where we sit has the most romantic street view in the restaurant. It's not a bad experience anyways."}
{"text":"The restaurant was not even half full, and still had to wait more than 25 minutes for our order (that's 25 after we order for the appetizer, after they removed those plates, another 25 minutes for the main course, and 30 minutes between the time they cleared those plates and the dessert was brought). 
The flavors were not paired well at all (spinach and fontina fritters/sweet and mellow flavors are completely overwhelmed when are served on top of dollops of strong Dijon mustard). 
Quinoa risotto with roasted red bell peppers, was overcooked,  underseasoned, very liquid and runny and not creamy at all (three threads of parmesan cheese grated on top is not enough). And two strips of roasted pepper sitting on the quinoa was less than expected. 
For dessert, chose the Chocotorta (should be layers of chocolate cookies with dulce de leche and some sort of soft cream cheese layered in between), was just a brownie with three minute little dollops of soft whipped cream on top, sitting on a speckle of dulce de leche). 
Will not recommend or go back to this establishment"}
{"text":"L'endroit est très beau et accueillant. Néanmoins, les serveurs étaient nouveaux et cela a paru dans le service reçu. Les gaspacho étaient délicieuses mais mon plat principal n'était pas à la hauteur.

{"text":"We went for lunch a Saturday at 1:30 PM.
The first disappointment was that they do not offer a full lunch menu on weekends, just a limited brunch menu.

The next disappointment was bad service, from slow sitting to not offering us bread during the very long wait for our brunch.

As for the food, the Monrealese sandwich was quite good but the amount of spicy Dijon made me cry."}
{"text":"Good ambiance, food was okay but service terrible. They mixed up our order twice and it was soooo long. Took at least 30 min once we sat down for someone to come offer us something to drink."}

{"text":"Does the beef served in Canada taste different from the beef served in the U.S.A.?  While in our hotel room, we saw a commercial on TV that boasted about beef from Alberta.  So for our last evening meal in Montreal we decided to search for a nearby steakhouse.  The one that my wife selected was L'Atelier d'Argentine Vieux-Port.  After all, isn't Argentina noted for its beef?

The restaurant is very attractive and split into two sections.  The Lounge side contains a bar and maybe a dozen tables (the side we were seated in) while the other side, based upon webpage pictures, appears to be a bit more luxurious looking with just tables.  The Lounge was rather warm on a mid-June evening as if the air conditioning was not fully operational.  Staff seemed surprised at our question of whether the room temperature is always at this warmth.  Their response was to point out that the gas fireplace, literally touching the top of our table, was turned off at this point.

(All prices are Canadian dollars)
We started with a pint of Blanche de Chambly ($9) and a glass of 2013 Catena Alta Chardonnay ($21).  Both were fine and lasted through our apps and entrées.

One appetizer we ordered was the Callos del Chubut ($18) (actually we received this dish as part of a misunderstanding, but a very delicious misunderstanding it turned out to be) - pan seared sea scallops, porcini mushroom cream, and chipotle flakes.  A very eye appealing dish with perfectly seared scallops and a rich, flavorful, creamy mushroom sauce.

A second appetizer was just as enjoyable.  Ensalada de Pulpo ($9), warm smoked octopus, kalamata olive, sun-dried tomato, red onion, bitter greens, and a light pesto sauce.

We both ordered beef entrées, and I'll say right up front that we were not overwhelmed with either dish.  My wife had a 10 oz. Lomo (fillet mignon) ($38) served with traditional Argentinean chimichurri, and salsa criolla , and a Lobster Tail ($20).  Her requested medium-rare appeared to be more medium.  The red tint that appeared when cut seemed to be a reflection from the red lights in the Lounge as there were no juices running from the knife cut.  The Lobster was a little fishy tasting.

My entrée was a 14 oz. Ojo de Bife (Rib Eye) ($35), again with chimichurri and salsa criolla.  Neither of us found that these traditional sauces highlighted the beef.  My medium-rare was cooked a bit too long also.  The flavor and tenderness of the meet was at best, average.  I also had a side of Papas al Horno ($5), mixed Andean potatoes with rosemary and an olive oil glaze.  While not as good as my Mom's oven baked potatoes, I actually enjoyed them more than my rib eye.

With one more chance to please us, we ordered a Chocolate y Pecan ($8) for dessert.  A ball of chocolate ganache on a pecan cookie was truly rich with a lot of flavor and went well with a Double Espresso ($4) and a Cappuccino ($4).

Service was helpful with explanations and recommendations from the staff. Reservation was made through Open Table."}
{"text":"Overall I really enjoyed my experience at L'Atelier d'Argentine. The food was great and for steak I think the price is on par with other restaurants in the area. The staff was really nice and helpful and I felt like they really cared about making sure I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! $33 for bottomless mimosas or Bloody Mary bar. Good selection of food and very reasonably priced especially for the portion size. Ambience is very light and open, nice for day time especially when the sun is shining through the big windows. Service is great, coffee and champagne keep flowing."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. The decor, the food and the live band was amazing. Tried a lot of things on the menu and it was delicious. You gotta try their speciality steak it's sooo good. The wine Clos de Los siete 2010 was also delicious and married well the meat. I recommend this place to everyone who loves good food."}
{"text":"I came to try out their $16 table d'hôte lunch menu. Certain items on the menu such as grilled chicken or steak required an extra $1 or $2. For starter I tried the Locro: a hearty squash & corn stew, chorizo, smoked bacon, spicy tomato. The chorizo and bacon really elevated the flavour and warmed me up. For the main I went with the strip steak ($2 extra). It was a decent sized steak (150g), accompanied by arugula salad and some pan fried potatoes on the side. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I managed to get a reservation for NYE thanks to our hotel's concierge. There was a prie fixe menu: four courses for $50. Given the bargain we were receiving on our meals, I encouraged my partner to order a bottle of wine for us to enjoy. The waiter recommended a wonderful Malbec. 

The food was good: it was not the best we ever had, but it was better than more expensive meals we've had. The first course was an empanada with braised lamb and potato, which was well-seasoned and fantastic. The second course was a seared tuna (a crudo) over a wasabi cream which was really delicious. However, the portion was smaller than I hoped. The third course featured a steak that was cooked beautifully with chimmichurri and potatoes. The dessert was a chocolate cake with raspberry. I am smiling as I remember eating that dessert. It was an amazing dining experience, for sure! 

The service and the layout of the restaurant did not match up to the greatness of the food though. The dinner service felt rushed because of the scheduled NYE festivities. It seemed that while I was chewing my last bit of food, the next course being brought to the table. Another gripe we had was with the layout of the restaurant: the tables were placed very close to one another. We were sitting uncomfortably close to the two couples next to us. 

When we return to Montreal, we will definitely make a return trip to this place. The food is good, but you will have the chance to get cozy to your neighbors (whether you like it or not)."}
{"text":"I have had various types of experience in restaurants: some very great, some not so good, some just okay. This one, unfortunately, was just disappointing all around. The majority of my experience is tainted with the deficient service I received. 

In my mind, there is no justification for not receiving any service, not even a glass of water, for the first half-hour. Sure, we were a group and for some time we were still waiting on some of our dinner mates. However, why can't those of us already here not be offered a glass of water? Or if we want to order a drink or an appetizer while we wait on our friends? 

We asked a few waiters that were there if we could get a glass of water and some bread. Every single one of them answered 'sorry, not your waiter/waitress'. We had been sitting there for so long, I couldn't even remember what our waitress looked like. But even if this is not your table, this 'not my table, not my problem' attitude just makes me feel like we're unwanted patrons. Let me add that we did have a reservation, we weren't that large a group (7) so it's not like we dumped a surprise big group on them on an already busy night. In fact, the restaurant was really not all that busy and there were not really any new tables in the whole time we were there as we had a late dinner reservation. 

Once our waitress deigned make an appearance to our table, we asked if we could get a basket of bread. And we got some water. Things were looking up. Except, she disappeared again. Every time she came near our table we tried to ask if our bread was coming. The 3rd time she said 'yes it's been ordered'. It had been a good 20 min by then. We were actually starting to discuss among us if they even had bread but figured, surely, she would've said so if they didn't have any. Finally we see some bread come out of the kitchen and land...on a different table! The 2nd time a waiter came out with some bread and made his way toward a different table we just flagged him down and said that we believe this bread is ours and requested that it be brought to our table. Thankfully, he didn't say anything. That was the best part of the night. 

Of course we scarfed down our bread in 10 seconds because we were starving from all the wait so we asked our waitress if we could get another basket of bread to which she said she would bring it right away. Spoiler alert: bread never arrived. 

Appetizers went without a hitch. The empanada was a little disappointing. The roasted pumpkin soup was actually delicious, though a little too heavy on the yogurt. I quite liked the spinach balls as well. 

The next bit was a little weird. One of our dinner mates didn't order an appetizer so she asked to have her dinner to be served after the appetizers, at the same time as other people's main dish. Except it arrived after the appetizers and before the rest of us got our main dish. When she pointed it out to the waitress she said \"oh I thought you wanted it right away\". \"No, I wanted it at the same time as everyone else's dinner\" \"Oh well, it's okay, the other plates are on their way, anyway\". She forgot to mention that 'on their way' meant 'another 15 min'. She did like her dinner though it was cold by the time she ate it. 

When the waitress brought the rest of the plates, she didn't know who ordered what or what she had brought. She could only recall part of the Spanish name for the dish but that wasn't helpful to us at all. In the end we guessed what was on the plate and handed it to the appropriate party and we turned out to be right about what she brought. This was, however, too much unnecessary detective work. The food was alright but nothing memorable. The portions were tiny but we went on an evening they had a special menu. Maybe we should've ordered from the regular menu. 

At the very end, we were so appalled by the service or rather lack thereof that this was reflected in our tip. I understand that the waitress was offended but instead of asking us about it she complained to her manager. The manager came to us and we explained everything mentioned in this review. He was apologetic (our waitress never came to apologize) and wanted to make it up to us by offering us drinks or desserts. While this was appreciated, we just wanted to leave the restaurant at that point. 

I would like to point out that most of us have worked in restaurants before. We have had our fair share of bad and difficult days and having to keep our game on despite everything going on. As a result we try to be empathetic and patient patrons but this was too much. There did not seem to be any effort whatsoever from our waitress. As mentioned previously, when our waitress was MIA, the other waiters in the restaurant also refused to serve us since we were not their assigned table. I sincerely hope the manager took our criticism seriously and provided further training to his staff but unfortunately I simply cannot take the risk of spending another awful meal here."}
{"text":"Steak was incredible, appetizers were okay. The vibe was amazing too, super cool DJ and graphics."}
{"text":"I went to This restaurant 2 weeks ago and i have to say i was really disappointed by the service. We had a group reservation at 9:00pm and we sat down, the table wasn't even ready, at 10:00pm. 1 HOUR of wait with a reservation....it was a really bad start. We finish the dinner close to 1:00am , everything took a lengthy time: receiving the entrees, dessert and even the bill.

Lets talk about the food now, seriously i have no doubt about the quality of the product but nothing blew my mind however the price did blew my mind!!! 
A main dish of meat without any sides , every side are extra $, i find it a little cheap not serving anything with an entree.

If you want to pay pricey food for a nice decor well it is the place to go.

Belly not happy, not coming back"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. What ticked me off was how ridiculously small the portions are. I ordered a salmon and it was maybe a 2 oz sliver at best, surrounded by a bunch of cheap green leaves.

Also found it ironic how their menu claims to represent true Argentinian food and not a stereotype or North American adaption, yet the first item is Montreal smoke meat.

Service wasn't particularly attentive either."}
{"text":"In one word: inconsistent. 

We went here as a group of 6 for the mtlatable event. 

Ambiance and decor give a supper club kinda vibe. 
Music was a bit too loud for our liking, as we felt like we had to almost shout to make conversation. 

The proposed menu was quite enticing but as my one word had summed it, what we got was quite inconsistent. 
Portions for the same dishes were uneven which left some of us envious of the bigger portion of others. Taste wise, some mains were delicious (like the gnocchis I had ordered) while others lacked a bit of finesse. My boyfriend had ordered the rib steak and got what seemed like a lovely piece of meat but was disappointed when he cut into huge pieces of a fat cap which should have been trimmed away before grilling. 

Overall, the food we got for the price tag was justified, but this wouldn't be a place I would some back to without a reduced fare menu."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Came here for montreal a la table, small portions but delicious options. Empanada + steak + flan were really good, especially the potato salad !! Tried my partner's salmon however - wouldn't recommend. All in all, good experience"}
{"text":"Went here for our last dinner on a recent trip to Montreal. It was a Monday so the place was pretty quiet - we had walked by it on the previous two nights and it was much more crowded both of those nights - understandable. 
The restaurant's decor is really cool - that's what mostly drew us to it. There are these really neat vintage lamps all over the restaurant. I've been to my fair share of \"hip\" NYC restaurants, but this is definitely one of the top 5 coolest restaurants I've been to.

Food was amazing, prices were extremely reasonable. We got the hanger steak, pumpkin puree, potatoes with goat cheese, and gnocchi. Each dish was done superbly. Though that was a LOT of food for 2 people, we cleaned our plates! 

Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best ambience for a restaurant in Montréal with its superb interior design makes for a great backdrop for dinner. The experience and food is great at a reasonable price. The choices are mainly meat focused, you really should have the steak."}
{"text":"Le cadre est sympa, les produits sont de bonnes qualités. Cependant, le rapport qualité prix n'y est pas. En effet, malgré que la qualité soit là, la quantité raisonnable dans l'assiette n'y est pas. Et je suis loin d'être un ogre ! 
Dans cette établissement, il ne fait pas assez chaud. À ma table de 10 personnes, plus de la moitié des convives ont gardés leur veste durant le repas. 
Comme déjà évoqué, le cadre est sympa et tendance, cependant les sièges où l'on s'installe autour des tables sont horriblement lourds (on a du mal à s'installer correctement à table) et très peu confortable dû à un dossier peu adapté pour manger confortablement. 
Le service est très moyen.
Pour notre table de 10, il y a eu un temps d'attente important pour l'arrivée des premières entrées. Par ailleurs, les entrés et plats ne sont pas arrivés en même temps, ce qui fait que tout le monde n'a pas mangé en même temps. Certains d'entre nous étaient au plat de résistance alors que d'autres seulement aux entrées. Sans compter, qu'une entrée avait été oubliée, ce qui a obligé la personne à manger son entrée après son plat de résistance.
Enfin, la cerise sur le gâteau, une erreur dans l'addition. 150$ (pour deux)au lieu de 108$. Cela est très désagréable,d'autant que cela indique que le serveur n'a pas fait son travail correctement !

Pour conclure:
Joli restaurant proposant de bon produit. Cependant, la température ambiante n'est pas assez chaude, mauvais service, mauvaise coordination de la cuisine, mauvais rapport qualité prix, on est mal installé pour manger.
De ces faits, il y a de en nombreux restaurants à Montréal réunissant bien plus de points positifs pour ne pas aller manger dans cet établissement.

Passer devant, regarder dedans et passer votre chemin."}
{"text":"Just finished a wonderful dinner at L'Atelier d'Argentine, an Argentine contemporary restaurant founded by Natalia Machado (Gusto TV).  Up front, I do not frequent restaurants for their 'celebrity chefs'; I am not a fan of them and I believe many are over rated and over charge for over handled food.  

As a contemporary restaurant don't expect actual Argentine dishes, but rather somewhat westernized versions.  The tag of contemporary offers that license to mix, interchange, and fuse flavors.  Think of it as Argentine light.  This of course is not to say the food is not good.  As a matter of fact, the food is delicious, as is the nice atmosphere they provide including a DJ that mixes in great ambiance without pumping up the volume.  This allowed for proper dinner conversation.

My dinner partner and I had good things to say about the dinner, wine selection, but partially let down on the dessert.

COCKTAIL: Vesper Martini - This was a mix of Vodka, Gin, Lillet.  I'm not a fan of gin, so I did not really enjoy it.  At least I tried it.

WINE: Trivento Malbec
Very nice selection from our great waiter!

Appetizer:
BURRATA DE CAMPO: Creamy burrata, roasted bell pepper, prosciutto chip, Argentinean olive oil
- This cheese is a MUST HAVE if you find it on the menu and it is available as it only lasts two days opened.  It is clean to the pallet and deliciously creamy.  I enjoyed it on bread without the prosciutto chip as it actually overpowered the cheese.  

Main:
Hers: RAVIOLON DE CORDERO: Giant braised lamb ravioli, rustic almond pesto, confit garlic, plum
- Delicious! The pasta was perfect and the taste of the lamb and ingredients were vibrant but not overpowering.  Well plated too.

Mine: OJO DE BIFE: Bifteck de côte / Rib eye
- Cooked to a perfect medium rare that melted in my mouth.  It came with two Argentine salsas but I'm a purist so I did not like them on my steak. 

Sides:
FRITAS DE POLENTA: Crispy polenta fries, chimichurri ketchup
- Very yummy and it was a good substitute for fries.

Dessert:
Hers: A banana crepe and ice cream combination she'd had in Argentina previously so she was expecting something bigger.  The taste was okay but not something she'd recommend.

Mine: A dark chocolate mousse dessert with walnuts and a small biscuit.  This was so delicious, like a flavor party in your mouth!  Strong delightful flavors that won't disappoint.

PRICE:  Reasonable for this type of restaurant, be prepared for about $90-$100 per person on a full meal like the one described above.

SERVICE: Excellent service!
1) The manager came by to explain the concept of the restaurant when I first sat down.  Nice touch.

2) The waiter was well trained, attentive, personable, and knew his product. BRAVO!

3) The bus staff were constantly watching our water glasses and filling them and removing finished plates.

TIPPING POLICY:
This is where I have a very big problem.  The tipping choice on the portable payment machine is listed as:
a) 20%  b) 25% c) 30% d) other

Are you kidding me???  Regular tipping in Canada is 15% (USA 18%+) and more (sometimes less) depending on the service.  I would have happily given 18-20% for this waiter (I did give 20%), he was that good as was the entire experience.  However, it is presumptuous to begin the tip scale at 20%.  If this is the trend of restaurants then clients beware and do not be suggested into giving that much on a regular basis; because once it becomes a habit it becomes the norm.  You have other things to put your hard earned money toward.

Overall Rating 4/5 stars
I would recommend this restaurant...but beware the tipping policy.

{"text":"L'Atelier d'Argentine can best be described as trendy and upscale.  It's located in the Old Port.  I did find the noise level a little high making conversation difficult but I did enjoy my meal here and would want to go back again.  The menu is very meat-centric which is expected for an Argentinian restaurant and they know how to cook it well here.

We started with grilled chorizo sausage which was well-seasoned and had been properly grilled so it had that good, charred taste to it.  To follow it up I had the braised pork belly which had what I believe might have been a balsamic reduction.  The meat was a little drier than expected given how it had been braised.  That being said their was a layer of fat on the cut of meat which had been seared so that it was really crispy and I did enjoy that.  To finish it off I had panqueques which was a dulce de leche crepe stuffed with a sugar burnt banana and milk semifreddo on the side.   The dessert wasn't too sweet and thoroughly enjoyable.

The service here is also worth mentioning.  I found it better than most places.  Our waitress was very attentive, checking back on us frequently and the sommelier was friendly making conversation and everything.  This isn't something you always get here in Montreal and it is very appreciated.  Anyways given my experience at this restaurant I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Zero to negative star.

Service was atrocious. The wait for anything and everything was painfully long. So long 2 tables left before their main course. No consistency in waitstaff and food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I lived in Argentina for a few years so I experienced first hand the deliciousness of Argentine cuisine. I'm disappointed to report that L'Atelier D'Argentine has nothing to do with Argentinian cuisine.

Portions are tiny, the ambiance pretentious and the prices exaggerated. It has nothing to do with a real Argentinian dining experience which is homey, filling, and incredibly delicious.

Go to be seen there and plan for a snack after your meal."}
{"text":"We gave L'Atelier d'Argentine a try for the MTL a Table menu. We got there early so we could try the 5@7 drink specials. They heavily advertise the $6 drinks until 8pm all over the city - what a gimmick. The drinks are only available at the bar. You need to sit at the bar. The bar has maybe a dozen seats. So basically only about 10 or 12 people can enjoy the drink specials. I'll pay the extra $6 to have a full priced drink so that I can enjoy it while I'm comfortably seated. Anyway, the food was good. Between us, we tried pretty much everything on the MTL @ table menu. It was well seasoned and served hot. The timing was a bit wonky with the drinks and the food being out of sync. The food was fairly unremarkable, I mean, a restaurant is supposed to serve edible food that is served at the right temperature so they don't get extra stars for that -  but the thing of distinction was the service. The service was just so strange - the waiter was...what's the term...vacant? I think \"vacant\" is a good term to describe him. He really didn't seem to care. Like, about anything. At all. In life. Or otherwise. If zombies could wait tables, I'm sure the experience would be equivalent (minus the brain eating). He just gave zero sh*ts. He basically threw the food at us and never came back to check and see if everything was fine or if we needed anything. A waitress would come back and check on us time to time and she was nice, but... again, I'm struggling for a term to describe it. Awkward? Yes, she was awkward. It was almost like she knew he didn't care and she was in full on damage control mode. She would take over his tables and... it was just awkward. Anyway, the whole experience was unlike any other I have ever had. I think there are better options for food and better options for service in the area. My recommendation: If you're into weird human experiences, then maybe you'll like this place? Otherwise opt for one of the many other establishments in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been there for MTL à Table, so the restaurant was offering a fixed-$31 menu from which you choose 1 primo plato, 1 segundo plato and a dessert.
Overall, I was quite disappointed. The service was good and quite fast. However, the size of the dishes were impressively small, which even makes me laugh when I saw my dessert. Presenting the meals in very, very big plates doesn't help by the way...
The Empanada Patagonica for the entrance was good, ok but really, I didn't get much chance to fully get the taste of it (too small...).
My main meal consisted in a soup of pumpkin, with different spices, peach and goat cheese. Good, but not impressive I'd say.
The dessert was a little balll of chocolate mousse, surrounded with chocolate crust and some sauce. 
The wine was very good.
Also the music was extremely high, it even put us in a bad mood as we had to shout to hear each other. Even though I asked the waiter to turn it down.
Basically I don't like to write bad reviews, but I think this was clearly overpriced for what we got, especially as I didn't take the meat or fish main dish. It was good, ok, but I didn't go out of this place amazed.
 I understand that in a great restaurant you are not going there to eat too much, but to discover and appreciate, but really this time that was clearly not enough for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose to drive to Montreal for the day and we found this restaurant (the new one in downtown Montreal) and decided to eat there for lunch. We were **mostly enticed by the outside seating trap that was very attractive. My appetizer was delicious and up to par - fried spinach plate. I then ordered Salmon for my entree, but the waitress returned saying that they were out of it. This was at 2 pm on a Saturday. I then ordered the chicken salad. About 45 minutes later we received our food. This was maybe 10 minutes after the waitress finally came over and told us why there was an issue. She did offer another refill of my husband's beer on the house. My salad was extremely sad. It looked and tasted like a salad you could purchase at McDonalds. The \"avocado\" was sparse and diced into cubes and buried beneath the stemmed parts of romaine lettuce. I think they used a quarter of a radish based on how thin they were sliced. The chicken tasted like it was grilled two weeks prior and probably consisted of 6 diced cubes. 

We had a conversation with the hostess and she made us aware that they were severely understaffed and just opened two weeks ago. Well, management of this restaurant - don't open up a restaurant when everything is clearly not ready. I would never recommend this restaurant. The entrees are completely average joe. Don't waste your time in the beautiful city of Montreal and pay über amounts of money for a meal that would cost $8 to make in a quicker amount of time. Sorry, for the harsh review, but get your act together. It's frustrating wasting time waiting for food and then receiving food that a three year old could have made."}
{"text":"Would not go back after what I witnessed: barmaid pulls out a old tub of hellman's mayonnaise which, lo and behold, contains the house's white wine.  She proceeds to refill one of the empty wine bottles right from the tub and places a little wine pourer cap.  Good as new, I guess.

Embarassing.  God knows what happens in the kitchen.

At least don't do it in plain sight in front of customers."}
{"text":"Honestly confused about the negative reviews for this place.  The ambiance is great. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the food, attentive with the water, and extremely friendly. All our food arrived at the same time, and the wait wasn't long. My mom and I got the sea bass/mussels and my dad got the hanger steak and fries. Everything was cooked to perfection. The saffron cream sauce on the sea bass was particularly incredible. Even the bread was exceptional.  And the portion sizes were great!  We left feeling full and satisfied. Legitimately can't think of a negative thing to say about the place, everything they did they did well.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Snuck in for lunch. Really great value for what you get as we tried their lunch combo for $18. My duck appetizer was fantastic and the Cornish hen was great. My wife had the mussels which she really enjoyed. 

Our server Chau was great to deal with as he was courteous, prompt and friendly. Great place for food and they've got a great bar selection as well."}
{"text":"Went there during \"Le chop Mtl\" event and I must say it wasn't bad for a 25$ 3 course menu. Let's start with the ambiance that was very chic and cosy....there is a big fireplace next to the bar and it gives a nice softned light! Overall,the staff is attentive and friendly! The food wasn't bad but they could improve a few things such as the side dishes that where a little borring.I recommend the place for dates or small groups but if you are looking for a gastronomic experience, you might be a little disapointed!"}
{"text":"If i could give  Zero I would . Steak like rubber and I had a side salad that was as if the chef spilt peppercorns over it. The place was loud with music so if your party is more than 2 people you won't hear each other. Worst restaurant experience in the las t 20 years stay away!!! Also too expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"How is it even humanely possible to ruin a steak that much.

The Entraña  was burnt. Tough. And carried and aroma of burnt rubber sneakers. 

The sweet potatoes held their name. They were intensely sweet

And the sauces tasted like grandmas rotten coleslaw 

However. Good service, great tasting water, and fast food times made it Enjoyable .... Until I bit into the steak. 

The smell of people smoking ruins the outdoor meal too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I did not have a pleasant experience at this restaurant and left highly upset, dissapointed, and hungry. I made a reservation at 745 and only received my main course meal at 950 (we had an entree that was served around an hour before the main course meal). On top of this there was a confusion with my entree and I was served an entree that contained sausage which I dont eat. They offered to give me something else but at that point I had waited an hour for an entree and did not want to wait further as we had a show to go to which we needed to be there by 10. When my main meal came (Rib eye 14 oz bone in) it was extremely salty! I left a good portion of my steak behind. At this point I was done as it was a little past 10 and I was not about to send the steak back to wait another hour and continue missing my show. All this to say we got our meal around 950 had the dessert and left by 1015 in order to rush over to our show. The service was horrible, the waitress hardly came to see us. We had to get up to see her. A man who came to serve us our main course apologized for the wait and offered a drink however I do bot believe that is enough to compensate. Unfortunately the night that I had planned for my boyfriends birthday was ruined by this establishment by poor service, long wait times, poor food quality which is not worth the price. We went to go have pizza later on. Would definately not recommend."}
{"text":"Très belle place avec une bonne localisation non loin du vieux port de Montréal.
Décoration très classe et chic.
Service de très bonne qualité.
La nourriture du brunch était très raffinée et de bonne qualité."}
{"text":"C'était un moment vraiment agréable !!!! 
Un mercredi soir avec 3 amis, le restaurant était assez vide, on a donc été servi rapidement. 

Les plats étaient raffinés, assaisonnés à merveille, bien présentés et délicieux. Le restaurant fermait à minuit donc on a pu profité tranquillement de notre soirée sans être pressé. L'éclairement faible et la musique donnait une ambiance chic mais à la fois décontractée. J'ai choisi le ravioli géant à l'agneau avec sa sauce pesto, c'était un délice. Mes amis ont commandés les short ribs, le faux filet (une vraie portion) et le bar, ils ont également été conquis. 

Dommage qu'ils mettent plus de glaçons que de cocktails dans leurs drinks (virgin mojito) et qu'ils se pressent pour que l'on commande bien qu'il n'y ait personne."}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday morning brunch.  I was very impressed by the quality of the meal.  My friend and I ended up sharing Huevos Benedictos and Panqueques, which is a dulce de leche stuffed crepe.  Both were delicious.  Quite possibly one of the best benedicts I've had.  I think my favorite part of brunch here though is the bottomless mimosas or bloody mary's/caesar.  It was a build your own bloody bar with choice of regular tomato juice or clamato.  This was the only brunch restaurant I went to while in Montreal with the choice of a Bloody Mary instead of Caesar.  My friend had the mimosa and they set up a bottle of champagne and carafe of OJ next to the table.  Perfect spot for drunch ;)"}
{"text":"Keep away!
Went with my girlfriend as a Tuango promotion : 95$ for 2 people.

Promotion promised an argentian bottle of wine...the waitress states that they've ran out already, so they offered us a cheap bottle of autralian wine. I should have taken this as a bad sign right away of what was to come.

Entrees looked like cosco-style fried entrees. Empanadas was the only good thing.

Dinner options not the same as the ones in regular menu. 
We both chose the Hanger stake...was very hard to chew. Very bad quality of meat.

They offered us desert on the house to compensate...only 1 desert to share was offered, and to boot, we were told there was no more coffee (it was 8pm on a Friday night...are you kidding me?)
What kind of MIckey MOUse operation is this joint running...
CLIENTS ARE PAYING HARD EARNED MONEY, OFFER THEM THE QUALITY THEY DESERVE!"}
{"text":"This Argentine steakhouse, situated in the former DNA space, has a lounge/bar space as well as a beautiful dining room. The lounge/ bar space utilizes large light fixtures and brick as the main focus points for that area whereas the dining space combines wood, metal and glass with more subtle lighting to create a intime but very striking feel.

Now, before I enter into the meal itself, I need to spend a moment discussing a big sticking point from this dinner fwhich was the overall service. Now, I rarely have a issue with service at a restaurant and will generally let minor things go. However, in this case, the meal was almost completely derailed from the start. We made our presence known to the hostess and were told that the table wasn't ready yet. We would need to wait a few moments - no issue there, given the late time of our reservation. After 15 minutes of standing in the entrance way and a few of the other parties waiting around with us getting seating, the same hostress asks us if we had been helped yet. Oh boy.... informed that we had presented ourselves prior, she found out that the party at our table still hasn't paid yet, so she offers us a seat at the dining room bar in the meanwhile.

We sit at the bar where none of the dining room staff had been made aware of our situation because we sat for 15 minutes without anyone bothering to come serve us. One of my friends actually got up and went to speak to a waiter so that we could get a drink menu. We finally ordered drinks but we got our table before they came - a full 40 minutes after our original reservation time. Now thankfully the cocktail I had - their signature Diplomatico Old Fashion - was excellent and one I definitely will try to make myself but I had hoped to have it much sooner.

Finally at the table, we started with the two appetizers available on the Taste MTL menu. First up, smoked trout glazed with maple, raspberry and arugula. Very simple but well executed dish - the sweetness of the maple mixed well with the bitter arugula and the slight sourness of the raspberries. The 2nd dish was roasted beet, green onion and young goat cheese with roasted garlic oil. Once again, a successful plate - simple but well done. 

At this point, having had the wine list taken away from us for some reason despite our stated intend to order a bottle, we got it back and ordered a bottle of white. The waiter was surprisingly unable to give us an opinion on the bottle we had in mind but at least was honest enough to admit his lack of knowledge about that particular bottle. We were presented the bottle but told it is warm so the waiter will chill it for us. I like the honesty but why exactly was this bottle of white wine warm in the first place? Again, a very weird and disappointing service instance between our courses.

The mains came through next. We ordered both Taste MTL options as well as an extra one off the regular menu. The taste MTL options were pan seared duck filet with grilled orange, fennel &amp; shallot salsa; and a semi-smoked flank steak with buttery potatoes and chimichurri. The duck was excellent - perfectly cooked to the right temperature. The fennel and shallot salsa was delicious and complemented the fatty duck well. The roasted orange also added a nice element. The flank steak was okay - the interior was perfect temp but the exterior was a little too chard which made the meat tougher than it really was. The potatoes were plain but the chimichurri was outstanding.

From the main menu, we went with the pan seared Chilean sea bass with a ripe mango, roasted bell pepper &amp; arugula salad. The sea bass was seared well but surprisingly lacking of any punch of flavour. I assume that it is to offset the very flavourful salad which was wonderful. Great use of mango and peppers to add sweetness to the dish.

For dessert, we went with the two Taste MTL options - Lemon flatbread and basil sorbet; Sponge cake with cream, dulce de leche and peach - as well as one of the regular menu, the almendrado which is an almond crusted vanilla glace with a dark chocolate syrup and sugar cookie. The flatbread was good but relatively forgotten especially when compared to its companion the sorbet. The basil sorbet was possibly the best thing I had all night. Perfect texture and great balance of flavour - the basil is strong but not overwhelming to taste. The sponge cake dish was solid across the board but not particularly memorable. The almendrado was a very unique take - almost a deconstructed Haagen-Dazs bar - that worked pretty well.

Overall, the evening was a mixed bag. I loved the setting and the general ambience of the space - very much the kind of experience I like from the Old Port. The drinks and food were solid as well despite a few minor quips. However, it is hard to overlook the poor service we received throughout the meal. In the end, I would be willing to return because the regular menu interests me enough to give the service another shot.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Très satisfait de ma soirée à l'Atelier. On a bien mangé, les plats étaient solides, de qualité, le service attentif, enjoué. L'ambiance est décontractée mais ça reste un restaurant. Carte des vins correcte avec IP, dont un Malbec très abordable et satisfaisant de la maison Septima.

La formule 3 plats à 23$ est un très bon deal, mais je comprends que c'est pour une durée limitée."}
{"text":"Thank god it was a 25$ menu from Le Chop event! I guess this event was created to help the restaurant(s) during the dead season and to have people discover these restaurants as well. This place didn't make much of an effort to impress. We were four unimpressed customers at this restaurant.

From missing components to badly executed dishes, we were disappointed. Two of the dished had watercress and pretty much the same dressing. The chowder my husband ordered said to have a chorizo powder. It was cut into small chunks and fried to a crisp that was so hard Felix thought some rocks had fallen into the soup. The smoked Cornish hen was so salty (along with the salad that came with if) that i had a hard time finishing it. My husband's hanger steak had to be returned twice before they \"almost\" got it right. He asked for rare but it came back blue. He kept it because he was so hungry and that our table had finished eating. Coming from an Argentinian restaurant, we thought that they lack the expertise. The caramelized apple with crêpe, mascarpone and salted caramel (burnt!) was tasteless and dry. I had a bite and that was it. The only good thing was really the vanilla ice cream and the stuffed baked potato on the steak dish.

Service was good. Yay!!! Wine was well suggested. Double yay!!! Will we return or do we recommend? Absolutely NOT!"}
{"text":"Overprice, annoying overbearing server, expensive and steak was over-salted.  

Entree of warmed thinly sliced scallops were very nice. 

Ribeye steak was tasty enough, but more than just marbled - fairly fatty.

Place was empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I give this place a 4 star because the atmosphere was really beautiful. The food is good but not 5 stars. 
They serve you water right away. 
I should mention I came on Valentine's Day so there was a fixed menu. 
My hubby and I didn't want the scallop soup so they gave us a beet soup instead. 
The NY strip steak was good but there was too much fat on it. 
As for atmosphere, there was a live saxophonist and violinist. And they seated us right next to the fire place which added to the romance. 
I would like to come back just to see what the regular menu is like. 

I came back for a second time to this resto. The first time was not as good because there was a fixed menu. This time I ordered really good stuff! Beef empanadas and cauliflower cream soup for appetizers. The rib eye steak 12oz for the main course. It was a filling portion even if I was very hungry, it's lean, but also pricey. For dessert we got the chocolate peacan with cookie (don't remember what it was called). These were all delicious and 5 star options. Our waiter, Olivier, offered exceptional service."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch yesterday. Let me preface the review by saying that it is not a 3-star because it was mediocre, but rather it was mediocre for the price.

The location and physical space of the restaurant is lovely--located in the heart of Old Port. I ended up going with eggs benny--one of my go-to breakfast options. It is served with purple potatoes, fruit, and a salad. It ended up costing over $20 with a coffee and I just found it to be expensive for a meal that was pretty standard. 

I was here for a group breakfast and I will say I thought they did a great job at serving a large group smoothly and efficiently!"}
