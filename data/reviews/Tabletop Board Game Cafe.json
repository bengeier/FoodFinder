{"text":"My husband and I discovered this wonderful place from a leaflet somewhere. We decided to go and check it out, because the whole concept sounds awesome.

We came in, got a small table, and started playing. We had just come from dinner where we stuffed ourselves, and I originally felt bad that we were not buying any food or drink (so stuffed that I could hardly drink any water) but they didn't harass us for any food or didn't constantly ask us if we needed any drinks/refills on our water, which would have caused me to feel pressured into ordering. Eventually I did order a delicious dessert, which was a bit on the pricey side for the size but dude, 1,000 games that you can play for the whole day for $5! I'm okay with a bit of price, considering you don't have to order anything at all

The guy who helped us (sadly I cannot remember what his name was) was very nice, laid back, and had plenty of recommendations for us. Like I said, he kept back, leaving us to our own devices when we wanted, and knew when we needed help and always helped us. 


Overall, I would totally recommend this place over and over. My only regret is that I am just visiting Cleveland for my anniversary and probably won't be back for awhile. Otherwise I would be at this place every weekend."}
{"text":"Everybody loves games, right? That's why, in my opinion, Tabletop is a great place for really any group to come and have a great time. I've been countless times, from groups ranging in size from 2 to 10, and each time have received the same welcome, wonderful service and had a blast playing games. They have a wide variety of games ranging from the classic games (Monopoly, Guess Who, etc.) to heavy strategy and plenty in between. The table fee is more than reasonable, where else can you have hours of fun with your friends for $5 a person? The food is fresh and delicious, the beer selection is wide and diverse and they have some really fun mixed drinks as well. It's just an all around great place to spend some time in Ohio City."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found Tabletop! For $5 (only five dollars!! for as long as you want to play! I can't believe people think this is expensive!), you get unlimited access to nearly 1000 games, ranging from childhood games (remember Don't Break the Ice?) to complicated strategy games (like Settlers of Catan). The service is good, the desserts are delicious (I've never had any of the food though, so I can't speak to that). Anytime we have questions or want to learn a new game, Joshua is there with an idea and an encyclopedic knowledge of the rules. Considering how expensive board games are, a place like this is a treasure! They do get busy on weekend nights, so go early, call ahead, or be willing to wait a bit at a nearby bar. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Such a unique and cool places for anyone in their 20s-30s but also 10s-9000's. The servers are great at teaching and pushing you to try new games. Always a good time."}
{"text":"Joshua was absolutely amazing! He was so personable and helpful and funny. First time ever coming here and I will deff be back for the the whole experience, food drinks games and staff! It's a unique cute fun place. A hidden gem honestly"}
{"text":"We saw this establishment in the official visitors guide to Cleveland. It was listed as one of the top three things to do in the Ohio city neighborhood. 
 
We went there to kill some time before dinner and ended up staying several hours enjoying new games and local brews.

Firstly, we need to give a shout out to the gentleman running the front of the cafe. There was another employee in the kitchen but this bearded fellow was superb. Unfortunately, we don't remember his name but he made this experience, along with the games and brews, special. 

When we arrived around a quarter to six on a Thursday night, we were the only ones. After he explained how the joint works which is each person pays a type of cover fee of 5 dollars to play as many games as long as they want. He took our beer orders after explaining the menu, and then helped us find new games. 

We weren't looking to play the regular board games we all grew up playing. We wanted to play something new. With his excellent knowledge of all the games, he selected perfect choices for two players in various degrees of difficulty. We found every choice to be easy to learn with his help, and extremely fun. 

After spending several hours, drinking a few beers, and playing various new games, we came to the conclusion that this place was perfect to try new things. It would be as it was for us, a great date night to play new games, have some laughs, and some local brews. We can also see a group of friends having a memorable time. And with over a thousand games to play, there should be plenty of games for every age group to spend hours here. 

We would certainly recommend tabletop to anyone visiting Cleveland and definitely to anyone living in the area."}
{"text":"Such a fun place with the nicest owners and witty staff. Highly recommended to all. Local? Make it a fun new place to call your local joint.  Visiting Cleveland? Make a stop here.  Great concept."}
{"text":"This is their second time there and we had just as much fun the second time as we did the first. There are so many games to choose from it can be a bit overwhelming. But our server chose several for us and explained how to play each game.  We had a great time. The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is laid-back and fun. It's a great way to spend an evening with friends and family. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a gem! Not only is the price right for the games ($5 per person, all day), but they had a fantastic selection, well categorized, so you can figure out how much time you want to sit trying to learn a new game. The food was also incredible! I had low expectations thinking it would be more about the games, but I gobbled up every bite. The staff members were also very friendly and helpful. We can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"One of my friend took note of this place as it striked his fancy: games were involved. 

He mentioned that this was one of the top board game cafes he has been to in a long time. He visited the area from New Orleans for a week and came here bc the people made him feel welcomed. Brady took the time to teach him new board games and the rest of the workers had a really positive attitude. 

If you ask, they will take time to help you with the rules for learning new games. The next time you feel like you need a place to hang out to \"save the world\" or capture the \"spy\" in your group of friends, check out Tabletop Board Game Cafe. They made the week visit to Cleveland one to remember. :)"}
{"text":"As someone who really enjoys board games, I've been eagerly waiting for a chance to check this place out.  I came away really impressed.  The guy serving us was very helpful.  He even set up and cleaned up our game for us and explained how to play so we didn't have to read the directions.  I love that they have a wide selection of beverages and foods to choose from.  We had just come from lunch, so I can't really comment on the food.  It's nice that they have it available though.  I also really liked the weird d√©cor.  I love that angler fish wall hanging/light fixture.  There is no cover charge before 3:00pm (at least on Fridays), which was just a bonus for us.  There is also a maker space in the back where they do classes and workshops."}
{"text":"I love tabletop. Shiva is so nice. The wait staff is so nice, informative and attentive to everyone. Some will play games with customers and actually take the time to explain them. They have hundreds of board games to pick from - most I've never even heard of. They're so much fun though. I had the white wine smoothie and it tasted amazing. I forgot there was even alcohol in it because it just tasted like a smoothie. They could use more or different beer choices though but the food is also good especially the coffee pudding dessert."}
{"text":"I can't fairly judge Tabletop, so I am giving it the average 3 stars. While the idea and concept of this place is great. The manageability of people waiting to play and the people finishing play has not been mastered. Rick and I got here before our friends and it was explained to us that they couldn't give us an exact time of the wait for the table, but they took my number and said they'd call. We go down the street order a beer and 5 min later they call and say a table is opening up be back in 5. We chug our beers, walk back down only to find there is in fact still no one leaving. We didn't get to play, and chances are we won't be back. 
Maybe for the busy weekends you should have a time schedule to sign up for. You can continue past your time if no one else is waiting for your table. Don't know how else this would work."}
{"text":"I had a pretty A-OK time here. 

While a really good idea for families, this made for a questionable weekend spot because it was strangely quiet when we came in and games make already-loud drunk people even louder. I felt like we were disrupting everyone the whole time we were here. 

The cover charge is a little strange, especially when you're likely going to spend money on drinks and food anyways. I think if they restructured this payment system, I'd be more likely to come back. Something like if you buy 2 drinks, the cover is waived."}
{"text":"Having already been to a place similar in Hudson, OH I was expecting a similar environment. This little place in Ohio City blew me away! Walking in, the decorations were so inviting and really made the place special. I loved taking pictures around the place. They had an abundance of games, compared to the other place I have been. The staff was very friendly and not too over powering when it came to stopping by your table. The bathrooms were very clean, which was nice to see. The menu features so very interesting things such as kombucha! I had eaten before, otherwise would have tried some food. The pricing was great. I would reccomend for all ages."}
{"text":"Tabletop was one of those places I stumbled upon accidentally; the type of place I didn't even realize I HAD to visit until I knew it existed. 

My wife grew up in a family of board game playing fiends - they played the classics, but also a ton of board games I can't even remember all the names of. I knew I had to take her here, as she loves games, so we headed down one fine Saturday afternoon and we were amazed! 

$5 per person is tacked on to your bill to cover access to the games - which is unlimited! We and others around us sat for hours playing games and just ordering food as needed. They had every type of game we could think of! As far as food goes, it was also really good (tip: if you like mac and cheese, get it here. It's diabolical!).

Now that all being said, there were a few downsides: namely that we were two people and most of the games need at least 3, if not 4, to be playable. We weren't able to find many games that we liked for just two people, so I'd highly recommend going to one of their game nights or out with a group or double date here, as you may get bored (hah!) with just two people. Some of the games were also missing pieces (pencils in some games that needed writing or scorecards in others) and could use with updating. We played a Friends trivia game that had seen much, much, better days. 

However, none of that detracts from the awesome time we had here. It was such a different date for us and we had an amazing time!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get more brilliant than a coffee shop-board games business model (why didn't I think of that?) Their selection of games is quite impressive, as well as their menu. I love that not only do they have great coffee selection but a great drink selection too ...(if your having one of those kind of days, if you can pick up what I'm puttin down). Its just a great idea if you are sometimes just sick of getting a drink at the bar and sitting there. I was always concerned (in a good way) why their basic sandwiches were so good. I mean, it was literally just buffalo chicken sandwiches and I couldn't put it down! Like what did you put it in that I haven't came across it in life yet? Will come again to get to the bottom of this :)"}
{"text":"I can safely say I have no desire to waste my time going back here again unless there's some sort of overhaul in management or something. 

while i realize Saturday nights in -ugh- Ohio City are busy and every place is pretty packed, it was the poor reception and planning of the staff that have ruined it for me. 

it was raining pretty good when Danielle and I arrived on Saturday night and we were told by bearded, hipster host that he \"wasn't sure how long, but it was going to be a while\" until they could seat our table for 6. understandable, it's Saturday and this place is apparently new and cool. so Danielle and I walked down the street to various bars until we got to the Market Garden Brewery a short while later as it was the only place with 2 seats at the bar. so we're about 10 minutes since being told our way was going to be \"a while\" when we order 2 beers and Danielle gets called that our table \"is ready.\" So, Danielle called Erin and told her to just go straight there and get the table. We quickly finished our beers and talked back to Tabletop, in the rain, now joined by Jaime and Maggie. when we got to Table top, soaked, were told it might be another 5 minutes because the group at the table they were giving to us had just paid their bill and were finishing their game. OK, again, no big deal, but our table is NOT ready. hipster beard host then tells us to have a walk around and look at the games and pick one out. so we did. we walked around for at least 15 minutes and not only did the group at \"our\" table not leave, they started a new, different game. 

at that point we were all kinda sick of the nonsense and decided to try somewhere else. 

i hate Ohio City and i don't care to go back to Tabletop which is a shame because I was hoping to have a great time and recommend it to coworkers as an option for one of our monthly team-building Engineering Days."}
{"text":"Tabletop deserves five stars for sure. Every time I go here I have a fantastic time. The food is delicious, the drinks are creative, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and there are plenty board games to play! It is my favorite date spot and I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to try something new and fun!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to go and play board games. Josh specifically is an incredible host and does a great job suggesting board games based on your number of people, time you want to play, how drunk you are, etc.."}
{"text":"This place is fun. I've come here multiple times and always had a good time with my friends. Unfortunately I always feel a little ripped off after coming here. It's $5 for all you can play games, per person. And although my friends and I spent 2-3 hours having a good time playing games something about it just didn't seem like I got my money's worth. 

The food was not good. It took upwards of 45 minutes for them to make a simple panini, which ended up half cooked on the inside. The service is slow and when you ask what beers they have you get the response of \"a dark one, a light one, and an IPA\". Normally this service wouldn't bother me so much but when you charge me the $5 to play games I expect to get a really good experience."}
{"text":"I don't remember how I first heard about this place, but when my board-game-loving husband and I found ourselves about five minutes away, right at opening time, with absolutely nothing on our schedule for the rest of the day, we knew the time had come to visit.  It was a bit awkward at first, as we were obviously the first people in and we had no idea what we were doing, but after confessing our newb-ness to the staff guy we quickly found ourselves set up at a table with fast-refilling water and makeshift coasters and a zillion board games to choose from.

Since we ourselves own and play a lot of board games, we made sure to choose only ones we'd either never heard of or not yet had a chance to play elsewhere, with mixed results.  Games that were awesome included Splendor and Jaipur, while on the other end of the spectrum we found ourselves with a weird zombie deck-building game with a terrible instruction manual or terrible gameplay or, more likely, both.  On the plus side, once we realized it was bad we were able to put it right back on the shelf and try out something new!

We spent about four hours checking out various awesome games, and so when we got hungry in the middle of that we took advantage of the happy hour specials to get a tasty-sounding appetizer.  It was definitely tasty, but also teensy, and didn't seem worth even the discounted price.  We would probably have had better luck with a regular sandwich, but we were too cheap to order one that day.  Next time, perhaps?

Food woes aside, this is definitely a fun place to come spend several hours and absolutely worth the $5/person cover charge to check out the huge variety of games that is hard to come by in the demo section of a regular game store.  I will definitely be back on a future Cleveland visit, probably with a few more friends in tow!"}
{"text":"Every week they host the best trivia in Cleveland. Tons of board games, and a great selection of food and drinks."}
{"text":"The games are top notch! 5 bucks to play as many games as you wish or ask one of the staff to recommend a favorite! There are over 1000 titles! They even have game gurus to help you learn something new! The food is awesome and super yummy. Craft beer or spirited cocktail to help liven your experience!"}
{"text":"Spent Saturday evening here. $5 for all you can play, which may seem pricey to some but you can't do anything for that price (bowling, movies, davenbusters, ice skating, bands, etc) So it is really a good deal and with unlimited fun and no time limit it was totally worth it. Time flew by, 5 hours later it was midnight. Great atmosphere, wine smoothies and games. Doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"My entire group enjoyed the food choices and were very impressed by the game selections. We found the prices very fair  and the staff friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We came here on a late Saturday afternoon for the first time.  We're pretty big into board gaming, so we were excited to hear about the cafe.  The building is really nicely done-chairs are comfortable, tables are a good size.  Staff is very friendly.  You pay a $5 fee to play unlimited games for the day, which is a really good price.  The selection of games is solid.  A lot of older school games-the kind you had as a kid and mom kept.  Forgotten treasures of fun.  They have a decent selection of games for more \"hard core\" gamers.  There are a few things that I really loved about this place.  They have the games all labeled with amount of players, level of difficulty, what type of format the game is in-which is very helpful, especially if you're not sure what you're looking to get into.  Second, the staff was very helpful.  They are available to help if you need it, but if you're comfortable with games and instructions, they don't hover over you. The other patrons all were friendly, and it was nice to see a variety of ages.  The drink menu is a few beers, some smoothies, pop-nothing really notable, but you're probably not there for the beverages anyhow.  It will be a good place to spend a cold winter day-close to some really cool restaurants, but not smack dab downtown.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love introducing friends to this place, no one would ever expect to go out to play boardgames! It's nerdy, its stilly, its always a great time!

Pros: The price is $5 and you can play as many games as you want (they have +1000 on site). Whenever I go, we alway ask the 'game masters' for recommendations of games and try something new each time, it's a great way to find new things without paying $30 to buy the game. On top of that they have food and booze so no need to find a bar afterwords. 

Cons: The wait on weekends can be over an hour wait for a table because of limited space and they don't take reservations, I have called ahead and they said it would be a 45 min wait, but if I arrived in 45 min they should have a table ready. 

Love this place and will be back soon to try some new games!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Go anytime, grab some friends and try out a game you've been wanting to try.  The sandwich was average, but the coffee was good."}
{"text":"My friend who is living in Cleveland temporarily for work suggested a group of 4 of us come here - and it was probably one of the most special, unique, and fantastic places I've been in a long time.

The concept is simple: a board game cafe. With 1000+ games, a wide drink (alcoholic and non) menu, and a decent array of food options, Tabletop Board Game Cafe has my heart. We waited for about 10-15 minutes for a table to open up, but once we were seated, it was so much fun. The entire staff was warm, welcoming, fun, and knowledgable. 

Everything from the organization of the games, to the set up of the space, to the DIY/fun vibe - it was just a great place to spend a chilly Saturday night.

The food wasn't anything to write home about (although my spiked apple cider was delicious), but I respect their effort to produce food at all. The $5 cover is totally respectable and all things considered, affordable, because you can stay as long as you want and play as many games as you want.

I desperately want Tabletop to come to Philly :)"}
{"text":"So I've never been here before. My friends usually dictate where I go when I'm in town because I went to Ohio State in Columbus and stuck around after graduation so with that being said, I don't usually know what Cleveland has to offer on the weekends.

We came here first but had to ask for a table for 5 people. They said it would be about a 45 min to an hour wait so we went over to Town Hall to kill some time (Separate review for that later)

What I didn't know was that it was a $5 fee to play unlimited games since I wasn't a member (But we played more than a couple so it was well worth it). The selection is mind-boggling. Most well-known titles are here along with at least another hundred or 2 you've never heard of. They're categorized based on levels of understanding and how long they could potentially take to play. finish, or learn. Luckily, when it came to us learning a new game, the staff was very good at explaining how the game (Takenoko) actually worked.

Service was great considering the place was fully packed! I got a red wine smoothie, which was not something I'd recommend but everything else about this place is pretty worth it. The 4/5 stars is really only because of the one drink I ordered (was trying to save money). I wish I could have given 4.5/5 stars but alas! 

The noise level is pretty average/low so it goes over pretty well. 

The best thing is that we were there for the Saturday before Easter Sunday and they had this special where non-members can buy an egg for $1 (he added it to my tab) and I bought 2. I got a free sandwich and free coffee for 2 dollars!

If I understood correctly, membership works by paying $25 and you get 5 free play cards (Basically the membership pays for itself). And then for every visit you don't use the cards like if you choose not to or use them all up, visits are discounted to $3.50 (I think) for the rest of the year."}
{"text":"I am into games and fortunately so is my family. My wife and I went here for a date night and had a good time. This place is similar, but different to The Malted Meeple in Hudson, Ohio.

Both offer a huge selection of game. Both require a five dollar table fee per person. Both have knowledgeable staff to teach you new games. And both offer refreshments.

The cafe is different from Malted Meeple through the game selection. The cafe has a lot more mainstream games. i.e. Monopoly, Connect Four, etc. The cafe also has a great selection of European games, however many of the patrons we saw came to play the mainstream games.  We prefer to play games that we do not own. We asked the staff for suggestions. They asked us what types of games we have played and what type of games we like. From these questions they brought us four games. We played two of the games and found them enjoyable. We would not go out and purchase the games, but that is what makes both the cafe and Malted Meeple great. You can try games and be taught how to play the games without purchasing a game that in the end you may not have wanted to purchase.

The cafe does offer meals, which is awesome! They also offer a nice selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. The Malted Meeple only offers snacks and similar types of beverages.

We went on Saturday around 8pm. It was not crowded, but it quickly filled up If you go with more than two, you will want to go early to insure you get a table for your group."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out and play board games. Costs $5 a person to play but you don't have to play. We came in for lunch and the food was amazing! Kind of a long wait for the food to arrive (40 minutes+) but if we had been playing games we might not have noticed it. Food is 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome place to spend a cold winter night! Employees are very knowledgeable about the games. Menu has delicious drink, snacks and sandwich selection. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"What a cool and refreshing concept! When i first heard of Tabletop i knew i had to try it. Not everybody wants to party every weekend including me. So why not go out with friends or go alone and meet new friends and play board games! When they say they have over 1000 games they are not lying. Out of all those games, I may have known how to play 3. However, they will actually sit down and teach you if you are looking to learn. They do have a decent size menu of food and drinks.  I had a glass of wine and played Connect 4. I really like this place. I can't wait to bring my friends here."}
{"text":"Incredibly fun, casual, friendly atmosphere with unlimited board games to play. Perfect for either a date night or a group of friends, they have beer, smoothies, and sandwiches, small bites. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much a nerds paradise. There is every single game you could imagine? here, they have trivia, delicious beer, ?and food! This place always has a good scene, friendly staff, ?and hot coffee.  

Great place for a second date, friend night or gathering for pretty much any occasion?. Everything is pretty funky and gives you a lot to talk about. 

I highly recommend? coming to the trivia night with a group of your smartest? friends. The competition? is fierce and the laughs are loud!"}
{"text":"I have been to Tabletop several times now, and always have a good experience.

The food is reasonably priced, especially for being on W 25th. The orange and goat cheese appetizer is bright and delicious, and the Club Awesome sandwich is truly awesome. They don't have as wide of a selection of beers as some of the other bars on the strip, but they do have a good selection, and the draft beer list is different almost every time I'm in there, so there's something for everyone.

The main thing is the games. There are so many, and a huge variety. The staff are always willing to teach games. Brady is awesome and very helpfully taught my group how to play Camel Up, which we loved.

It gets a little loud on Friday and Saturday nights, so if you're with a group trying to play a very involved strategy game, I might recommend going on a weeknight, as you'll likely have more space and also an easier time focusing on your game. 

I learned a lot of games I would not have expected to play here; I usually play strategy games, but I've learned some quicker games that are extremely fun. $5 per person is definitely a reasonable value for an activity like this. It offers a nice change of pace, something to do besides just go out for food or drinks or to the movies. Great for groups or a date night."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place while visiting Cleveland. We met the owners and they are totally great. They serve all kinds of great snacks, beer, wine and all kinds of different drinks. They have a great many board games and the staff is more then will to teach. This was great fun for our whole family."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to have a good time. The amount of different board games available is ridiculously large! Great selection of wine and beers too! Plus, the staff is super friendly. Josh, our server, was amazing and suggested great games for us to try :)"}
{"text":"Had so much fun here and the prices are very affordable. This is a gem in ohio city and the concept is genius. Will be back."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! I wish I lived in Cleveland, because I would live here.

It's a cafe for playing games. The idea is so simple, but it works so well.

When you enter, you pay $10 a piece for unlimited use of their games. This is worth it, because the selection is huge. I got to try games I've wanted to, like Sushi Go, and games I didn't even know about, like Cthulu Pandemic. The staff will help explain how to set up games you haven't played before and they really know their stuff.

The food selection is fine. The sandwiches try to be something a cut above and, while I'd never come here for the food alone, I did enjoy the food enough to want to order more. The avocado sandwich was tasty.

The drinks are better. There's alcohol, which is definitely a great thing. They had an alcoholic orange creamsicle with a scoop of ice cream floating in it. I absolutely died. The beer selection tends toward the craft and local beers, which is admirable on a moral level, but that means it's heavy on ales than on lagers and wits. It's a perfectly fine selection of beers.

I went on trivia night and that is the only thing I did not like. The trivia was a distraction from my games. I like trivia and I like games, but I kind of want to do one or the other. Additionally, the questions were difficult in a way that felt less challenging and more irritating. If I get to go again and trivia is happening, I will ignore it and keep playing games.

If you enjoy playing games, this is the best gaming establishment I've ever seen, hands down."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, however our service was atrocious. After twenty minutes my friend and I set a timer for our server to do check ups - 30 minutes after the fact we became fed up and decided to leave. No checkups, water, or asking if we needed anything else. Honestly had it only been"}
{"text":"Really unique place. So many game options and the staff takes the time to teach you the rules and recommend games. Stopped in with a friend on a weeknight. Nice selection of craft beer to enjoy. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun. I absolutely love playing board games... So this is the perfect place to get coffee and games. 

The location is great. You can find a ton of parking around. And the place is beautiful! Tons of wood and pallets. The place is so bright and open. I think it would be so much fun to have a party there! 

The concept is fantastic! So original. It's just a different place to go. It's more interactive. And the employees are willing to teach you how to play the games. That is awesome. 

There were a couple areas that brought it down 2 stars. 
(I'm sorry! I really want to give you 5 stars)

First, there is a five dollar cover. So every person in the group automatically pays $5 to play the games. I understand the idea and need for a cover, but we were paying an additional $10-$15 in food for each person... So it gets pricy. 
I would recommend a deal - maybe free games if you spend $15 in food/drinks? Or just a flat $10 per party?

The food is okay. I really like my grilled Munster and Jam sandwich, but the turkey club was kinda boring. The cookies also tasted like they were store bought from a box :(

Overall. I will definitely go back. It's a fun/chill date night. Or would be great for a group of friends.
I hope that I can change my review soon and give more stars!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to board game cafes when I lived in Asia all the time so I was beyond excited to find one here! It's only $5 to play for as long as you want which makes it a great and inexpensive way to spend a day with friends. They have just about any game you could think of, advertised at about 1000+ games, as well as a pretty decent happy hour. Totally worth checking out with some friends."}
{"text":"Well hello there, new favorite place in Ohio City! I never had any idea board games were such a culture. I think i'm into it.

Tabletop is a true gem, and a refreshing addition to Cleveland. I went for a game night with a group of my intergenerational sorority sisters, and it was the most fun we've had in a while. We went on a rainy Thursday night, and we nearly had the place to ourselves. You will pay a $5.00 play fee, regardless of the night, which tacks on your bill at the end. We also ordered some beers, root beer floats and hard root beer floats.

I fell in love instantly. Here's why:

- The interior is plain old fun. It looks like someone went to a vintage shop and bought as many oddball paintings as possible. Accompanied with cool lighting and reclaimed wood furniture, you feel at home right away.

 - The crowd in Tabletop is so diverse and awesome. Families, friends, singles, couples, grandparents, all ages and skill/interest levels. People are very respectful of each other, and its not terribly loud.

- Board games galore! Play something you know in your 1st round (we chose Cards Against Humanity), and try something new when you're burnt out (we chose a mystery game, SpyFall). There are countless shelves of game options, organized by both alphabet and concept (TV/movie, Abstract, Strategy), etc. 

Our server was very knowledgable at providing a general overview of most games. Can't wait to go back again and play something new and a little wacky!"}
{"text":"It's not a paradox. Introverts like to go out too, and this is the perfect place for them.
This is a nice low-key gathering place to hang out and unwind with a group of friends. There's a very large selection of games, conveniently sorted by category.  They have everything from party games, to word games, to trivia, to strategy.  Whether you want to try something new, or stick to a well-known classic, everything is here.  They have a nice beer list, and some pretty good snack food and deserts.

One minor issue that we ran into was that many of the games didn't seem to have instructions.  When the place isn't busy, the servers can help you out; but on a busy Saturday night, there were only 2 or 3 servers, and they looked pretty busy fulfilling orders.  We ended up looking up the instructions on my smart phone, which was fine, but I can see how some people could be frustrated by this."}
{"text":"Took my lil one here and got our game on.  It was happy hr so the 5 draft beers were all 3 bux which is nice.  Would like to see a better variety of style and ABV but it did the trick.  Select apps were discounted too but I didn't try any.  Next time.  Its 5.00 and you can play your ass off all day if ya want.  Pretty much every game I have ever heard of.  The place is decorated cool too.  Not hip and douchy like the rest of 25th now.  Only thing is I wish the 5.00 was discounted at happy hr too because that was most of the cost of the bill.  There were only 2 other people playing games in there when we were there.  I would go more often but 10.00 to walk in the door seems a tad high when the place is empty..."}
{"text":"Great quick experience! We had about 45 minutes to kill before meeting up with our gaming group and decided to stop by Tabletop Board Game Cafe to get a feel for the place. Having only 45 minutes before we had to leave we just grabbed a quick beer from the 5 on tap and several bottle/can offerings of craft brews. A decent selection. Took a look at their library which had a great selection of new and retro games. Made some small talk with one of the workers and explained we were playing games that night with our group and he asked what we would be playing. Was very knowledgable of all the games we listed like Fury of Dracula, Run, Fight or Die and Mysterium. In fact having never played Mysterium he set up and taught us quickly so that when we played later in the night we would be all ready. When we left we tried to pay the library fee since he did take the time to teach us a game we were going to be playing elsewhere, but they would not let us pay. We promised to stop back and spend more time at the Cafe some weekend. All in all it was a great experience even though short. Nice and clean with a very welcoming staff!

Just a quick update:

I went back with friends and we spent several hours playing games. Again, excellent selection of games. Very helpful and informative staff. We learned several new games and had a blast.  It did get pretty crowded and loud so it was hard to hear each other at times but that just means people are having fun. I think it is a great place for party games.  Maybe not so much for big strategy games unless certain times aren't as rowdy.  Of course, a Saturday night was sure to be a little more rambunctious.  Definitely check this place out if you are into gaming. You can't beat the selection for $5!!!"}
{"text":"If you like board games, you'll love this place.  They have an entire wall of every single board game that you can think of, from your traditional monopoly, sorry, scrabble, taboo, cranium, cards against humanity, whatever to your settlers of catan, dominion, puerto rico, bang, citadels, to the weirdest games that you've never heard of in your life.  For $5 you can play board games here all day.

They also serve sandwiches here, an drinks and things.  The smoothies are pretty decent."}
{"text":"I had heard talk of a board game cafe opening up in Cleveland, and my boyfriend is an avid board gamer, so Thanksgiving break was the perfect opportunity to check out Tabletop Board Game Cafe with him. We headed in on Friday afternoon and while the place wasn't full when we arrived, there wasn't a table open by the end of our visit! If you arrive before 3pm, the $5 fee to play games is waived.

We loved everything about this place! It is super welcoming to all levels of board game players--from the very obsessed to the person who was dragged along. We saw a group playing a classic American board game (think Monopoly), an older couple learning how to play Ticket to Ride for the first time, and others getting into more serious board games. If you have any interest at all in playing board games, there is something for you at Tabletop. They have an impressive selection of over 1,000 games all categorized and labeled, so they are very easy to find or select something new based on what you love. They have a shelf dedicated with games for the kiddos too. They also have a Staff Picks section, which included many of our favorites or games that were on my boyfriend's list of next games to play. 

They offer some food--small bites, sandwiches, and smoothies. They also have coffee and about five different beers on tap. We didn't try the food, but we found the beer selection to be adequate. The guy who was serving had two roles--serving drinks/food and also explaining and helping to the set up our board game selection. We went with Machi Koro for most of our visit, and we also tried Citadels. The guy was not overbearing at all, and it is really nice to have someone explain the rules to you the first time you play a game.

Another thing that Tabletop got right is the ambiance. Board games in the past have been labeled \"nerdy\" or other places really try to push the \"geek\" culture. Tabletop is anything but that. You feel like you are in a very trendy, vintagey cafe, perfect for a hipster. They do have some geek references, but overall they tastefully included board game culture references like the meeple restroom signs. They also have a maker space in the back area, where they seem to host monthly workshops.

If you like board games at all, you should definitely check out Tabletop Board Game Cafe!"}
{"text":"My house used to be considered a sizeable cache for board games, and I've been put to shame after coming here. Hell, I haven't heard of 80% of the games I saw on the racks when I first came here. But that's what makes coming to Tabletop a very unique experience every time (as long as you're open to trying new things).

$5, and you can stay the entire day just playing board games with friends. There's also a bar and food offerings available the entire day. I always get a root beer float, but usually nothing else, because the food is unfortunately overpriced for what they offer. If you do opt for food, the Gouda mac is pretty good. The rest is pretty lackluster.

What's the move? Go to any restaurant on W. 25th for lunch/dinner, then go to Tabletop. I've had so many fun hours spent there, and it's probably going to become a pastime soon. Come for the games and for the root beer."}
{"text":"Really fun, new hangout spot in the heart of Ohio City.  Located near West Side Market on West 25th Street, Tabletop Board Game Cafe is a place where you can play over 1,000 games with your friends.  The fee to play is $5, then you can play as many games as you want.  With this amount of variety, there are both familiar games and games that I've personally never heard of.  Tabletop has a decent sized drink menu, so you can sip a beer while you're busy conquering the world.

The furniture is comfortable and the cafe has an older, more rustic feel.  If you don't know what you want to play, there's a cool chart on the wall that suggests new, less common games which are similar to games that are mainstream.  The staff is fantastic.  We chose a game from the \"staff recommended\" shelf.  It was a game that none of us had played before, but a staff member came over and spent 10 minutes teaching us how to play the game.  Drink service is well paced - your glass won't go empty, but your board game playing will not be frequently interrupted.

Overall, Tabletop is a relaxing place to chill, have drinks, and kick back and play board games while you're enjoying your drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to similar places in other cities and I like Tabletop's model better. At most board game cafes you pay $2 or 3 a person per hour. If you're like me and you stay for a couple games, that can add up. I've been to Sidequest in Lakewood as well, and I like the atmosphere here better. No blaring TVs or a crowded bar of people yelling horrible things at each other (read playing Cards Against Humanity). Don't get me wrong that has it's place too if you are looking for a livelier night out.

I didn't get to try any of the food, but the bites sounded yummy. I had a Frozen Wine concoction which was quite tasty and reasonably priced, my partner had a glass of wine and our Assistant was friendly, helpful and always there to refill our water. We often try to bring a book or play a game when out to eat at a place that isn't crowded. You either feel guilty or get shooed away if you \"stay too long\" even when there is no competition for the bar stool or table. Plus the noise level here was very manageable even on a busy Saturday afternoon. 

I'm so very pleased to have Tabletop finally open and to see it doing well. It was a nice rescue when Cleveland Pride had been cancelled."}
{"text":"I visited Tabletop this past Tuesday with a friend for their trivia night (8-10ish pm). I had never been here before, but it is definitely a place that I can see myself visiting again soon. While the trivia was pretty hard, it was a lot of fun and seemed to be run pretty well. 
     I didn't try any of the food, so I can't comment on that. As an IPA fan, the beer selection left a little to be desired, but they have a lot of cool drinks like wine slushies and you can even add shots to hot chocolate. My trivia teammate ordered the buffalo chicken dip, which comes out as 6 pieces of bread with a dollop of dip on top of each, which is not what we expected. 
     There was only one server for all of the tables and it was a full house for trivia. She did a decent job with being pulled in every direction, but the main backup was when trivia ended and everyone wanted their bills at the same time. Took a little long, but she was very nice and was working hard."}
{"text":"I love their HUGE selection of board games, unfortunately their menu didn't really please me. Their snacks work just fine for vegans or vegetarians but corpse eaters like me don't really get a great selection of foods (I loved their coffee though) Thankfully there are many food places near by that you can check out before or after playing some great board games!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the concept of this place is super cool but the management is just not ok. They are firm on rules for some groups and then completely bend them for others (like fire code regulations for seating). This makes me feel like I'm not valued as a customer. Also, the food is way over priced. I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to have a few laughs and hang out with good friends. Has a hipster vibe with its craft brews, smoothies, and overall atmosphere. You pay $5 a person to have access to over 1000 games. They also have sandwiches and soups, but I just opted for the Cleveland Sunshine Smoothie. It had mango, pineapple, banana, orange juice, and almond milk. It was delicious. Our waitress was terrific. She consistently checked up on us to see if we needed anything. They have all different size tables for various size groups. We were sat towards the front where there was a couch and several chairs. It was very comfortable. We spent several hours there, and never felt like we were being rushed out, which is great. If you want to have a relaxing night with friends, plays some board or card games, and have a drink, this is your place."}
{"text":"Welcome to Ohio City Tabletop! What a refreshing change of pace near a strip of loud crowded bars! I had heard about Tabletop many months ago, and am thrilled that they finally opened a few weeks ago.
I came with 3 friends- it wasn't too crowded when we got there around 7 on a Friday, but by the time we left after 10, it seemed that most tables were taken.
Each person pays $5 (like a cover charge) to have access to unlimited games for the night- and they really have such a huge library of games, and multiples of many games as well. They also have a nice small draft selection or craft beers- reasonably priced, and fun non-alcoholic drinks like kombucha, smoothies, or coffee/ tea. They have a small food menu, which I thought was a little pricey for what you get (really my only beef,which knocked it down to 4 stars for me). I think you're paying a premium because turnover is so low- I imagine most folks stay for 3 hours or more.
Our group had 2 kinds of bitty bites: orange goat, and buff chick dip. Both were really tasty, but small for the price, I thought. 2 friends had smoothies, and they enjoyed them, but again, they were $4.50 for probably an 8 oz smoothie.
The service was very great. Our server was fun, nice, and weird- in an endearing way. He was great about refilling our drinks really often, and when he saw us struggling with a game's rules, he was right there to offer some expertise. It really seemed like all the staff were not only on top of things, but also really wanting to make sure everyone was having a good time. And it really seemed like people did! It was loud, but not rowdy. 
Also the decor is simple, but I really liked the vibe. Comfy vintage-y chairs and a subway tile bar. Some cool custom art on the walls. I dig this place, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Definitely recommend for a 2 some or group... Drinks are fab, prices are great and staff is so awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with helpful and courteous staff. Only drank, but menu looked appealing. Seems like their cover charge encourages people to camp out, rather than stop in for a quick game. Would like to see a better deal than minimum $30 for 6 people---regardless of \"all day pass\" status---is a bit steep."}
{"text":"Such a fun little place. For 5 dollars you have access to all the games you want! I have brought so many friends here for a fun night in Ohio City. Such a different, quirky place! A board game cafe is something I never would've thought of but it works so well. I recommend for a date night, night with friends, or even with co-workers."}
{"text":"From one who doesn't play many board games, I still give this place five stars. My other half though, is an avid board gamer, and he was super impressed with this place as well.

I've been here plenty of times since it's opened- being roped into friends' gatherings, and specifically friends who love board games, I've ended up here many of a time.

For only five bucks, you can enjoy unlimited time of playing all types of board games- from old school (aka Hungry Hungry Hippos) to more complex strategic games to international games- this place has it all.

And the board games are clean- I was expecting them to be all nasty from people playing them, but it's quite clean.

The cafe also serves an arrangement of nice refreshments to fuel your playing- tea, kombutcha, smoothies, etcera. It's quite refreshing and convenient.

This place is usually very full, but we've always found a table to play at. It's chill and just a fun way to make all type of \"gamers\" happy, with their large variety of games.

If you're looking for a different way to spend the night, go hang out at Tabletop- it'll be a fun way to relax with friends."}
{"text":"I was with five other friends and none of us had been to Tabletop Cafe before.  Most of us had a misconception of what it was, as being only for kids or boring, but we were delightfully surprised!  We had a blast!!!  It was the perfect place to go for a group of friends for food, drink, and an evening of fun.  Alicia was a phenomenal server, giving us suggestions when we asked and just generally being attentive and fun-loving.  Joshua was our game expert and brought us five possibilities based on our expressed interests.  He was able to describe the games quickly and then taught us the game we chose without hesitation, coming back when we had a question or hit a bump.  I appreciated the fact they had local brews on tap (Platform Brewery for example) and the food wasn't complicated but was tasty - perfect for a game night.  I *highly* recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something new, this is the place.  My girlfriend and I checked this out a couple weeks ago and we aren't board game people.  I mean we like them, but our experience is limited to Monopoly and Sorry.  

We showed up, were quickly greeted with a beer, and a friendly waiter.  I forgot his name, which is absolutely critical to this review.  I think it was Josh or Joshua.  He had a beard - I know its 2015 and I'm at a board game cafe, lots of beards.  Given the beard, I'm going Joshua.  

Well Joshua came over and asked us what we wanted to play (I want to play Mortal Kombat (they don't have that)), and so I asked Joshua \"what's good for two people\".

He rubs his little genie beard and hands us \"Jaipur\".  It's nighttime, I'm drinking, I'm not reading instructions.  Luckily you don't have to.  Joshua explains the game incredibly well in under 2 minutes, and we were off and running.  After a couple hours of absolutely dominating in the game (if you meet a girl named Christina that's bad at Jaipur, that's my girlfriend), we settled up and went home happy.  As we were leaving, we noticed that there was another couple waiting for Jaipur.  

So thank you Joshua.  Thank you Jaipur.  And thank you Tabletop.  

But get another couple sets of Jaipur."}
{"text":"You're never too old for a good round of board games with your friends! Not too pricey to grab a group of friends and head in to play games from an enormous selection of games. What's especially cool is that there are food and drink options to accompany you during games! Only downside on the customer side is that its always so busy in there, but being in such. a great location in Ohio City it's completely understandable."}
{"text":"You guys, this place is the JAM! 

If you love the idea of a place to socialize with friends that:

A) Is not too loud. (This is a huge selling point for an introvert like me!)
B) Offers a nice selection of healthy, affordable snacks in addition to alcohol.
C) Gives you the chance to try out new board games and enjoy favorites with friends.
D) Has a cool, laid back staff of friendly, fellow nerds.

Well, then this is the place! I love everything about this concept and my friends and I had a wonderful time here on a (albeit very busy) Saturday night. I'm glad we braved the long wait because we found a favorite new game (Pandemic!) and had so much fun that we stayed up past midnight for the first time in ages! (We're in our 30's, ya'll.) 

I can't recommend Tabletop any more highly! I'll be back with my gaggle geeky pals - perhaps during a more quiet hour - to discover some more great new games!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time and it certainly won't be my last. It's fairly small with 10-15 tables so it fills up quickly. It's best to go as early as you can so you don't have to wait in line at night. This place has a hip vibe and cozy feel to it. I stayed for four hours and time passed by quickly. Staff were kind, including my server Candace and a worker who was very helpful in explaining the rules for a game called Machi Koro. I didn't get his name but he had long hair and a beard. There is also a \"Staff Picks\" area if you are stumped on what to play. 

I would give five stars if it weren't for the food. I ordered the avocado brovado sandwich. It took a long time to come out. The sandwich was decent but tasted a bit bland. Bread was hard and it didn't make me full. However, that won't hinder me from coming back. Besides the food, this place rocks! I am now officially a board game fanatic."}
{"text":"I had a great first-time experience here. There was 2 of us and we were able to get a table on a Saturday night after about a 40-minute wait. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We sat at the bar, so we interacted with the staff quite a bit. We had just come from dinner so we didn't try any of the food, but my friend had a coffee which he said was good.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is really neat! What a great idea. They have TONS of board games. If you don't know, you pay $5 to play games for as long as you are there. I also really like the atmosphere. They have a limited snack menu, but the stuff we ordered was decent. They have a couple of beers on tap. I really like this place, but I so wish they had liquor. (I get why they don't, but, still...)
I've already been here twice and I definitely plan to go back. 
The only thing I didn't like is that the service is pretty slow, but since you are pretty engrossed in the game in front of you, it's not a huge deal until its time to get the check and go."}
{"text":"I love me some Tabletop!  Went on a Wednesday evening with 2 of my girlfriends and we closed the place down. The staff there is always really helpful with picking out games.  They are generally attentive and unobtrusive.  Beware, it is easy to rack up a nice bill in there.  Playing unlimited games is just $5. But their delicious food will set you back.  Individually, they aren't terribly priced. It's just that you end up staying for so long that you keep eating (and drinking.) My favorite items are the Buff Chick dip and the grilled cheese with bacon! We played Rhino Hero, Quelf (I think), and Joking Hazard. If you are a fan of Cards Against Humanity, play Joking Hazard!  I actually want to purchase it for an at home game night.  Tabletop is great for a date night, friends night out, they have trivia, and a variety of eats and sips."}
{"text":"What a fun little joint! This place has so many of my favorite things: board games, ultra-funky decor, friendly staff, Rising Star coffee, snacks, and boozy drinks. Although I've never actually had one of their boozy drinks, the fact that they even have them is appreciated. 

I've been to Tabletop with my board-gaming work crew more times than I can count. We tend to take one of the 6-8 top tables and stay for the afternoon. We usually have the same server (I believe she has blue hair, or at least did!) and she is just the sweetest, most attentive person. Our drinks are always filled promptly and she makes sure we are taken care of while being nearly invisible (in the best way; she's great at her job and is just awesome at balancing her timing with gameplay).

Our group usually balances some quicker games with something longer...maybe a collaborative game followed by Mysterium or Betrayal. I don't think we could ever hope to play all of the games and expansions they have, but I love how many options are available. 

There are some tasty snacks here, including bitty bites, sandwiches, and sides. I went with a sandwich and mac and cheese last time and it didn't disappoint. I do wish they had some lower-carb options, but when I once asked if I could order a sandwich without the bread, they kindly obliged and even arranged the sandwich fillings on my plate artistically (really!). How cute. 

For only a $5 cover charge, coming to Tabletop is a great way to spend an afternoon laughing and playing games with friends."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. It has so many board games and a wide variety of them too. Having a food and drink menu makes it even more fun. However, I think that the food and drinks are a bit overpriced especially in addition to the $5 cover charge to play the games. I got a smoothie which was okay at best. Another downside is that it fills up pretty quickly on Saturday evenings."}
{"text":"I always pegged Ohio City as the beer district, but welcome Tabletop to add a little flare to the mix. Not just beer, but a nice variety of liquid fare. From both fruity and wine smoothies, draft beer, bottled beer and wine as well. Who doesn't build up the munchies after chugging back a few? Tabletop has you covered with mini bites and sammiches as well!

Walk in and you will see what appears to be a library of board games, like 100's maybe even thousand? Saw many classics games like operation and sorry. Have no idea where to start? There's a nice poster on the wall that suggests some games, like \"if you like scrabble, you'll like ----\". In an hour and a half I played three games. I thought it was pretty cool of the owner to volunteer and show us how to play a few of the games. None of the games we encountered had missing pieces and were all well kept. FYI to indulge in the games, it's a $5 gaming fee per person.

Ample room to play, or just sit and mingle. Very clever of the place to add little flags you can place on your table if you have room for someone to join in (what a great way to meet new people).

Bravo Tabletop. It is not game over for me. I will be seeing you again soon."}
