{"text":"I have gone here twice, both times for lunch and ordered a lunch combo. Soup, salad, and oranges are included in the price. For about $11 I got a california roll and a dragon roll. The taste was great and the sushi was rolled really well. Service has been great both times."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and the value of the teriyaki with tempura shrimp lunch special is just crazy!  I have a hard time eating all the food you get for $9! (10% off for cash).  You get soup, noodle salad, green salad, rice, teriyaki, shrimp and vegetable tempura...and the best part is their lunch menu works till 4pm.  I dare not see what the dinner portions are like!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Japanese food. Only problem was it's really small. Service was quick but not as good as typical Japanese restaurant service. I loved loved loved the food though."}
{"text":"They are very child friendly and their seafood udon is truly delicious and bountiful.  Nice attentive staff and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I used to eat here once a week. Last week they were out of an item and charged us full price anyways. This week I tried take out, it took over an hour and they messed up the order. They offered no compensation so I demanded a full refund.  Worst customer service I've ever had. I'll never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh, sushi! Very well prepared with careful attention to detail. You won't get a fat maki roll of mostly rice with a smidgen of fish here. The rolls are very generously portioned and delicious. Tip: don't order too much at first - pace yourself."}
{"text":"Sushi is the food japan is known for. It was probably the first truly international food. But Japanese cuisine is so much more, as you can sample here.
I tried the fish Donburi. 
Donburi translates as bowl, and bowl-based cuisine is the basis of all foods that come from the common people, because women only had the time and heat available to cook everything together in one pot. One pot also allowed a lot of filler to fill people up, and just a tiny bit of juice from meat to add flavor -- the oldest and most healthful trick in the books, compared to societies that eat way too much meat. 
I'm glad to have been introduced to Donburi here and will report back when I've tried some elsewhere.
As I argue in my e-book, Food for CIty Building, restaurants need to be seen as more than places to eat food. They share cultures, and educate people about food.

Restaurants also innovate by mixing it up. 
My suspicion is that fish-based Donburi is adapted from Korea. Great to see two cultures meeting and fusing in Toronto. 
Great cuisines are alive, and they adapt all the time."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner at Japango. Well prepared, good price/quality. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food. I went here because I had a fantastic experience at the Japango on near Dundas street. Thought this was a chain and food would be equally good however was totally wrong. We started with the gyoza that was very oily but tasty. We ordered three different types of maki. The spider maki, the spicy tuna maki and the dragon maki... all three tasted exactly the same!   The only reason why I'm giving this place two stars is because the service was good. Made up to some extent for the bad food. But not enough to make me want to go back there."}
{"text":"The sushi here is really really good and fresh. One of the better sushi places. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommend. Staff are really nice too."}
{"text":"Had lunch here. I thought the menu selections were great. They also do a 30 piece maki tray for $27 which is absolutely enough to share for two.  It had a spider roll (yay!), shrimp tempura roll, salmon roll, tuna roll, california roll and I think there was one more. 

We also ordered the assorted sashimi appetizer which was great. Really fresh white tuna, the salmon was fantastic.. overall some of the freshest fish I've had in awhile. 

I will definitely check this place out again when I'm in the 'hood. I won't go out of my way to go there but it's a good choice in my books for sushi in the east end."}
{"text":"Have been a few times, every time it's been excellent! Last visit had the bulgogi, was terrific, also some maki which were equally good. Nice little place, courteous staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my fave mid priced sushi places in the Beaches. Prices are reflective of their quality, and I have never had a bad experience there. The owners are always there and are happy to see me, they genuinely seem appreciative for the business.

Their lunch menu is way cheaper, and only available Mon to Fri in the day. The dinner can get a little expensive. Atmosphere is a bit lacking, understated if anything. There is another place in the Beaches that is amazing, not naming names, but it can turn into a 100 dollar evening very quickly. So if you are looking for mid range nice meal this is a great compromise.

Worth the price"}
{"text":"Yummy! I get their MA-4 lunch special at least once a week.

Great sushi and good price. Must try!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place despite how small the restaurant is. But it seems like they hired some new waitress. And one of them has been pretty rude to us. 
When we were asking for small bowls, she came to us but left us there waiting because there were uber drivers coming to grab food. She didn't even let us know that she needed to deal with someone else, she just walked away. 
When we were paying, we tried to use android pay to tap. She insisted that the machine doesn't support Interac and kinda just throw the machine on the table. I saw the sign on the machine and tried to tap. Guess what, it went through. It was kinda awkward. She didn't say anything then just walked away. 
I really hope the owner could do something to make their service better."}
{"text":"I have not been to the popular Japan Go on Elizabeth, but I can say I was not too impressed (nor disappointed) with the Beaches location!
This might have something to do with the fact that I visited the restaurant on Sunday, which is not generally a good day to eat sushi, but I just assumed if the restaurant is kept open, they are serving fresh food!

The sushi and maki rolls tasted ok, but I did not feel that any of them particularly stood out. The value for the amount and quality of sushi was also not great at this restaurant, and the tuna did not look particularly fresh, but then again the latter point may be related to the 'Sunday effect'(**) 
On the other hand, the appetizers (seaweed salad) and bento box were well above average in both taste and value, and I would definitely go down that route if I were to visit this location again! (****)
 
Finally, the service at JapanGo is very pleasant and friendly and seems to provide a little extra of something to each customer! (****)

All in all, Japan Go is a pretty decent Japanese restaurant that I would visit again if I were in the 'hood, but would not go out of my way to travel to."}
{"text":"What a great little local gem.  Great food and service with huge smiles.  Way more than we could eat, but leftovers were just as yummie!  Looking forward to trying the roll special next visit!"}
{"text":"I always order the tempura and sashimi appetizer here because of the price and quality. It's rare to find a Japanese restaurant by the beaches that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. The restaurant is small but the food is solid. The staff is also very friendly and we are welcomed with smiles every time we visit. They also offer 10% off if you do cash for takeout."}
