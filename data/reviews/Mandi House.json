{"text":"Our server Pamela was a sweetheart and the Gyro was fantastic! Spacious and clean, quiet and peaceful!"}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant on a Saturday evening.  Started off with an appetizer but could not find falafel in the appetizer section so ordered a platter.  Came with a generous portion with a salad but a very watered down dip/sauce on the side.  

We then went on to order two entrees, kabsa and kebabs.  When they came noted that we were missing the salad that was supposed to come with the entree.  Guess they forgot?  Then on closer inspection of the kebab platter noted it came with only two skewers instead of three as noted in the menu. 

 At first when we asked the server it was as if nothing happened.  However when we pointed out the discrepancy by pointing out to the menu, they indicated that they ran out of kebabs so gave us only two.   Oh well that certainly did not sit well with us.  They did apologize a few times, but that was after the fact of bringing it to the attention and brought us the missing kebab.   Both menu items were OK and lacked flavor.

Thankfully we came with a Groupon.  We certainly hoped for a better experience as it seemed like a nice family restaurant, but will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Tried this hole in the wall place tonight after finding a coupon in the entertainment coupon book, and it was so awesome. I'm so glad we discovered it! Huge portions,  super fresh and great service. The cuisine of Yemen is a delightful mix of Mediterranean and Indian. Loved their shawarma and \"teakah\" (not spelled tikka, like India).  $8.99 for a mammoth plate with tasty fixings. $2 for a flat bread topped with spinach and hot gooey cheese, plus side salad and dips! And free all you can drink Ceylon tea! Hands down best middle eastern in the area (and after traveling to Turkey,  Greece and Egypt, I do not say this lightly). Worth the half hour drive, (though there's another place only 1 block from my house....it pales in comparison.) Friendly server was patient, kind and hospitable. So Yummy.  Loved it all . I must try the bakery soon!! (there goes the diet...) Thanks oasis bakery and cuisine! You need to get a Facebook page so I can follow and recommend you! :-)"}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  If you have never had Yemeni cuisine you are missing out. I tried the fahsa which was absolutely delicious.  By far the most flavorful lamb stews I have ever eaten.  
 
The service on the other hand, needs major improvements. I stood at the cash register for almost 5 minutes trying to get someone's attention.  Another customer came over and handed me a menu. She must have known the staff because she went to the kitchen and got their attention.  I rated it so high because the food is fantastic but be warned, service is lousy."}
{"text":"I had the lunch specialty of chicken. A plate of rice and a big chicken leg are served. Rice is a bit hard and chewy but the chicken is flavourful."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! So yummy and even the kids ate it. Super friendly service, totally willing to explain the menu. They made us feel like family. Definitely worth the drive from San Tan Valley!"}
{"text":"1. no handsoap in the restroom, not sure how employees are working
2. flies while dining.
3. timing hours online differ from what they actually are. went there once all the way from chandler to see them closed
4. no response to the phone calls
5. asked for a glass of water, brought a bottle instead and charged

i am guessing the place is about to die. food was good to ok."}
{"text":"I went here to give it a shot as I forgot my usual spot was closed. We ordered several dishes to-go to try this place out and were not impressed with any of them. After waiting a very long time for our order we headed home and started unboxing the disastrous food. The Meat pie  was burnt and black around the edges and on bottom. The Zerban Meat dis was one of the few times I wished I had only potatoes and no lamb as it was loaded with bits of bone and the meat tasted like it had been cooked in a deep fat fryer and left there too long. The Meat Shawarma plate had tiny crunchy pieces of lamb that had no flavor. The only thing that was decent was the Biryani Meat dish. 

There are a lot of options in that area do yourself a favor and go to one of those as this place is not worth the time or the disappointment."}
{"text":"Simply loved it. 
We tried three different type of foods including fish. All of them awesome!!!!
The owner is nice guy and the staff were super nice."}
{"text":"A new Middle Eastern restaurant in Tempe which by far is one of the best ones my husband and I have ever had (we have eaten at a plethora of restaurants). Everything here is delicious. Over similar restaurants in the area I would recommend this one before any others!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food quality is about average, nothing too special. The shawarma was just okay. They got my order wrong and the manager tried to argue with me about whether I could order take out or not with a Groupon. For this reason I will not come back. Additionally the restaurant is exceedingly dirty, considering how recently it opened."}
{"text":"I love going to this place! The best brakefast, lunch and dinner for the best deal! Very good food, great hospitality and good customer service. If you eat a lot this place is the best one to have a good satisfied stomach plus the desserts, juices and tea's are super delicious and made there. TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT. RUTH."}
{"text":"Oh my God.....after a very long time... authentic Yemeni Laham Mandi......my mind exploded as did my taste buds.....I am surprised to see that quality here in America for Laham Mandi. Mandi House.....you won my heart."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, it looks a little sketch from the outside.  Totally authentic expetience.  The food was flavorful! Large plates. We had ground lamb kabob and chicken shwarma. The meat pastry was light N flaky, hummus was on the runny side but good flavor.   And the baklava.... yum!!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is in the former fire house that was formerly also long Wongs and other bars.  In typical Middle Eastern fashion, we had to haggle to get them to accept the coupon from restaurant.com; apparently their relationship is not so great. Either way it worked out and we compromised and I'm glad we did. The food was really good. I've never had falafel this moist. I find falafel to be dry and this falafel was not dry. I highly recommend the special fish. The fish is a special fish from the Middle East with a nice spice mix that includes a little sriracha. Finally the hummus and baba ganoush are also very good. Finally the tea is free, how can you go wrong with that?"}
{"text":"My first experience with Oasis was an absolute delight. My wife and I ordered a variety of items delivered, and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. The oqdet was rich and spicy, the mandi lamb flavorful and perfectly cooked, just great all around. Portions were generous, and delivery was prompt. 

Unfortunately, Oasis has failed to maintain that quality over several additional orders. Late deliveries, missing items, and steadily lowering food quality have become more common. Today culminated in all three. Bland, overcooked, late, inaccurate, and the items we did get were smashed up like they talked trash about the cook's mother.

We won't be ordering from Oasis again, and it's very disappointing. They seem to have so much potential when everything's executed properly. They're just not very good at the \"running a restaurant\" part of running a restaurant."}
{"text":"Fish ,lahm mandi ,chicken madhbi are the best in Tempe .. and the tea in the house .. this place is piece of Yemen."}
{"text":"To be perfectly honest this place wasn't that great. I had passed by this place several times while driving on apache and decided to drop by one time with friends since we like to try new places. The service was not very good, the guy that took our order wasn't paying attention to what we ordered, for example I ordered chicken shawarma pita but he brought me the plate instead. As far as the food was concerned the rice was good but the chicken itself was overcooked. The only great part was meeting the manager, he was pretty cool. Other than that I wouldn't really come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Apache Blvd is known for it many great cultural cuisine destinations. The location itself used to be a firehouse and a Long Wongs for a short period. This Middle Eastern restaurant serves up Yemeni cuisine - slow cooked meats cooked in spices and served with rice and vegetables. I teach ESL to International students on the side and brought a few of them here for lunch. I love how they have an area that you can sit on floor cushions and eat. They have free tea up front and quite a variety of baklava choices. The entrée portions are quite generous. I had the Chicken Shawarma and one of my students had the Zerban Chicken. Both were amazing! The owner came out and shared her story of coming here to the US and how she ended up here in Arizona after being in New York for a brief time (cheaper rent). A wonderful experience that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've had a few kinds of Middle Eastern food before, but some of this was different from what I've had, enough to make it very interesting. We had the lamb Fahseh and the grilled fish. Both were delicious, and each had a unique flavor. The Fahseh was served literally bubbling hot in an iron bowl. You have to be careful as you get it out of the bowl not to burn your hands. Our waitress even got a little burnt when it popped out on her hand as she was serving it to us. The fish is served whole and cut in half, eyes, mouth and all. It's easy not to see the eyes and mouth if you're not looking, so it's not too disturbing-- just be on the lookout (no pun intended). Also, watch out for bones. Both entrées were served with flat bread, rice, and a salad with salsa and yogurt sauce. There was a tea that was free and very tasty; it was self-serve, and it was next to the entrance of a floor seating room where people take their shoes off before they enter. You have to be careful not to trip over the shoes as you're going for your tea. For dessert, we had the Ma'soub, they kind of bread pudding with Banana, honey, cream sauce, and what they call holy seed, which like black sesame seed (but I'm not quite sure). All this cost us $41 with tax and a 20% tip. Not too bad considering we took half a fish, a lot of rice, and a little bit of stew home with us, and the desert would've been big enough for four people! (We just didn't take it with us because we didn't think it would keep well.)"}
{"text":"So far I've tried Mandi Chicken, Kabsa chicken and Biryani Meat. As an Asian I was confused about these terms on menu, but the greatest thing is they add detail description on the menu right now! Food is good (soft juicy lamb and chicken omg), service is fast and passionate. I recommend this place for anyone who wanna have a good middle eastern food experience."}
{"text":"This wasn't my favorite place I've tried in Tempe so far. The falafel I ordered was flavorless, full of overwhelming spicy onions, and very dry."}
{"text":"5 star rating food wise.

The most flavorful Middle eastern food with huge portions. 
Earlier I almost reached the conclusion that 'Green Corner Restaurant' at Mesa has the best Middle Eastern food in the town and but man.. Mandi House's food is no joke.
I am taking out 1 star just due to their ambience. Otherwise staff is authentic and polite 

Try out the food guys and thank me later"}
{"text":"I love this place. Tried it with my husband for 3 times now, two times during Ramadan, their Iftar buffet was cheap and great! Now ordering a la carte, the food is even better! Prices are reasonable and the service is very good. The food is up to par and my favorite is the Kabsa. The portions are pretty big and the food is served with salad. That's a very good deal! I definitely recommend this place and will be coming here over and over again."}
{"text":"Went to redeem groupon since it was written that it was accepted for take out. Guy said (I am guessing owner) he won't take a groupon telling me that he is losing money. He shouldn't have advertised on groupon his business then. I walked out."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken a photo of the food plate. I was very disappointed. I have completed reviews on many different restaurants, this place has to be my least favorite. 

I ordered a Chicken Shwarma Combo. 2/3's of my plate was rice. 1/3 was of the plate was salad and there was some chicken crumbled on top of the rice. The food looked nothing like photographs. 

My husband complained that his gyro plate actually came out like bits of burnt steak. 

I've already killed 3 or 4 flies too while I was eating. GROSS!

Save your money. I only wish I had gone to Haji-baba instead."}
{"text":"To be honest, the other three entries our party tried were mediocre, there's no atmosphere, and  the service was not good (though friendly), but OMG, the briyani was amazing.  I am pretty fussy about my briyani, but it was exquisitely spiced!  The chicken was not deboned, but they were generous with it, so who cares?  The price minimal and the portion size maximal, so be prepared for delicious briyani leftovers.  Everyone in our party flipped over the briyani!  I would rate the briyani, alone, 5 star --  best I've ever had!  The only way it could be better would be to add nuts and raisins."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at the Oasis. We did go on a weekday and it was around 7pm. There was only one other car in the parking lot. The area where the restaurant is located is right next to a shady looking motel. Park near the brightest light. LOL! Anyway we entered through the back and was greeted right away by the hostess with a huge smile. She was very, very nice and had us sit anywhere. The restaurant was empty except for one other table. We ordered 2 dishes the biyrani chicken, zebna chicken, and the hummus. The hummus had too much lemon juice, it was edible, but it could be better. Our favorite dish was the zebna chicken. The chicken on both dishes were a little dry but the rice with the zebna chicken was amazing. Becareful the portions are HUGE. One dish can feed three people. We did get baklava with pistachios for dessert and it was delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here couple of times and it's been a great experience. I love the favorable foods and the sweets. I tried the fish and halal goat rice with some fresh salads. Everything was very tasty!!!! Don't forget the sweets oh man out of the world so darn good. Overall very good middle eastern food. Price range is reasonably and they give more then enough food to enjoy."}
{"text":"This is the best middle eastern restaurant in Tempe. Their prices are very good. They have many kinds of food. It is so delicious. Their waitress are very friendly. I really high recommend to all."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness so delicious like home cooking
Went there with my family, good humble service
Best middle eastern cooking I give 5 stars"}
{"text":"The grilled fish and biryani rice is the BEST.  They have excellent hummus, too.  I am not a big fan of the salsa or dressing for the salad....I wish they would improve that.  However, the fish and biryani rice are with the trip every time we go! Yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was not good at all. I ordered beef kebab and it tasted only salt and co2. I would never go there again and not recommend there."}
{"text":"While ordering oder spicy. The food is fresh and owesome. Our family just loved it.
We ordered lamb Meat Mandi and chicken Mandi. Lamb was really great."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed ourselves here.  Falafels are SUPERB--so much so that after we ate we took an order to go.  Hummus is delicious.  Mandi chicken is not all that spicy.  Shawarma and fish dishes were fantastic.   The baked rice takes the cake--I ate every last grain and I usually don't eat rice!  Prices were fair.  They are definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have been here twice now and we've left so satisfied both times! We've had a lot of hummus in our lives and this one is definitely up to par! Both times we got the fahseh and the second time we also got to Zerman meat. They were both delicious but we would definitely recommend always getting the fahseh as an addition to your other entrees to add some sauce to your plate. The entrees are hugeee (would definitely recommend splitting one between two people) and the lamb here is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly new Middle Eastern restaurant in Tempe. It's a very nice and clean place. You do get a Middle Eastern feel and their music is pretty great there (if you're into their music). 

Food and service was exceptional. Prices are reasonable and worth it because these plates are in huge portions. There is also an area for you to sit down and eat(my favorite way to eat Middle Eastern food) but if you prefer, there are also tables and booths. Mandi meat and Biryani chicken are a must try! They also have tea available for you before or after your meal, it's delicious. I came in late so I didn't get to see much of the bakery side of the place but from the look of it, everything is tasty here. 

I'm gonna hold out on the last star because this place is kind of ghetto and has a scary/creepy parking lot. It's next to a motel and you can't park in the motel parking spot. You have to go through their parking lot and it's kind of creepy at night for me(a girl) to go there alone, so bring some friends!  Another reason why is that I wish they have a plate that feature different kind of meat instead of just 1 specific type of meat per plate. Maybe I'm asking too much but most places I have been to, there's always an option where I can get gyro, chicken and kabob all on one plate. Also, I love rice and yogurt but the yogurt here wasn't doing it for me, it wasn't creamy enough.

Overall though, I like the place and love the food. I will probably come back here again and also try some of their dessert since I was too full this time."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the portions are huge! Really flavorful rice and chicken. The desserts as well are super satisfying. The staff is really humble and kind too! I can't wait to go back. Definitely a must-try!!!"}
{"text":"Companion and I arrived for dinner and were promptly seated. Entry is through a small parking lot in the rear, and is easily missed.

The restaurant has two rooms, one with regular tables, and one in which guests are able to sit on the floor.

We started out with a plate of hummus (4.99). Startlingly smooth and beautifully not over spiced, this was to portend the start of a really good dinner.

For main courses we ordered Mandi Meat (Roasted Lamb w/basmati rice 13.99) , Zerban Meat (Lamb w/raisins, nuts, potatoes in a tomato based sauce 13.99), Falafel 5.99, and Areekah (Bread w/dates, honey, and cream 7.99) 

The portions were large, and the lamb was cooked perfectly with wonderful flavors. The Areekah served as our dessert, and is almost addicting to eat. Once you start, you cannot stop.

Our only disappointment was with Falafel. It was on the dry side and was obviously made from a mix rather than fresh fava beans.

All this also came with complimentary salad with two types of dressings available and on the plate. 

To be honest, this is going to become one of my new must eat at places because the food is so very good.

It is also worth noting that they also serve a breakfast menu which includes Shakshuka, which is a must have middle eastern dish of eggs cooked in a tomato base with spices. I personally cook this at home, and have never found any place that cooked it in the U.S.

I highly recommend this restaurant for a wonderful experience of eating middle eastern food.

4 stars for cleanliness, portion size, and wonderful flavors."}
{"text":"YS restaurant's cousin. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices. 
The food here is delicious too, I like to eat beaf and lamb from it. They have a lot of choices, and I think they have fish too but I prefer meat from them.

The things that I find it as disadvantages:
1- There is only one entrance to the restaurant, don't miss it.
2- The interior design of the restaurant need to be changed.
3- The decorations and lights also need changes."}
{"text":"The last time I was in this building was when it was a Long Wong's. Oasis has converted the space into a quaint little Middle Eastern eatery. 

I actually entered mistakenly into the neighboring hotel parking lot and had to turn back onto the road and through the narrow alleyway to get to the restaurant parking lot in the back. There is ample parking once you arrive and you can enter through the back door.

I arrived after getting some service done on my car and was feeling hungry for breakfast. I got the shashuka ($5.99) and a za'atar bread ($2.99) to go. It was made in a few minutes and I was on my way in no time.

The order was packaged well and smelled wonderful. The shashuka was filled to the brim with fluffy scrambled eggs mixed with tomatoes, onions, and spices. It reminded me of the Middle Eastern version of a tomato egg dish my mom used to make when I was a kid. It was served with 3 huge pieces of pita bread. It was such a hearty amount that I could only finish about half of it.

The za'atar bread was evenly coated with za'atar spice and had nice flavor. The bread was slightly too browned for my tastes and it was a little too oily for me though. 

Service was polite and friendly. If I'm in the area I'll be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Really good experience, Authentic food with decent amount , prices are reasonable and service is nice , I recommend it for good food lovers .."}
{"text":"I think this place is still in beta testing although you should stop in just to sample the several different kinds of baklava  (take out).  As a diner, there were no napkins on my table and when I asked for some I was given a stack of the type of paper towels that go into bathroom dispensers.  The gyro sandwich was not very good.  There are some leftover wall items, I'm guessing, from when it was a Long Wong's...  If the flavors were there I could overlook the rest, but more thought needs to go into opening a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a party of 5. Only few other diners, so we were easily seated. I've tried lots of different Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, and there were definitely some things on this menu I'd never seen before.  We ordered the mandi meat, kabsa chicken, grilled fish, and oqdet chicken stew. The food was all delicious and the portions were huge! I loved the rice that came with the mandi meat, but thought the lamb was a touch bland. My friend who ordered the grilled fish devoured it. I didn't get to try it, but it looked and smelled amazing. The chicken stew was very flavorful. The best part of the night, however, was our interactions with the owner. He was covering for a server who was out sick and apologized profusely for the (nonexistent) wait. He talked to us about soccer, his family,  Yemen, his food providers, and Muslim culture. He offered us some delicious baklava and tea. He told us about the adjacent room for families who prefer to sit on the floor instead of at tables. He explained some of the beautiful pictures he had hanging on the walls. I wanted to talk to him all night! Go for the yummy food, stay and talk to the owner if you can!"}
{"text":"Didn't get the food here, just a mixture of the Baklava's, and have to say, I was damn satisfied. Closest as I got to my mom/grandma's home-made ones and the vastly superior Armenian baklava's you'll find in Glendale/Burbank/throughout the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles.

It was a bit pricier as well, and the zatar disappointed me. Wish they had Lahmajaun as well, but hey, it is what it is.

Curious on getting the food next time."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say honestly, everyone told me to go try the mandi whatever so I told my mom, Iam going to bring big tray on lunch, I walked in first of all no one was on the front Area , than i asked for good tray with some chicken ,beef and some rice and I got small can of soda , i end up paying 75.00 $ and the food smell disgusting the beef or dry as hell , I took it home no one end up eating at all just me the chicken was okay, i'm so disappointed
From this place it was the first and the last time ."}
{"text":"The lamb mandi and the fish entree is out of this world. Fish entree is must have if you are a seafood person. Oh and the portions are huge plus price is beyond reasonable."}
{"text":"Really bad food. The rice tastes like lemon. Same thing with chicken kebab. Even if you ask for white rice, it still tastes like lemon. And the place is boring. There is barley anyone. All you can hear is the AC. They also really need to remodel the area. They should drop the ceiling level , replace the light and repaint the place. Go to haji baba instead!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed at service, very unprofessional. couldn't even order food due to a rude cashier lady. Asked to speak to a manager but he cared less either and never came out to talk. I'm surprised on how they have a business going with no clue how to run a business!!"}
{"text":"Authentic middle eastern food, nice atmosphere, and very respectful staff! I would come back over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"Actually the food was really good. Like really good. This is authentic middle eastern food, so if you want a taste of the real thing, this is the place to go. Plus price wise, it's quite the bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for the first time, and ordered chicken mandi. It was a beautiful dish. Not sure how it tasted because after the host took my order,  and referred to me as using a racial slur in Arabic,  I figured it was not safe to eat it, so I threw it out.  You are in America now, so have some respect and be aware that there are some Americans who speak fluent Arabic. Not planning to come back. Black people should be wary of eating here."}
{"text":"this place never fails w great food and customer service.  everytime we go the waitress - i unfortunately dont remember her name - but she's pregnant - is always super nice and provides great service.  we love going to this place for dinner and feasting off different items from their scrumptious menu!"}
