{"text":"Just moved to the area my girlfriend and i checked this place out. Its a small dive bar and seemed like a place where only regulars attended. Was a bit uncomfortable at first, but we were greeted immediatly by a very friendly bartender. Overall a great experience very friendly people. Will definatly go back!"}
{"text":"This place is gross on so many levels.  Not a safe place especially for women.  On a recent visit I saw a \"joke\" sign making light of sexual assault.  Very sad and disappointing to know this kind of culture is accepted in our community."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Was greeted by a friendly maitre d upon entering and showed to my seat. The atmosphere was amazing and was pleasantly surprised to see that the angelic harp music I was hearing was actually a live person and not just a recording. The mix-ologist at the bar was very personable and quite knowledgeable about the selection of spirits on-hand and crafted me a beverage fit for the gods. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Awful. One of the worst bars I have ever been in. The smell of this place will make you gag. Never cleaned, floor is sticky YUCK! STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Small dark not very opening or friendly place. Will not be returning. The floor is dirty. The bathrooms are small tgey stink and the lock is broken on the womans side. No food offered. Maybe u have to ask. I got a vodka cran and it was watered down. The only good thing was free parking out back."}
{"text":"Living in Dormont for 6 months I always wanted to see the inside. Hadn't even read the reviews beforehand.  It was Karaoke tonight, not my fav but whatever. I left work at 1am, just wanted a last call round before heading to bed. The bar waitress, cute as a button didn't even acknowledge us 40's & 60's yrs old sat down and ate pizza instead of asking us if we wanted a drink.  Was you drinking behind the bar honey or were you just distracted by your friends? We only walked into a bar to have a cocktail, guess not in this place."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood dive- not a sanitized and gentrified version. No food and not craft friendly so be prepared. Lots of local menus available if you want to order in."}
