{"text":"Called to place an order for delivery this evening, gentleman refused as, \"they were busy and no longer taking orders\"! I was surprised and taken aback by this, considering they are a pizza business offering delivery. Will never use this pizzeria again, that's for sure! My recommendation, be sure they are \"not busy\" ~ apparently they do not operate well during these times!"}
{"text":"Our Friday night ritual has become an extra large white pizza with an order of cheesy breadsticks. The best! I pick it up on my way home from work and its still hot bybthe time i get home. Their buffalo chicken rolls are awesome...a lunch time favorite around the shop where i work. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have ordered twice now. The food (buffalo chicken pizza, gyro platter, garden salad and 2-liter soda) was good, fresh and hot.    Delivery was prompt, however, both times my yelp order was not completed accurately.    We like the Buffalo chicken pizza but didn't want the chicken on it this time...we still got chicken.  Twice asked for extra cucumber sauce for gyro but didn't receive it either time.  Ordered a Dr. Pepper but received a coke."}
{"text":"Typical Pittsburgh pizza delivery joint with one exception- the sandwiches are enormous. A whole sub is easily a filling meal for two. My only complaint is that they use \"buffalo fries\" (similar to Arby's fries but waffle, not curly) on their buffalo chicken sandwich. Not enough chicken and too many fries. The pizza is great! Must be the same folks as Venice pizzeria because the menus and quality are identical."}
{"text":"I ordered from here before and had no problems.  Food was great! However, this last time I ordered, I only ordered a medium pizza and was notified my order was cancelled.  I called to ask why and was told they didn't want to deliver to me in Castle Shannon for such a small order.  Then how come on Grubhub it states no minimum for delivery?  If they are going to be picky over which orders they will deliver, they need to establish a minimum.  Very misleading!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered from this place via grubhub almost 2 hours ago. We we're incredibly excited about all of the positive reviews, and ordered steak hoagies. After waiting 30 minutes past the estimated wait time of one hour and still not receiving a text saying our food is on the way, my boyfriend called the restaurant. The guy who answered the phone was rude and insisted he had called (to tell us they dont deliver to our area even though we're only 3 miles away and it has our area as a delivery area) and no one answered the phone, and since it was my phone he supposedly called my boyfiend handed the phone over to me. I explained that I did not recieve a phone call and that my phone had been in front of me the entire time. At that point he decided to switch his story and say that he called grubhub and it was their fault. To those that use grubhub, you know that when you or a restaurant have an issue with an order, you contact them or they contact you directly. Upon hanging up with him and talking to the nice lady at grubhub, I learned that he never actually contacted grubhub either. They were perfectly okay with letting us sit here hungry all night waiting for food that would never come. The customer service is why they're getting one star.  I don't care if the food tastes like it was made by Jesus himself, I will never eat here."}
{"text":"The search for good hoagies in the South Hills might finally be over! Ordered the two hoagie special out of their flyer - a steak and a buffalo chicken. Both were delicious! I do wish they put lettuce and tomato on the buffalo chicken, but it's forgivable. The chicken and fries were crispy and not drowned in buffalo sauce which I appreciated. Ranch dressing on the side was a nice touch, to keep the bread from getting soggy. The steak was great too, the lettuce hadn't wilted under the heat and the peppers and onions still had a bit of bite to them. Express uses Mancini's bread for their hoagies and it makes such a difference in quality. Delivery was surprisingly quick considering the snow. I'll definitely be ordering from here again - looking forward to seeing if the pizza is as good as the hoagies!"}
{"text":"I ordered from grubhub and they said an hour to hour and 15 mins for delivery but I got it about 30 mins after I placed my order, So fast delivery.  I got a buffalo chicken pizza and it was so good. It have trouble finding one that is spicy and theirs is. Also tons of cheese and buffalo fries. You have to open your mouth real wide to get a bite.   I also ordered cheesecake and wasn't to happy about those. I didn't expect them to be homemade or anything but the strawberry one came frozen. The top had ice particles on it and I couldn't get a piece off.  Luckily the person I got it for wasn't home to eat it right away so it could defrost. The oreo cheesecake came fine though. I guess they don't sell a lot of strawberry so they keep it in a freeze and the oreo in a fridge. If the strawberry one wasn't frozen I would have give 5 stars and I'll try other items."}
{"text":"We received a flyer in the mail today and figured we'd give it a go. This is by far, hands down, the best pizza we have had since we moved back to Pittsburgh! We have deffinetly found our new pizza shop! We ordered a large 12 cut pepperoni pizza, whole steak hoagie, an 12 garlic parm wings ... $25.00 w/reusable coupon . Everything was just perfectly cooked, delivered hot, and just awesome! Can't wait to order again!"}
