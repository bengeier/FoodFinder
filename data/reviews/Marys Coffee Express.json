{"text":"Great service. My friend got a mango smoothie which he really liked. I thought it tasted like baby food but he really liked it

My latte was solid. All around quality stop."}
{"text":"We were desperately looking for coffee on Sunday morning and found this place!  They were open early, had an excellent drink menu, good coffee and excellent soft, fluffy scones! Very friendly staff, too.

Really happy we went to check it out rather than get McDonald's coffee next door!"}
{"text":"Favorite scones!  You won't believe this coffee and scone shop is in a gas station.  Drive up and order. Great service. 
Good variety of flavors on daily basis.  We often pick up several for teachers or clients.  Lemon poppyseed is still our number one."}
{"text":"Very good coffee. Love the convenience of the drive thru. I also like having the punch card for regulars."}
{"text":"Just waited in line in the store for fifteen minutes and never got waited in.  They take care of drive ups before customers at the counter.  Super slow service, this has happened to me many times.  I left without ordering.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Awesome service! the young woman that served the window today was a delight. the gourmet coffee ... perfect. Lenin blueberry scone. yum!"}
