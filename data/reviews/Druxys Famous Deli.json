{"text":"the review: awful. awful. awful.

the why: so i had the crummy occasion to be at twh for 8 hours on sunday the 11th and 4 hours monday the 12th. diabetic as i am i had to get some food being caught as i was unprepared at the length of the visit.

they get one star because i am thankful at least druxy's was open on the sunday evening and the only place other than tim hortons which unfortunately is not a sandwich type tim hortons. pity. are you listening timmie?

being i was the only customer and obviously in no mood for any customer the obviously miserable in all aspects of her life employee, miss crab apple tried to rush me along which made things worse given my low blood sugar. 

the oddness of my order, 6 oz of the most tepid, worst of the worst kind of roast beef, no bread, just some sliced tomato made my oddness quotient go up even further with her.

then i did the unforgivable. in my effort to be polite i called her ma'am. now i am older than her by at least a half dozen but i try to be polite with servers even when they are almost jerks. well she crossed into jerk by her eye rolling over that.

the other star though is for the lovely woman who served me the next morning. great smile and overall welcoming. 

that said 3 eggs scrambled and bacon i ordered is a crime: egg 'juice' poured from a jug and the lowest of the low - microwave bacon! unbelievable.

how is druxys in business anywhere with this kind of crap they serve? hospital food puts them to shame. and to put the word deli next to the name should be punishable by planetary banishment."}
{"text":"Not bad for a smaller size, hospital-based Druxy's. The service here is quite good - the Asian guy is really polite, welcoming, and helpful with your order-related questions. The food is mediocre, both quality and quantity. The sandwiches are really small and basic, kind of flattened and ugly. You can do better with a panini grill at home. I come for the fruit salads, which come in multiple sizes, the smallest (pretty small at 8 oz if I remember correctly?) being $4 not including tax and you can \"make your own salad\" for $7/24 oz (and other sizes/prices), which is not bad. They don't have yogurt parfaits at this location though.

Come for a quick coffee or lunch, but wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have to or are pressed for time."}
{"text":"I'm at the Toronto western hospital for my monthly appointment with the clinic. I didn't eat breakfast yet. So I thought I would buy a sandwich from this place. I had a sandwich from a different druxy's before and it was good. Well was I disappointed with this one. 
The lady was rude and every time she asked me what I wanted. Her back was turned towards me. I had to keep asking her what she said. 
I ordered a BLT on an onion bun. She made the sandwich and started wrapping it up. I was confused, because your supposed to pick out your topping. When I said something she seemed annoyed. She was in a rush to talk to a guy that was waiting for her. 
Well I tried eat the sandwich and it was the most horrific thing I tasted. The bun was old and dense, which should have been thrown out. The tomatoes you could tell where from the day before because it was watery and slimy. The bacon was microwaved and thin. It was disgusting. 
This place is a disappointment and it's a shame. When the food and costumer service is this bad it affects the other franchises also. This place won't last to long as there serving old rotten food with a really bad attitude."}
{"text":"Why do all Druxy's make the customer ask for a pickle when it is supposed to come with every sandwhich??? Such bad customer service!"}
{"text":"OMG. I bought a medium fruit salad & some banana bread for myself & my dad when he was at Western Hospital for knee surgery. My dad went to eat the fruit salad & it was spoiled! I ate the banana bread & it was fine. Anyway, I went back there to tell the guy who sold it to me about the spoilt fruit salad & he didn't seem surprised. He gave me my money back. I asked him if he had anything fresh & he said that's all he had. He didn't even throw away the remaining fruit salad in the bowl where he served me from.  Awful! Save your money!"}
{"text":"There are a number of fast food outlets in the Toronto Western Hospital, but this Druxys Deli, next to the Shoppers Drug Mart across from the Food Court is open late to 8:30 pm so you can have a quick dinner and visit a patient for the evening. Reasonably priced corn beef & grilled cheese & chicken & tuna sandwiches, plus a make your own salad bar with fruits, vegetables & nuts & choice of dressings. Good choice of drinks too. Able to find a Sprite Zero. Woman with diabetes does not live by Diet Cola & water alone!"}
