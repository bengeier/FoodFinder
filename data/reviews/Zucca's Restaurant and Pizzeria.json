{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really did. Considering it's about 20 minutes from Newmarket, it was quite a drive.  But I had to try it out.   I ordered a medium pizza. It's a large medium, probably outmeasures most restaurants, so already you get your money's worth. I got pepperoni, sausage and peppers. Peppers are cut in cubes, pepperoni is fine, but the sausage is flavourless and placed over the pizza in giant chunks, as opposed to finely cut and placed more frequently.   The dough is good and chewy, but the sauce... you can tell it's homemade and pretty authentic. Very tomato paste tasting. I won't lie I wish there were some more herbs or spices.   Will I go back? If I'm in the area. Overall, the hype around this restaurant didn't really meet expectation. But it's an independent business and I'll always chose to support them over chain restaurants."}
{"text":"If you are anywhere in the Newmarket area, it's worth the drive up Hwy 48 to try Sebastian's new restaurant in front of Vlahos Trailer Park. Everything is homemade and delicious. My son wanted pizza but doesn't particularly like pizza sauce so he asked to have it made with honey garlic chicken wing sauce. I thought he was crazy...until I tried it! We had to make sure we had lunch there again on our way back from Minden, even if that meant we didn't eat until 2:30. In our two visits to Zucca's, we had 4 variations of pizza, the steak sandwich, the meatball sandwich and the chicken parmigiana sandwich and they were all excellent. If you're lucky, Sebastian's little girl Isabella will be helping out."}
{"text":"OMG  Beautiful place  Great people  AMAAAAZING FOOD  The roast beef sandwich is on another level"}
{"text":"As soon as I saw the restaurant, I felt an overall 70s vibe with its rustic yet quaint exterior. The interior is a cozy old-fashion style restaurant with a mini bar on the side. This was a recommendation from a friend who says this restaurant uses recipes passed down from a Newmarket family.   We ordered the Garlic Shrimp, Bruschetta and a XL pizza during our stay. The appetizers were simple yet tasty. The true highlight was the pizza; when they say XL, they mean it! The portion almost filled our table. For their crust, they use a thin crust. Overall the food is not Michelin level, it is definitely tasty.   The prices are quite reasonable with quite an attractive selection in their menu. On top of that, the service was quite good; they checked on is quite often. Definitely planning to come back to try their Parmesan items."}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza in the area!!   Found this gem through a friend and have referred them to everyone I know.  Their pies are always tasty and cooked perfect.   Our family orders almost weekly now.  Their prices are more than reasonable.  Ive been there only a handful of times and the owner knows me by name and always makes me feel like a valued customer.   Dont let those other couple whiney reviewers sway you (wobbly table? Flat soda? Shut it lady go whine to your hubby dont burn a good business owner with your one and only review - and to the other lady bitching about the decor... Get a life... You pulled into a restaurant in the front of a trailer park, get over yourself)  Its about the food, if they could afford to renovate it to be classier for you maybe they wouldnt be hidden away up hwy 48 in a trailer park restaurant space?!  I dont get ppl on Yelp.    I appreciate that Zuccas is pushing out consistantly great food to the local community at more than fair prices.  Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"Family friendly! Friendly people and delicious food at its best! Kids meals are exceptional value and I am a big fan of their Ponzerotti! You simply have to experience this football to believe it!"}
{"text":"I think my expectations were a bit too high. I love Italian food and go out of my way to try new Italian restaurants whenever possible.   Food: Pasta was cooked al dente but the sauce was a bit too heavy. Service: Very good - our server was pleasant and helpful. Ambiance: It's more like a sports bar than an Italian restaurant, and it was very loud.  Decor: Some called it \"cute\" - I call it outdated. Could use some updating and brightening up. Price: The price was reasonable for the food I suppose, but a bit high when you consider the decor, atmosphere, etc."}
{"text":"I always passed this restaurant and never gave it a second look, one day my mom and I were looking for a new place for dinner and we found this place! Glad we gave it a try. Lots of good home made food, portions were huge and prices were reasonable. Service was a bit slow that night but owners and servers were very apologetic, and super nice. Tried the Alfredo and spaghetti and meat balls and they were delicious! I saw some on the panzos and pizza they were bringing out they looked good, so I'll probably be back to try that!   It's a nice family owned restaurant. Give it a try! It's not a huge chain restaurant so if it's super busy they can't plow the food out in 15 minutes or less. It's homemade and made to order! Give it a try."}
{"text":"Have tried their bruschetta, pizza, wings and panzo! Can't wait to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Huge portions!! Great price! Their staff is wonderful. Try the Yorkshire panzo, it's amazing."}
{"text":"The food was good but they were out of a number of items today.  Pricing is ok but it fits the decor and ambiance.  Portion size is larger than expected and the pizza wasn't bad.  They appeared in to understaffed but the were moving.  I would try it again to see if today was somewhat off."}
