{"text":"Worst service EVER! I would of gave zero stars if possible. We went to celebrate two birthdays. We had a party of 12. It took over 30 minutes for us to get our orders. We all waited forever! We each had ordered and each waited for more than 30 minutes each! Other patrons came in after us and got their food before us. When asked they kept apologizing. Saying they were busy. The \"owner\" lady was rude!!!  The food quality was average. Ordered some nigiri sushi. There rice portion was huge! Four times the amount of rice to the size of the sliced fish. Could of made three more nigiris. Pretty sad. When we got our checks to pay we asked about their frequent stamp card. She said she wouldn't stamp our cards cause we had used the free birthday dinner promo. Hello we had to pay for three other people to get the promo so why wouldn't we get stamped. She said \"well we had a time limit and could of close you down.\" Meaning we went over our one hour time limit. Hello? We went over cause your service was slow and horrible. Constantly having to ask where our order was and asking for drink refills. WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"Although the area isn't very nice the food is yummy. Since I like to try out different sushi spots I came across Sage Sushi, so I yelped that sucker and went even though some of the reviews were low. But hey I like trying places even though some people might not like it. Everyone has their own opinion right?   As my bf and I arrived a lady greeted us and asked if we wanted to do AYCE or al la carte. I am a big AYCE fan because you get your money's worth and then some. I checked out the menu and saw some new stuff that I've never seen at some other sushi places. I came upon the creamy mermaid as an appetizer, I had no clue what was in it so I asked the waitress, who was indeed very helpful. Creamy mermaid is shrimp wrapped in wonton with cream cheese and with special sauce...umm yum!!   Must try:  Creamy mermaid- will blow your mind if not your outta your mind.  Mussels- good, has crab baked with it.  Oyster Shooter's- MmMm  Tako- my favorite  Screaming tuna roll- chef's special, was good but too much cucumber  Tako salad- with cucumber in vinegar sauce  Lychee Sorbet- chunks of lychee what can go wrong. Make sure you leave room, totally recommend trying it!   Overall, my experience here was fantabulous! The service was great, the chefs and waitress was very helpful, and very clean with Japanese decorations. Also, the waitresses get to wear the cool Japanese outfit. Prices are average $25.95 AYCE dinner. But if you go the day before, the day of, or day after your bday your FREE!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and good service. The staff is really friendly and very helpful on suggestion on what to order if your not a big sushi fan."}
{"text":"Located on W. Craig just northeast of rancho in the smith's plaza. Sage sushi must be one of my favorite sushi spot. It's delicious food  and great service makes this sushi bar an outstanding place to eat."}
{"text":"Good hospitality, good selection of rolls, free wifi, and birthday specials. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This was my go to place in north Summerlin when I was too tired to drive to Sushi Mon.  On two of my most recent visits I stopped eating after one piece of sushi because the rice was underdone and inedible.  To add insult to injury they charged my for what I had ordered and was unable to eat.  Over a 6 month period I collected 10 stamps and my next dinner would have been free, but I am so sure I'll be disappointed I don't even want to to there for a free meal!"}
{"text":"Delicious all you can eat lunch $21.95 every day.   Many types of nigiri sushi \"melts in your mouth\" for the super white (from the cod family).   There are spicy options for chefs rolls."}
{"text":"I just love this place!  They are friendly, kind and always ready to say Hi.  The Sushi is always fresh and the AYCE is awesome.  They have more rolls than any other place in town.  They offer free AYCE on your B-day too.  I like to go to local places and this one is always been a favorite."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Sage for going on 6 years now. In that time my friends and I have visited other sushi resteraunts. Some to our dismay. We always return to our favorite place. The turn over in wait staff has caused an ebb and flow with service. Common in the food industry. The sushi however is always of high quality in taste and creativity.  I enjoy the interaction of the chefs with the clientel. Its far better than the generic stoic composure of other establishments. It goes a long way in creating a pleasurable dining experience."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant, first of all its filthy,owners dont care, food is low grade standard trying to cut cost.it not a place for best dining experienced"}
{"text":"Overall a nice place to eat service is good but ayce was a bit overpriced in my opinion. The rolls that where made for me where all very skimpy on the fish and had a ton of rice.   Too much rice actually, I probably won't come again, wasn't bad.... Just not my taste for a sushi bar. I really enjoy the actual fish more so then rice."}
{"text":"Me and my man always come here. Food is amazing and the servers are very friendly. This place is a must go."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great atmosphere! The sushi was really good and the people working are really friendly! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Sage Sushi for almost 8 years now. They are right down the street from where I live and I absolutely love the owner and the staff who work there. It may be a little dated on the inside, but I love the kitsch 80's sushi vibe on the inside. I've never once had bad service, always fresh fish, and the chefs have always prepared everything quickly and effectively. My favorite thing on the menu is the Monkey Roll. The banana tempura with the white pearl sauce is so amazingly delicious. The AYCE portion of the menu is pretty extensive and they have lots of great options.   They are a wonderful little business and I will continue to be a regular customer of theirs. I've eaten at just about every sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. From The Strip's 5 star cuisine, to hole in the wall Japanese locations. Sage Sushi will always be my first choice when going out for sure though! They never disappoint! 5 stars"}
{"text":"oh, my what can i say... the best sushi... clean, fresh, and awesome price for ayce!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cold food, forgot we were there. Miso Soup was salty and not hot. When our food came, only half our order came out, while my mom waited an additional 15 mins and still no food for her. The owner said \"Its the Kitchens fault\" so we decided to leave. The owner said \"I'll give you 50% off\" cold food was not worth it. We paid for 2 rolls and left... never again."}
{"text":"Big change from the previous reviews as far as appearance. First the Chefs and waitress were in costume playing the part. They also advised me to choose more than 1 role because it could take some time in between orders.   Appetizers are included with All You Can eat. BIG Plus! The food came in about 10 to 15 minutes. But, I was 1 of five customers there. Now the bottom line.  This place needs a little more for example checking on your drink when the ice melts (I ordered Ice Tea). The Sushi was Average. So the price was expensive. All-You-Can Eat Dinner was 25.00. The special which comes with Saki was displayed as 32.00 per person.   This place has potential to get better. For now, I advise that you got to your local favorite so you don't feel like \"I should have made the extra Drive to get what I want.\""}
{"text":"I went to this place at 1 50 pm, which was 10 minutes before the happy hour. And by the time I sat down it was already 1 55pm.  So I asked the sushi chef if it was ok to start the all u can eat or should I wait till 2 pm. He told me it's fine, I could start ordering. It was ok in the begining. But they got a bit busy later on and when I try to order more sushi they try to pretend that they didn't hear me. And when I got my bill they charged me for the regular price because the waitress saw us came in at 1 45 . What a scam"}
{"text":"Walked in and was immediately seated by a very nice waitress which was the only positive thing I found.  While we were there, we were given menus with chunks of half dried fried rice, stuck in the pages.  While waiting for the drinks, there was a customer having a very loud, obnoxious political conversation with the sushi chef.  Dropped F-bombs in front of the kids.  Got up and left, no thanks.  Seemed overpriced anyway."}
{"text":"i really can't understand all the bad reviews, but i wasn't there for the experiences so it's not in my place to criticize them.  however, my experience here was different, and quite pleasant.  first, the owner is japanese, so you know you're getting authentic japanese food.  second, the sushi chef, as well as the cook are japanese, so it's definitely legit.    the problem with this place is perhaps the signs outside advertising AYCE and the pricing, as well as the \"free food on your birthday\" gimic.  i mean, let's face it, when eating establishments market itself in such a way, it does make you wonder about the quality of food being served.  that said, as i've stated above, my experience was pleasant.  i ordered the AYCE sushi for 25 bucks, and had the omakase, which was wonderful.  i also had a salad, miso soup, tempura, spring roll, and for dessert - green tea ice cream.  not bad at all, in fact i felt very at home and warm inside.  i can't wait to tell my parents about this little neighborhood gem of a sushi shop that i've discovered."}
{"text":"Most of the time I've gone here, even while sitting at the bar, normally there's a chef too drunk to serve. I don't know his name. The owner is kind. But I believe it's switching over to a new owner. They never have had uni. And I've gone here sooo many times. There's never enough servers. And most of the servers forget orders.   People are giving this place 5 stars because if you give them 5 stars, they'll give you a free soda or sake... but I don't get bribed easily. I'm just here to be honest..   All though I've gone here many times, it's only because everywhere else was too busy..  Maybe things will change with the new owner. & on Valentines day, they were closed.. just gonna say 2 stars.  They have sushi. Just takes a while to get to you."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was horrible. It took 2 hours and several times to tell the waitress that we order a Vegas roll. We finally gave up."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here at least 3 times a month this place is great, the food, service and the people are the the best."}
{"text":"Love Sage Sushi and the gang there. Ms. Mary is a great leader. The servers are great. I was helped by Susan today and the service was awesome. I enjoyed the Dream roll and the Creamy Mermaids. A good place and they don't hover over the AYCE purchasers."}
{"text":"..I'm updating my review.. while Sage has changed since I first step through the doors and chefs and servers have come and gone, this place has become my home away from home. Mary has become like a mother to me, and Joy, while she is a recent addition, is like my hanai sister (\"adopted\" in Hawaiian) and John, also a new addition, I found in him a good friend, and Salvador.. not too sure about him, I think he owned part of Mexico or something...?? and then there is Shinji San, who has become like a brother to me. I can always come here to get away from my troubles for awhile and find good sake and beer, great sushi and priceless company. Thank you to my family at Sushi Sage!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Food was Amazing!!!  We recently moved to the neighborhood, and was hoping to find a great sushi place. We found it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always nervous about trying new AYCE sushi places, but I am SO glad we came here. The sushi was delicious. I loved everything our server recommended. The chefs are amazing and super friendly, and it was so cozy. We caught the restaurant on a slow day, and it was perfect to try the AYCE. We'll definitely be back!! Shout out to the little gal that was our server, she said she was new to the restaurant but she's SO SWEET!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Did the ayce. Both sushi chefs and server was Filipino a first I have to say. $21.95. Place is out dated. Need to upgrade the furniture. A little too dark. Food tasty and lots of sides to order besides sushi. They have several tv's to view. They also have a all you can eat and drink. You can order full rolls or half."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price, my new favorite sushi place in North West las vegas check them out"}
{"text":"The worst sushi restaurant in Las Vegas !!!!! Horrible service from waitress and sushi chefs ... food is horrible just all around really bad place"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I used to dine here 2-4 times a month. If i hadn't moved 45mins away i would continue eating here. a must try for any sushi fan! the best roll in my opinion was the \"Drew James Roll\""}
{"text":"First time eating here and it's AMAZING!!  Great taste, beautiful presentation and great value. Thank You"}
{"text":"Great food and good service! The menu has not only sushi but also some traditional Japanese dishes like  katsudon and different bento box meals. The variety is nice because I can eat here with friends who don't like raw fish but they can still find lots of options. Try the Screaming Tuna Salad... absolutely one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with a friend, who had been recommended by a friend.... The atmosphere was pleasant and appeared clean. The wait staff was friendly, albeit somewhat slow, and accomodating of a service dog (the floor is carpeted and there is sufficient space under the table for a SD). The food was good; I enjoyed the seaweed salad and found the sushi to be tasty. Not all the fish was exceptional, but it was good; and there was a nice selection of specialty rolls (I recommend the Monkey as a dessert roll). I thought the AYCE price was a bit high at almost $27 and I'd be more likely to rate it 2.5-3 $ signs (I'm used to $20 for AYCE else where). All in all I enjoyed myself and I will return to Sage when back in town."}
{"text":"This little sushi bar is not fancy but it is a spectacular neighborhood bar.  I eat here a couple of times a month and the food is always excellent. Service can be slow if they have a big group in eating all you can eat but when it's just small table of 2 or 4 people the service is wonderful,fast and friendly!   Try the creamy mermaids, the screaming tuna (salad and roll) and my personal favorite the Asian pillows!"}
{"text":"We've never eaten inside and always order to go over the phone. I like it. Their spicy rolls are among my favorites, but my wife isn't into spicy at all. They have tons of different kinds of California rolls.   Price varies from cheap to expensive depending on how many rolls you get and what kind of rolls they are."}
{"text":"When I walked in the door, it felt like I was in a sushi restaurant in Kobe, with the bamboo entrance, and the running fountain.  Being greeted in Japanese, and the waitresses dressed in Kimono's was quite impressive.  Food presentation was definitely 5 star.  I didn't have to ask for drink refills, I actually had to ask the waitress, to stop refilling my drink.  I had the chicken katsu dinner--it came with california roll, vegetable and shrimp tempura, salad, miso soup and sliced oranges.  And one can order entree's or all you can eat sushi--and if it's your b'day, they have specials.  The price is reasonable, and I am definitely returning to try their lunch menu.  You can't beat Sage Sushi Bar."}
{"text":"It was good but super pricy in my opinion. 63.00 for my girl and I for LUNCH. The board behind the bar said a large hot sake was 6.00 and when I was checking out was charged 7.00. I had all you can eat and my girl had the baked Alaskan roll..."}
{"text":"Good food the creamy mermaids are awesome they are worth the trip for sure. Staff is awesome they know your name and know your order. We go about once a week it's our go to spot, and we will keep going back for the excellent service and the great food."}
{"text":"My regular Sushi stop Cici is great  The chefs are terrific and fun  I come here a couple time a month  Baked Muscles The Dream SSS Hand rolls ....it's all great every time"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Sushi chefs are amazing! Waitress so so. We eat here so often that we keep a punch card. Then we noticed on the punch card one of the host/waitress crossed out the word \"lunch\". As much money we have spent here I don't like when restaurants become greedy and start to rip off loyal customers. Just saying."}
{"text":"Food was great and so was the customer service. The interior was clean with a nice design. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New owner has taken it too another level new carpet paint chairs menu etc  Love the service love the food"}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night around 6:45.  Waited about 20 minutes to get seated.  Another 20 minutes for waiter to appear at our table.  Appetizer was great!  Sushi was good.  I've had better, but we were quite hungry, and ordered several rolls.  After 2 bites, all the rolls start to taste the same.  Vince the waiter was efficient, but no personality or recommendations.  Would  I return?  Probably not."}
{"text":"The sushi here is delicious. The only drawback is the service, its def hit or miss. Jamie(waitress) is wonderful. She is friendly and attentive and if you eat their often enough she even learns what you like and will suggest your favorites when you sit down.   Our favorites are the Lisa Lisa , Hurricane Ahi, Japanese Lasagna, and creamy mermaid.  The environment is clean and traditional and usually not to crowded."}
{"text":"NEVER GO HERE. As soon as we walked in, we were given a tray, at the bar. They were \"fresh out of the dishwasher\". However, they were dripping wet, and when I reached out for mine, there was a sauce like substance that I got on my hand.  When I tried to tell the waitress about it, she didn't believe me, informing me of how \"clean they were\". I had to show her my dirty hand for her to wipe it off. She didn't even offer me a napkin. When our drinks came, my friend noticed big black floaties in her glass. The waitress blamed it on the tea filter. Another waitress asked if things were going ok, and I said no, telling her about the dirty items. She argued with me about it! What kind of staff argues with a customer!  WE WALKED RIGHT OUT, AND YOU SHOULD TOO. If I could give ZERO stars, I would. This place is filthy!"}
{"text":"Went in for AYCE lunch, place was empty. Service was good, but the fish didn't seem as fresh as other places. Not to bad of a price."}
{"text":"Why bother with \"all you can eat\" when everything tastes the same? We went here to celebrate a birthday. We were waited on by the owner a waitress, who described the owner, \"Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde.\"   I actually enjoyed our waitress, who tried to make our experience enjoyable. She was constantly deterred from her mission by the proprietor, who gave her nasty looks any time the waitress tried to be helpful.  The sushi specialties are mostly cream cheese filled, deep fried, greasy concoctions that were hard to distinguish from each other.   The best item on the menu was the lemon marinated Tako (octopus). The ebi was also tasty.   If you are into spice and heat, their jalapeño popper roll doesn't make it. I asked for their hottest menu item and found it mild.   If you go here, stick to standard sushi, hope the nice waitress wasn't fired for knowing how to do her job, and look out for Mrs. Hyde!"}
{"text":"If there were such a thing as a neighborhood sushi bar, this would be it. The location is cozy, the service is familiar, and the food is just right. I'm not sure I'd pick it as a date night destination, but it is a good spot to grab lunch or catch up with a friend if you're in the North Vegas area.   They offer AYCE and the rolls are fairly creative, but the combo meals are the best deal: the sashimi or sushi plates come with multiple courses of soup, salad, tempura, and rice before you even get to the main plate. Unless you have multiple stomachs or answer to the name of Matt Stonie, you'll probably be too full to finish, and it's under $20."}
{"text":"You won't believe it from the outside but this place rocks and has the best sushi.   Don't tell anyone it's our secret."}
{"text":"Friendly. Great if you're in the NW & if Shinji is working. He makes it fun & adventurous- always coming up with new things."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and the sushi was ok. Some of the fish didn't look very fresh, specifically the salmon. Also some of the cucumber in my rolls tasted weird. I dunno If it was more of a texture issue or if the pieces of cuke were too big...I really can't explain it.   They have 3 menus. One is for AYCE, one for lunch specials and an ala carte menu. I went with AYCE and ordered the rainbow roll, Japanese lasagna, 2pcs of super white tuna, and half of the sc7 and volcano rolls. The lasagna was good but it fell apart when I tried to pick it up. I hate that! I shouldn't need to use a fork to eat my sushi! The rainbow was typical rainbow except that cucumber was so prominent it overpowered my roll! Boo. My favorite was the sc7 it was a cali roll wrapped in soy paper with spicy crab, a touch of cream cheese and avocado. Price for my lunch was $23.73 with tax because I didn't order a drink just water. They also have an ayce special which also includes aycd (all u can drink) with choices of Draft beer or sake and that runs $34 something per person. The service was fine no problems there but I can't say I will be going back. There are too many other better sushi spots around town."}
{"text":"What a great find, very cozy place. Walked inside and found they had very nice decorations, nice music and friendly staff.  I came right when dinner started had a great conversation with the sushi chef, the original chef when the place opened 5 years ago. Said that he returned about year ago so I imagine many of the lesser reviews were for other sushi chefs.  My favorites were the Spider Roll and the Cabo Roll.  Spider Roll - the plate presentation of the soft shell crab was great, sauce spiraled in the middle of the plate with soy and seaweed wrap.   Cabo Roll - great combination of spicy tuna and salmon - loved the crunch of the roasted sesame seeds.  Overall loved the care and attention from the authentic sushi chef, unlike the crowded mass made sushi places at other AYCE like Yama. You won't be disappointed to stop by this local place.  Was a fan of their specials as well: Options for all-you-can-eat/drink, happy hour from 9-10:30pm, and a stamped card, 12 visits and next visit free! If it's your birthday bring 5 guests and your meal free (before or after your specific birthday is okay)   All these reasons are compelling enough for me to come back versus driving all the way downtown or Chinatown for other Sushi spots, a must for those in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I was hooked the first time I came here. The waitresses have an upbeat attitude and are willing to work with whatever needs me and my friends have as customers, however when the owner is around they are reprimanded for even having a 10 second conversation with a customer, even if it's about the food, which is something that needs to be improved. The interior of the restaurant is not the greatest, it looks like they bought their decor from big lots; go elsewhere if you are looking for a location to host a formal event. The menu has a decent selection, I've never been dissatisfied with any dish I've had there. They do not try and scam you by adding copious amounts of rice like I've seen other restaurants do. The orders go in very quickly and are never messed up. I absolutely love this place and know refer to it as our \"usual\" sushi place and will always come back."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The waitresses are nice and friendly. Love the lunch specials and bday special!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and decided to come here for date night. It's close to where we leave so we figured why not? We ordered at least 6 rolls each with your sides and all the appetizers. The baked scallops... let me tell you... they were AMAZING. I wanted to order more. Something with the sauce is what got us addicted. I suggest if you stop by this place, you HAVE to try the scallops. Also, the customer service is high up there. Our rolls were made within 5-10 mins. (Under 10) the hostess/waitress really took the time to get to know some customers from what I saw including my boyfriend and I. It's a really great atmosphere if you're looking for just a quiet date for some sushi. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi restaurants in town.  Some may say that the exterior is a bit tacky, but I prefer understated.  To be honest, the fact that this place doesn't have the same curb appeal as some of the trendy spots makes the dining experience much more personal.  For the most part when I'm in the restaurant, I see the same familiar faces.  As far as the food goes, anything that I've ordered from the AYCE menu is great.  Appetizers and dessert are included, which is great.  My wife doesn't eat sushi, so she always orders from the a la carte menu, and she can't think of a bad thing to say, either.  I come here with my family (wife and two young daughters), and I never feel awkward bringing my kids in.  The first time we ever came in, the sushi chef saw my daughters and cut up an orange to look like a bear, just for them!  The food, the atmosphere, and the general pleasant nature of this place keeps my coming back."}
{"text":"I don't get these other reviews.  The atmosphere is a little dated but the food is great.  They have some really wonderful specialty rolls.  We have always found the staff friendly and fun ( even taking several shots of saki with us). i can honestly say my wife and i have tried 95% of all sushi restraints on the North side of town and enjoy Sushi Sage the best, scan bet the food and price."}
{"text":"Went to Sage last night on the recommendation of some friends and I will not be going back.  The service was terrible, the worst I have ever had in a local restaurant.  The restaurant was only about half full and they had at least 3 sushi chefs working.  We were there for almost two hours because it would take 20 minutes or so between rolls.  Our waitress was indifferent and unapologetic.  The restaurant is also a bit run down and had a slightly funky smell that I noticed when we first arrived.  The food was ok, not the best sushi I've had but certainly not horrible. Maybe it was just an off night but I don't think I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Horrible. Took FOREVER to get food EVERY SINGLE TIME WE ORDERED for all you can eat. Not happy. I don't recommend you eat here unless you like to wait around more than eat."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!! The chefs are entertaining and we love our waitress. We love the creamy mermaid and their stuffed jalapenos, not sure what they are called but they are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Last Friday it was time to concur all you can eat sushi.  We met friends there who love this place as the food is awesome,  staff is friendly and they are quick.  Except for this night.  The place was pretty much packed,  which is not unusual for a weekend night.  Upon my arrival at 6pm, my friends and hubby were already enjoying appetizers.  As soon as i sat down we started the craziness of all you can eat sushi.  From there it all went down hill.  Rolls were taking forever,  when i finally received my baked roll it was more like a burned roll.  My dream of eating this delicious Japanese lasagna roll fell to shambles from the first bite. My friend sat and watched while we stuffed our faces as her simple roll still was not on the table 50 minutes later.  Her hubby who pretty much had lost his patience at this point, couldn't believe it. As we watched the waitress deliver my roll to the wrong table,  as well as others customers looking beyond upset.  Not sure what gave it away,  the pissed off look on everyone's faces maybe... This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth.  Either get more help,  get people that know what they are doing, oh and hire some people who don't use the word f#$k every time something goes wrong, or simply treat your customers better.  My friend who finally got to eat her roll after an hour,  God's blessed you with lots of patience my friend.  Oh and the kicker,  we still had to pay full price,  great management.  :-("}
{"text":"Decent sushi. Not a bad place I get your sushi fix."}
{"text":"The sushi  has been always fresh but the other day the rolls were just not as good as they have been, maybe different chief ?  waitstaff is super but over all best so far."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service.  Portions are smaller than most places, tasty sushi. however, rolls have too much rice. Try the candy came roll, it's interesting!  The waitress kept taking our plates too soon, rushed us w/ ordering & cut us off from ordering more by asking us if we are full yet.   Probably won't return."}
{"text":"I was seriously underwhelmed by this restaurant. Granted, I was a bit wary to even go here when I heard \"all you can eat sushi\" -- that almost never goes well -- but my friends were quite insistent on going.  True to what I expected, there was nothing particularly positive to report about this restaurant. Everything is designed to get you in and out with as little fish in you as they can manage. You are limited to one serving (2 slices) of nigiri. I didn't even see an option for sashimi, which is generally the majority of what I eat. All of the rolls were made mostly of rice, with very little filling -- again, a tactic to fill you up quickly. The rolls were very loose and fell apart easily. What little fish I did actually get was certainly not up to the standards of freshness that I expect.  Overall, my experience here was only memorable in the fact that I will remember not to return."}
{"text":"I went here about a month ago and was so disappointed! The fish didn't taste fresh at all and I've never been so sick after eating sushi. It was awful. Though the waitress was nice that was really the only good thing. I got the ayce so that I could try different rolls. I couldn't find one on the menu that was good. Such a let down. On to finding a sushi place I like...."}
{"text":"My wife's favorite sushi bar. The staff know when we come in its a out to go down. We've tried other places and we keep coming back to sage."}
{"text":"First of all the service was very slow. As soon as I walked in I notice that another table were making complaints to the server. The sushi had way to much rice. And the food sucked so much that I didn't want to finish it. The sushi chef was using his cell phone and touching his cell phone and then touch the sushi he was making without washing his hand. This has to be a health code violation. And worst of all the server was really really really rude. She had a bad attitude and did not even try to take care of us. She did not refill my drink even though she could see that it was empty. Very poor service and very bad attitude. And the food did not taste good at all. She took forever to bring me my check and when we left she did not even acknowledge us. WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED. PEOPLE DO NOT EAT HERE. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE. HORRIBLE. I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN. I HOPE I SAVED YOU THE DISAPPOINTMENT."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating AYCE. I was surprised at how nice this place was.  All of the rolls I had were yummy. My favorite was the Pretty Woman. The staff was very friendly and are glasses were never empty.  The red bean and green tea ice cream were tasty. I already want to go back and try more items."}
{"text":"this place was clean, the ambiance is nice and the place was cute.   they have late night happy hour starts at 9pm, AYCE sushi for $19.95!!  Everything on the menu was awesome!  they don't do half-rollsl which was disappointing for a sushi lover like me who loves to try as much as i can on the menu.   TIP:  come here with a group of friends and do AYCE so you can order and try out more on the menu. The more the merrier!!   Service: the waitresses were super nice.   Wait:  We had reservations at 845, but didn't get seated until 910pm. The place was busy, which was understandable."}
{"text":"This is a good AYCE sushi place around here. Sushi chef is really nice. Their fish is fresh. Just one thing the miso soup was too salty..... maybe it's been sitting for a while...?"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for 8 years.  We always have excellent service, and the food is great-always fresh.  Especially love the creamy mermaids and baked mussels.  Best place in town for AYCE sushi!!  Thank you Sage Sushi!"}
{"text":"Friend took me here for dinner while I was in town, it's an AYCE sushi bar ($26.95) the food was pretty good, mostly rolls/cooked items on their menu though. This place is located in a strip mall, a little confusing if you are entering the plaza from the wrong way haha  It's a mom and pop shop, decor is a bit dated but I guess you are going here just for the food. I would prefer it to be a little bit more updated only because it feels a bit dingy.  Had their salmon and octopus nigiri. Fish is pretty fresh. Could've ate those all night! My friend doesn't eat the raw stuff so I was able to try a bunch of different rolls. Chicken teriyaki roll was a bit odd to me haha I'm personally not a teriyaki fan so to put that in a roll was just not normal to me. Baked mussels were delicious!! I'm not a mussel fan but I really enjoyed it. The sauce was really good. Creamy mermaid was good too, light and fluffy batter. Japanese lasagna was too rich for me. I love cream cheese but it was overwhelming. Melted cream cheese over the roll and a slice on top, it was smothered in cream cheese! straight up heart attack haha Alaskan roll, was OK.. I wasn't expecting the salmon on top to be seared. Overall the food was good but I would prefer going to another AYCE spot that my other friend recommended."}
{"text":"This place deserves 3.5 stars but just isn't good enough for 4. The AYCE happy hour special for $19.95 is amazing but there are definitely some issues with this place.  The decor inside seems a bit old fashioned and depressing, not to mention the music was played from a CD player that was skipping every few minutes which was really distracting.  The menu itself was a bit small but the Nigiri was plentiful and all appetizers/desserts were included in the AYCE price which was a nice addition. Not to mention they had lychee sherbert which was interesting and a great way to finish the meal. Sadly the roll choices seemed a bit dull and a lot of the rolls seemed similar. All that matters is that the sushi was really fresh and the nigiri was delicious. Couple that with the lightning fast and friendly service and I will definitely come back here for AYCE Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Second time at sushi bar sage. First time I got a bento box. Second time the lunch AYCE. Staff is very friendly. The atmosphere could use some updating. I generally wouldn't recommend because the fish did not seem as fresh. The price is a little bit cheaper than some but not much."}
{"text":"great lunch special, good sushi, great sushi chefs, friendly staff, and i like the environment. It was a good find! i'm a regular... :)"}
{"text":"We've been here several times in the past. In fact, this is where my husband's love for sushi started. We moved to henderson a few years ago and don't get out here that much so when we were in the area yesterday we decided to stop by for lunch.   Our experience was very disappointing. The fish did not taste fresh (had a tinty tast), there was no flavor in things like the garlic tuna (which is hubby's favorite), the spicy tuna, or even the tuna salad. There really weren't any good choices for lunch as the menu was very small.  The service was even worse. We had to ask for refills and anytime you looked for the waitress she was no where to be found.   When it was time to pay, she would not stamp our frequent visit card because it wasn't dinner (that's ok, you won't have to worry about us using it).  The only good food was the creamy mermaid and the Goya (please note, these are not sushi items)  All around, we were very disappointed. This place quickly went from our favorite sushi resturant in this area to the worst. We are done and won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my my favorite resteraunt in la s vegas. Great chefs, staff so friendly I look forward to,my visits. The only sushi place you need to visit in this city"}
{"text":"Ill be brief, but honest. The deal is like this: -Used to have owners who worked in the resturant, now you don't see the new ones  -Prices went up, number of items on AYCE went down  -Old owners used to let the sushi chefs 'try' new ideas out for you, and if you didn't eat them, so what! New chefs tried new ideas-WITHOUT ASKING ME WHAT I LIKED, i hated it, then they threw out 3 COMPLETE ROLLS due to me not liking tuna. However, at the end, 1 did not eat 3 pieces of a roll I ordered-so they tried to charge me $3 due to not eating.  -Old decor: nice, peaceful, relaxing and pleasant to have a conversation in. New decor: cluttered, dim, looks like its from an old hotel  -Even the roll names were taken from Sushi Zen and Sushi Loca!  -AYCE punch card, after 10 meals then next one is FREE. Cool, i thought. So I brought in a punch card with 9 punches on it, then my wife and I EACH had AYCE. So they punched my card for the 10th, then gave her a card with 1 punch. I said \"Excuse me, hers should be free I believe, that would make 11 meals total.\" ...to keep this VERY short, let's just say the owner wasn't there, they couldn't tell me who the Mgr on duty was and I ended up paying for the whole thing. Do the math you idiots, I've spent roughly $200 with you, now I bring my wife her for her birthday and you can't give me the meal for free?? Even though on the 10th time ITS FREE!?  To the new owners: Treat people as PEOPLE, not customers. Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me. I had to get my own refill twice. And the fact that the ONLY white blonde girl working there TEXTS WHILE ON THE JOB and is still employed is mind blowing. Sell the place back to the old owners, who knew my face by my 2nd visit. You however have seen my face MORE than they did and Ive brought groups of 9+ people in and you don't think of me as anything but $$.  To the folks reading this: Go to Sushi Zen, not much further up the road, MUCH nicer employees. If you don't care about AYCE then head to Sushi Loca off of 95 and Ann, that place is an AWESOME atmosphere  Sincerely, a FORMER customer"}
{"text":"Sushi Sage is my go-to sushi joint.  I eat there about once a month, and have never been disappointed.  The menu offers a fair selection if nigiri sushi, and a lot of rolls that span the gamut from simple and traditional to the \"How dirty can we make the name of this roll\" game that all sushi joints indulge in.    I did not realize how special this place was until I took friends from Phoenix.  They told me that an equivalent meal in Phoenix would have cost over $100 per person, and would not have been nearly as good. Sage Sushi is now a required stop whenever they are in town, and we enjoy every visit!"}
{"text":"I have to say that Sushi Bar Sage if my go to place for sushi in North Las Vegas. It has fresh fish and I get great service. You have to know that sushi eating is an experience and having a great relationship with your chefs is critical. I have that type of relationship. I really never have to order because they just know what to bring. Give this place a try and get into the experience. It is great."}
{"text":"So completely disappointed in the service we had tonight. This has been my favorite place for so many years. We were here for over an hour, no drink refills, no napkins, had to ask for chop sticks, wasabi ordered all you can eat and between two people received one roll and a few nigiri and we waited and waited after an hour being there were asked if we wanted to order more..... we still had not received what we ordered to begin with. No it wasn't busy there were 3 other tables who appeared to be finished and just chit chatting.  AYCE was a bust as we waited so long and knew we wouldn't get our moneys worth."}
{"text":"This is my goto sushi spot its pretty close to home I know the chefs and they are consistent on quality and service."}
{"text":"Decent for AYCE. I like the fact they offer cucumber wrapped sushi, I just wish they would offer more choices with wrapped cucumber. I love getting salmon, tuna and red snapper nigiri with a spicy garlic sauce. That rocks. All their other rolls are standard fair as far as AYCE goes. Waitress was very friendly too."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential as a neighborhood sushi joint. My sister and I came here for lunch and the sushi was pretty good! The service was pretty awesome as well everyone was really nice and attentive.   My sister and I will definitely be coming here often!"}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good and the best green mussels I've ever had. Service was slow but $35 for all you can eat and drink??? Hell Ya!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I am beyond aggravated right now. My boyfriend and I came here a month ago and absolutely LOVED IT. Except today... The guys at the sushi bar are absolutely amazing. Super friendly and great with giving the perfect suggestion and everything tastes AWESOME. It's the waitress we got. We are leaving tonight and definitely not paying. We got here and right away the waitress was rude right away. We had ordered our appetizers right when we sat down. 20 minutes pass and still hadn't received anything. We ask her for our mussels and she said \"if you order it, it's gonna come. You don't have to ask.\" Im sorry, we've been waiting 20 minutes. 4 lousy mussels don't take that long. We'd already gotten our first sushi dishes from the bar and EATEN them before we got the mussels. She could tell we were upset, but didn't even apologize (I was pissed about her attitude). Next thing, we were almost done with our food and we hadn't had a refill yet. THE GUY AT THE SUSHI BAR MADE HER COME OVER TO REFILL OUR DRINKS! So, she brings our drinks and leaves right away. We try to flag her down to order our last items and she for some reason keeps walking past us and looking at us but blatantly ignored us. My boyfriend gets pissed and takes his first drink of his refill and immediately spits it out. SHE SPIT IN HIS DRINK! You can tell the difference between spit and soda. I am beyond disgusted by this sad excuse for a woman. We don't know what she does and does not have. That is absolutely disgusting. If I EVER go back, I will only receive service from the sushi bar guys. I HOPE YOU GET FIRED!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Sage for years and I have always really liked it. I'm a huge fan of the Asian Pillow and Asian Green rolls. Our favorite waitress recently left and since then the service has been horrible. On our last visit my dinner companion got all of her rolls (and was done eating) 45 minutes before I even got my first roll. When I asked why it was taking so long they told me that one of the chefs was new and he didn't know how to make the Asian Green so he just put my whole order aside.  I'm very disappointed to take Sage out of my rotation, but with the last 4 visits, each worse than the last, I can't, in good conscience keep going there."}
{"text":"I visited here a few years ago and their AYCE sushi was really good. Last week I was back in the neighborhood and decided to go there for dinner. There were quite a few customers there, but the place wasn't packed, we placed our order and waited....and waited...and waited.....over 45 minutes for our first sushi roll to arrived. People who ordered after us had their orders, but not us. Once the food arrived it was mediocre at best and mostly rice. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"My son Birthday is June 28th. He has autism so this is the first time in 22 years he asked for a party....He asked to go there..We both liked it there before this day.. I had 5 people in our group...We got there about 6:30..My son got to eat free for his big day..there was one waitress and one guy behind the sushi bar...It was a little busy..We all order drinks and about 5 rolls at one time...she never wrote the order down..we had to remind her what we order a couple times...so she was bringing us one roll then another 10 to 15 min apart ..it was like this for the whole 2 hours we were there...I ask the waitress why is it taking so long \"she snap at me\".....We order All You Can Eat....this was crazy...I've been coming here for 6 years... She was so RUDE to us I was getting pissed...In 2 hours we had ate 10 sushi rolls ..we were still hungry when we left but I was done with being treated this way  My son ate free but it still cost $143.00  They lost me as a customer"}
{"text":"Sage has become our sushi place, that is until tonight.  We ordered 2 AYCE and one Deluxe Tempura Platter.  The sushi was not nearly as good as it has been in our past visits.  The rice was overly sticky.  A number of the rolls that we ordered were fair at best, not even considering the rice.  We had an assortment of leftover pieces from those rolls that weren't good - and they wanted to charge us .50 for each piece.  If it were good, it would have been eaten.  I let it be known that an added fee would be completely offset by the tip.  I was told they didn't care.  The owner, Mary, was very rude, and made a few whispered remarks.  When I questioned what she said, I was told \"nothing\".  (There was no additional charge)  We had to wait a full 20 minutes to get the bill - and that included asking every server.  Another 10 minutes before someone would take the payment.  Our stamped card for a free dinner was almost filled up, but we ripped it up before we left.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have AYCE! the staff is always so friendly. the chef is so polite and will recommend things based on what youve already ordered and is very accomadating. i love the sushi here just as much as the friendly service. i have an amazing experience every single time! I used to frequent oyshi but it started going downhill and then i found sage.. its a billion times better and at a much better price!  the best sushi in vegas, hands down."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to spot but over the last couple of months it has been going down. Started with a couple things coming off the menu. Last night I went in and it was dead. I sat down and the waitress brings me a menu I notice its new so ordered a water then began to look it over. She comes back and I order my normal starter creamy mermaid bake mussels and salmon collar ( witch they never have). She informs me that I can only get two items. So I say let me get the mussels and collar and I'll order the mermaids later. She says no only to items period. I asked well why call it ayce she said sorry the owner changed the menu. I've had talks with the manager before so I guess I shouldn't be suprised. So seeing there was only one chief I knew there was something different. Needless to say me and my girl left on her birthday to find a new one and did I. Won't be coming back here again. Sasa sushi on Cheyenne is my new home."}
{"text":"Not busy for a Saturday night. Rolls came out quick and we're tasty. Not fantastic or over the top delicious. Baked mussels were our favorite along with the Japanese burrito. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is that the place was empty. Beside our group there were only 2 other customers."}
{"text":"I had the AYCE lunch at Sushi Sage Sunday June 1st. I was meeting with a friend to review plans for upcoming events. He suggested we meet here. I jumped on YELP and honestly I was a bit concerned with some of the reviews. Although I only gave them 3 stars it was a good experience. We were seated right away, the server took our order right away and our rolls were served right away. The waitress was very attentive and there was not a delay with our additional orders. My only problem was the window price for all you can eat was $21.00 and change when the bill came it was $23.00 and change. Seems like that would be something they would have taken care of. I have not had sushi in a while so not complaints. Need a sushi partner so it may be a while before I have it again. I go to many different eating places but for some reason I do not enjoy sushi as much alone. If anyone knows why that is please shoot me a note. I also thought just North of $60.00 for two AYCE with a soda and a tea with tip was a tad high. I always like trying new sushi spots. So hit me up with your recommendations."}
{"text":"I gave it one star because I had to this is by far the worst service and food I've had however Juliana was awesome if they had two of her I might not have had to wait an hour for my miso soup with four squares of tofu. Asian lady kept taking orders never writting a single item down which also meant we didnt get anything we asked her for..funniest thing was when he told one of my friends that she couldn't order because she had already placed an order, all she had ordered was more ginger lol anywho for the price stay away!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went here once and we will never come back again We were there doing all you can eat ordered a bunch of stuff and we only got 2/12 things we ordered. We were there for a hour!!  Constantly had to ask for more water because every time they would forget to bring us some.  We decided just to leave.  And to top is all of They wanted to charge us (2) $26 all you can eat.    They only brought us california roll and salmon nigiri!!   Hell no.   We went to mc donalds after."}
{"text":"I should start off by saying I am not the world's pickiest eater. I've eaten a ton of good food that was expensive and a ton of mediocre food that was cheap. This place is definitely more towards the \"delicious\" side of the scale.   My date and I shared a few rolls that the waitress suggested were her favorites, and they were all pretty good. It's not a place I would consider nearly as good as Yama or Ichiza, but it was solid. The place itself seems a little bit rundown, but not enough that I would say it's a detriment... it just has character. We were seated promptly and the waitress was super nice, though I do kinda feel she forgot about us once or twice. I also felt like I had too wait entirely too long to get the first rolls out to us considering the place wasn't jammed.   This is a place I would return to if I were on that side of town again, but not a place I would drive out of my way for. It's definitely an ok spot and you won't feel like you're being gouged, so it's worth a try."}
{"text":"We got here at 6:30pm they started taking our orders at approximately 6:45pm and there is only one waitress and one person making sushi .  They have a so call hour limit for AYCE and now it is 7:29pm and we are still waiting for food.  Left at 8:50pm probably short on some rolls but we got tired of waiting.  That probably was the plan!   The restrooms were clean!  It wasn't too crowded.  We had a few Sake bombs, all came up to 153.00 for five ppl.  Not too bad.  The birthday boy ate for free."}
{"text":"Got a great deal off Groupon. Food was great and service was awesome! Tempura Shrimp roll and samurai rolls were so yummy!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the past and tonight I was pleasantly surprised and honored to be taken care of by the owner Thein. After a short conversation as to what I like he immediately started to Custom make my sushi to my preferences of fish. WOW! What an amazing burst of flavors I've never experienced at any sushi place. I'm eating while I write this and the more I eat the more I am really happy with what's going on in front of me.  Run! Don't walk to this AYCE establishment. Forget the hype about the new and exciting sushi place on the strip. Get back to basics and start patronizing off the strip places with great service and wonderful delicacies. I could on and on but I was just served another delectable treat. I'm going to stop right now because I'm missing out on the next Custom dish coming my way! And here it is!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We always come here for lunch. There is always great service and good sushi rolls. I usually do al la cart and my husband does AYCE. So far everything we tasted here has been delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant. Joy is so friendly and fun to talk to. I've been coming here for over a year now and have had a great experience every time."}
{"text":"this place is solid.  good california rolls.  i think the owners are real japanese people, sushi chef is really nice.  bathrooms are clean and it has an \"A\" food administration rating, so it meets the health standards.  just looks kinda odd from the outside, with pink neons.  inside is nice though."}
{"text":"The fish was not fresh, Had better store bought Philly roll which is really sad. Good server but food is not up to par. Won't be back here anytime soon. (Least till quality gets better)."}
{"text":"Horrible service ... nasty food! Sprite - dirty water California roll - sewer Spicy tuna roll- not spicy Philadelphia roll- dull Edamame- from a frozen bag microwaved Green tea ice cream- pinezol    After 30 minutes of waiting for the server we called her over and she acted offended... Save you money and time."}
{"text":"Updating my review because I've become found of this cozy little spot ..      Creamy mermaids are to die for, and their baked mussels are just about the best we can find in Vegas. The fish is always fresh and the waitresses  are attentive and friendly..  They have a great a.y.c.e. menu . Just  $26.95 per person from 4-1030 pm, or opt for a.y.c.e and drink for $39.99 .    They have a great menu , and I've noticed alot more fish and alot less rice in the sushi rolls than before. All in all we have tried just about everything on the menu and have loved just about everything we've tried.   Will add more pics next time.. I was too busy eating.. :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in town! Wonderful staff and incredible food. If you like crab, I highly suggest the Dragon roll!"}
{"text":"The rolls are pretty good. The servers don't communicate at all. Three different servers came to us, sometimes asking the same things. It interrupted eating and created confusion."}
{"text":"I love this place it's my favorite sushi place In North Las Vegas! Great staff. I always sit at the bar. The prices are fair and they have a really good menu.  Try the \"creamy mermaids\" and the \"hurricane ahi roll\""}
{"text":"Best sushi bar in the NW!!! Great staff & great food . I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped in to try this place out. We sat at the bar and were helped immediately by a friendly waitress. We ordered the AYCE and started with a volcano roll. This was a good choice, I really liked this roll. The Itamae Hiro was a master roller and we had a good conversation with him. Very friendly and accommodating and sticking to Itamae tradition was helping us find new rolls we may like. The sushi bar was starting to fill up now but every order was made with precision and speed. Very impressed with this establishment and the Itamae was from japan so you just know hes good. The fish was fresh and tasty and the appetizers and desserts were included in the AYCE price which was $19.99 and $35 if you include all you can drink Saki and Sapporo. The ambiance was traditional and comforting. This is going to be my new favorite place even though it is out of my way."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We've been coming here for 4 years. It's not in the best neighborhood, but the food is good! We always do AyCE with all you can drink Kirin and sake. It is so worth it! Everything we've tried there is sooo good! They don't have ridiculous rules like other AyCE establishments. The owner and sushi chef are really nice sweet people and make sure your taken care of.   Its not a fancy place but if your looking for a place to fill your belly up with great sushi and a good buzz, then this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location or the the old booths and furniture fool you, this place is awesome!  The waitress we've has always been attentive, and the sushi chefs are quick with a smile and even quicker when doing up your roll.  Then there is the sushi.  It is really good.  Being landlocked in the middle of a desert in Las Vegas, it's tough to get fresh ingredients.  But I've always believed that while fresh ingredients help, it's all in the preparation and execution, and these guys know how to do that.  The rolls aren't sloppy, the ingredients are appropriately measured, and the presentation is great.  To be honest, I might have given it a 4 out of five, but we've gone a few times now and they are consistently good and always trying and improving.  A solid sushi joint in this desert oasis!"}
{"text":"Cute and cozy spot; the service was great we had the AYCE menu which was below par and a very limited selection, definitely will have to come back and try their lunch combos and other items that reviewers have mentioned!"}
{"text":"No frills, old school.  It was clean and had food customer service.  Rolls seemed a little small.  We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Food is not good... The chicken tasted spoiled and the sushi was not good. No Flavor what so ever in the sushi."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi house in north Vegas. Friendly staff and amazing sushi chefs . Toshi is the man!!!!! Always go back because of the great food and friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"The sushi was lacking freshness, which made it taste below average. It took close to 45 minutes to bring out a beer my group ordered, which was too late since we finished our meal. The attentiveness of the servers was absent. One perk that made the meal more enjoyable was that my friend received a free AYCE, because it was his birthday. My stomach bothered me after the food digested and I had to use the restroom frequently if you catch my drift."}
{"text":"Sushi Bar Sage or Sushi Sage as I like to call it has me hooked. I must confess this was the first AYCE sushi place I was taken. I have celebrated a birthday there as well.  The AYCE menu is a decent selection. There is something for everyone. I am a fan of cream cheese rolls(yes it still counts sushi, snobs haha) which they have. I had some octopus and eel rolls this last time that were yummy. I recently have started trying some nigiri rolls and the Cajun albacore is yummy. Has just enough kick for me. My friend had their tea and said it was good(she should know she loves tea). I have a habit of not leaving room for dessert but when I do have it, it was yummy.  It's not a super big sushi place but I kind of like it. We usually strike a conversation with people sitting at the bar and the sushi chefs are friendly. Sitting table side is not bad either. A good tip I give to people is at least give a order of a sushi your familiar with so then you can have some sushi being made while you decide what you want. Sage also has a stamp card. I don't know if they always did it or if it just started.  Sage gets 4 stars for food and service and because of some good memories I have from going there."}
{"text":"Place is so good. Never busy or packed and super hilarious sushi makers. Atmosphere is fun and food is delicious."}
{"text":"7/13/17 - Update - I went to have dinner with family here just the other night. It was terrible !! I had not been there since 4 years ago. I was told after a bad review on Facebook that ownership had changed a year ago and to give them another try. We went in and everything was the same. Same waitress - CC forgot everything. We told her that we had the chefs hair in our food and did not want that roll that had the hair. She said sorry and no one offered us any complimentary anything for that. When I looked at both Chefs , they were both so drunk , they could barely keep their eyes open. There was an 8 women birthday party at the bar and all the one chef could do was lean on the Sushi counter glass over the food prep area , hold his forehead up , touching his skin. He kept moving his baseball cap forward and backwards , which probably resulted in grating his hair off in the food. Whatever happened to hair nets for food makers ?? All the sushi that was presented at our table was sloppily thrown together and every single roll or nigiri completely fell apart. The quality of the cuts and freshness was C grade at best. They said this was new ownership but everything was exactly the same as 4 yeara ago. Same waitresses , same chefs , all the same decorations. Even the disgusting Unagi was the same. Sages Unagi always had a weird look and texture , and it smells bad and tastes foul. I have never had Unagi this bad and would not even eat it. Unagi is always my favorite anywhere I go and this was not Unagi. I dont know what it is ? Umiya is our usual go to place and they are 5 star quality. I will never be back to Sage again !! Sage was also empty that night , like every other time I have been there , not a good sign. Umiya is completely packed everytime ; a great sign !!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Las Vegas to go. They have a new owner and management but the same traditional sushi chefs. Shinji is my all time favorite and I love their special for all you can eat and drink for $39.99. It includes draft beer and hot or cold sake. If you don't like sushi then they have bento boxes for really good prices."}
{"text":"I guess if you like AYCE this may a good place.  They overdo it on the rice but the nigiri is good as well as the salads, tempura and desserts.  Otherwise it's mediocre for the prices they charge.  Services is spotty, atmosphere different and AYCD a good deal."}
{"text":"SAGE IS  NOW UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!! Food portions are small and prices have gone up!"}
{"text":"Been here one, and I'm gonna go out of m way to say that this place is probably going to be out go-to AYCE Sushi joint.  friendly staff, attentive, a nice ambiance, AWESOME food too!  Although I must say I've never been a fan of time limits on AYCE, but I guess people can and do take advantage of it.  And the fact that out kid don't eat for free :(  I just made myself crave for some sushi"}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time on a Sunday afternoon at 1:00 p.m. for AYCE. The afternoon (11 a.m. - 4 p.m.) and late night (9:00 p.m. - 10:30 p.m.) AYCE is only $21.95 daily. The place was empty; we were literally the only customers in there. It was not fancy; it's just a basic, but well kept atmosphere. The waitress was very attentive and pleasant. The sushi was delicious. We had about 10 rolls between the three us. My only semi-complaint is that the sushi chef was an older gentleman and a little slow with the sushi-making. We were done with the first roll and waiting before the second roll came out; then the same between the second and third. However, by the time we got to roll four, he was on it. The rolls started coming out much quicker; we would be still working on the rolls at our table when the waitress brought out others.  We were nearly done by the time another two sets of customers came in. So if it had been crowded, the service may not have been as quick and we probably would not have gotten the great attention. Overall, I thought it was delicious and well-priced. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Nope, nope...won't come back here. My cousin enjoys this place so we all went and I am not a fan as she is.   Food: The rolls were mediocre nothing so great to rave about. I hated the calamari we got, the texture of it was gross and the breading too, My guess is it's frozen crap. My goddaughter's fried chicken was bland, no seasoning. Edamame had so much water in the bowl - it's called straining but I don't think they know that.   Service: Was so crappy! We would ask one girl for a roll or drink and she would say ok and never come back. Had to keep telling the other lady just to get what we already placed (or so we thought placed) with the other. They kept bringing orders that were not ours or got our order wrong. We asked for a whole roll and half of another but got the opposite. By that time we were so tired of the screw ups we gave up.   Atmosphere: Eh! The places seems kind of dingy. Went to the bathroom and happen to look up, the ceiling is sagging and completely cracked! Just not appealing. Enter at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I use to frequent Sage often but it is now under new ownership, whom has totally changed the place and does not honer any of the things that made me love sage in the first place. Its almost like the Grinch has taken over the restaurant, and now you can tell its about the profit line not customer service!. they have lost a \"loyal\" customer."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and we love it!  Service from staff is great.  If you want really good sushi Sage is the place you should come."}
{"text":"Amazing quality and selection of fish, generous cuts, and most of all, delicious! The price is standard for all you can eat. Includes all you can drink for addititonal charge to ayce. Presentation is beautiful and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This isn't a fancy place for special occasions, but a good neighborhood bar to eat fish and drink beer. We have been going there for 8 years, and its had ups and downs. Current owner is very nice and friendly, and like most places struggling to balance price and quantity. Quality of fish always good. AYCE is very fair, especially lunch 11am-4pm. They take care of their regulars, we don't even order, just let them take care of it. Some of the best rolls we've had aren't on menu, just creations by chiefs. And above all, the Saporo is cold."}
{"text":"First time here,  just 2.5 miles away from me and being handicapped one bus str8 line makes it easy for me to get here.  My son brought me here as a bday for me.  We both love sushi.  I had two cut rolls.....volcano, and samurai,  appetizer of creamy mermaids and plum wine.   My son had ayce, included....volcano, monkey roll, lava roll, Dragon roll, salmon surprise,royal Cali.   All the rolls were great. Great customer service and cook."}
