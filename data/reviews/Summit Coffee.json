{"text":"Hip, quintessential coffee and pub near the college campus. Great selection of their own locally roasted coffee brand,  as well as Counter Culture options. Small place adds to the Main St. charm. It's usually busy...and that's a good sign."}
{"text":"Besides this place being the hipster haven of davidson, its a really neat place to go grab a bite. The coffee is the best in town without a doubt. They also have excellent teas. My favorite thing to get here is a spinach scone with hummus. Its to die for. Really. The best/most intersting times to go are probably Wednesday and Saturday night. Local bands come and play, and if you are a high school or college student its a great place to hang out and meet new people."}
{"text":"We came in while waiting for the farmers' market to open. It's a bit loud inside, but the staff was fantastically, extremely helpful and friendly. I got the red fruit herbal tea."}
{"text":"The best atmosphere in town for casual conversation or reading a book.  The coffee and scones are great as well, but the atmosphere really makes this place."}
{"text":"Great! I'm a coffee snob, no Starbucks for this gal, unless its an emergency! With that being said, the coffee at summit was AMAZING! I had the straight up caffe latte and it was perfect. Lattes aren't meant to be steaming hot and Summit's was the perfect temp. Would highly recommend. Plus they have a pretty cool atmosphere and has a wide variety of coffees and beers! A++"}
{"text":"Had the iced white chocolate mocha. What a cute place to just chill and get a cup of coffee. I'm a coffee snob and I can be a pain when it comes to how it tastes but this place was up there with my standards :-)"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend Summit highly enough. The ambiance is relaxed and warm, the service is friendly and welcoming, and, most importantly, their coffee is excellent. You truly can't go wrong ordering here; there's not a bad choice on the menu. The expansion to the Davidson campus is most welcome. I only wish it had been around when I was a student."}
{"text":"A great local coffee shop with a warm and inviting atmosphere.  There's a large selection of drinks with plenty to choose from.  The service is friendly and pretty quick.  On the weekends, they usually feature a local musician or band which only adds to the community-based feel of the place.  Summit is a great place to grab a coffee on the run or to stay and relax."}
{"text":"My new favorite coffee shop. Great coffee, super friendly staff, interesting clientele, and beer! Just a great vibe overall."}
{"text":"I love this place so much I had to write a review. Literally the best mocha I've ever had. The baristas are so nice and the other staff are super friendly. If you buy coffee bags, then you get a free sticker or pin. Highly recommended! I came all the way from Winston Salem to check it out."}
{"text":"Summit makes Davidson what it is. It's the perfect place to meet to chat, study for exams, or attend a low-key concert. Summit has a really cool vibe and good drink and pastry options. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Great little Coffee shop!! Friendly staff, indoor and outdoor  seating...  Trendy fun spot and I love the Mourning Bird cookies..."}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like about Summit is that there isn't one on every corner! I am a pretty faithful Starbucks patron but I would pass it up any day if it meant drinking a delicious beverage from Summit.   The atmosphere totally rocks, the epitome of a neighborhood coffee joint. The coffee and espresso is super fresh and STRONG. Sometimes I find that Starbucks and other coffee places don't serve up the freshest java but that is certainly not the case at Summit. They are always serving up three or four different types of brewed coffee and they have a latte of the day. They also sell pastries, yogurt, and sandwiches (REAL FOOD!).   I truly envy the Davidson College students who spend their time hanging out there. Jealous."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the area by far. Great house coffee and variety. Perfect place to have coffee outside. Very knowledgable staff as well."}
{"text":"The place is too small and the drinks are just okay for the price. I brought three kids into see them, and the service (read attitude) was bad as well, not that the people who work there are ever really hospitable."}
{"text":"i used to love this place. lately it is overcrowded for such a tiny space and the upstairs is swarmed with kids rather than peaceful and cozy as it used to be. new workers are awkward and very very slow. two coffees took 15 minutes and they all were asking each other how do you make whip cream. none of them knew and ended up trying and failing at making it after waiting another 10 minutes, so no whip cream. kept giving this place more chances but they no longer have my business."}
{"text":"Delightful location, great seating, love the branding, and above all else delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"We like this place a lot. Nice neighborhood atmosphere with friendly staff. My friends and I really enjoy hanging out inside or outside just a great place to be seen."}
{"text":"Really great locally roasted coffee house.  We lucked out by going on their 18th anniversary so our house blend cups were free!  We split a pastry that was just okay...so this review is more for the coffee and atmosphere.  They have seating inside but there is a nice back patio area that overlooks some real green spots and a nice lower deck as well.  Relaxing."}
{"text":"I love this quirky cafe.  When the weather's warmer the tiered patio in the back is great for soaking up the sun while reading a book.  It's frequented by college kids from Davidson.  On the whole it's generally quiet & a great place to get work done.  The first few times I went there I had no idea there was an upstairs, which has couches & comfy chairs for relaxing.  They have music on the weekends & local beer as well, I just never get up there in the evenings."}
{"text":"The people working at the campus location were so rude and seemed deliberately obtuse when we met our daughter for lunch there over family weekend. I remember the last time I visited they were like that then! She informed us they are always rude and indifferent. If I were the owner of this business I would want to start fresh with a new crew after some customer service training."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late-night fix of caffeine on the road, passing through Davidson.  Got a double macchiato and a latte immediately after.  The latte was among the best I've ever had.  Amazingly creamy and balanced.  Can't recommend their espresso enough, very nice surprise from a pit stop for caffeine!"}
{"text":"Woo hoo I love finding out about coffee places that are unknown to me, especially when they are locally owned. They have any kind of coffee.tea concoction you could ask for plus a variety of cookies, breads, quiches, turnovers and other delectable treats. Small joint with a narrow space to line up and order with walls adorned with pictures of Davidson sports teams, campus and local art. I got their chai tea which was absolutely perfect--not scolding hot but warm enough to keep me toasty on a cold night.   I wish I lived closer to this place, I would definitely go back for their drinks and to hear the live music they have at night. Staff was a bit apathetic for my liking, especially in a coffee house setting but I really liked the atmosphere of this place......it's Davidson hipster-licious."}
{"text":"Beer in a coffee shop?! I have to tell you, I really love the South...  But that is not the only reason I love Summit Coffee. I love Summit Coffee because it is the perfect local spot. When you first walk in, it looks like a standard coffee shop. Then, you realize there is good local beer on draft. (What can I say? I love beer) So, you order you beer or coffee and look around for where to sit. Now, you could deny yourself the pleasure of exploring and sit in a booth right across from the espresso bar or you could explore. I am going to recommend you explore. If you go upstairs, you will find yourself in a cozy area with couches and a lot of silence. Not the place for talking. It seems everyone upstairs is studying or reading. So, you go out the back door and find yourself on an open outdoor patio. This is the spot for conversation, sun, and (on select days) live music. This is the spot you can come to when you just need to relax. This is truly as good as it gets. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love finding local alternatives to Starbucks, and Summit Coffee ranks as one of the best!   The ambience is fantastic, and I love hanging out listening to the music on weekend evenings. There is free wi-fi (the reception can be spotty if you sit upstairs) and outdoor seating.  Not only is the coffee fantastic; it is also sustainably grown. I like a strong cup of joe, and theirs certainly meets my expectations. I can't speak to all of the blends, but I know the dark roast (our usual order) is shade grown and organic. They sell beans as well, so you can bring the goodness home with you!  The Chai lattes are delicious, and in addition to coffee they have beer, sandwiches, and pastries. They also can make French Press coffee on request, which is sooo good!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming back to Summit since high school (about 7 years ago). I didn't know what to expect, but it was pretty good.   The atmosphere:  This place is very small when you walk in but has a vintage/modern feel to it. They have very tiny tables (about 6 I think) that can only fit a small laptop. There is one long bench along the wall and the other side of the tiny table is one chair. If you have a big group you probably won't find a table. I went at 2:45 on a Monday afternoon and I barely found a seat. There is a back patio that is large and would be nice to sit at during spring/summer. There is an upstairs but I didn't go up there so not sure what it is like. The lady at the cash register was nice and friendly!   The coffee:  I'm not used to fancy coffee shops and ordered a macchiato to go.. they lady looked at me funny because it is a small drink (thank you Starbucks for making me think a macchiato is a big cup of coffee!). She was nice about it and followed my request! It was bitter (since there was only cream in it) but surprisingly it wasn't too difficult to drink and I never drink black coffee!! It was smooth and rich. I would actually get it again (in a legit coffee cup).   This is a staple in Davidson and of you are looking for quality coffee step in for sure! It's priced about the same as coffee shops. Most things were $3.50-$4.50 a cup! They also have cakes and sweets!"}
{"text":"Loved it here. Has the vibe of a pretentious hipster cafe in some boho chic city neighborhood, but then you start talking to people and while it may be hipster-looking it's anything but pretentious. Sort of like a taste of a New England college town, but everyone is polite, makes eye contact, and doesn't cringe if you say the word \"decaf\". Plus? Big on the environmental impact reduction. Big box on my list checked there.  Nestled in the college town of Davidson, this little cafe has enough charm and appeal to keep me coming back for a long long time. Loved it."}
{"text":"A great coffee place that has great quiche. The employees are extremely helpful and it has it's own personality.."}
{"text":"For some reason, the coffee at summit has a horrible taste that I can't describe. It's almost sour like. Everyone else that has gotten coffee here tells me the same thing. I decided to give it another try this morning and order the chai latte, it was like drinking water. I think I'm better off with my Pete's coffee at home. I only go to summit on the nights music is playing. They have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"A centrally located coffee shop, with good brew, and occasionally some live music.  If I lived in Davidson I'd be here all the time.  Great for a quick in and out cup of joe, or for a slower paced pastries and couch time upstairs.  I hadn't been in forever when I went a few days back.  I used to see the same smiling face of Dave Beam there all the time, I hope he's still there.  I don't have a whole lot to say in this review though.  I was just in and out.  The coffee was fine, but not amazing.  Hopefully I'll catch a show there soon and give you guys an update.  FYI:  The dark roast was REALLY dark."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop on the main street in Davidson.  Coffee is good and the outside area looks really nice."}
{"text":"Every single person that works at summit is extremely rude, the coffee is not good enough for the employees to be rude."}
{"text":"Yesterday I found my neighborhood coffeeshop in Cornelius, a cute little café on Bailey Road.  In the mindset of not of OD'ing on it, I wanted to diversify the neighborhood cafes that I go to and find other spots for good measure.  I found Summit on yelp and thought why not give it a try.  Though it took me an additional 10 minutes on the road, I am happy to have ventured to Davidson to make it here today.    The neighborhood has a college town feel to it and is super quaint.  The café itself is on South Main Street next to a lot of other local businesses and does its job of representing as the resident coffeeshop.  It actually reminds me a bit of the places the cast went to in the movie \"Reality Bites.\"  Summit just has a quirky rundown feel to it with mismatched furniture, spongy dark flamingo colored wall paint, and interesting photographs in cool frames all over.  The best is the antique lamp in the corner, and the guitar displayed on the fireplace.  This is all the charm on the second floor where they have several outlets and plenty of seating.  As another yelper has pointed out, there are also three other areas where you can sit - downstairs, the front patio, and the back patio.  Wi-fi is free and reliable too.    As for the coffee, it's REALLY gooooood.  Their fair trade coffee, which they call \"total quality\" is organic and free of pesticides.  It's grown under a canopy of shade trees, which is a traditional and natural farming method of conserving land and nature.  The taste is rich and strong without being overpowering.   The last toot I have for Summit is it's team of founders.  They're a bunch of rugged outdoor adventurists who've climbed around the world and have this amazing coffee franchise.  How cool is that?!!!"}
{"text":"Great location in downtown Davidson, and good quality snacks and bevs for a morning or afternoon at the local coffee shop. Their 1 lb. bags of coffee are a little steep at about $12 each, but I guess you're paying for the name and quality. Frequent customer cards are a big plus. They have scant seating indoors downstairs, but upstairs they have some extra seating (and I think they just redid the upstairs!). There's some outdoor seating, which I wish more people would use so that the indoor seats would free up for those of us interested in using the internet and being able to read our computer screens. Sometimes it gets jam packed with college kids during the school year, but that's to be expected when you're walking distance from Davidson's campus. I will continue to come back for an occasional caffeine fix, and I might try to check out their weekend concerts this summer, too!"}
{"text":"Davidson isn't high on my list for a visit any day of the week, but each time I've found myself in the area, Summit is a go-to.   Full disclosure: The coffee is mediocre at best. I'm spoiled down here with varieties from purveyors who craft each drink and the fare at Summit is a little obligatory. However, I'm happy to grab a cup of drip coffee and chill in the gnarly atmosphere.   The interior is rather homey, the upstairs is a great escape, and the back patio is perfect for temperate nights. They even have live music here frequently.   These guys also house quite the variety of local beers. Last time, if I recall correctly, growlers and bombers were available. Big plus.   If I find myself in the Davidson area, I'll definitely come here to plop down and do a bit of work. I can definitely see this as an obvious college spot as Davidson College is right across the street. However, I think there's still plenty of appeal for the person looking for a respite or quiet place to chill or chat.   Good stuff, Summit."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a variety of comments. I am not by any means a coffee expert, but a drinkers of it and enough to know the various roasts. 1) this place is so small its annoying. 2) dont like the cheap little table to put your own sugar / cream in, because they dont have the real estate space for that OMG. get rid of that. Some customers are so disrespectful they are in no rush to keep the moving line. 3) I agree with post about the staff experience & I'll leave it at that.  4) Coffee tasted like a wet cigarette and I dont smoke. Oh & grinds in cup - come on now. 5) $$$ for coffee - really..  I wanted to like this local place, but sorry it didn't pull through."}
{"text":"My visit was brief but enjoyable. There's some sitting on the left side, the right side is the lengthy bar. Behind it is every conceivable concoction of caffeeine and decaf in the known world. As a non coffee drinker I appreciated the loose leaf tea jars behind the bar (though they should not be in glass to keep them out of light) and the tea list sheet so I didn't have to try to read the tiny labels.   The weekend afternoon I dropped in was such a nice day that I was happy to find a small unshaded porch out back with umbrellas at the tables. Neither my cell phone nor laptop would connect to the wifi so I can't say it's great to get work done but it's good for a respite."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever had, and that's no exaggeration. Summit has high quality beans, talented baristas, and a slew of other non-coffee offerings (notably craft beers on tap) that have had me going here since I first moved to Davidson as a freshman at the college.  Summit is also well connected to and invested in the Davidson community. Local musicians and artists are regularly featured, trivia night is a blast, and their twilight race series has helped give back to the community via charities and awareness events.  Highly recommended - be sure to stop in, even if you're just passing through. If you're not, bring a book and grab a house mug and unwind."}
{"text":"One of the better cups of coffee I've had in awhile.  Got a cup for the road.   And I hate to admit it, but I didn't finish it all on the drive back to Raleigh.  I brought it in and left it on my counter.  Reheated it in the microwave the next morning.  (I know. You can judge me.  I can handle it.)  Well guess what?  It was just as rich, flavorful, and wonderful the next morning.  So there."}
{"text":"This is my second time attending Summit Coffee. The first time not much to complain about, but this afternoon the coffee was atrocious and the simple syrup tasted like vinegar. Not to mention I was greeted with a not so lovey worker."}
{"text":"Great selection of coffee tea and alcohol. Nice environment. Pour over coffee here is top notch. My only complaint is the WIFI is painfully slow most of the time. Outside of that servers are friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! I went two times in a days and the worker recognized me.  Awesome customer service.  I had  a cappuccino the first time, and an iced latte the second time. Both were really good! Someone in our family had the milk shake, I think it was called the glacier, and it was SO good! Tasted like chocolate and peanut butter!!!!   The vibe in this place is so chill!!!! Cool music, awesome paintings on the walls. Just wish they weren't so expensive or I'd buy one.   Definitely found our regular coffee place! No more Starbucks for us."}
{"text":"The best medicine for the relentless rain recently is a great cup of coffee.  Summit definitely fits the bill.  I really like their Basecamp blend, perfectly bold.  If that isn't good enough for you they have a menu of pour-over options now too.  And they have cold brew on tap.  The baked goods are tempting but I have successfully avoided them so far.  I am sure that will change soon, stay tuned."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment - Summit has great drinks and a great vibe. Truly the centerpiece of the Davidson community, like any good local coffee shop should be. Great place to grab a quick coffee or linger with a latte or a local craft brew upstairs or on the patio."}
{"text":"The family and I wound up in the Davidson area on an impromptu vacation when we left Florida ahead of Hurricane Irma's expected arrival. The friends we stayed with suggested, when they found out about my love of local coffee shops, that I check out Summit Coffee. I made sure to do just that.  On my first visit to Summit, yes I went twice during our four days there, I turned my back on my normal coffee drink. Instead I was intrigued by a special drink Summit was offering that mixed lemonade with coffee. It sound absolutely hideous but, like a rubbernecker or a train wreck, it sound so hideous that I just had to try it. It took a few sips before I realized just how terrible of a decision that was. This drink was not good. It wasn't the coffee's fault. It probably also wasn't the lemonade's fault. Those two drinks just shouldn't be partnered up. Like a terrible marriage, they do nothing but bring each other down.     I couldn't leave Davidson with that bad taste in my mouth. I mean the friends we stayed with said this was the best coffee they've ever had and I couldn't believe that their tastebuds would be so far off. So before heading out of town I drove back to Summit and took a coffee to go. This time I was not swayed by trainwrecks or out of the ordinary drinks, I went with my tried and true drink. The iced latte with vegan milk was absolutely on point. It wasn't overly saturated with sweetness, I could still get a sense of the great Summit coffee taste. I loved the taste. There wasn't the lingering bitterness in their coffee that I dislike about some of those chain coffee shops.   So, in short, go to Summit and get your drink of choice and you'll most likely be pleased. If you stray outside of that, watch out, you could find yourself face-to-face with something truly scary."}
{"text":"Perfect coffee shop for a college town.  In town to move my daughter in and needed a good cup of coffee, not the hotel kind.  My daughter recommended Summit and it did not disappoint.  The coffee was excellent and freshly brewed.  The coffee of the day was superb."}
{"text":"Yeah, good coffee. Now on to the irks. What's with the seating? Downstairs they have only tables for four. About 6 of those. Almost EVERY time I'm there most tables are occupied by just one person with their nose in a computer while nursing a cup. Multiple times I've seen 6 people monopolize 6 tables for over an hour. Why don't they put in some barstool/railing seating and some two-seaters, too. Give me some sitting space people. And upstairs? Gross! Sticky, stain (?) covered couches that look like rejects from Sanford and Son. It misses the quaint mark and goes right to trashy. Place needs more thought concerning the customer AFTER they make a purchase. And the Howard Johnsons orange chairs out back? Whoa."}
{"text":"Local coffee shop in the very quaint downtown of Davidson.  Good local vibe with many coffee, bakery, and beer choices."}
{"text":"Summit Coffee is the coffeehouse nearest to Charlotte which makes me feel as though I'm an entire world away. It's a quiet, cozy place where they take not only the coffee, but everything they provide their customers quite seriously.  The town of Davidson is lucky... and they ought to consider bringing in more independent businesses to downtown, rather than so much gentrification. First and foremost, Davidson is a college town, not a condo community off I-77."}
{"text":"I can always rely on Summit as a place to relax and hang out. Rarely a line to order but always moves quickly when there is. Baristas are very friendly.  Chocolate milkshakes are amazing! Mocha with almond milk met my expectations. Made-fresh-daily macarons and other pastries pair perfectly.  Be sure to stop by for trivia night Wednesdays and live music almost every night as well!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and coffee is good.  I actually prefer Starbucks, but this little privately owned establishment has a lot to offer.  We go there often"}
{"text":"One of the greatest coffee shops in all of NC. This is the definitive coffee shop for Charlotte. Yes, even better than Amelie's coffee, which sounds sacrilegious, but this small place lives up to the hype. Consistently great cups of coffee and lattes at Summit and a fun little place to pop in and/or hang out.   Service is friendly.  Parking is luck of the draw, but usually, there are spots outside across the street."}
{"text":"One of the nicest staff I have ever encountered at a shop. The location can be iffy because it's in the dead center of Davidson, but a walk through town is very beautiful. I always get the box turtle mocha with whip cream. It is oh so sinful. They know exactly where their coffee is sourced also so you always know where it's coming from!"}
{"text":"A fantastic coffee shop with excellent teas, coffees and bites to eat. The ambiance is soothing and relaxing while the staff friendly and knowledgeable. I was there last night to meet a friend who regularly attends the monthly live music show. Last night they featured three musicians from different backgrounds who each played the acoustic guitar and sang. We sat on comfy couches, drank beer and wine and really enjoyed the show. I'm looking forward to checking out the show next month. I don't know much about local microbrews but I enjoyed the Brown Dog Ale (I think that was the name) that I had. The environment lends itself to many activities and may even inspire you to do something creative. When you're in Davidson, stop by. You'll be a fan."}
{"text":"Loved this little coffeeshop I stumbled upon during my stay in Cornelius.  They make a tasty chai latte and there is ample seating upstairs.  They have wifi and most people are doing work so it's relatively quiet.  Check this cute place out - lots of good shopping around as well!"}
{"text":"I travel pretty frequently for work and the more I try new coffeeshops the more I realize that Summit sets the standard in my book.   If you're looking for coffee, don't look elsewhere, come here - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I dont get there as often as I would like to, but honestly this place reminds me of the coffee houses in Chicago that I used to go to."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Latte taste wonderful. Some of the staff very warm and friendly others a little aloof to say the least. Delicious pastries that are mostly baked by a local pastry goddess, although you won't find much in the way of gluten and dairy free or \"clean\" food. Several smoothies offered healthy and fantastic although not organic. Although the other local coffee shop in town, Salon Café, offers organic non-GMO as well as other milk choices, for some reason summit doesn't want to do this. They will remain popular and always busy however - they're in the middle of town and a staple for locals. Milkshakes made to order and little snacks as well for on the go. Great outdoor and indoor seating, in a quaint old historic building, lots of perks such as live music frequently, and other events. A lot of community building activities centered here. There is a strong flavor of a conservative town in the south embodied here here, so if you travel from elsewhere be aware of that, but it is a not to miss spot if you're living in the Davidson area or visiting..."}
{"text":"Very cool local coffee spot. Good variety & many options.  They offer outdoor seating & is perfect if you catch the right time of day."}
{"text":"I admit that I've had the privilege of discovering some truly wonderful independent coffee shops (Busboys & Poets, Crema Cafe, Philz) -- Summit is among those that are okay. It's a college-town hangout and serves that purpose well, but those looking for exemplary coffee and a place to dig in to a book or power though some work for hours on end will be disappointed. There's much to be said for the outdoor seating and free wifi, and it's pretty easy to find free public parking -- though comfy chairs seem forbidden commodities."}
{"text":"This is by far the best coffee shop I've ever been to. Their coffee and smoothies are delicious. As a student, my Sunday morning ritual was to grab a latte and sit in the cozy upstairs lounge to study. Now, as an alum, I really miss this place, but I have a great excuse to go back and visit!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, friendly, coffee...not great. Tried several times at the behest of my wife (who likes it), but won't waste my time anymore"}
{"text":"Um, how cute is Davidson? Summit is a great little coffee shop downtown- interesting mocha flavors with Ghirardelli Chocolate, including white chocolate, milk chocolate and carmel specialties. We popped in after lounging at the Cottage at Lake Norman and grabbed coffees before a movie at AMC- looking forward to visiting again and spending some time on campus and downtown Davison.  Great coffee drinks, though WAY too much whipped cream. Next time I'll tell them to skip that part."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars for the following reasons: great atmosphere, solid coffee, lots of seating options (indoor, upstairs, front and back patios), good beer selection, live music, always seems to be open even late.   I don't give the last star for the following reasons: leaving pastries out for flies to land on them (gross), apathetic/mud fence personality employees, mediocre food, higher prices than comparable inde coffee shops."}
{"text":"Had two amazing Lattes!! It is rare to find a coffee shop that has such an extremely talented barista. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"New to NC I've noticed that the majority of the people seem VERY friendly and helpful. I'm not sure what happened to this location, but they clearly didn't get the memo on friendliness or customer service. The lanky employee with glasses was not helpful at all and seemed overwhelmed with hardly anyone in the shop.   Their menu is very limited and the majority of the food items are gluten free. I asked for an iced coffee hoping it would be sweet and at least drinkable, but it was utterly disgusting! I took one sip and left the entire full glass on the table!   She had an Affogato which was also horrible! Bad tasting coffee with a scoop of ice cream which should be gelato. We also ordered a slice of their Nutella Cake which surprisingly was edible and not bad. Overall I would NEVER come back, and truthfully have had better coffee at Dunkin Donuts."}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable coffee/drink shop. Quick service, strong (but not bitter) espresso, and tasty looking pastries.    If you're familiar with Boone and love Espresso News, cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker, but I like the chai, I like the tea, I like the diet coke in glass bottles. And I love the sense of community + the free wi-fi + sitting on the deck with friends on Friday afternoons. Am a big big fan of Monday night Trivia Competitions as well - great way to have fun and fill a bar on a Monday night!"}
{"text":"Being from Huntersville, I have visited Summit multiple times and had an enjoyable cup of coffee and the experience. However, upon recommending to friends and family - the customer service they experienced was unprofessional and to put it simply, comprised of a complete lack of tact. When the barista was questioned regarding different coffee makes, an attitude was given back. Both my friend and family member have lived in the area for years; my friend was profiled due to her accent and the barista (female on Sunday's morning shift) actually referenced Dunkin' Donuts in a rude manner. Funny. I'd actually rather spend my money at Dunkin' now! - save your money y'all, hit up Waterbean Coffee for great coffee AND experience. Forbid they snarkily mention Tim Horton's to someone next..."}
{"text":"Best coffee I have ever had, best staff, best atmosphere..perfect place to grab a coffee, snack, or beer/wine. They have live music too several nights a week."}
{"text":"When you go to Summit, you'll usually find a long line that is worth standing in.  The line moves pretty quick and the coffee is worth the wait...savory sweets are excellent too!  This is absolutely a local hang out and for good reason - good coffee, efficient/friendly service and historic ambiance in a cool, old building.  So if your in the area, swing by Summit for a nice cup of coffee and a treat.  You can also go at night for craft brews too!"}
{"text":"I travel the USA quite regularly and I must say that Summit is one of the best coffee (plus!) shops that I know of.   The quality of the roasts and baked goods is top shelf and the rotating beer and wine selection is great for exhausted parents.   The upstairs alcove is great for studying students, quiet conversations, first dates, etc.   They really support the local community and have an excellent back patio. A \"must-do\" for my European colleagues whenever they're here in America."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and plenty of seating. I love that there's outside seating in the back too. My boyfriend and I both got lattes and they were incredible!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly! It was my first time, my husbands third and they recognized him, which was refreshing to see!  I had a iced latte that was good, we father had a chai clone milkshake that he liked and a glacier full which is a chocolate milkshake with espresso. I liked the glacier go myself.   We will be back for the music nights, have a beer outside and enjoy the space. Very small inside, but have a larger seating section outside in the back. They also have seating in the front.  Good place to grab a coffee and walk around to look at the local shops!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go into Summit which is usually 10ish the staff are rude and just not friendly at all.  I mean SPEAK to me when I walk up...no customer service at all. If you hate serving customers get out of customer service! ESPECIAllY when my coffee is involved. I mean that is one thing I really look forward to in the mornings, and getting it there is just a let down...."}
{"text":"Summit offers Davidson a cute small town local atmosphere without the feel of a chain coffee spot. They recently (within the last month or so) painted the interior and changed some of the seating options downstairs. The upstairs \"lounge\" is COZY. Great for some light conversation, but the real convenience is the ability to grab and go.  Food items at Summit have never been a hit for me. I've tried a scone, and a bite of a cupcake and they all felt kind of stale. They don't claim to be foodies, and really put the umph of your experience into the beverages.   The espresso is bold and strong and the best thing you can order. The small latte is my go to. I've had some of their dark roasts coffees, and they're just not my favorite. Some of them have unique flavor combinations and others just left me with too much of that sumatra earthy taste in my mouth. If you're unsure of what to get, I'd stick with a latte."}
{"text":"Excellent local coffee house.  It has an excellent, well-worn ambiance that makes it feel like it's been around forever.  (Which may very well be the case - the first time I ever came here was about a decade ago, when from what I remember the building was basically the same as it is today.)  There are four distinct areas you can hang out and drink coffee or just hang out - the ground floor, on the patio out back, on the patio in the front or in the upstairs lounge.  I personally recommend the last, which is full of couches and seats where you can easily hang out with a group.  They also serve alcohol in the evenings and have live music several nights a week during the summer."}
{"text":"Summit is quintessential coffee shop. A feel of the mountains with a cozy atmosphere. The Kilimanjaro blend is my favorite brew. They also offer craft beer and delicious pastries."}
{"text":"This place is very busy on Saturday mornings and has great food and drink options. Popular spot for weekend cyclists and runners. Even backs right up to the farmers market. The space is very small and the line never ends, but thankfully there is some seating outside. I ordered a matcha latte with almond milk which cost a pricey $5.75 and I added a dollar tip easily on their iPad setup. The flavor was great, however they failed to properly sift the matcha before whisking it, so I had hundreds of clumps in my drink -  very unpleasant. I make matcha at home every day and sifting is the most important step.  They now offer fancy toast options for a steep $7 (and gluten free but I think for an extra $1), but give them 5-10 min. to prep the toast as they don't have a good system down and their counter space is tiny for the employees to tend to everyone. Even though their location is great, they really need more space. I may have to try their flourless chocolate cake next time I go in. Their desserts look tasty."}
{"text":"Coming from a coffee snob, this is insanely good coffee. The atmosphere is just as good. Laid back. Eclectic. Great live music and events. Killing it."}
{"text":"My only visit to Summit Coffee was when visiting the farmers market.  I like the place because it seemed like a small neighborhood place.  Wooden floors in a smaller town.  The staff was outgoing and polite.   I like this place.  If I ever find myself back in Davidson- I'll be back."}
{"text":"What a cute little street - quaint ...Fast service - reasonable prices and great coffee!"}
{"text":"I love coffee shops, and one of my hobbies is to check out coffee shops, sit there, read books, or just browse internet while enjoying the comfort of a nice coffee shop.  I happen to discover this place on my way back from the Indian lunch buffet in Cornelius. Davidson has a pretty little downtown. Finding something nice like Summit in such a small town of about 10,000 people is always a pleasant surprise.  They have great seating arrangements. They have patio outside in the back, few tables outside in the front, downstairs with the music playing, and upstairs with the quite atmosphere.  I sat upstairs as I wanted to learn Spanish through Rosetta Stone, online. Upstairs is very quite and perfect place to read and study. The ambiance is very pleasant. They have stuff like speakers, this and that hanging by the ropes with various kinds of knots. I forgot the names of knots but I appreciate when I see knots of different kinds. I used to be good at tying different kinds of knots. There are ancient ski boots, skis, and what not on display everywhere inside. It's a pretty cool view in there.  That was all about the place. Now the main thing - about the coffee. I had a drip coffee. I did not inquire about the type and origin of the coffee, as I wanted to be surprised. After the heavy lunch, I needed a nice cup of strong coffee, and I got it. The coffee was delicious, and the aroma was good enough for me to stay alert after pigging out at the buffet. ;-)  The staff seemed friendly.  I think I will definitely go here again. Probably next time, to watch the live music. They have regular live music upstairs. Will check it out sometime, soon."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but typical for a local coffee shop. The chai tea late was very good. It was a little hot upstairs too. The ambiance was nice for studying; however, the tables were kinda small. It got loud at times, but it is a public area so that is expected. All in all it was a pretty decent coffee joint. I probably wouldn't study their but it seems to be a pretty good joint for social events or just to pick up a good cup of coffee/other beverage."}
{"text":"So, I owe all the folks on Yelp an apology for not doing the right thing when I patronized this establishment this weekend.  So it was Sunday and the little lady and I were off to Church in Davidson.  In addition, we tend to make it up there from the city early enough to enjoy a cup of coffee and something to eat at Summit coffee before heading off to service.  For this particular visit it was the same as many other visits to this little main street shop....except for one thing...but I'm getting ahead of myself.  We entered the shop and as usual it was a buzz with activity.  There was a small line, but it quickly moved and our order (both coffee and food) were taken.  We were lucky enough to grab a table right by the counter and waited on our coffees while we ate our food.....My back was to the back of the store and my lady noticed something that surprised her.......I knew this only because of the expression on her face.....she was watching a mouse...literally sitting/standing...whatever they do, on the floor and right at the edge of the far left of the counter.  He was facing us and just looking around.  As I too started to watch him, I thought for a moment that perhaps the poor little fella had eaten some rat poison and was in the final stages of life due to the fact he was just standing there as folks were all around him - wouldn't the average mouse run and hide???? Keep a low mouse profile????..........then all of sudden he casually crawled/walked/mouseyed over and under the table behind me where two older women were deeply engaged in conversation.  At this same time a young woman had also seen the mouse while waiting on her coffee and my lady and her started to talk about what they were witnessing....I continued to follow the mouse and watched as it moved to the wall....and eventually hopped/crawled onto the woman's shoe behind me......I immediately turned around and knew screaming was about to start - but it didn't........my girl watched in horror as it appeared to try and crawl up the womans leg.........  At that moment we looked at our food.........and decided even though it was half eaten that perhaps not finishing it might be the best idea.......so we threw the food away and took our coffees and left, but even doubted the coffees were worth saving????  As we walked out we couldn't stop laughing as well as couldn't imagine ever going back there again.  Yes........ the vision of a mouse and the unhygienic enviroment has scared us into never coming back, but I should have given a constructive complaint to benefit the restaurant (and your community's health)............but I didn't...........sorry folks."}
{"text":"Plenty of seating inside, upstairs, and outside (front and back). One lone window seat (seats 4) right at the window facing main street. Definitely the best seat in the house! Very good piped in modern \"college radio\" music. Pour-over menu had four choices on this day. Dark roast was one. Barista did a good job of preparing it. Pastry selection was varied: cookies, cake slices, scones, and \"bruks bars\" (gotta Google that for details). Prices for drinks and pastries were fair. Bathrooms were incredible! Two one at a time restrooms for everyone. Absolutely clean, roomy, modern, and pleasantly decorated! Plenty of parking out back and 2 hour parking out front.   Couple of concerns here. The upstairs was cramped and quiet with few windows. Definitely the place to get work done and not socialize. Cookie, while locally made, still managed to taste processed. Staff were a little stand-offish, but were able to muster up some fake friendliness.   Overall, a good place to come back to!"}
{"text":"Nice, tiny coffee shop. Their Guatemalan was sub-par but better than a lot of the coffee I've found in the area. The downstairs is very small and has only 5-6 tables but upstairs has couches. The featured artwork upstairs consisted of magna doodle drawings which was interesting.  The people, though. Oh my... pretentious with a capital P. As someone who enjoys eavesdropping and watching others, I got a few giggles out of it, but I have friends that would have rather thrown their head through one of the rust-colored walls than listen to these uppity college students talk about how great they think they are.  One of the things that disappointed me was the website suggests the Summit as a climbing-themed atmosphere. As a climber, I was excited to see this. Once I arrived and did a once-over of the place I was disappointed. I didn't see any climbing posters and not even one cleverly named drink. I saw a North Face poster while walking back downstairs but that was about it."}
{"text":"Stumbled along this ~hip~ little place to sit and catch up with a friend. Great selection for both types of brew junkies-- coffee and beer lovers alike.  The shop itself is deceptively large, due to the upstairs sitting area. They have a pretty compact coffee menu, but you don't need frills when the coffee is this good! They also offer Stevia, which isn't common where I live and was refreshing to see on the cream + sugar cabinet."}
{"text":"Visited my son and got two pour over coffes and scones while I was here. One of the best cups of coffee I have had in my life. I know, but it was actually that good. And the scones were delish."}
{"text":"I got the plunge... drip coffee, half & half & flavoring. It was delicious. However the young lady working the register was terribly rude & unfriendly. I also bought beans. My husband & I love getting beans from different coffee shops. Typically the baristas are full of knowledge about the beans & pretty excited to help. Even passionate about their job. Not here! This chick was zero help & annoyed to have a customer. I couldn't wait to get my drink, beans & peace outta this place!"}
{"text":"Today they were overwhelmed, coffee is awesome but they fill it to high and you cant put any cream in it! I tried their vanilla frosted, nutella cake. Dry but tasty, you cant taste any nutella though. The place was packed, i love upstairs, cozy. Still a great place even if it takes a little longer"}
{"text":"The iced pumpkin latte was good but very strong. Staff was short with me but would still try it again. Atmosphere was really cool."}
{"text":"I love working here and having meetings here.  I often just grabbing a pour over after working out or at the Farmer's Market on Saturday.  They have THE BEST homemade granola.  I love the granola with steamed almond milk.  Hubs like the granola with yogurt.  Check their calendar for live music events.  Their back deck/patio area is the perfect spot to chill with wine or beer on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I might be way out of line here since a lot of people have given these guys a high rating, but I ordered chai latte here and it was pathetic. A couple reviewers have said that the chai latte was really good... Maybe compared to Starbucks, who cannot make chai right ever, but I wouldn't order that ever again. If you want good chai, go to Smelly Cat, Central Coffee or Amelies in Uptown. I cannot comment on their coffee though, since the only time I went I ordered chai. I also had their quiche, which was alright, but I had a lot of trouble eating it with their low quality plastic forks which would bend any time I tried to cut through the crust. Also, the girl managing the counter didn't seem to know anything and ran really low on confidence while talking to customers. Maybe she was new since the barista was helping her out, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Definitely not a fan of this place though."}
{"text":"Had the chai latte and it was really good. The shop and the back patio were super relaxing. The wait staff were super helpful and welcoming.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"What is the fuss about? Basic coffee shop, wet coffee rag smell included. They have Counter Culture coffee and I would say that's the only plus. Food options were scarce on Saturday morning. Not Just Coffee still reigns supreme."}
{"text":"If you've spent any time in Asheville you'll sense some similarities between the mountainous hippie town's coffee shops and Davidson's one and only, Summit Coffee.  This coffee shop caters to both young and old, and you will find a good mix of young davidson families, professors, college students, and local highschoolers and business types.  Both the drink menu and the food menu reflect the spectrum of customers.  The drink menu offers everything from chocolate milk to lattes, and the food menu includes fresh pastries, cookies, and sandwiches delivered daily from a local sandwich shop.  The meal selection is not extensive but it is diverse: from chicken empanadas to spinach salad to hearty soups in the wintertime.    The decor is outdoor sports, with pictures of famous mountain climbers and outdoor gear used as art.  You will also find framed photographs of loyal customers on vacation, at different 'summits' around the world.  The upstairs level at summit has recently been renovated (big comfy couches, hardwood floors, an old jukebox, wooden tables, and a giant antique serving bar) and is used as a concert venue and art house for local musicians and artists. The best thing about this place, however, is the fact that eevery aspect of the coffee shop caters to a long stay.  You do not need to purchase anything to sit at one of their limited tables downstairs, you will not be rushed to leave, the baristas will continue a conversation with you even if a long line awaits, no one will wake you if you fall asleep on a couch upstairs, no one will kick you out when they close until after they have finished cleaning, and 'for here' coffee orders are refilled for free- all day long.  Summit Coffee is an excellent place to meet a friend for coffee, great for  a quick snack on your own, and the best place to curl up with a book for the afternoon.  This is not a place to take a date for dinner, or a great place for a fast-paced business meeting."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, friendly staff, and fast wifi. What more could you want from a neighborhood coffee shop?"}
{"text":"Summit is the definition of what a coffee house should be. Great atmosphere, great coffee, and the best part is a great place to spend time , morning, Noon or night!  They server wine and beer at night.    The staff is great and very friendly.    Summit serves its own line of organic and eco friendly coffee that you can buy or get served up.    As opposed to the nice but sterile environment that Starbucks serves up Summit is the real deal."}
{"text":"What you would expect a coffee shop should be. Great selection of good coffee. Super nice staff. Live music usually Thursday through Saturdays. Many time outside. Had a recent, much needed, update upstairs.  Downtown Davidson is getting busy though, so watch out for parking issues."}
{"text":"Great coffee, location, people! The best coffee and great prices on wine and beer! We love this place."}
{"text":"This place is such a cool little shop.  They have coffee and some goodies, I also saw a sign that they have beer, but it was too early for me to ask about that.  I came on a Sunday morning and it was already buzzing with patrons.  They have a small inside area and a pretty large back patio to sit on.  The patio was too hot for me this particular day, so I enjoyed a nice indoor, tiny table.    I ordered a double espresso with chocolate and it was ready fairly quick for how busy they were.  The espresso was very good and quite strong.  I was happy with my choice.   The staff was really friendly.  They did a nice job of keeping things moving on a busy morning."}
{"text":"Almost perfect! Coffee is deep, rich and authentic. Just the way it needs to be! I tasted both iced and frozen - perfection, not too sweet or milky. The frappe had regular milk and the iced coffee had almond milk. Both were smoother than a very close shave on a man's face. The lack of the fifth star is for the lack of flavor choices (sometimes that's for the best like too many toppings on a pizza pie ruins the whole thing...) and the place could use a more \"ambient seating\" that feels friendly both to those who are passing through and sitting down. Otherwise, amazing for a town in North Carolina between nowhere and nowhere, kinda."}
{"text":"Summit is a must stop if you are in Davidson. They are an entrenched part of the town for the last 15 years. As someone who grew up in the town it was a great place to grab a drink and attend a live-music show.   If you are in town earlier in the day, it is a great place to study or talk with friends. I recommend the summit plunge (chai clone for non-coffee drinkers).   Enjoy it, you are in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Meh. Hate to be a Debbie Downer, just not my cup o tea (errrr coffee) (but in their defense I'm one of those people who like a little coffee with my sugar lol). It's just OK, so deserving of 3 stars.  I agree with someone who said they don't get what all the hype is about on here. If you're a huge fan of Starbucks Caramel Macchiatos, PSLs, Toasted Graham Lattes etc. like me, you won't be happy with the drink options here or the fact that it cost just as much as Starbucks but they do NOT cater to the customer & try to help you make your drink taste more drink-able... They actually charge 50cents for extra caramel, maybe that's normal for boutique or, non-Starbucks places, but I like when I order a drink at Starbucks & they fiddle around to get it just right for me and don't \"nickel & dime\" customers on an already way overpriced beverage!  So, if your taste buds are like mine, go somewhere else... On the flip side, love the quaint little interior, back patio and overall environment so great for a quick meeting.  The employees could smile at least once, might make the place feel a little friendlier. Oh & don't waste $ on the overpriced, pathetic excuse for cupcakes.  I really had my hopes up because they looked great, but tasted like cold, dense cornbread (refrigerated) with gooey strawberry in the middle topped with frosting that tasted like saran wrap :/ Not sure if that makes sense, but I was told they were fresh, made daily... I could only stand a couple bites :("}
{"text":"If I were going JUST on taste - I would give this place five stars. I ordered an iced soy vanilla latte with light ice. It was super tasty and I enjoyed every sip of it.   I didn't mind the cramped space or the long line as I waited ten minutes to order my coffee and then five more minutes for it to be made. That wasn't a big deal to me. But in the world of Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts, I was super underwhelmed by the small size of what they consider to be a large iced drink and super overwhelmed at the 5.50 price tag for it.   Tasty? Yes. Good value for the price? Nope."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop ANYWHERE.  Been enjoying this little independent coffee shop for about ten years.  Tip: Get the Box Turtle Mocha. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, but a couple of things fell short for me. Maybe it was the day we went, so I will go back someday to see how it is again and update my review accordingly. There was no soap in the bathroom... ewe, good thing I carry hand sanitizer with me. There were no clean spoons either for stirring the coffee. Honestly, it looked like they were just slammed for hours with no chance to do some simple housekeeping. When we came in, it wasn't very busy, but they could have just finished a busy day."}
{"text":"We came here for a nightcap after dinner at Kindred, and we both wanted to prevent yawning, so espresso for the two of us! We both ordered Cortado's, namely because ever since my introduction with it at Not Just Coffee (7th Street location, I've been obsessed with it.  Now yelp, I'll warn you, I don't drink much coffee. Not because I don't like it, but because I like it black, and black coffee gives me heartburn (ughh such an old thing to say). So when I order coffee out, it's gotta be well made. Well what better place then a roastery?  The location is nice and small, it's essentially a long hall and then a door at the back that opens to a nice patio with a stage. And tip: There's live music on Friday nights! (I'm sure other nights of the week to, I just know this one for sure.) The patio out back was the perfect place to sip on our well crafted espresso's and enjoy the night before our movie! Would love to stop in here again next time I'm in Davidson."}
{"text":"A nice coffee place. Small but a neighborhood favorite. They make a great lemongrass tea. I hear they have bands upstairs. Not coffee only but beer as well. They also have a rewards program, grab a card"}
{"text":"Five stars says it all: great atmosphere, terrific staff, wine, beer, music, trivia... and the coffee isn't bad either! Oh, and there's an indie book shop next door.  Summit is the heart and soul of Davidson's Main Street. Go there!"}
{"text":"Summit is the ultimate college town coffee shop vibe. Seems like they have been here for twenty years. They have all the drinks you can get at Starbucks with comparable flavor and better pricing. They offer beer and wine and some light food fare as well. Check their website because there is always music and events. The outdoor area is a believed hangout for the davidson intelligentsia and general yuppie chillers."}
{"text":"The Chai tea latte is amazing enough said. The chai tea latte is one of things that's good or bad. This place does is right."}
{"text":"This place was recommended because it is a local place with good quality products. I have to agree. I thought their drinks were great and made with care. I think there is an upstairs or somewhere more casual but I stayed at the front where tables are to work. I really enjoyed my coffee and would like to come back to sample more options. It's right on Davidson's Main Street so a great location."}
{"text":"Before I found a high quality coffee shop like Summit, I was perfectly happy with the chain coffee places. However, I've started to drink black coffee, or sometimes coffee with a small amount of almond milk. I can definitely tell the difference in the quality of the coffee, and Summit if great.  I also enjoy the atmosphere, and go there frequently to work (I work from my home office). It's a great place to have some good coffee and get work done."}
{"text":"A hip, quiet place to grab some coffee. There's plenty of seating outdoors and upstairs. Free wifi for all, so you can get your work one, or just go on your phone! The fancy drinks are decently expensive, but their drop coffee is just fantastic. We haven't been for the live music, but I've heard wonderful things!"}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop. Coming from a place that didn't have any it great to see a local place like summit. Offers coffee drinks and beers. What's there not to like!"}
