{"text":"This place is worth the wait. I take clients there for lunch and the service and food are quick and on spot. 

My wife and I will take our young son here for din and have a nicer meal and they are always willing to accommodate us."}
{"text":"Loved the apple ravioli. Everything was delicious. Prompt, polite, and kind service. Good portion sizes and well priced. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"A staple of any restaurant that calls itself an Italian restaurant should be their tomato sauce.  The tomato sauce here is weak.  I am not sure how they are preparing but it lacks flavor and any evidence of seasoning.  A pancetta base with onion, garlic, black pepper, red pepper flakes, basil and oregano would improve the flavor.  

The breading on the chicken parmesan was soggy and bland.  My table also had the pork chop.  It was ok but it was small and a little dry.  

Another issue is the the lack of a choice of soup or salad with the order of an entree.  They do have these items on the menu available for ala carte purchase but something just doesn't feel right about that set up.  Raise the price of the entree if you must but this option should be included.

The best part about the meal was the bread and the olive oil dip that accompanied it.  The bread was fresh and delicious and the dip was perfectly seasoned.  But then again,  this really shouldn't be the highlight of a meal."}
{"text":"I grew up with an Italian restaurant in the family, so I'm very picky about Italian food. It's just as easy to dress it up too much as it is to make it bland and generic. Bella Frutteto hit all of the right notes! No pretentiousness; just a warm, familial atmosphere and great food to boot! The stuffed pepper appetizer reminded me of childhood meals, while the seafood bake was a like a tour of the Mediterranean coast on a plate. I will most definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Food is great, and priced fairly (food is why it's getting 3 stars instead of 2).  Ambiance and service both left something to be desired.  The ambiance made it feel more like a sub-par olive garden, and our server rushed our entire meal (we weren't the only table in her section so she wasn't ending her shift, and the restaurant wasn't full so we weren't holding up any other patrons... I wasn't sure why she was so anxious to get us out the door).  She checked on us every 15 minutes or so and kept asking us if we were \"done yet\".  Yikes.  After working as a server for years, I try not to let one bad server (or good server having a bad day) spoil the meal, but I probably won't go back here if I'm looking for a nice evening.  Maybe I misjudged the restaurant.  I thought this place was more of a \"dining experience\" restaurant, but it might be better suited to people who are looking to be in-and-out in 30 minutes or less. Disappointing."}
{"text":"A favorite spot for date night. We always get the apple dishes. Service can be a little slow, but it is always worth the wait. Sangria is a must try."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding service! Our server was Jamy(sp) and he was extremely accommodating. We made a reservation and were seated immediately. The appetizers could have been slightly larger as we had a large group, but that took nothing away from the flavor! The entire meal was absolutely delicious. My wife and I will visit many more times to come."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was fabulous . I loved the carrot soup! But over the past couple of years it has gone down hill significantly. My husband bought the living social deal for us and our 2 children. The hostess told us we could use our living social deal that day, but when the check came, the waitress said nope! We asked to speak to a manager, and ended up having to come back to the place to use it. We made sure the bill was as close to the living social as possible the next visit. I agree with another's review that the pasta was overly sauced so it was more like a chunky soup. Only positive is the bread. Delicious, but not worth it to go for just bread."}
{"text":"Both the food and service here were wonderful!  The owners make their way around the restaurant to talk with customers and check on their satisfaction. Our salads, entrees and desserts were delicious.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the casual dining atmosphere.
The apple bruschetta was wonderful as was the Ahi Tuna.
Bellla Frutteto is now at the top of my list1"}
{"text":"The food was good. Visited on a Saturday night for the happy hour specials at 9pm. However, I think the drinks are over priced and the service could have been better."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner last night to avoid traffic on I-79, and wow! We were all so happy we did! Great atmosphere and fantastic food! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I too wanted to like this place but having a perky server who seemed a bit confused didn't help. 6 of us went and each couple had a living social voucher. When time to pay came we were informed we could only use one. When I asked the owner why her only response was too many people come in and order water I said as u can see we did not do that. She then asked did I want her to lose $100. I said if we each came separtely could we use them she said yes and i said what is the difference. She said we sat together. WHAT AN IDIOT MONEY VALUE IS THE SAME DUH! She then got very nasty by attacking me instead of the issue. This place obviously cares about the $ not the custumer . WE WON'T BE BACK! BY THE WAY TOTAL CHECK FOR TABLE WAS OVER $300 INCLUDING TIP."}
{"text":"I was served a congealed, mushy, overcooked bowl of stuck together ravioli on an uncrowded weekend night.  I have been here many times with friends, family and business associates. With the arrogance of the wait staff and owner, I won't be back. They just lost a good customer."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The bread with olive oil was decent, but the pasta dishes weren't very good and seemed overpriced considering the quality. The alfredo was watery and bland, and the ragu I had was too spicy. Now I am rarely one to complain about spice in food, but this dish just didn't make sense being that spicy, it just detracted from any flavor the sauce may have had (if there was any)."}
{"text":"OK. They have seem to attempt to provide you with a nice atmosphere but everything they do from the candles to the shaker of cheese is just somewhat tacky. I felt as if I was back on campus at a college restaurant but paying double the price for it. The flavors were good - I'll give them that, but the atmosphere was not great. Even our server seemed slightly off. Would have been an excellent experience at half the cost, but at ~20 per dish there's many better places with more interesting cuisine."}
{"text":"Bella Frutetto has excellent food and a very broad menu.  I have been to this restaurant about 4 times and it is consistently good.  I highly recommend the seafood bake.  Service is always good at well.  The only downside to the restaurant is that some of the tables in the front of the restaurant are a bit cramped and feel a bit cold, but towards the back of the restaurant is very nice!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Started with the Bella Blue bruschetta. Very good, but blue cheese is not my favorite and so didn't love this. Everything else, totally loved. Had the prosciutto and fig salad. Loved the delicious goat cheese, the figs, the prosciutto. Then had the greens and beans. Had a lovely smoky flavor unlike any I've had before. But thought it was great. Finally had their signature apple ravioli. LOVED it - it was divine. Like an apple pie. Can't recommend this enough. Will go many times in the future."}
{"text":"We stopped after Pumpkin Picking with our 1st Grandbaby last Friday Night.  They were busy and had a Rehearsal Dinner coming in.  The Hostess did a great job checking with the Manager to see if they could accommodate us.  Manager coached her Hostess on how to make room, and we were seated within 5 minutes.  Everything was delicious, and our server, Haley, was on top of everything. Veal Caprese, S&S Pasta, Mediterranean Salmon, and Crab Manicotti were all too much to finish after soup, and their complimentary bread.  Delicious!  Competitively priced and they are a restaurant that prides themselves on customer service"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for dinner last Saturday evening. The very cheerful hostess said it would be a 45 minute wait (which we expected - it is saturday night after all). So we went to the bar area. We liked the selection of taps and my girlfriend was excited that a local sparkling hard cider from Arsenal Cider House was on tap. After only waiting about 15 minutes, the hostess had a table for us. Our server was puntual, friendly and never made us wait for anything we wanted. The manager of the place that evening even stopped by twice to check on us and chatted. My GF ordered the striped bass and I ordered the stuffed chicken breast with both of us ordering the spinach, walnut and gorganzola half salad. The Apple house dressing is very good here - highly recommended. Our meals were wonderful. The price is what you would expect for a nice place (we had a drink, salad, and entree and it was about 28$/each. The desserts are realy good as well - we didn't get dessert this time, but last time we had creme brulee and it was top-notch. This was our 2nd or 3rd time here and have enjoyed it everytime. My only gotcha is that if you get a table by the side door in the front, it is very drafty. They have a space heater there but it was still drafty."}
{"text":"Imaginative \"winter menu\" didn't give us a chance to try the regular menu. We've never been disappointed with lunch here."}
{"text":"We have been here three times. Twice as a couple and once in a large group. Although there is a nice back room, I do not recommend going in a group as the staff is not well trained in dealing with tables of more than four or six. The food is pretty good but nothing is really outstanding. The wine list is better than average and the overall cost is very reasonable. The staff is courteous although overwhelmed if you come with too many people. 

Here are the food comments: the wedding soup has fantastic stock but stringy chicken. The striped bass is good but needs some seasoning to make it better. The marinara sauce received praise but having meatballs would have been nice. The meatloaf got a thumbs up and was plentiful. I think we took ten pounds of it home as leftovers. The desserts were all pretty awful. 

So,it's a mixed review. We will probably keep an open mind and give it one more shot as the people seemed to really be trying their best. We would love to see them succeed!"}
{"text":"A-OK. That about sums it up. 

Nice atmosphere. Service has been pretty friendly, attentive, and consistent. Sometimes I get chocolate sauce when ordering cannoli to go, sometimes I don't. Odd, but nothing to get upset about. 

Food is pretty good. Though I wish as an Italian restaurant they would stop using a blended oil for everything. Dipping sauce for bread, spinach, vegetables, green and beans, potatoes, etc. - you would think if anywhere an Italian place would use a pure olive oil of some type (EVOO, etc) for these, but not here. Good info to have for those of you up on the drawbacks and health issues regarding vegetable oils. 

This sort of thing tends to limit me to the Italian Style Meatloaf, but it's fantastic so that's alright at the end of the day. I also tend to go with the prosciutto and fig salad, while I get inconsistent amounts of the various ingredients each time, it's still always a tasty salad. I understand this is something hard to plate consistently. 

About the best cannoli I've had around Pittsburgh.

Prices are reasonable considering the portion sizes. 

All in all I like the place and stop a handful a times per year when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Went there last week on a Groupon.
I'll keep it simple.
Go there.
Eat.
Enjoy.
Since Yelp is telling me that my review is on the short side, l will bore you all with some useless details:
-I had the crab cakes.  While not as good as Andora's, they're still pretty good.
-my wife had the lasagna.  She said it was excellent.
-my compliments to the server,too.
Go there.
Eat.
Enjoy."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and it looked very promising when being seated.  However,  things went south quick!  To begin, the waitress was rude and seemed annoyed/distracted while taking our order and bringing out our food.  The prices are high for lunch ($15 for a average size bowl of pasta) considering you do not get a soup and/or salad.  We asked for bread, but were rudely told \"no...bread is only at dinner\".  In addition, the pasta was cool and appeared to sit for a while before being served.    Overall, it was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood for quality Italian food. The lasagna is very tasty and the portion is large. I also enjoyed the lobster bisque. The bread and dipping sauce was exceptional. Don't be fooled by the nondescript appearance from the outside, it is quality once you get in the door. Very reasonable prices. The owner was working as hostess on a Saturday night and was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Nice, inconspicuous Italian restaurant conveniently located off 79 north, across the street from Soergels. Very friendly staff and casual atmosphere. The bread was warm, fresh and delicious, however the dipping oil wasn't my favorite as it was just cheese sitting in the center of the dish of oil with cracked black pepper. I was disappointed calamari wasn't on the menu. Two appetizers were ordered, Apple ravioli and fried rice balls. The rice balls were delicious. Nice and crispy and fresh! The raviolis were sitting in a pool of butter and had apples, golden raisins and figs spread atop. Unfortunately, the butter killed most of the flavor for me. The lasagna is a very large portion and was quite tasty but they put a big dollop of Alfredo sauce on top of it and it was much too rich for my liking. The pomegranate Martini was good and definitely not weak, like I've been served elsewhere. The manager was so nice and checked in on all of the diners. I'll definitely be back to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food! I had bought the Groupon to use there but unfortunately I went during the black out dates. There happy hour was going on anyway which was a great deal."}
{"text":"This yr I haven't had as much time to eat inside the restaurant so I get a lot of takeout. Takeout is always rite on Packaged perfectly. The bread is awesome always hard outside doughy inside. Since the expansion there is rarely a wait. I really enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise!  Great atmosphere and reasonable prices.  The service was very attentive and accurate.  It's hard to believe that I've lived this close to this place and never went there before.

Don't let the fact that it's in a small shopping center fool you!"}
{"text":"Bella Frutteto is close to my work office so it has entered the usual lunch rotation.  The food is good but is not consistent.  I have had the Blackened Bass sandwich three times over the past 2 months and it has tasted so different every time.  They also took a Mozzarella, tomato, basil panini off the menu.  The service is a little slow at lunch so if you have to punch a clock stay away because you are always there over an hour."}
{"text":"Awesome!  We've been here a few times and we just love it!  We recently were there Monday and had the gnocchi which were pillows of air!  Very tasty and not chewy at all.  I hate chewy gnocchi so I'm always afraid to order it.  My husband had a customized pasta with pink vodka sauce that was also delicious.  The bread was warm and delicious too.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday,  party of 8, for a birthday celebration.  Service was very good.  Everyone liked the   apps and entrees,  but there were fruit flys buzzing around the table which turned my stomach.  We brought in a cake and opened presents, and the staff was very accommodating.  Overall a good night except for the fruit flys."}
{"text":"On Monday, July 11, 2016, my wife ate there and got me a chicken salad wrap for take-out.  When I ate the wrap, it was pretty good tasting until I was stab by a chicken bone that was about an inch long and the thickness of a toothpick.  I contacted the restaurant on there webite (http://www.bellafrutteto.com/contact.html) on Wednesday, July 13.  The site said I'd get a response within 24 - 48 hours.  As of now, haven't heard anything.  I was expecting at least a sorry and a thank you for letting them know.  Hopefully they are too busy making sure there are no bones in the food to response to my message....  :("}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Took some time to come out.  We sat at the bar and service was great."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. The food was excellent they use high quality ingredients. The service eas excellent. Our server was Christy, she was very attentive and friendly answering questions we had about menu items and specials. Will definitely dine there again and if Christy is serving that day we will request her as our server again. I would recommend reservations even on a week night."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here last night for the first time. Wanted to try something different and close to home. We saw they had a Groupon deal, so that made this restaurant even more enticing. When we walked in, the atmosphere of the restaurant was comfortable, quaint, and inviting. Our waiter, Jaime, was very friendly and provided us lots of suggestions as far as meals and apps.

We didn't get an appetizer but got salads instead. My husband got the wedding soup as well and said it was good. The Caesar salads were a good size and were tossed in the dressing with homemade croutons. The homemade bread and dipping oil was fantastic... almost so much so that we were pretty full before our meals came!  Both the soups and the salads came out quickly, which was nice.

As a whole, the meals we chose were pretty good. Took awhile for us to get our dinners, but after all of the bread it was worth the wait! I got the Seafood Bake (recommended by the waiter as their top seller) and my husband got the Spicy Shrimp and Scallops. I'll admit, the Seafood Bake was made with vodka sauce, but I wasn't thrilled with its quality. My husband said his was the perfect amount of spicy and he finished his whole plate!

Although I wasn't thrilled with my meal choice, we'd like to go back and try some other meal options. There were definitely a lot of good looking options! This place is worth the try"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. Yes the bread was good. I had spinach ravioli and the sauce was just mediocre. The waitress drove us crazy. There were 4 of us. Two of us ate half our food and wanted the other half to go. Third person finished. Well, every time the 4th person put his fork down the Waitress ( I will call P) wanted to take his plate. It was obvious that he was not done yet and is a slow eater. She did this 3-4 times. They weren't overcrowded or anything for trying to hurry us out.  It was very annoying. She didn't ask are you done...she went to reach for his plate."}
{"text":"Food is great (especially their blue cheese and garlic aioli steak panini lunches). Chips are made in-house, and the dressings taste as if they are too (try some ranch with your chips, YUM)! Great little hidden gem. 

The only drawback is the slow and often inattentive service which is a shame since its an otherwise great place. Very often the servers are congregated around the service window on cell phones and enjoying each others' company when our drinks haven't been refilled and our starters haven't been delivered. Bottom line, expect to wait a good bit of time and have to flag down a server for most things you need. 

Still...4 stars for food, selection, freshness, cleanliness, seating availability, and ambiance (despite being located in a mini-strip mall). Worth the trip especially if you've got some time to kill."}
{"text":"My husband and I first visited this quaint little Italian restaurant the night we got engaged. We recently went back to use an enjoy book coupon and it was even better than I remembered. 

The ambiance was wonderful: dimly light, romantic, almost \"fancy\". There were so many items on the menu that I wanted to try, it was hard to decide! I was looking for a large portion so I opted out of ravioli which is what I really wanted. Instead, I had the lasagna and the size was just what I was looking for! I couldn't finish it. Loaded with cheese and sausage, it was probably the size of four small pieces. Included in the meal was warm, fresh bread with a dipping oil containing parmesan cheese. The owner himself brought our meals out to us and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy dinner. 

The hospitality is exceptional. The food is above and beyond delicious. It is all worth the price. If you love quality Italian food, do check this place out. 

I will be back for ravioli."}
{"text":"I went here with my niece and parents... It was ok, but nothing special. No one really loved their food, but no one hated it either."}
{"text":"Outstanding so far. Though I will caveat this review with the information that my sister is a server here, this in no way alters my perception of the experience. I started off with, along with a glass of house Pinot, the fried macaroni and cheese. 5 balls of fried goodness that can only be described as melting heaven. They're served with a sauce that can be described as bisque like tomato. So, so, so good. I then had a bowl of lobster bisque with a sesame cracker. Possible the best lobster bisque I've enjoyed. It was freshly made also, so I got it litteraly right off the grill.  Then came the grilled chicken caesar salad.  very good caesar dressing.  not too sharp.  very moist, perfectly grilled chicken and excellent blend of lettuce.  had the cannoli for dessert.  wow.  very crisp shell and very sweet, rich center.  i should've just had about 9 of those for dinner instead of all that other stuff.  great experience."}
{"text":"The service is really good, the bread with oil and parmesan cheese is outstanding.  The food is tasty with good portions and reasonable but fairly high prices. 

I'll subtract a star because the restaurant is solid, but not amazing.  The prices are a tad high for standard/solid/pretty good.  I always enjoy myself when I go but I feel that there may be other restaurants I'm not aware of that are exceptional or excquisite for the same price."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! I ordered the lobster ravioli and white peach sangria and both were amazing. Also, their bread and oil combo is delicious! I'll definitely come back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Astounding! I had been here once before for a work event when I still worked in Wexford. At the time I had enjoyed some free and shall we say interesting samples - I had no idea this place makes a mean spicy marinara sauce. Still, while not a fan of hot items I liked what I tasted well enough to come back.

Actually dining here was heavenly. They very kindly held our reservation even though we ran forty minutes late in traffic. The wine selection is massive, always a plus! And the menu has a nice diverse selection of entrees, pasta, and really good salads. Seriously, the chicken harvest salad was to die for. Everything tasted so fresh! Finally, during the main course my mother declared that the crab cakes here were divine, second only to fresh crab cakes from sea line restaurants.

In case you couldn't guess, I will absolutely be back. Thank you for a perfect meal, Bella!"}
{"text":"Gem in Wexford. The lobster bisque was delicious with big pieces of scallop on top. The filet, cooked medium rare, was perfection - paired perfectly with grilled asparagus. Rosemary potatoes are really not necessary, however, they are a good choice of a starch. An add on option of shrimp stuffed with crab is well worth the extra $.  5 stars."}
{"text":"I think we've dined here twice over the past few years,  The food is good and the ambience is nice.  They have some decent wines by the glass and a full bar and the service is usually pretty good.  This visit was no different.  

I tried the Pick a Pasta option with Linguini and Pink Sauce, Sun Dried Tomatoes and Shrimp.  The dish was very satisfying and I managed to finish the whole thing I'm embarrassed to say. I love the fresh bread they serve and the dipping oil.  I didn't fill up on that this time so maybe that's how I was able to eat all of my pasta. Good as excuse as any, right?  

Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing and the price is average for finer dining options in the North Hills."}
{"text":"Traveling north, on Route 79, we had a chance encounter with a fine Italian eatery! Recommended by our hotel we were pleased with their suggestion. 
My Bride ordered a Caesar Salad and due to a medical condition, a simple pasta with oil and garlic. The special order was handled correctly and satisfyingly. I ordered the Beet Salad and the Veal Parm. My salad was generous, with fresh greens, a generous number of beets, candied pecans and a subtle vinaigrette. Delicious! My entree was equally generous with perfectly cooked pasta and a perfect amount of the house marinara. The two pieces of veal were thick and well breaded. The over generous amount of sauce rendered the breading soggy. Wine list was limited but reasonably priced.

Next time your near Wexford Pa. give Bella Frutteto a try!"}
{"text":"Do not miss this restaurant in your travels, whatever you do. This food outshines most of the Italian fare I have ever tried since being transplanted in western Pa. Everything is perfection, for me, the apple ravioli is a must try. I couldnt stop swooning! Delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"This had to be the worst Italian dining experience I have ever had. I'm a vegetarian so I eat a lot of Italian, and this was just the worst. I'm not sure which was worse, the service or the actual meal. The waitress acted as if she could not be bothered. The restaurant was virtually empty but she had zero time for any requests. Giving one star is more than generous. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone and I caution true Italian food lovers from going to this place and wasting your money. Horrible, just horrible!!!"}
{"text":"The waitress and staff checked on us so many times which was very helpful.  The bread and olive oil dip was very flavorful. I shouldn't have filled up, because my mahi mahi was delicious.  My daughter had the lobster ravioli and enjoyed it.  I don't like lobster, but the vodka sauce that was on this was amazing..."}
{"text":"While visiting a farm nearby we got extremely hungry for Italian food and luckily we found Bella. It's a casual joint with a few dining areas, small patio and a bar. We went at 8 on a Sat. and it was still busy. They started us off with a warm basket of bread and dipping oil with cracked pepper and park. Delicious! I had a heaping layer of meaty, zesty lasagna. It. Was. Fantastic! My spouse got linguine fettuccine which she said was creamy and smooth. The kiddo got penne with marinara. He seemed to have enjoyed it. The owner or manager came to our table and checked in to make sure everything was good. Very friendly staff and a comfortable atmosphere. We recommend this joint."}
{"text":"We ventured out to Bella Frutteto after buying their recent Living Social deal. We were really looking forward to it, as we love Italian food and there aren't many good choices in this area of the city. We were sorely disappointed. The drinks are ok, but way overpriced at $11 for one cocktail. Each of our dishes was dominated by only one flavor. The spinach salads that we started with tasted like garlic - and nothing else. The Lemon Linguine with Shrimp dish that my husband ordered had an overpowering lemon flavor that was hard to get past. My Sun-dried Tomato Pesto with Shrimp pasta dish tasted only of the sun-dried tomatoes (and lots of them). It was all very boring. We brought the extras home in take-out containers, and haven't eaten them yet. I should probably clear them from my fridge now..."}
{"text":"I love Bella Frutteto!  Every time I go I get the same thing - Apple Ravioli - they are delicious cheese filled ravioli and then they are covered in butter sauce with baked apples, dates, figs, and raisins.  I've been known to keep eating these even after I'm so full I feel sick!  Also, the cannoli for desert!  OMG!!!!!  They also always have a homemade ice cream that comes from Soergel's Orchard across the street."}
{"text":"As a frequent attendee with my wife, the staff is always courteous, the food is always plentiful and tasty and it feels like home.

I cannot overstate how great the whole Bella Frutteto experience is, from soup to (pine) nuts."}
{"text":"Delicious food & our waitress was extremely helpful with their generous menu. I enjoyed the seafood bake pasta, which consisted of scallops & shrimp. I also added spinach that ended up being a great call if I don't say so myself. Chicken parmesan also looked great."}
{"text":"I've been to Wexford exactly four times in my life: once to pick out a car, once to buy said car and twice to visit the boyfriend's exceptionally lovely family.  Certainly, that's enough of a reason to frequent this fair suburb to the north, but now I have one more and it's name is \"Bella Frutteto's Bread.\"  Sure, my meal of crab cakes and salad was delightful, as was the atmosphere. And the service - pretty much impeccable.  But I'm telling you NOW, do NOT skip the bread like I almost did (workin' on my girlish figure and all). Screw it. Load up on the dippy sauce stuff too, though a strong breath mint is advised for the aftermath of that garlicky goodness.  And sure, try an entree if you must - they all looked incredible.  Oh, and it seems that they also have a Cupcake of the Day, so there's THAT."}
{"text":"Bella Frutteto is a very popular restaurant with a lot of loyal fans.  Make sure you make reservatons if it's the weekend, otherwise you could be looking at more than an hour wait for a table.  The staff is professional and friendly.  The food is very good and reasonably priced (I had an appetizer, salad, entree and dessert for $35).  The Apple Ravioli was delicious.  All of the salads and soups are very good...I tasted the Lobster Bisque, and it had an intense, rich flavor.  I highly recommend the Crème Brulee, it is made in the traditional style.  Another reviewer mentioned how much they like to sit in Amanda's section.  That's fine, but Lisa V. is also awesome: very knowledgeable about the menu, very helpful, and gave us impeccable service."}
{"text":"Came here for date night and we were not disappointed!!  I got the Seafood Bake and it was delicious!  3 large scallops, 3 huge shrimp and a generous portion of crabmeat!  Would definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"When we arived we were greeted right away by a friendly hostess who promptly showed us to a table. She even asked if the table was ok or if we would like another. This is something not many places do and I like it. We were fine with the table so we sat and looked over the menu. The thing that jumped out at me first were the prices. It is on the higher side. I think the cheapest pasta dish was like $14. Anyways our waiter came up and took our drink orders. I of course just ordered water Bry had a beer and my little man asked for a red lemonade. I told him they don't have red lemonade and the waiter offered to put a splash of grenadine in. I thought it was genius. My son was very happy. 

The bread here is quite good. It was warm and crunchy and the oil served with it was pretty good. I chose the shredded beef ravioli. It's a seasonal dish and quite good. It was just a bit on the salty side but not by much. Bry had a steak and shrimp dish that he liked but the steak cut was uneven so part or it was medium which is how he ordered it and the other part looked very rare. Almost raw. He did have it refired but he said it wasn't as good after. The manager did buy him a drink so they did make an effort to rectify the issue. Vin had chicken parm. It was 3 pieces of chicken strips with red sauce and cheese on top and a side of pasta. My boy loved it. He ate all the chicken and we took home the pasta for his lunch today. Also our waiter gave him a fresh loaf of bread since he asked for bread. 

Also Vin got the cutest little thing of ice cream with sprinkles. He was so happy. Bry and I went with red wine for our dessert. I don't remember what they were called but they were featured wines. One was the one from the top of the list and the other was from the bottom. I really enjoyed the one from the top of the list. The other was more earthy then I like. 

I have to say our waiter was really good. I appreciate when my son all though just 4 is treated with patience and caring. Our waiter was so good with him and even gave him options and waited while he made up his mind. I like the place and our server was great but not somewhere I feel I will have cravings for."}
{"text":"The food is decent you just don't get much for the price.  I think it's really expensive for the potion sizes .  You go to Olive Garden and get great Italian food and also get soup and salad.  Here that is all extra.  You can end up paying $25 a person for lunch, no thank you."}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience here.  First, we were not greeted in a friendly manner.  We went to the bar and the owner and bartender stood with their backs to us for 10 minutes chitchatting.  The decor is a little tacky and diner-ish.  The best part of the meal was the wedge salad, although the cranberries didn't really go with the rest of the salad.  I ordered the apple ravioli which is what they are known for.  It was nothing special.  It was very rich, sweet, and the cheese flavor was very pungent.  I could only eat 1 because it was so rich.  I did like the caramelized figs on it.  My husband ordered the fish with sweet potato purée which was slathered on like pizza sauce.  Then it was covered in some sort of cream sauce.  The fish itself was tasty, but the rest was a gloppy mess.  The presentation was awful and there was so much goop on ... No texture at all.  The manager said it was one of their best sellers.  Maybe this restaurant is just not our type and we are not the norm, but based on our meal, I would never even consider giving it another shot.  It is odd to me how places like this stay in business.  On a side note, our waiter was awesome.  He is a student and just moved to the North Hills.  He was friendly, attentive and was the bright spot of the evening."}
{"text":"To start we thought the prices were too high. When spending $18 Plus for the entrees we expected soup, salad or something else to be included, it isn't. Basically you get a high priced salad at $2 off if you have an entree as everything is ala carte. The 3 of us each had lasagna and yes we expected better. It seemed dry without out much tomato sauce, but too much fettuccine sauce which I didn't expect on lasagna. The tossed salad I had did have a nice balsamic dressing and the swarm bread was good. However we all expected more, especially considering the price. If anyone decides to try, I'd only go there with a Groupon, which is what we did."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very busy last night, so our reservations prevented a wait. In my view, this is strictly a pasta restaurant. I would not and have not ordered any of their meat or fish dishes. The pasta is good. We had the apple ravioli and gnocchi with hot sausage and peppers. We also took advantage of a wine special where they were trying to get rid of some odd inventory. We got a very nice California Chardonnay at less than the state store price! We enjoyed prompt professional service and a good overall experience. This is a great little local spot for a casual pasta dinner."}
{"text":"My experience here today was superb.  My daughter has Eosinophilic Esophagitis that causes food allergies.  She needs to be gluten, soy, dairy and egg free.  I have Celiac's disease and need to be gluten free.  The mamager made sure the kitchen knew everything about my daughter's needs and they made her a plain piece of trout.  She loved it and my pasta with shrimp and scallops was AMAZING!  We will definately be eating here again."}
{"text":"The waitress was attentive and strived to attend to any questions we might have had. My aunt and uncle bought me there. The food was delicious. I will return."}
{"text":"Used to be better.  Went here all the time, away for a couple of months.  Came back and disappointed.  Took an elderly neighbor to dinner.  She ordered pork rib eye, I had seafood back and the other angel hair with chicken in bolgnese sauce.  The chop came \"rare\" when ordered well.  It came bake when we were finishing our dishes.  The waiter took my plate literally with my fork in my mouth to pack it up!  We got exactly three pieces of bread.  My seafood bake had two shrimp and two scallops.  Used to be double that.  Our waiter really rushed us out.  He was packing us up and gave me the check while our guest was still eating.  

We were very disappointed.  Has gone down hill.  Sad because I used to love this place!"}
{"text":"Great service, better food. I've been here 5 times, and ordered a different dish each time...all excellent. The bread and dipping oil that comes out at first is THE BEST! The prices may be a little high, but the portions are huge and well worth it. Will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Sad.

No one knows how to cook here, period, a tacky bucket up front collecting money for st Jude's says a lot. A photo of the owners offspring also lessens the professionalism of this place.

Overlooked soup with frozen meatballs, soggy orzo,

Canned beans not drained .....

Horrible pistachio chicken crust with no flavor or salt.

Citrus vinaigrette  was like pouring water on a salad.

This place is hopeless and their current guests must not have a palate for quality food"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. And I always leave wondering why I went back. This last time we went for lunch. The waitress , Rosalie I believe , did not even offer to tell us the specials. When asked she had to go see. Finding out if they had soup which was hidden on their menu was  another thing we had to ask. I also observed her not being able to answer another clients question about the menu. I think part may be that the menu changes a lot. I had mushroom ravioli with sausage which was very tasty but had a very small breadstick with it. My friend had a chicken panini which she said was very messy and came with what they called a side salad. The side salad was the saddest excuse for a salad I have ever seen at a restaurant it barely had 4 leafs of lettuce and again the waitress basically argued she had to get the house dressing. I told her she should have complained but she didn't. The waitress was also bothered that we had water with our meals . I did order coffee for after and never once did she refill it. A table came in late lunch and they put them in this small pvt table room. Personally I think they did it because the rest of the restaurant was empty. They said they were high profile, not. Also after I paid the bill the waitress completely disappeared. I think we were holding her up leaving the whole time thus her rudeness. So the food is average and over priced for what you get. And the service is mediocre."}
{"text":"I had the apple ravioli and my family had the vegetable lasagne and the braised chicken.  I thought the wedding soup was okay and the apple ravioli was pretty good.  It definitely had a different taste but was one that was pretty tasty.  The service was good and friendly but our waitress was a little slow at times.  Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Food is OK but overpriced. Waitress was slow and forgetful. Since they are charging fine dining prices I would expect the service to match. Server placed other tables empty plates on our table several times while filling glasses, etc. I was also asked by server if I could hand her an empty plate sitting near me while I was still eating, very unprofessional. Rarely came to check on us, I waited approx. 10 min to ask for extra sauce then waited another 8 minutes to receive it. Also at 18+ for a bowl of pasta I would expect soup or salad to be included. If you want to pay downtown pricing, go downtown it will be a better experience."}
{"text":"Wow. Website (yelp) said open until 9. Walked in and told \"that's old. We close at 8.\" It was 8:03. Nope- you can't be seated. Terrible customer service. Nasty attitudes. They literally turned off the sign as we were coming in the door. There were people just seated and looking at menus. Will not return. Heard it wasn't that good anyway. We were just trying to support a local establishment."}
{"text":"This was the worst food I have had in many years.  The veal piccata and linguini came with a yellow sauce that was like glue and had NO - like zero - taste."}
{"text":"Too many menus going on. One on the website, a different one for PDF and a new one at the restaurant. What I had chosen before showing up wasn't being offered.
Pasta is overpriced. 
Cranky waitress. 
Kraft Mac and Cheese for a children meal? (It really says \"Kraft\") but, I thought we were at an Italian restaurant!
The atmosphere is average and the plastic table cloths are a little tacky."}
{"text":"We found this adorable place about a month ago and have eaten there 4 times since!! My daughter has celiac disease and they have a bountiful gluten free menu.  She loved the pumpkin squash and the build your own meal.  She got her own gluten free rolls with the dipping oil.  My husband and other daughter fell in love with the lasagna... Which I will admit I stole bites from each of their plates.  I had the lobster ravioli which was okay but not melt in your mouth amazing as the lasagna.  I've since switched to the build your own and have tried the Alfredo with chicken, shrimp, sausage and caramelized onions.  Appetizers have been the Italian stuffed peppers (just enough heat) and the lobster bisque.   Love love love this place.  Even though it's a 3 hour drive from home... It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"After going to Bella a few times there, I've learned the things I love and the things I could go without.  Things I love...their beet salad.  Beets, with mixed greens, candied walnuts, goat cheese and a light vinaigrette dressing.  It is mighty tasty, and a decent size.  I wish they did put a little more beets in it, but hey, it's still worth ordering.  Also love their lobster ravioli.  Homemade ravioli with small chunks of lobster in the filling served in a pink cream sauce with goat cheese on top.  Can you tell I love goat cheese!?  The ravioli are done fabulously with a perfect amount of lobster present.  I almost forgot about their bread dipping oil!  Olive oil mixed with parmesan cheese and cracked black pepper is a perfect complement to the bread.  Bread is always served warm and while it's not my favorite bread locally (Mancini's always has my heart) it's not as bad as a loaf of Schwebels. 

Things that I don't like...Inconsistent food.  I pretty much always get the same 3-4 items because every time I try something new, it's not good.  Chipotle sauce on a steak? Bad.  Apple ravioli? Not a fan.  Beans and greens?  Eh.  But other items knock it out of the ballpark.  The pricing is a little extravagant for a restaurant located in a strip mall.  Chicken parm for 17 bucks?  It's a bit much in my opinion.  

Overall, I will definitely keep going back, ordering a beet salad and lobster ravioli and I will be a happy camper."}
{"text":"Bella Frutteto has the best atmosphere, it was so very inviting.  Nick and I were very pleased with the relaxed setting.  The lighting was very romantic! We did have about a 25 min wait, but it was a Friday night at around 7:30pm.  Our waitress Maura T. was very frriendly and professional.  We started our dinner off with the Banana Peppers.  They were very good and we highly recommend them!  Then Nick had a Caesar salad, which he said was the best he ever had.  For dinner I had the Crab Cake Dinner.  The Crabmeat was very large and cooked perfectly!  Nick had the pick a pasta: Linguini with Shrimp, Chicken and Steak in an Oil and Garlic sauce.  He loved every last bite, even though we took food home, there was so much!
We highly recommend this restaurant, but make sure you call ahead with a reservation!!!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable from atmosphere to waitstaff to food.  We have eaten there on several occasions.  Their portions are plentiful, not huge. The fish dishes are delicious, lasagna verry good, although the red sauce is ok...chunky and a little acidic.  It seemed to rule over the chicken parmigiana. Their other sauces are very tasty tho. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect when eating here this past Tuesday but what a great little surprise it was! My dining partner and I started with an order of beer battered asparagus. The batter was tasty and it came with a side of Dijon sauce that was perfect for dipping. Both the sauce and batter complimented the asparagus which you could still taste. For dinner I ordered the Steak Gorgonzola. The presentation of it was nice with a load of Gorgonzola on top and lines of balsamic reduction across the top of the pasta. I have never had balsamic on a cream sauce before and found that the tartness of it fit perfectly with it's richness. The tips were not that great but it did not really matter to me as that was overshadowed by the great taste of the rest of the dish. My dining partner ended up getting the Chicken Bruschetta and raved about it as well.
The bottom line from this restaurant is that they have some great flavors at a very good price point and I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give 5 stars but I just couldn't. Stuffed peppers were great, but Luke warm. I got the stuffed chicken over linguine. Tasty but just warm, not piping hot the way I think it should have been. Chicken was borderline dry. Hubby got steak Gorgonzola. Same thing, tasty but not hot. I'm not sure if you are supposed to get bread and oil with the meal, we didn't get any. 
I will go back. I want to give it another try."}
{"text":"I come here a couple times a year for some solid Italian food. It sits up in a little plaza overlooking the Sorgel's farm.  It can sometimes be hard to get in and out of depending on traffic in the area.  If you get a nice day request to eat outside on the patio.  

I love the bread and oil that is brought out before the meal.  The bread is fresh and warm, easy to tear off to dip into the oil.  The oil has some spices and my favorite touch some Parmesan cheese. Last time I came here with my girlfriend and we tried the fall special menu.  I had some pumpkin ravioli flavored with butternut squash and she had the apple harvest ravioli. I appreciate when restaurants do specials playing up to the wonderful flavors of the season.  The ravioli was just the right proportion and both really played up to the fall season. 

I've never had any complaints about the food here. This place is a step above the chain Italian restaurants and I will definitely be making my way back here at some point. Good Italian food in the Wexford area!"}
{"text":"Read the positive reviews on Yelp so I decided to celebrate my wife's birthday by taking the family (7 of us) to dinner at Bella Fruetteto since we were in the Wexford area.  Decor is unpretentious and staff are warm and friendly. The waiter was very friendly and accommodating.  Made sure we had plenty of bread and drinks were full.   I had the spicy fillet which is a fillet mignon with a spicy shrimp sauce on top.  I thought it was good but not great.  I also had the lobster bisque, which was pretty good.  My wife had the seafood bake which is shrimp, scallops, fish in a vodka cream sauce on pasta.  She said the same, good but not great.   Overall the meal we rated about a 6.5 to 7.  So this place is above average and the prices are about what you would expect to pay ($15-$20) for most entrees.  Overall I would definitely go back if I was in the area but would not go out of my way to make a special trip here."}
{"text":"We have visited several times, and the only thing that I've had that I enjoyed was the steak panini that is on the lunch menu. So this evening, we attempted to visit for dinner. On our way in the door I asked the hostess if it was possible to order a sandwich off the lunch menu for dinner. \"No\". Well okey dokey out the door we go. I was pretty shocked that she wasn't even going to ask, just nope we can't accommodate you and basically don't want your business. That's fine we will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service Great, Food Great (wedding soup really good). Nice Atmosphere and locally owned.

Would greatly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Bella Frutetto, I really did. I guess from the raves I've seen on Yelp, I expected a lot more. Not so much. From the inattentive, nonchalant hostess who was too distracted to greet us - let alone seat us to the tired decor, we certainly expected more.

The bright spot of lunch was Patty, our server. Loved her little bit of sass, little bit off snark. She made us  smile when after waiting quite a long time for the hostess to return with a gluten-free menu, she strode off to track one down saying, \"What's she doing, printing one?\" 

The food. I had a simple penne with tomato basil cream sauce and sausage. The pasta was waaaay over-sauced...more like soup than pasta. Still, it was tasty. Adequate. My daughter had a trail mix salad. She enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything you couldn't get anywhere. Adequate.

The cost of lunch for a bowl of pasta, a salad and one iced tea? At lunch, not dinner? $30. Eat n Park at the end of the strip mall would have been better and half the price.

One more thing. Rarely do I talk about plating, but the presentation of the orange-ish pasta in an orange-ish dish was not thought out well. For the money, more thought should be put into every aspect...from the substandard hostess, to the surroundings, to the attention to detail in the preparation of the food, to the plating. It could have, it SHOULD have, been so much better. Adequate."}
{"text":"We love Bella Frutteto!  For those of you who have to eat Gluten Free (like me), they have the largest menu options anywhere.  And it all tastes wonderful.  I would suggest the seafood bake - crabmeat, scallops, shrimp, fresh mozzarella and a creamy tomato sauce.
For the people able to eat Gluten, my significant other orders the seafood bake, pasta steak gorgonzola, and the spicy shrimp and scallop pasta.
Their salads are unique and combine some great flavors. We have always been too full to try dessert!
Enjoy"}
{"text":"It's not often that you can take your taste buds on a vacation from suburban sprawl chain restaurants.

Bella Frutteto in Wexford, PA combines traditional Italian favorites with a unique twist.

Overlooking the rolling hills of Soergel Orchards, Bella Frutteto does not leave the assets unused. Many of the extraordinary dishes are prepared with locally grown apples in a harmonious way.

The aura of the restaurant is cool and relaxed with deep colors and modern accents. The bar is pristine, complete with an HD tv which does not take away from your dining experience in this intimate setting.

I was lucky enough to be invited to the restaurant's training event and to taste some of the dishes before they opened to the public.

The restaurant's signature dish, the Apple Ravioli, is deeply rich and must be savored to the last bite. The menu boasts \"Granny smith apples sauted with amaretto stuffed in our house made ravioli, sauted with golden raisins, and balsamic roasted figs in a fresh sage and butter sauce.\" It's not something you can even imagine until you taste it. Upon my first bite, I instantly thought of something you'd eat around the holidays. The accent of the figs combined with the amaretto soaked apples in a comfort food such as ravioli is a kick in the pants for anyone stuck in the doldrums.

Another apple inspired dish is the Apple Brushetta served with warm toast drizzled with balsamic glaze. The combination of different types of apples along with onions and peppers with balsamic reduction creates a pleasing set up for the rest of your meal.

Other dishes sampled at my table included the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and the Mediterranean Pasta. For dessert, we were presented with the freshest biscotti I've ever tasted and the Chocolate Bombe, covered in delectable Frangelico Cream.

The prices were very reasonable for relaxed casual modern dining. This restaurant is a rare gem and a great addition to the North Hills. I know I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Bella Frutteto is our \"go to\" for local dining. The menu is diverse and the food, exceptional. I love supporting locally owned business and Sandy (owner and hostess) is warm, funny and very accommodating. We have always had good service and the prices are fair. The chef (owner) is also accommodating to my garlic allergies, which is difficult when going to an Italian restaurant. Beautiful view of Soergels apple orchard if you sit outside, and you can count on more than one menu item featuring apples. The martinis are yummy, too! The atmosphere is welcoming and there is plenty of parking available. Easy access from 79 makes this restaurant a must in the greater Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Deliciously meal! Highly recommend the Brussels sprout salad and the blackened chicken. The owner also (who is looking very slim and fashionably dressed) was warm and friendly. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Not sure what restaurant the other reviewers ate at, this place is below average you're probably better off at Olive Garden. No atmosphere and brusque service. 
The food managed to be both greasy and bland. Beans and greens were basically a warmed can of beans with a few pieces of spinach, very bland. Our fish entrees were salty and served with the greasiest snap peas I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it's never anything to write home about. Decent, relatively predictable Italian food that doesn't break the bank, although their seasonal specials are sometimes more interesting. The ambiance leaves a little something to be desired for me."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, but yesterday was the first time in about year. What a bad experience. Our server, however, was great. The food was not. We had soup, wedding and chili, both were good, not anything special, but good. Our main courses were AWFUL! My fish (mahi) was so bad, I didn't even eat it. At first bite, it smelled and tasted strange. I sent it back. My daughter had chicken parm, also awful. No taste, chicken over cooked, over fried. I am so disappointed! Won't go back. Never even got the famous bread and oil!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give half stars because Bella is a solid 4.5. We went to dinner with our friends. We were greeted promptly and even though the parking lot was scary full, we were seated immediately. This place looks really small but there is a bigger back room and bar area. The dining areas are warm and cozy, inviting. We were waited on quickly by our waiter who was attentive all evening but not in an in-your-face kind of way. We were given a wonderful basket of warm bread. The bread here is awesome by the way. So fresh and so good. We all got either salads or soups to start. My friend did note that the croutons were not great, tasting more like oil than crunchy bread. Other than that everything was yummy! I got my usual and although a bit overdone, the actual tuna steak was sublime-so fresh! The hubby got the veal parm and it was tender and tasty. The other two in our party had pasta dishes, a gnocchi in a roasted red pepper sauce noting it was good. My friend is a vegetarian and they were accommodating when it came to leaving out the chicken and noting there were not any other meat byproducts in the dish. All in all it was a great evening spent celebrating my bday and my friend's bday (which is next weekend)."}
{"text":"The Bella Brushetta appetizer was good, everything else was just lacking.  The Chicken Diavolo had a ton of banana peppers.  That's not how you make a dish tasty and spicy. The cheese ravioli in pink vodka sauce was boring in taste. The tiramisu cheesecake was below average. My red wine was poured in a small white wine glass to the top.  It's hard to call yourself an Italian restaurant if you can't even pour a glass of wine in a proper glass. 

The service was good. The server was attentive and stopped by the table several times. I asked her a couple questions about the menu and she was well-versed."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night and had called ahead for a reservation. We got there early and were seated right away. I found I had a hard time seeing the menu because the lights were a little too dim. Also the menu was a bit greasy and reflected what little light there was. I wiped the surface of the menu and that made it a little easier.  Since there were only two of us, they seated us in a semi booth (one chair and one booth seat) and I sat facing the wall (and my companion) in the chair.I hate sitting like this but I let it go because they wanted to sit three or four (or more) at the tables. I ordered this chicken breast stuffed with sausage over pasta in a tomato cream sauce. The chicken was breaded and fried. This tasted really good and I was glad for the sausage because the chicken was just a little dry. I would have liked a little more of the tomato cream sauce because it absorbed into the pasta and kinda glued it together but the pasta was cooked perfectly. The salad I had was a dinner salad with Ranch dressing. The dressing was the best ranch I have ever had, and was told that it was made in house. Small complaint with the salad was the abundance of red onion. I know it looks pretty and I like onion on my salad but in the end, half of the goodies on the salad was red onion and I had to pick a lot of it out. Onto dessert, I had the sampler which consisted of a 3 inch canoli (very nice),  a mini chocolate bomb and a creme brulee. The chocolate bomb was great, rich and decadent. The creme brulee wasn't bruleed at all. This is supposed to have a burnt/caramelized sugar on top and the sugar was sprinkled on and not caramelized at all. The creme part was luscious tho. All in all a good enough meal but all the little things took it from 5 to 4 stars but I will try this place again."}
{"text":"The bread here is perfect! It's crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  

The menu is big; lots of choices for pasta, seafood and meat dishes.  We started with the apple bruschetta. It was ok for me, but my aunt and uncle liked it.  We were curious because Bella Frutteto has their own apple orchard.  They also offer an apple ravioli app.  I akso had the house salad with balsamic but the vinegarette was so sour that it burnt my tongue.  I didn't enjoy it that much.

I got the lasagna with spicy sausage and both marinara and alfredo sauce.  I liked it.  My hubby and uncle got the seafood bake, which the server said is their best seller. It definitely looked yummy.  We would probably go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I've been there about a dozen times. Always had a good meal. I love their Cesar salad dressing  I usually get some type of chicken dish. Never can go wrong. I only wish there were a few more fish selection available. Service has always been good. The owners always come over to the table for friendly conversation and to make sure everything is good"}
{"text":"It would be stupid to judge Pittsburg by the one dinner we had on our way through, but if I was going to, it would put this town below even Lincoln, NE. 

Our bread was so under-baked it was  basically just warm dough. I'm a huge bread lover, and for me to forgo the pre-dinner bread offering at a restaurant is very rare, but that's exactly what happened here.

Our pre-dinner crab-cakes were tasty and well done, but our entrees showed just what quality this place is. We ordered the Veal Oscar, and neither of us even made it half-way through the meal. The veal was tough and tasted like a pork chop. The sauce tasted like pure lemon juice. There was no creamy, savory flavor at all. Veal Oscar is allowed to have a little lemon flavor to it, but this was not edible. 

The service was friendly, and the appetizer was alright, but that's the end of the positives for this place. Boo."}
