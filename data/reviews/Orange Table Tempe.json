{"text":"I used to frequent this place when it was in Scottsdale.  I loved this place! So on mothers day I decided to try out the new location via carryout. I called twice and got hung up on twice. I called back a third time to raise a complaint with the manager about the host Danielle ( who clearly doesn't want to do her job). The manager stuck up for Danielle saying that she was a sweet girl and that she would never do that. In the process pretty much telling me he doesn't care about our business. He could not have cared less and took no ownership. It'll be a while if ever I go back here."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time recently and it's become a weekly tradition. Breakfast food is incredible. Love the breakfast sandwich, eggs beni, and unique pancakes. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the few times I ate there for lunch were just average at best. So go for breakfast and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service, quick seating at lunch time on a Sat, & a great menu with good, simple foods and a pretty fantastic cocktail menu. Local beers but not draft, which is okay, but I prefer draft. My sister and split a bacon burger (huge btw) and a Greek salad. Burger was cooked perfect with really fresh ingredients...and incredibly mouth watering delish! Greek salad was also amazing, lots of the stuff that makes a Greek salad great. This place doesn't skimp on the finer ingredients that other places do to save money. Breakfast & lunch prices around $8 to $12 and cocktails around $5 to $12. My sister had an elderflower cocktail and I had a greyhound with fresh squeezed grapefruit; both were incredibly refreshing and perfect for enjoying on the patio amidst a beautiful sunny day. Go here-it's affordable and very, very good. You'll also be full enough to skip your next meal! FIVE STARS EASILY!"}
{"text":"I'm so relieved that this place opened up in the neighborhood. As a young professional thirtysomething I have been very hopeful more good quality, reasonably priced, and locally owned restaurants would come to town. And Orange Table doesn't disappoint! I've taken out of town guests who have always been impressed, gone with the kids, and had brunch with friends. A great experience every time. Especially like the French Press coffee and OT eggs benedict, but have tried many menu items and never gone wrong. The owners, Craig and Alissa, are really friendly and very involved in the community, so I always feel proud to support their business. Highly recommend checking it out. Oh, and great happy hour from 1-4 pm."}
{"text":"Food was very good, but I made a reservation and then had to wait 20 mins to be seated. Very disappointing. And the hostess couldn't explain what happened."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice, hoping it would be better the second time around. Sad to say it was terrible both times. The prices do not match the quality of the food. We will never go back...

First time I had the steak and eggs with chimichurri sauce- steak wasn't cooked well, meat was tough and the sauce was sour! Second time had the wildberry waffles, expecting fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries as it said on menu. What I got instead was some nasty syrup with frozen fruit in it (which by the way cost $2 extra from regular waffles). And the waffles themselves were pretty pathetic- soggy not crisp and golden as you want waffles to be. The others with me had omelettes- greek which had one measly olive and artichoke and some onions. All of the veggies in it were NOT fresh and looked like they came out of a can. Plus the eggs were overcooked and the potatoes were shriveled up and tasteless. 

And the table we sat at had a bunch of dog hair on the seat, the floor and some even on the table. It was disgusting and we were told there was a dog there the night before. This tells me that the place isn't very hygienic- if the dog hair was still there the next morning that means they don't clean up after they close every night and they don't do a basic sweep or clean every morning. Otherwise all that hair wouldn't have been there. Very disgusting."}
{"text":"We, too, were there for a Valentine's breakfast.  Excellent food.  The \"Ménage\" is a great deal and my husband got the Eggs Benedict.  The Bloody Mary was awesome and perfectly spiced up!  Great service and fun art on the walls.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"4 of us tries to go here on December 6th. We made a reservation online only to get to the restaurant and it be empty. The doors were locked, there was no sign or the restaurant and no answer on the phone. Everything online indicated they were still open. It was a bummer, we walked over to Snooze instead."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! The prices are at the high end, but you come here to get the best in both quality and variety and you do. Pancakes, waffles and hash in different styles (you could eat here for breakfast four days in a row with four very different choices and love it all). Decent parking options nearby."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at The. Orange Table for the first time because my friend said it was great. We were the first customers of the day and the only ones on a Friday at 9 am. Our service was good, but we waited 30 minutes for our food without ever seeing our server again until the food was brought to the table.  I'm thinking maybe our server was cooking as well? I dont know whether I'll go back or not because of the lengthy wait on the food, not even an apology  for the wait or an explanation. If you're the only person in the restaurant, one would think the  service would be impeccable."}
{"text":"Have driven past this restaurant a few time, but decided to give it a try when we bought a Groupon.  We were very happy with our dishes.  They took a long time to come out, but the food was very good.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family last week and was looking at breakfast places on Yelp.  Since we are traveling with two young kids, we wanted to make a reservation so we wouldn't have to worry about waiting.  We made our reservation for 8:45am last Friday and when we showed up at the restaurant, no one was even there... I even received a text message from the restaurant to confirm my reservation that morning!  Would never try going back to a place that doesn't even open their doors when they're supposed to be open (as stated on their website and yelp).  Awful!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  It just relocated to Tempe from Scottsdale.  Really unique food like jalapeño pancakes.    You have to go try it!"}
{"text":"So happy Orange Table came to Tempe! It's kind of a new hidden treasure so it's always easy to get a table. The jalapeno pecan pancakes and Sparky's egg white omelette are my favorite breakfast choices. I've only had one lunch item which was a veggie sandwich and it was AMAZING. When you have to select your bread-try the olive bread it is fantastic. Owners are super nice and really want you to have a great experience. Looking forward to trying out their new patio."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. The restaurant was 3/4 full, yet only 2 tables had been served food the first 30 minutes we were there even though there were at least 7 waiters on duty. Perhaps the cooks were late coming in or they ran out of a particular ingredient. (I had been to the Scottsdale location where the service was excellent.)

Tempe has turned into downtown Phoenix as far as parking. Meters were $.25/10 mins which made it difficult to relax and enjoy the meal when the service was so slow. My mind was on the meter even though we'd paid for 1.5 hours. 

On a positive note, the food was good. The pancakes were magnificent, though I'm not sure the maple syrup was authentic. The Catalan omelet was quite tasty; the chorizo flavorful."}
{"text":"So just want to start off by saying that this was my first time at the restaurant and if it wasn't for the fact that I was leaving AZ I'd give this place another shot.

That being said my girlfriend and I didn't have the best experience here, nothing terrible happened but we came here based off the good reviews we had read on Yelp while we were looking for a place to get brunch.

So just to get the bad out of the way here's what made me take 2 stars off:
*we arrived and were told there would be a 25 minute wait (no biggie, that's common) or we could sit at the bar. Being pretty hungry we opted to sit at the bar with another couple. Now none of this is an issue, what was an issue was that there was about 1 or 2 empty, clean tables. Not really sure why we couldn't get seated at one of those? 

*After placing our orders we ended up having to wait about 30 minutes for our food. I typically don't have a problem waiting for food, but I did get irked when the couple who sat and ordered with us and another couple who came in after us go their food before we did. After we asked our server if he knew the status of our food, it came out about a minute later.

The Good:
The food was amazing, my bacon was chewy just the way I liked it, and my French toast was some of the best I had ever had and very filling. My gf and I both got pineapple mimosas (I wasn't a big fan because they were a little too sharp for me, but my gf loved it) 

The atmosphere is very relaxed and great for anyone whether it be college kids or an older couple.

All in all I recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to grab brunch!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a classic breakfast that you can get at Ihop this is the place for you. Service was ok, food was ok, and the fresh squeezed juice had huge chunks in it that you could not drink. We are big foodies that love breakfast and were so excited to try a new local spot and were very unimpressed. They still have a lot of kinks to work out. We wish them the best but probably won't be back. Good thing we used a groupon."}
{"text":"Well, I am glad others had a great experience here. I walked in (its at the bar) I looked at the bar........NO TAP BEER! Really? They list beer on their website. They are all in bottles or cans. so....they basically have 1% of the beers at Safeway. A12 oz. can of Four Peaks Sunbru for $5. sheez. This place is a 2 minute walk from word of beer etc. on Mill ave. Speaking of the bar. The bar material is some cheapo plastic with hundreds of surface scratches. The beer cooler was the size of a dorm room fridge. 
I ordered the steak and eggs. I asked for no additional salt on my food, and that was honored. I ordered my steak medium rare, and, of course it came out well done. 
I thought this place was a joke. Looks like something by the side of the highway out in the middle of nowhere. There were only a couple other customers there while I was there. It was around 10:30 in the morning on a weekday, so probably not representative of peak times. 
I did have a living social voucher, otherwise I would have shrugged my shoulders and left. But, I stayed and thought I should share my experience."}
{"text":"The service here is friendly enough, pretty small area with a small bar area.

The Mexican hot chocolate latte is pretty good! No fancy latte art here, but the drinks overall seem tasty.

The food, however, wasn't that impressive. A friend and I split the French toast plate and it came out fifteen minutes later soggy and seemingly undercooked. I'll definitely come again but maybe order something different and see if they deliver, but I was hoping that since they opened their plates would be on point."}
{"text":"This place recently moved from Scottsdale to Tempe. This is my first visit here. The food is really good. My omelette was one of the best I ever had.  The place is bustling with people - testimony to how good it is.  The bf had the Greek omelette and he said \"it was a substantial and satisfying meal.\" Now that we are all fueled up, we are ready to tackle the day."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere with background music just loud enough for you to hear (background being the operative word), and not so loud you think you're in a dance club (like Snooze and Postino nearby - where I just can't go to anymore due to the frenetic music selection and super loud volume).  I don't want music blaring at me through my meals so loud I have to shout to be heard.  Lunch time us for being chill and enjoying the meal break.  Orange Table is a very nice change and just a block away from those other places!  

Of course, one generally goes to lunch for the food.  I love that the menu includes breakfast anytime.  Today I had French Toast with fruit and a decaf amaretto latte for lunch - it was great!  In the past, I've had a lunch salad (on which they allowed substitions with no upcharge) along with burger and fries (excellent). I also enjoyed excellent service. I'm happy!"}
{"text":"We had 4 delicious meals at Orange Table Tempe today. The food was fresh and the service was outstanding. We are so happy you are close to ASU campus and will definitely be back for more great breakfasts /brunches lunches."}
{"text":"Went with the corned beef hash and eggs! Excellent and the coffee was great too! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"My favorite new breakfast place in downtown Tempe. Great menu, friendly people and a cool  space for breakfast and for lunch.
The sandwiches are amazing, the breakfast is to die for and the salads and burgers are tough to beat. Some of my favorites have been the green flannel, the hash plates, the granola yogi, the french toast, coffee drinks and the green cheddar melt just to name a few. SO good!
Be sure to add this place to your Tempe breakfast and lunch list."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch and cocktail menu. Bonus outside seating area!"}
{"text":"We're always looking for great new breakfast places and this one didn't disappoint. I had the corned beef hash and it was yummy. They have wonderful adult beverages if you like to enjoy those during brunch. The owners are great and treat you like family. It happened to be ASU homecoming weekend and we appreciated that they played the ASU fight song over the restaurant speakers. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were so hopeful for this place. But in the process of being seated and ordering their hopeful 5 star rating decreased to barely one star. The truth of the matter is this place is overwhelmingly popular and the staff and infrastructure just isn't able to handle the demand. We ended up waiting an hour and a half at the bar for our food. We were having a nice day and were in no hurry. But we when asked about the status of our food our waiter JOHN became super defensive and then we found out that the order had never even been placed. No apology, no checking up on his customers, no care for the restaurant or its service. In a belligerent tone JOHN offered to comp the food. I finally asked him To stop arguing with us and walk away. Ultimately he was such a jerk to us we had to leave. As a small business owner I would have fired JOHN on the spot. People will tolerate average food before bad service. 

I can't comment on the food because we never got any."}
{"text":"Tasty brunch, large selection of breakfast and lunch options; including French press coffee and even alcoholic beverage options. I was In town visiting and this was one of the better meals of my stay in Tempe. Cute ambiance, outdoor seating, and great service. Recommended for a low key brunch option that is well worth the money!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  I cruised the menu a few times and was excited to give this place a try. So after being seated we sat unattended for more than 10 minutes. We were looking around trying to make eye contact with the wait staff, nothing. There was no obvious reason for this. There was plenty of wait staff and it wasn't a full house by any measure.  I walked up to a waitress and asked if your table had a waiter.  I few minutes later the same waitress came and took our order with apologies. At this point it's still all good. 

I ordered the garlic mushroom omelette and the Mexican mocha latte. The omelette was plated on top of the garlic sauce. As soon as I touched the sauce with my fork I knew by the skin on the surface that the food was cold. The side of potatoes were unimpressive as well - looked liked the portion was scrapped together and included inedible pieces of potatoes and what I think were onions. My friend really liked her sandwich. I was disappointed enough for the both of us.     

So would I eat here again? The short answer is no thanks. If a friend suggested it and I couldn't talked them out of it I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"We came here a couple weekends ago for brunch. I enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the food.  My husband got the ot style Benedict and I got what they call the ménage: a basic egg, meat, pancake plate.   I enjoyed my food and I even liked my husbands.  I wouldn't mind coming back.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat hidden so make sure you're looking for it but the food is delicious, it may take a while to make but if you have the time it's worth the wait. thinking about returning here again"}
{"text":"The four of us were in Tempe for the Rock n Roll Marathon.  After running we are ready for a really great brunch.  We scouted out the Orange Table the day before and made reservations online through Yelp.  The restaurant is only a couple blocks off Mills Rd. It has both indoor and outdoor seating with a full bar and TV,s on the walls.  Great waiter took care of us.  I had the Chimichurri Hash, my husband had the Green Flannel, the couple we were with had the Rustler and a two egg breakfast.  The coffee was great!  We happened to make it for Happy Hour that started at 1:00, so tried their Bloody Mary's.  They were the best ever!  All of us were so happy with our choices and cleaned our plates.  We definitely will return to the Orange Table the next time we visit Tempe, and we definitely recommend it.  Oh, and did I mention we loved how comfortable this place was!"}
{"text":"So I didn't know being served an omelette with 1/4 cup of oil underneath it and raw pancakes in the middle were a thing?! Yikes!! This place has very scary food."}
{"text":"Every part of the rueben is made in house, and every part is basically perfect. The flannels and pancakes look delicious. 

The decor and the space aren't quite as nice as the old Scottsdale location, but they are coming along nicely, and with food this good, I'd eat in a dark room if need be."}
{"text":"We had been to the original Orange Table and loved it, so we were very excited to see it had moved to Tempe and was light rail accessible.  The space is nice, but nothing over the top.  The service was good, but a little slow sitting at the bar.  The food was fantastic - I enjoyed a hot chocolate and the Greek omelette...yummy!  My husband had a combo breakfast and said the pancakes were some of the best.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, food was not well-cooked, and the prices were too high for the food we received and ambiance we experienced. The wait staff was pleasant and the menu was promising, but everything just felt disorganized and not quite put-together. I feel that maybe in a few months they'll have their \"stuff\" together a little better, but as of today I feel they charged far too much for the experience they were offering."}
{"text":"Ok... This one is tough... Immediately walked in and felt the stuffy atmosphere. Sat  down looking forward to the good food I have been hearing about and placed my order. Service had been pretty solid at this point. Ended up waiting 35 minutes for our food and when it came mine didn't.... Following this disappointment I politely asked the server if he could turn the air down a little bit as the entire restaurant was fanning themselves and he responded with the air conditioner had been broke for hours... In Arizona.....its 102 out mind you. I feel like that should have been brought up when we walked in and sat down rather than as we were wiping sweat off of our heads. As we keep going down this journey I finally get my food which was quite a delightful burger. We QUICKLY  asked for our checks and were kept waiting as the bar tender chatted it up with another group as we were left sweating. I'm not a cheap ass by any means and still left a 20% tip however I was hoping for some sort of a discount.... Must have caught orange table on a bad day but I don't think I'll try again."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday morning with friends for our first time.  It wasn't too busy so we got seated pretty quick.  Entire staff was friendly and I never caught them just standing around. The food was amazing! I had the traditional french toast,  bacon,  and breakfast potatoes. I think that was the best french toast I've ever had. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After my third visit to Orange Table Tempe, I am still rating it only 3 stars.  Why? It's SO LOOUUUD, I consistently have to raise my voice to be heard across the table. On a busy day, expect a slight wait and a bit of a high noise level.  On an average day, the noise level has a hopping energy to it and enhances the experience.  

The food is EXCELLENT and I immediately zeroed in on my favorite dish on my very first visit, the vegetarian hash.  The vegetarian hash is consistently delicious, crispy and non-greasy, the bacon is solid, and their chamomile tea is absolutely lovely.  The last time I was there, I did have a small allergic reaction because my toast came back with butter (severe dairy allergy), but I forgive them.  Sigh. The times you don't check your food is when it happens.

I would go back here again, however, and enjoyed great service here."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time at Orange Table. I showed up a minute or two after my friends only for the server to pay little to no attention to me, I was never given a menu to look at, never got to order a drink and when I did got the wrong thing, ordered the stake & eggs that should have come with chimichurri as it said on the menu in the name of the dish but got none. The server never asked how I wanted my steak cooked and I was given a raw slab of meat I wouldn't feed my dog. To try and get some attention from my server who spent most of her time in the kitchen I cut my steak in half and left one half on top of the other to show the very uncooked state of my meat, and with no question if we needed anything else or asking how the meal was our checks where on the table and she was gone again. Worst service and kitchen staff of anywhere I have ever been!"}
{"text":"Can we talk about the morning breakfast shots please? I don't think its possible to not do one of these if you're with you're friends. I had the banana pancakes and split an order or eggs Benedict. Also got a side of the chicken sausage that was soooo good. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Had okay service, since the server was new. Not a big deal, especially since I've been a new server before.

The atmosphere was chill. Not a ton of seating, but it wasn't busy on Saturday morning. 

Parking: It's metered all around their restaurant, FYI.  The parking was fine when we visited because it wasn't busy near the ASU/mill area, but parking could become a total pain, if busy. 

The menu was totally overpriced, especially when their breakfast food portions were child menu sized. 

We ordered the ménage and the yogurt/granola/fruit items. The ménage includes 2 eggs, 2 cakes, and 3 sausages. I order the eggs over medium and they were cooked correctly. They were able to make the cakes gluten free, which made then less fluffy than traditional cakes, just another fyi. The sausage was good, nothing special. 

Gluten Free Peeps: They have gluten free bread so 1) you can order toast; 2) you can order french toast; or 3) they can substitute any of the meals that have cake items included with a particular meal, with the french toast gluten free bread item instead. Their pancake flour is wheat based and granola is not gluten free. They didn't charge me extra for the substitution, which was cool. 

Only reason the stars are low is the overpriced meal points coupled with small portions...and their breakfast food isn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Good food, good people, nice atmosphere! Overall nice place to meet with friends and family!"}
{"text":"We were a huge fan of the Scottsdale location and now we are even bigger fans of the Tempe spot! I've been dying to go back to OT since it relocated. It was worth the wait. Same amazing menu and great service. The Chimichurri steak & eggs is my favorite, but it's hard to choose between the different hashes and fluffy pancakes. I took a bite of my son's Monkey Cake this morning and it was sinful. 
OT isn't just great for breakfast. Lunch is also a culinary adventure!l The burgers are excellent and the grilled cheese...YUM. Order it with tomatoes. 

The staff and owners at OT are so helpful and accommodating. They happily changed our reservation from 6 to 9 on Friday (for Mother's day no less!!) and then had two tables waiting for us today. One inside and one outside beautifully decorated with oranges. Most restaurants make a fuss when you change any reservation, OT not only accommodated us, but then gave us two table to choose from. That's what you'll get from this place - true service."}
{"text":"First time here was earlier today before the ASU game to have breakfast.   It was crazy busy and we had to wait about 30 min.  Once we were inside, I really enjoyed my garlic mushroom omelette but instead of Swiss cheese I did cheddar.  And thanks to Orange Table I have found my new favorite morning cocktail called Breakfast at Tiffany's.  I am telling you it is yummy.  I look forward to coming in when I am not in a rush to watch the football game and relax and also I would like to try their lunch."}
{"text":"Went to Orange Table for brunch and the food was pretty good. I had the Eggs Benedict - OT Style. Drinks were pretty weak and small, so that was pretty meh. 

However, the service was really not good. I walked in and it was so disorganized. Servers were running around like crazy and kept handing me (and others) off to one another. There was no structure and no one was taking control of the situation. They were not prepared for a mildly busy Sunday morning. Thank goodness our group had reservations, or I would have headed somewhere else."}
{"text":"We came here hoping for amazing food and service, what we got was slow service when the place was only at about 60% full. The waiter just kept walking back to the kitchen for no apparent reason, It took over 30 min to get our food and when it did most of it was wrong and we had to ask for everything that normally comes with your meal ( condiments, napkins, salt and pepper, syrup), ordered a burger med well and it came out super pink and a little bloody, had to wait for fries, and for them to cook the burger correctly. ordered pancakes and had to wait for about 8 min for the syrup. The potatoes were tasteless and very greasy. The price of their food does not match the quality or quaintly of it. 

After a few complaints to the hosted and bus boy, who seemed to be the only ones paying is attention the owner came out to apologize, he said they had callings and they were busier than usual and wanted us to come back, he comped our meal and invites us back. We're gonna give it another try to see if it's any better."}
{"text":"A lil over price ? Is that the complaint here . Food is absolutely delicious and worth every penny . Food taste fresh . Top 5 breakfast spot I've ever been to . Would have to come try out there lunch . Oh what did I get . The green chile flannel . I believe that was the name of it . My friend got the French toast . Had a taste of that 2 . Once again delicious . Real fruits . Not that cheap stuff everyone else has . Eggs taste farm fresh . Need I say more ....."}
{"text":"Really liked this place when they were in Scottsdale and we would go in occasionally.  Thought they sold and closed but realized one of the owners reopened in Tempe.  Went in for eggs and bacon and berry waffles.  Also, the mushroom omelet, mimosa, and Americano.  Everything was good.  I think it will get more refined as they work out the kinks.  The staff is great and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, cool building and location. Service was really good. Great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Orange Table and I found it delightful. There was plenty of seating for groups of all sizes, $1 coffee and $2 latte specials and it had a business casual atmostphere. I had the hatch omelette. It was delicious and if you like spicy food this is the meal for you. They aren't kidding around with the hatch green chiles. In AZ i.am used to mild green chile so i was a bit taken aback but the chicken and sweet onions counter balanced beautifully. What will.make.me want to come in everyday though, is the bacon!! I ordered a side of bacon and OMG it practically melted in my mouth. It was perfectly cooked and crunchy and felt like a treat. I think I have found my new breakfast-as-lunch spot. There was a diverse breakfast/lunch menu and you could tell they were excited to be near campus because they had created (or renamed) a few menu items to show off their Sun Devil pride. This is a create addition to the Downtown Tempe District and students, staff, families and tourists will all enjoy Orange Table"}
{"text":"Creative breakfast and lunch menu in a artsy like setting. Outdoor seating as well. Ordered the Maroon and Gold Flannel. (Corned beef, roasted beets and potatoes topped with cool sour cream.) Only problem was that I couldn't find the corned beef. Being that corned beef was a highlight to me ordering a Flannel, I mentioned it to the server. She quickly brought back hot portion of just corned beef for me to add to the dish. Instantly it was a perfect meal. Come with 2 eggs and choice of toast. The server was also very attentive throughout my visit. Will definitely go back to try the jalapeño pancakes."}
{"text":"Alright,  here we go...  This place deserves 6 stars (seriously)!  

Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE breakfast fan.  Always have been, always will be.  Trust me when I tell you this place deserves 6+ stars from the food alone, but it doesn't stop there!  

My order:  Red Flannel Hash - if you like beets you have to try this, it is superb.  If you are not a fan of beets (my girlfriend is not and she still loved it) don't worry, there are at least 5 other Hash / Flannel options to choose from and they all sound amazing.  I am coming back every weekend until I try them all and curb my Homemade Corned Beef Hash Fix!!!

GF's order:  Standard Bacon, Egg, Potato combo - Eggs: Cooked to perfection.  Bacon: also cooked to perfection with a very nice smoke to it.  Potatoes:  Best I have ever had by far!

BTW, the breads that come with each plate are outstanding (I recommend the olive bread)

At the end of our breakfast I told my date it was the best I had ever had.  She looked shocked to hear that coming from me (critical breakfast guy)!

I know most people are on here to hear about the food.  But I must say the service was also top notch!  The owner was there working up a sweat as he ran around and when he heard us raving about the food, he brought out a french toast plate called \"Bananas Foster\".  Once again, Best Damn French Toast I Have Ever Eaten!"}
{"text":"When we first arrived we were told there would be about a 40min wait until we got our food. It was Sunday, during the busiest hour, so a wait was expected, we were seated after a short wait, but our waiter was distracted and forgot silverware, but had waters for us promptly. It took forever for our check to come but the food was excellent. Excellent pancakes and chipotle chicken sandwich, but were out of Belgian waffles."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome bloody Maria, and amazing service. This was my first time here and I really liked it.  The waiter was great to me kids."}
{"text":"From the time we arrived and throughout breakfast, it was a very bad experience. My omelette was drenched and dripping of oil and our waitress was not knowledgable of the menu. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came around 9 on a weekday, we were the only ones there so we were a bit worried, but the food didn't let us down!  Service was fast, we had lunch items that were fantastic.  Great portions and served hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I came to the Orange Table Tempe on a Sunday morning at 11:30am, we were seated quickly and our order was placed promptly. I had high hopes with the great reviews on Yelp.

Our food came after awhile, I got the Green Flannel. I took a bite. It was cold, not even warm, colder than room temperature. Eventually the waitress came back to check on us. I had to send it back to be remade. My friends steak was warm, her eggs were cold. She thought about sending it back too, but said it was okay and didn't. She tried my Green Flannel and agreed that I had to send it back, since it was so cold.

My second Green Flannel came out, it was mostly jalapeños and barely any hash. The waitress said my eggs were coming... I would have liked my whole meal at once. And then I had to remind her about my toast. We had to go to the counter to ask for the check, since our waitress seemed to be distracted and not really paying attention. She ran the bill and the took forever to bring it, so we went to the counter again to sign. The staff was playing with the remote and watching football. I have never written a bad review on a restaurant before, this is my first. I eat out frequently around Phoenix. My friends would consider me a foodie. 

The kicker: I ordered coffee at the restaurant, but I did bring in my own coffee in my Sacramento naked lounge to-go glass coffee mug. I accidentally left my unique mug and didn't realize until the afternoon, after they had closed. I called this morning, less than 24 hours later, to see about picking it up today and I was told by the manager (maybe owner) that he threw it away yesterday afternoon. \"You didn't call yesterday, so it went out with the trash. I can't keep everything that people leave.\" I could see 2 days later throwing it away, but less than 24 hours? And blaming the customer, for not calling by closing at 4pm? Really? Do you throw away people's drivers licenses or credit cards if they don't come back for them before closing? No lost and found for things that your customers accidentally leave behind? No you just thrown it away. Unacceptable. 

Platinum Service: treating others how they want to be treated. Restaurants come and go. There's plenty to choose from in Phoenix. I'd sure be more mindful how you treat your customers, you lost one. And I will not be recommending your establishment."}
{"text":"The other reviewers weren't messing around. This place is awesome. I had the Greek omelet with egg whites, a mimosa, and a coffee, all of which were delish. I especially liked that the mimosa was made with both orange juice and grapefruit juice to  lessen the overall sweetness of the drink. Great brunch."}
{"text":"This will be an as served review. Just received my giant cup of coffee and it's great. My wife is enjoying a morning mimosa. Very quaint restaurant, really convenient to the Residence Inn and ASU for an early breakfast. Service has been real pleasant. Next....the meal. Ok....did you feel the 20 minute delay? I was enjoying a great breakfast with a surprisingly good tasting Schreiders sausage (I never had these before). Wife is having these 2 huge banana nut pancakes and loving them. This is really good chinch!!! The breakfast potatoes are well worth ordering with breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm broken hearted writing this review. Since the move to tempe we have tried brunch three times and the last 2 have been disappointing. The ingredients and quality are just not what they used to be. The veggie hash was basically a side of potatoes with one artichoke, 4 olives and a few beets. The plate was honestly sad. I used to order this in Scottsdale every weekend and it was this amazing heap of every delicious and fresh veggie that I would never make myself. My husband ordered the steak and eggs and it was cold and swimming in sauce. The service was ok this time at least. On a previous occasion we waited literally over an hour for our food because they had run out of eggs. (I didn't even order a breakfast dish on that visit)

Unfortunately This might be my goodbye letter to orange table. If the quality from Scottsdale was still there I would have driven to tempe every Saturday for you, but right now it doesn't seem worth it."}
{"text":"First time visiting Orange Table today was just before the ASU football game. The staff was able to handle the crowd very well. The food was tasty, I had the corn beef hash and scrambled eggs. I really liked the fresh squeezed orange juice. Our server was courteous and prompt even considering of the place was packed. Will definitely come back and recommend it if you're in Tempe."}
{"text":"The food is great (try the chimichurri sauce!) and the coffee drinks are even better. The service can be slow if they're busy but the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming."}
{"text":"OMG. Hit the restroom prior to ordering. It smelled so bad from long term lack of cleaning that I was afraid to order food. I mentioned it to my husband, who had  just returned from the men's room. He said the same thing. We left....feared that the kitchen cleanliness was of the same caliber. Come on guys...a little Lysol and elbow grease  goes a long way."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but prepare to wait for a table. Restaurant is rather small inside but food and the Bloody Mary are good. Apparently they take reservations (even for 2!) so call ahead on the weekends. Definitely wish we knew that! Will be going back"}
{"text":"Orange Table Tempe is the best! The staff is so friendly and the food is amazing! I'm in love with the Smocha Mocha and could eat the banana fosters French toast everyday. But I really like their lighter fare! Great options if you are trying to be mindful of your eating or want to indulge. A must stop for anyone visiting Tempe!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went looking for a place for breakfast after cruising by his favorite place and seeing it was packed. We drove by this spot and decided to give it a try. We were happily surprised, sort of.
     We sat outside on a nice Sunday morning. The location is pleasant and is not noisy, even with cars driving by.
     We both a had breakfast. He had the chorizo omelet and I had the French toast. Both items were good but to be honest could have been better. For the price my friend could have had a more substantial amount of home fries with his meal. There weren't very many. The omelet was nice and fresh and he enjoyed it.
     I had the French Toast. It had good flavor, but to be honest, I could only eat part of it. The crush on the bread was so hard it made it difficult to cut even with the knife they gave me. I would choose a softer bread that soaks up more egg. It would make a big difference. My sausages were outstanding. Tender, moist with lots of juice and flavor.
     Service was a little slow, but not bad for as many people that were eating here. We had OJ and my friend thought it was fresh squeezed. I wasn't sure, but it was good.
     I'd recommend this spot, if your not in a hurry but want good fresh food."}
{"text":"I just came for a drink, I asked for the Mexican Mule but tequila is all out so I tried the next big thing; Bloody Mary and it was a perfect blend! Would have tried their food but I'm not ready just yet. I like the art stuff that they display."}
{"text":"Amazing service and DELICIOUS food! Moved to Tempe a few months ago and was getting tired of my regular breakfast routine so decided to give Orange Table a try and I'm blown away! Definitely will be back multiple times per week. 100% give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've dined here twice. The first time I wasn't too impressed with my meal. I had a hatch omelette. The chicken was overcooked and tough and the lack of seasoning made it taste bland. Our second dining experience was much better. I had the green flannel, which was a lovely mix of corned beef and veggies. The coffee drink I had was a great compliment to my meal. Service was good and we were checked on as needed."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite in my yelp profile, it is the corned beef hash with chimichurri sauce at the new location of Orange Table in Tempe. I had heard about their hash for years but had not wanted to brave the legendary crowd of people at their Scottsdale location, now I know, I missed out.  I talked with John, the GM for this location, and he told me the hash was made from scratch - generally, I like the stuff from the can better but not now, their hash here is the best, and this is coming from a hash hound (and that is not meant as a drug reference, though I do live in Tempe). I got the sourdough toast and the bread they use is a cut above - nice and crispy and thick and you get several types of jam to go with your toast, just ask. 

As for what is chimichurri sauce, it is a sauce of fresh herbs, olive oil and vinegar that comes from Argentina and is generally slathered on steaks - who knew this cross-cultural mash-up of my beloved hash and this sauce would be so off the hook, certainly not I! John (the GM) noted that one of the guys from the Pig and Pickle comes every week for this dish so give it a try - oh, they do add some jalapeno to it so it has a slight kick but nothing too much - just gives it that Arizona swing, you know? 

As for cost, the hash, with two eggs and toast is $11.75 - and the various coffee drinks are reasonable but expect about $15 to $20 for breakfast - not bad for a good breakfast. John noted that Saturday was still slow so hey yelpers, get out their and give it a try if your someone like me not willing to brave the old town Scottsdale region for a better than average breakfast - better yet, you can easily walk to here from the light rail - get off at the Transportation center by the Sun Devil. stadium and it is like a 3 minute walk. :-)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed visiting this place - in fact, I was there twice in the same weekend as it's a great spot for pre-ASU events too!  Great menu, friendly people and a cool  space for breakfast/lunch.  I also like that they support local artists by displaying their art throughout - great vibe! 

My food was fantastic - I had the Chicken Salad Sandwich and really liked the kick they put in it to make it unique.  The service was great as well and I can't wait until they get their patio!"}
{"text":"I was served curdled cream.  They were very nice to get my fresh cream but the sight of those clumps entering my coffee was more than I could deal with.  The first time I went there was pretty good."}
{"text":"First time eating here today and I will be back for sure. The atmosphere was open, modern and clean. Had a bunch of local art on the walls. Love the local feel. Had the eggs Benedict OT style with avocado and chorizo. Was awesome. Craig the owner was there and gave me a sample after of their famous bananas foster French toast. Wow! That syrup was like nothing I have had before. It was a mix between a great French toast and just like grandma made sticky buns.  Staff was nice and helpful. Bathroom was clean. Parking can be tough but not in the morning."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a Valentine's Day breakfast, and everything exceeded my expectations. We were seated quickly, the server was very helpful and attentive, and our food came out really quickly.

I ordered the \"Monkey Cakes\", and my wife had the Monico Hash. The food was absolutely beautiful and tasted amazing! The pancakes were huge and really tasty, and my wife really enjoyed her food. They do the little things so well here - the jam for the toast was homemade, the fruit bowl on the side was really great quality, and even their breakfast potatoes were well above average. We'd definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Ok, I followed this place from Scottsdale for the food but even that is starting to be a let down. My wife and I ordered the corned beef hash and the green flannel but they were more mashed potatoes than beef and my wife's soda was more like a glass of water than a bubbly beverage. The decor started out as a place for local artists to display their work, now it reminds me of a jock's high school bedroom, adorned with stapled, taped, and nailed (classy) sports posters from the 70's and 80's. The best thing about our dining experience was our server. He was happy, polite and very attentive. He is the only thing that saved this review from a 2 star review. As much as it pains me because this place used to be the reason I went out for breakfast, I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Been going to The Orange Table for years and I couldn't be happier that they're now close enough to walk! NCOUNTER CAN SUCK IT. This will be my breakfast spot from now on. Sunday Funday anyone?"}
{"text":"We came here because we had a Living Social voucher and wanted to try somewhere new and local. We waited way too long for a table, even though there were plenty available. Food took 40 minutes to come out and was cold. And they didn't  cook any of our eggs correctly- we tried Eggs Benedict and one of the Flannels with an over easy egg on the side- none of the yolks were runny. Disappointing because this place had so much potential."}
{"text":"The jalapeno pecan pancakes are unreal!! The environment and service are great. Just make to get there early on the weekeneds. This place is always  packed."}
{"text":"Our experience at Orange Table has been consistantly good. Best brunch place around. Be sure to try Monkey Pancakes or Bananas Foster Waffles. Various versions of hash - all great. Good selection of burgers. Have never hafd anything less than tasty! So happy they are now in Tempe near ASU. We try to hit this spot at lest twice a month!"}
{"text":"Although the help needs help in customer service , the food was delish.  Keep in mind when you go, you're there for the food."}
{"text":"We came here on a busy Sunday and grabbed a seat at the bar.  We got our drinks and placed our food order soon after.  After waiting for our food for over an hour and seeing people who had arrived after us get their food, we stopped the bartender to ask about our order.  He acted defensive and said he would check on it.  Turns out the kitchen never got our order.  He didn't offer an apology and seemed to have an ambivalent attitude about the situation.  As a result we decided just to leave."}
{"text":"The first time I came here with the eggs, wait time, etc was a fluke. I've been back here a few times after that because the food was so good. Every other time after has been a great experience with good food and good service. I like to see every time I come how they change the art also! This is now my go-to brunch place :)"}
{"text":"The good- they take reservations
The bad- it's still crowded/understaffed 
The ugly-not the prettiest decorations

But for more a appropriate tag line, Orange Table is all about \"The Missing\"
-milk
-paper towels in the bathroom
-coffee 

WaitWhat?! Yes! They ran out of coffee. How does that even happen? It's a breakfast joint and people want coffee on a Sunday morning.

And all the extra little things were missing:
-spoon with coffee (once it finally came)
-cream with coffee (requested when ordered)
-Bloody Mary (had to ask for it 3 times)
-syrup with pancakes (who eats pancakes plain?)

The food was ok/good, but the road to the food was a struggle. The struggle is real.  Don't think I'll be rushing back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I live and work in the area and I'm so glad that Orange Table is now in Tempe instead of Scottsdale. My favorite breakfast is the Green Flannel. It's sort of a corned beef hash on steroids. They have full table service and the staff is super friendly. The patrons are an even mix of ASU students, faculty, locals and tourists. You can go wrong with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is closed down. It was the hands down best breakfast place in Tempe. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. The Mexican Chocolate Latte is great, and the food is very good as well."}
{"text":"My new favorite brunch spot in the Phoenix area. The entire menu is awesome! Everything is reasonably priced, the location is great, and the staff is fantastic. I love how involved the entire family is in running this business. If you live in, or are visiting, the area, make this place a must on your food list."}
{"text":"Quaint little spot near the university.  

As a neighborhood breakfast spot, its adequate & average all around.  Where they really shine is with their coffee creations. Cappuccinos, mexican cocoa's, and chai beverages here are fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! Very friendly staff, lively atmosphere, amazing food-get the jalepeno pancakes and Mexican Latte; very unique and delicious. For lunch, get one of their chicken salads, but be prepared to take 1/2 back to the office...they are generous portions.  Another time I had their egg white omelet for lunch and it was light and I felt good going back to work. In short, if you are in the ASU/Tempe area, you must check out this place!"}
{"text":"Food as always, some great some not (griddle management issues... pancakes shouldn't be burnt or taste like hash). The flannels and hash keep up us coming back. Service is not as good or consistent as it was in Scottsdale (and, yes, I realize what an odd statement that is)."}
{"text":"Went last Sunday (the day after Game Day @ ASU) good parking and great seats.
Their \"ManMosa's\" (Mimosa w/a shot) are worth the trip (from California) and the Pineapple Mimosa is really good too. Portions are HUGE (great for a family meal to share or the College student with limited funds, you can share with a friend and split the check). Enough TV's so every seat is \"a good seat\" and food is deliciously fresh, simple and well priced (try the wild berry pancakes). Seriously, It's like sitting in your Uncle's den for a family Brunch. The owner, Craig, is both gracious & humble (he came out of the kitchen to make sure EVERYTHING was too our liking and gave me background information on the art/artist the decorate the walls-I plan to purchases one on my next visit). Our server, Danika had a great presence and made our experience that much more enjoyable. Never experienced the Scottsdale location but I make a stop in Tempe every time I'm in town.. Aaron P, don't cheat yourself and give them another try, I'm sure they will exceed your expectations !"}
{"text":"I had my first visit at The Orange Table Tempe today and I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of my experience. I ordered the white flannel with over easy eggs and an English muffin and my boyfriend ordered the steak and blu sandwich with a side of French fries. He was satisfied with the freshness of his ingredients but thought the blu cheese sauce was a bit on the heavy side for his personal tastes, but stated it was tasty nonetheless! My corned beef, potato and veggie flannel was lacking a bit of salt but a few dashes did the trick, and my eggs were cooked perfectly. I did however, removed the giant dollop of sour cream because I didn't think the flavors paired well and was too rich for the already heavy meal. Again this is just personal preference and not a reflection on the quality of the food. 
Our waiter was quick, polite and attentive and answered every question I had since it was my first visit. Portion sizes were large and we ended up taking a box home with left overs. 
Great food, quick service and a large menu selection! I will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw there was a Groupon for the restaurant, so we decided to give it a shot. We've been here twice and both times have been unimpressed. The first time we came for lunch. It was around noon and there were only two other couples in the  restaurant. We were seated quickly and water was brought out promptly, but it took an unreasonable amount of time to get our order taken. We sat there trying to make eye contact with the waitress who didn't seem to be interested. Finally, the hostess came and took our order after about 15 minutes. I got a sandwich and my boyfriend got the breakfast burger. The maple mayonnaise was good on the burger, but the rest of the food was just okay. The chicken on my sandwich was overcooked and a bit dry. On our second visit we decided to go for breakfast. It was definitely busier, but we were seated quickly. Our waiter was friendly and took our orders quickly. We ordered chai drinks which were more milk than actual chai. We mentioned it to the waiter who brought out more chai which helped a little. It still tasted more like watered down milk than chai. As for our food, I got the monkey cakes and the boyfriend got the white flannel. The flannel had a big glob of sour cream on top which seemed to have taken over the flannel. He was disappointed that there were so much big strips of onions and minimal amount of actual potatoes and corned beef. On the menu it said that the monkey cakes had bananas, almonds and coconut. When I got my cakes the first cake had bananas and almonds, but the second cake only had walnuts. Not anymore on the menu did it say walnuts. If they ran out, it would be nice to have been told so. What if I didn't like walnuts? Also, the second cake that had the walnuts was placed under the first cake which seemed like they knew they were in the wrong so they were trying to cover it up.

The service isn't terrible and for the most part the staff is friendly. However, the food didn't seem as good as most of the reviews are raving about. Would we come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"After wanting to try the original Orange Table for a long time (and not doing so for whatever reason), I was glad to try the new location. First of all, OT allows you to make reservations through Yelp.... that's so cool! I made a reservation for 10:30 on Super Bowl Sunday, thinking this place would be insane... turns out they were fairly empty, so the res was unnecessary, BUT it was nice to have the piece of mind. The restaurant itself is cute, it has interesting paintings on the wall, it has a large orange table (that makes sense, right?), and a nice bar. We were greeted at the door by (possibly) the owner? It was nice, they opened the door for us and were extremely friendly. We had a great waiter (Josh), who was attentive and helpful. They serve their coffee in giant saucers... which is fabulous! Oh, and this bowl'o'coffee was never empty! For food, I had the benedict OT style (at Josh's rec), this is a benedict with chorizo and avocado. The husband had the banana pecan pancakes. The benedict was legit... the hollandaise was tasty, the eggs were cooked perfectly, the chorizo complemented the dish nicely... only problem was the dish didn't have a lot of texture, but that was a mild issue. The potatoes that came with this dish were also tasty and served with onions and peppers... yum. The cakes were also very tasty, the batter tasted home made and the bananas and pecans added great flavor and texture. The prices here are a bit on the high side, but the quality make it worth it. The pancakes were 12$, but they came with bacon, so it really wasn't a bad deal. I will definitely be back, thanks OT!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, unfortunately the service was terrible. It didn't take long to sit, but the food took almost 40 min to come out. Then it took another 20 to get the check. Probably will not be coming back here again. The food just wasn't good enough to make up for the terrible service."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Try the Mexican hot chocolate specialty coffee- AMAZIng!!! Every time I've been here, it is not crowded. I never wait for a seat and always find close metered parking. Compared to the other super busy brunch places nearby, this is a huge treat!! Granted, I've never tried to go on a weekend... Orange Table is a hidden gem near campus!"}
{"text":"The R&R race was a great opportunity for a family and friends reunion. Now that most of us were going separate ways we needed a location for one last breakfast and The Orange Table was perfect. The reviews mentioned it being a small locale so I made reservations but on MLK holiday we were the only ones at 8:30 am. We are an eclectic group, as was our breakfast selections. Omletes, waffles and scrambles, tea, chai, coffee, latte and my Bloody Mary. Our only complaint was the Latte was barely warm. We declined their offer for another, my wife finished it without telling anyone, but they removed the charge from our ticket. 
If I come back here to race next year it will be a Go-to place."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my breakfast.  I bought a groupon and was excited to try this place.  I ordered the two egg breakfast, it took forever to come and was cold!  Not to mention there was the smallest amount of potatoes on my plate, I should have taken a picture.  There was no butter on my toast but my friends toast all had butter.  We only saw our waiter when we ordered, he only came back when we were done eating.  I probably wouldn't return for breakfast, would maybe give their lunch a try."}
{"text":"The location is great if you are an ASU student and you just have to walk there. There isn't enough parking if you are driving there, you'd have to pay at a meter to park close. Luckily, we came here on a Sunday morning and the meters were free for parking. Table of 5 and got seated fairly quickly, we also got our food fairly quickly. Service is good but food is not so great, although the food presentation is nice. I am taking a star off because we were sweating as the AC was not working and we were promised that it would have been fixed in 15 minutes after we sat down but we finished eating and the AC was still not on. Personally there are better and cheaper breakfast places around Tempe."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about one of my favorite restaurants was that it was too far away from me. Tempe is a much better place for this hip breakfast lunch bar. Some of the best breakfast around. The green flannel is phenomenal."}
{"text":"location: it is located right next to ASU. The restaurant is a bit small, but you can make reservation through yelp. So cool!!! 

Service: Great service from hostresses to our waitress. They were attentive and constantly stopping by to see if we need anything including refill. 

Food: I ordered a Latte and waffles covered with different types of berries. It was absolutely delicious. It came with 4 pieces of waffles and I shared that with my friends. They let me try a bite of their food and I really like the omelet that my friend ordered. 

Rating: I will definitely come back here again to try something else."}
{"text":"I came on Sat April 18th we showed up at 745 am and the place was not opened I double checked hours online and it said 7 am. We could see someone inside but they were not coming to the door. there was my party and 1 other there. Finally the door was opened at 815. Once we were seated the service and food was good. But if you are not going to open until later you should change your hours online to reflect that."}
