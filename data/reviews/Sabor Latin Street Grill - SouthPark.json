{"text":"Service here is good and quick, nice casual place to grab a couple of tacos and a beer. I had the steak autenticos and the super glass bottled Sprite."}
{"text":"We have been to the NoDa location once and the South Park location twice.  We have had different items on each trip.  Everything has been great (except the margaritas, but everyone makes them too sweet and too weak).  Quick, easy place to get a flavorful meal at a good price.  We will be back."}
{"text":"On popular days like Friday, Saturday, or Taco Tuesday, Sabor is packed!  We actually had to take our food home because their wasn't enough seating.  The burritos are amazing but the few times I have asked them to add lettuce they have failed repeatedly.  Other than that, it is one of my favorite places in Charlotte for Latin/Mexican food, and never fails to be delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place came here on a sunday for lunch so it wasnt packed at all. Got to the counter and placed order in no time. The menu is nice and pretty easy to make a selection because it doesnt overwhelm you. I ordered a couple tacos and an empanada which was pretty good! Tacos were really good as well, will be in my rotation of places to go when i want a good taco might earn another star in a later visit they were good but kinda hyped up in my opinion once i got there. Prices are fair and you get a good amount of meat on you taco worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great, just like the rest of their locations.  Nachos are very filling. Authentico tacos with chicken. Fabulous.  No line when we went on Tuesday.  Our new go to for Mexican. Prices are very reasonable. Have had great chicken quesedillas at other locations. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I had an enjoyable to go order!   Cheese Arepa - Amazing!!! I microwaved it to melt the cheese, much better that way. I wouldn't recommend the grilled onions on it.   Chips- nice and light, very good! I didn't care for the dropping sauces"}
{"text":"Fabulous tacos every time!! I love the tacos at sabor -authenticos style!! They are amazing! Corn tortillas and savory meat with awesome seasoning. The guacamole is phenomenal and perfectly made for sharing--we get the large that comes with free chips. They have a selection of beer and good margaritas. I love their tacos!! I think two tacos is good unless you're super hungry then order three."}
{"text":"We have been to Sabor on countless occasions and generally really like it. However our most recent visit was really disappointing. The counter server was not friendly and it took a really long time to receive our food. Several people that ordered after us received their food before us. I had to inquire about our order and only after that did we receive it. When it arrived neither of the two kids quesadillas we ordered were cooked through. The cheese was completely unmelted. The menu items that my husband and I ordered were also just okay. Usually Sabor is delicious and super quick. The Coronas were fantastic though! Maybe it was just an off-day for the kitchen staff..."}
{"text":"Tried Sabor for the first time today very good, fresh  and fast. We tried the fish tacos, steak tacos, burrito bowl and supreme nachos.  They also have several different salsas to try.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I need to edit and downgrade my review of this newest Sabor location in South Park. The first week they were pretty good and mostly on the ball. Since then, it's been a steady decline in almost every area - service mostly. For a walk-up-and-order place, the service is PAINFULLY slow. No matter what time of day, the wait for both ordering and food prep is just too long for this type venue. I've tried this place 5 times, and the last 4 experiences were frustrating and disappointing. Last Tuesday, I stopped in at 1:40 on my lunch break, I ordered ONE fish taco and waited 15 mins. The evenings that I've gone, the average wait in line to just place your order has been 15 mins. Then another 15-20 mins for the order to be ready. Sorry but that's unacceptable for almost anywhere. There are two registers for ordering, yet there's been just one order taker each time I've been there. Biggest blunder of all...they've got the counter person wo takes orders ALSO answering phones and processing call-in orders...while the line of people waiting to order goes out the door. The manager and staff seem unfriendly and glum.  I kept trying this place ONLY because my experiences at the Elizabeth location on Hawthorne have been fantastic. I was SO looking forward to having a Sabor closer to me....but sorry Sabor South Park, I'll stick with the Hawthorne location."}
{"text":"I popped in here after some Christmas shopping to grab a burrito and some chips to take home. My initial takeaway is the Sabor we all know and love has gotten a new face lift to fit into South Park. At the end of the day, the price is still right and I was surprised by how friendly and helpful the staff was.  For those who haven't been to a Sabor before, it is a latin street food concept that specializes in both tacos and burritos. Taco Tuesday is the go-to for most people as they have $1 tacos, but I prefer to avoid the madness.  With that out of the way, I ended up not ordering in advance (highly recommended if you are looking to grab and go) and sat down to hang out for a bit while they prepped my food. Overall I found the experience to be very positive as they asked me if they could get me salsa, a water, and brought me my food once it was done. I do think they were going a bit over the top since they had just opened and it was a busy time with Christmas right around the corner, but it was to my benefit so I'm not complaining! I'll certainly be swinging by again to get my burrito fix!"}
{"text":"Love this chain! I usually go to the one on Hawthorn, but upon hearing about a new one in South Park area I just had to go! Food is authentic for a great price and they have so many great sauces that pair well which whatever you get. Will definitely make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"We were here a several weeks ago. This was our first time at this establishment. We had a chicken arepa and a chicken empanada special.  I found the food to be quite bland. You can tell that the chicken was cooked well. The chicken was juicy, but there was no real flavor to it.  Note- The restaurant seems to be popular, but we did not spend much time on line, but it did get very busy as we sat and ate.  Wanting to be fair, we went back. My husband likes the food here. I don't think this restaurant will be on my top 5 list of restaurants."}
{"text":"Yummy, great pricing and a bit salty. Fun relaxed spot with laughter, families, couples and my favorite...take out."}
{"text":"So I've been to the other location a couple times years ago, cause it's down the street from my job, but I definitely like the setup of this location.   It's clean, updated, roomy, and well-lit.   I'm going to have to go back for something else, because my nachos were just okay. There was very little queso which I discovered when I was almost done with my meal, hiding under four of my chips. Also, there wasn't a lot of meat. It was really just a big pile of chips and lettuce with a splash of ground beef, refried beans and queso. The flavors were good, but it was barely noticeable given the lack of main ingredients, like cheese.   But there I go, getting my go to nacho dish. So I'll take the 'L' for this one. This is clearly the type of place where I need to get some tacos or maybe a burrito.   Considering this joint is literally in walking distance to my house, I'll swing by again. Especially for the delicious salsas. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The wait can be long and the parking is slim during peak dinner hours. I do however absolutely love the spicy pineapple Salsa. I could sit there and eat queso, salsa and chips. Everything else is just okay. I've gotten sick three times, twice at the Elizabeth location and once at South Park. I've stopped ordering the el pastor pork as that was the common offender. They have cheap $1 tacos on Tuesday's. Ample seating, with bar like seating against the wall."}
{"text":"This is a fast food restaurant. We ordered arepas and empanadas. They were ok. Not authentic taste but reasonable. I do not believe I will come back."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING IS AMAZING. Literally, everything we got was amazing. Elotes, gorditias, tacos, NACHOS, plantain. A margarita & a mojoito... everything was amazing."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER!!! Large portions and nice selection of homemade salsa.  The guacamole was very fresh and tasty.  Very generous with the proteins and the flavors!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come to Sabor almost every Tuesday for taco night, however the was the first time at the SouthPark location. It's new, clean and not as busy as the other locations. They still have the salsa bar, and the pineapple salsa is bomb! Try dipping it into your queso in it too - game changer!  As for the tacos go, they don't seem to skimp on the fillings here. Maybe because it's not as busy so they don't need to crank a million tacos out a minute, but at this Sabor location, the tacos were more full - and flavorful!   If it's your first time here for taco Tuesday, all authentic tacos (onion + cilantro) are only $1- this includes chicken, beef, veggie and black bean. My favorite is the chicken  - add a little jalapeño pineapple salsa to it and you got a good taco on your hands. The beef is also dynamite with the \"orange sauce\", which they have on the salsa bar in a squeeze container. It's a must with the beef taco!  I'll probably stick with my nearby location in Elizabeth, but if you haven't been to Sabor for a Tuesday in SouthPark you need to change that pronto!"}
{"text":"Had much better tacos at a street cart in Richmond VA for $6.  If you want this style just go to Cantina 1511 at the Park Rd shopping center."}
{"text":"I checked out Sabor on a Saturday night and it was packed! I haven't been to the other locations, but have heard rave reviews so I was excited to try it for myself.  I ordered two tacos and a margarita. My friend and I couldn't find a table, so we sat at the bar. We had to wait quite a bit for our food, but it was delicious. I got fairly plain tacos, so I want to try again and get something more substantial so I can better ranknbetween that and my other favorite taco places.   I shared some queso dip with a friend and it was so yummy! She ordered a burrito and it was HUGE.   The have a salsa bar by the drinks so you can get what you like."}
{"text":"Served soggy, gray corn on the cob as part of the kids meal. Brought it to staff's attention and was told it was supposed to be that way and employee at counter said, \"I didn't make it.\"  No other explanation or attempt to rectify the situation. Asked for a manager and was told by Luis that the manager, Pablo, was not there and he didn't know how to get ahold of him and directed me to the restaurant's website.  Food is mediocre, at best, and the customer service was subpar. Plenty of other options, like yummy Yafo across the street - with excellent food AND customer service. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing!  LOVE the quinoa avacado bowl.  It's a bit big, but I usually get the kids size.  The nachos are a must."}
{"text":"Sabor is probably our favorite go-to spot in Charlotte. My husband thinks the food at the original Elizabeth location is superior but it is ALL good! The arepas and nachos are our favorite orders here! Pro tip- the rosado sauce is amazing!! Make sure to put that on anything and everything"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, but everything seemed very disorganized.  Machines were down. We thought we had placed our order, but about 15 minutes later someone came to our table and said it was not in.  Was annoyed because no one told us the order wasn't even in and there was no offer to expedite (was dining with children who by this point were antsy), even on our order of guacamole.  Spent over an hour at a counter service restaurant which is frustrating when dining with small children.   Would love to enjoy the food again, it really was good, but will visit a different location from now on."}
{"text":"If you ignore the over 30 minute wait for our food, it was a nice meal! Glad to see Tina had a better experience early on.  I was surprised with the excessive wait for an early dinner on Sunday, even with it being opening weekend, as this is the fifth location and I figured they would hit the ground running. Had they shared that we could expect such a long wait when we ordered, I probably would not have been as frustrated. Not to worry, I'm sure they will be up to speed soon enough and visitors will be able to expect the same great food at seriously good prices AND have it ready quick as a fiddle.  This location has the expected SouthPark polish and full Sabor flavor. The arepas are really quite filling and the elote loco corn really is a must-have for any first-timer, as was the case for my relatives visiting town. The setup is similar to the original Elizabeth location, so locals will feel right at home.   I'm a big fan of Sabor, just consider giving this location some time before you rush over to enjoy a busy time like Taco Tuesday or any of their other fantastic specials. If you spend a lot of time in SouthPark, add this place to your regular rotation for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Usually Sabor is a staple in my weeknight dinner rotation; however, my dinner a few nights ago was a serious step down from what I am used to here. I only frequent the Southpark location, so I have no other locations to compare it to - just my previous visits.   I always get the Autenticos tacos with chicken and a side of chips. Usually, the tacos are great and the chicken is fresh and seasoned. However, this time it was greasy and not as flavorful: there was grease dripping out of my taco the entire time I ate it (not to mention that my tortilla broke while I was eating it). Also, I usually love the chips, but they tasted almost stale this time (also greasy). And to top it off, 4/6 of the salsa bar containers were empty when I went up (and stayed empty throughout my ~40 minute visit).   However, all this being said, the Sabor staff is still super friendly and the ambiance is nice. Also, that queso is so good, I'll give em that. Despite this, though, I think I'm going to take a break from Sabor for now- at least this location."}
{"text":"This location is bigger and a little fancier than the Hawthorne location. It's Southpark so it probably has to be. They give you a table number and bring your food to you rather than call your name from the counter. There's more seating and a bar along the wall where you can sit. Of course they have the salsa bar and the soda machine. Right now they have $1 tacos from 3-5 every day and all day Tuesday. I'm sure that's a promo for their new opening as the other location only does $1 tacos on Tuesday.  The staff is so nice here and there's a guy who has the aura of a manager is very nice too. They also give you more chips than you can possibly eat. I want to try the arepas here because they look so good. If you're out and about in Southpark, try this spot (it's in the shopping strip where Firebirds is)."}
{"text":"Love love Sabor! The line out of the door on taco Tuesday says it all--this place is legit! My favorites include the quinoa avocado protein bowl and the yucca nachos! Also, their margaritas are reasonably priced and fantastically strong! The owners are super kind and have a passion for fresh, local ingredients. My favorite Mexican-Latin cuisine in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Super busy location that weekends.  My al pastor was dry and nothing like the Hawthorne location.  The arepa was good though. I ordered nachos but was too full and saved it for the next day.  The sauce canisters weren't replenished.  I used the yelp app for free chips as usually and was charged instead.  I got a tea in place of the charge.  The tea was not sweet at all or mixed up."}
{"text":"This was very good - better than expected. Our empanada was perfect- as good as Mami's. The yuca fries were ok- prefer when they are,ace from whole yuca and not the purée. The Madurese were good and the fish tacos as fresh as could be- enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Great Dinner and Birthday Celebration at the Sabor in South Park tonight, Its such a good place for everyone old and young to eat at. Very crowded when we arrived with our huge party of 14! But we got the seats together and had our orders put in and delivered. Tom was a great help to all of us ordering. We had Nacho's for the table which are so big and delicious and then the very best thing is the Empanadas, you can have them with any of the proteins, they are all tasty! A couple of us had Quesadillas, and some of us had their taco's. All wonderful. Tom even came over and helped us cut the birthday cake we brought in! All the other servers were helpful and friendly. All the Sabor's are great but this one is extra special!"}
{"text":"The customer service here was awesome. Our cashier walked us through almost every option and helped us pick some great dishes. It's a pretty low-key place with pretty standard Mexican dishes, but it's pretty good. Will definitely be back. And get the corn!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE sabor, but I typically go to the location on Hawthorne. This location is HORRIBLE!!! Horrible customer service, very rude individual who was suppose to be working the phone. I tried to place an order to go as I was in a hurry, and the phones weren't working. When I went in they were very rude and claimed the phone had not rung. No there is a problem with your phone it's giving me a dial tone signal. They were super rude and unprofessional. I will only be going back to the Sabor on Hawthorne, so I recommend Sabor but absolutely not this location."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED!!! I admit, one of my favorites, but if you wait in line for 20 minutes in line for drunks to order and get to the register at 8:59pm... they will just take half your order then tell you to piss off... Gotta admit.. a little disappointed"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  I don't know where to begin. Free order of chips when you heck in on Yelp  which is a huge order. Plenty to try the different salsas on their salsa bar. If the carne Adara fries where any better I'd be in San Jose. The street tacos are awesome. The loco is my favorite, with chicken. They have $1 tacos on Tues and Mon - Fri for Taco happy hour from I think it's 3-5pm.  I also enjoyed their empanadas. Yes, I pigged out. They have a great assortment of beer and Mexican Coke. So excited to have another location hats closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"Went there and it was very busy which was a good sign. The food definitely needed more flavor. The portions were huge I guess a lot of food for your money? I won't be returning because the restaurant at Southpark needed more seating (everyone was crowding the drink machine and salsa bar bc there weren't enough tables) but the biggest reason I won't return is because the food just needed major seasoning help"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the South Park a couple times and many times at the Elizabeth location.  Food is always good.  I usually get the steak burrito and children like the carne asada with fries.  It is one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"I tried something different this time. I kept seeing pics of the corn so I had to try it. I also got chicken taco salad. It was plenty of food I almost couldn't finish eating it all. The corn was good but I still like my corn on the cob with butter and salt. It is definitely a place you could pop in for a quick lunch.   I lucked up and found a parking spot. I could see it being hard to find parking especially if you go on taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Quick service and fresh delicious food. the taco salad was yummy and lots of choices to make it your own. super healthy options."}
{"text":"$1 taco Tuesday night!!! Everyone please go the food is delicious and they have different deals every day. The salsa bar is also a must try they even have pineapple habenero."}
{"text":"I was surprised to hear a South Park location was added probably cause I have a hard time associating a \"street grill\" with the South Park area and demographic, but whatevs...  good food is for everyone!    The new location is a little more \"finished\" than the Elizabeth or NoDa locations... maybe it needs a couple of months to get a \"lived in\" feel... or maybe they are trying to appeal to the South Park crowd.  Either way... I believe this is the largest of the 3 locations (tablewise) AND they have a parking lot unlike the other two locations.  Although the parking lot was completely full when I got there... its nice to know there are more spaces instead of trying to figure out where you are going to park.  It was Tuesday, so naturally there was a crowd that came in waves.  My group of five had to wait on a table, but ended up getting the bar seats that look out to the parking lot.  It usually works out, and it is good that you have to \"fight\" for a table.... but sometimes you don't want that hassle.  Had some standard beef tacos - felt like you got more protein here, but the flavor was different (just a bit).  Still a good taco... and beggars can't be choosers when you are paying $1 for a taco, but I would expect the same delicious food regardless of what day it was.  Probably give the location a couple more months to \"settle in\" but for now, I may stick with the Elizabeth location and fighting the UPS trucks for parking."}
{"text":"So I love Sabor ~ as u all may know ~~ especially the street corn ~~ but this South Park location is soooo bland! If you want the authentic Latin Street Food go to the Hawthorne Lane location! The food tastes totally different. At the South Park location. The staff was nice BUT I visit Sabor for the authenticity of Latin Street Food!!!!"}
{"text":"An absolute 5-star rating for their $1 taco special... While I can't speak for the rest of the menu, I've come for their taco specials many, many times and am always extremely satisfied taste-wise, money-wise, and volume-wise. The meat options are consistently delicious, but I didn't really like the vegetable taco (probably just me being a meat lover). The place itself is clean and has nice interior decor. One of my favorite parts is all the salsa flavors available at no extra cost-- you just have to ask the workers for extra plastic cups if you need more and they'll gladly give you them!"}
{"text":"Still delicious like always. This was my first time at this location and it did not disappoint. I parked right up front. Ordered some $1 tacos to go and I was on my way. Tacos were fresh and filling and I love the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! My new favorite spot. The nachos were absolutely delicious and enough for 2 people. The authentic chicken taco my second favorite. The street corn was not to my liking. The restaurant was clean and relaxing."}
{"text":"Really rough experience. I usually do not mind waiting for an order to go when I place it in person, though I am extremely upset when people who order food after me (multiple people at that) get their food before I get mine. Waiting 21 minutes for 3 tacos to go while a table of 3 people who ordered food after me got it in less than 10. AWFUL. Food clearly rushed and thrown together in a to go box. Upset. At this point I just wish I would have canceled the order and got my money back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I don't leave many reviews but a business trip brought me to Charlotte and after finding this place on Yelp, decided to give it a shot.  Let me tell you, I have dreams about this place! Literally. The Dominican yuca nachos are KILLER, and the tacos are all fantastic! My husband was a huge fan of the empanadas, so add those to your list! I will be coming back to the area for the sole purpose of eating here again!   Mexican cokes are also a plus!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the two stars are for the service.  The food is consistently good, if you can get any.  My husband an I went in here for the first time on a Friday night around 8pm-ish, and there was no line. We took a look at the menu for about 3 minutes and decided what we wanted.  We stepped up to the checkout counter and waited.  I didn't mind waiting a bit, but we waited for over 10 minutes, with numerous employees looking at us and then going about their tasks.  No acknowledgement from anyone who worked there that we were standing there at all.  No \"We'll just be a minute, we're super busy\", nothing.  Finally someone came over to take our order, we ordered our food for carryout and waited.  We got our food, and went home.  When we got home, we realized that they forgot to include my husband's tacos!  The food was good, but I will never come back to this location.  I've been to the Pineville location several times since this visit took place and the service and attention to detail at that location is FAR superior."}
{"text":"It has a very tasty food. Super nice people with a very nice investment. Very family friendly. It"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at Sabor, the first location I went to was in Pineville area. This time we went to this location. I love gorditas so that's what I always order. I was expecting the gorditas to be made the same but this location fried the outer layer to like a chip like consistency. I'm use to having gorditas that are softer on the outside. Nonetheless I enjoyed it,  but would prefer all locations to be consistent on how they make their dishes."}
{"text":"So I've been to a couple of other Sabor locations around town and haven't been incredibly impressed but recognize that their food is a GREAT deal. However, tonight at this location, I ordered a plate of nachos to-go. When I approached the counter to ask for salsa containers I was met with sass as if it was unheard of to want salsa with my nachos? But nonetheless, one of my favorite parts of Sabor is the salsa bar to spice up all of their dishes! So I was a little disappointed to be met with that sass.   Upon getting home, my nachos had absolutely NO queso on them and I ended up having to add my own shredded cheese as I didn't particularly want to go back to the restaurant at this point. What's the point of nachos without cheese..?? Additionally the beef Barbacoa was overly seasoned and salty (doesn't help that the chips are seasoned too, which I love) to the point that I ended up not finishing. Overall a pretty disappointing experience when I just wanted a plate of chips and queso :("}
{"text":"Great food. Counter service, but made to order. Loved the flavors and the overall menu options. Street tacos and nachos were huge hits!"}
{"text":"Food is okay here but better at other (uptown) location. The nachos were a bit of a disappointment (soggy from chicken and somehow not a lot of flavor), neither of us liked the street corn. The street tacos were good though."}
{"text":"$4 Margarita Friday are better than $1 Taco Tuesday.  There. I said it.   The margaritas are bomb."}
{"text":"How can trump build a wall with such amazing food like this!? I've always wanted to try This place because it is close to my school but I never did until now. However this is for the South Park location. The EMPANADAS ARE AMAZING. I've never had one of those in my life and I see how that is easily a rookie mistake. Reasonable prices for the portions they give you. The food is cooked properly smells great and they have a hard working friendly staff. Seems like it does business well. But seriously order an empanada!!"}
{"text":"With my Mom in the area, I have been to this location more than any other. It is a nice space, with several booths and tables and one wall offers a few seats, if your dining alone.  Like other locations, Sabor brings in a crowd. Due to the fact the register is close to the door the line can always be long and a little misleading as it does move quickly. Unfortunately due to the amount of customers, definitely a lot of families, tables can be tough to find, but hang in there.  The food is okay, in my mind nothing spectacular. Yes, they have a good menu and a great salsa bar.  Most recently I got the Quesadillas and I really enjoyed those. The Sabor Margarita is also great, but the last two times I got the wrong one by accident. And, you can definitely tell the difference between the Regular and the Sabor. Needless to say it is a great addition to this shopping center and I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites I taste on quality, affordability and atmosphere. It's a great place to hit when you want a quick bite. Taco specials 3-5 daily, and every Tuesday all day. Only warning. Don't order the nachos by yourself."}
{"text":"Sabor's food is great. Although the service at the Southpark one is less enthusiastic as the other locations but food is always hot and fast. Good for a take out lunch."}
{"text":"Nachos were so large topped high- need to share with another. I go for taco Tuesday's- corn soft tacos  great deal $1. No wifi here and cell reception dead inside for me at least one draw back. They do serve alcoholic beverages as well. The queso is also shareable and delicious."}
{"text":"There are other locations that make amazing food with a better selection of salsas. The people who work in the kitchen have huge heads of hair and they do not wear hats to cover up. While I stood in line I saw less than desirable sanitary habits. They do not have a sanitary number posted on the wall and I would be curious to see what it is. Sabor is one of my favorite restaurants in the Charlotte area, but the other locations produce much better food. One last annoyance, but has nothing to do with the food, is the sassiness. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate it an 8.5."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is to die for. I've been eating at Sabor for a good four years. I used to go to the one near Hawthorne, but when I found out one opened up in South Park, I was so happy. The food is sooooo good. The service is great. I've never had an issue. And their chips and caso (probably spelled that wrong) are my favorite thing. So creamy, so tasty. Recommend this for anyone who loves good food."}
{"text":"The food is awesome at any Sabor location and this is no exception. My issue here is the time it takes them to prepare the food. I have now been to this location 3 times and every single time it has taken far longer than necessary to get food to the table. Tonight, they were at roughly half capacity and I waited 10 minutes for a taco salad. The last time I was there, they completely forgot my friend's order. She finally got it about 20 minutes later. It seems like they have enough staff but maybe aren't using them efficiently. Just my two cents. I'll be back because Sabor is awesome, but I'd like to see this location step their service game up."}
