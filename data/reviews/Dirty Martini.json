{"text":"It is a great place to have fun after a long stressful week at work!!! The music, ambience and crowd are incredible!!! They offer a variety of food on their menu and the stuffed chicken is my absolute favourite which means that I don't have cook and can enjoy a delicious selection of beverages with my meal!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I have never been hit on so many time as I did at this bar. I know it's 25 plus but man oh man the women are crazy!! I loved it!!"}
{"text":"I've been a return customer many times and each time I'm given consistent fun times and good memories.. Never fail great energy on the dance floor with the music to match... I find most nightclubs in Toronto/GTA extremely cliquey with the exception of this place staff and patrons are all warm and welcoming The food is delicious and that's coming from a picky eater... They have tons of healthy options Let's just be honest here I'm just picky in general and dirty martini never fails to exceed my expectations"}
{"text":"On a thursday evening about 10pm it was DEAD.  {A girlfriend of mine had wanted to visit for a while, so we did}.   Their web-site indicates live music with DJ begins 9:30.  (We also called to confirm the day of).  Didn't happen.  By the time we left around 11:30, there were about 3 other tables.  Service was \"ok\".  Food was \"ok\".  Martinis severed in stem-less glasses which was a tad different, possibly interesting.    Decor was cool & sexy.  Dancefloor was spacious.  Has potential - not sure when the action is - maybe a friday or satruday???   Only open Thurs/fri/Sat"}
{"text":"It's a good location. Good music but older crowd. It's not a bad setting if you're going out as an older couple but it's definitely not the spot to go if you're looking to meet younger singles. Pricing is decent, a little overpriced but the drinks were made well."}
{"text":"Great over all place. Lively crowd and good music. One of the better things about it is that it's 25+. Had eaten once and the food is good, not mind blowing but this place is known for its dance floor and socializing more.   Beautiful decor and on super busy nights, they open both sides of the bar and one time had 2 different style of music playing at 2 places. It's never over crowded where you can't move.   In my opinion it's one of the best places to chill in Mississauga/Oakville/Burlington."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy the music .... It was way too crowded! The drinks are expensive and seriously watered down....."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and a lively crowed.  The Martini's were over priced but well made, (we paid $36.00 for two Martini's).  They also charged a $10.00 cover (cash only).  According to the website Ladies can get in free on Friday nights if you sign up for VIP, which I did but never received an e-mail. Overall it was a good experience, the bartenders were polite and the music was good."}
{"text":"A little pretentious, but for what its worth the music is fine.  I noticed more of an older crowd which was a bit weird.  Highlights include outdoor heated areas for smokers"}
{"text":"This is our place to let loose and have a great time, food is great considering we go for the night club. Place is always rocking great customer service. Try their VIP booths never miss a drink."}
{"text":"Made recent visit on a Saturday night after a few years to probably what's probably the best  known Cougar and MILF bar/ nightclub in the city . It was busy and by 12 midnight you couldn't really move much. $10 cover to get in and drinks are reasonable. For smokers in the summertime there is an outdoor patio. Good mixture of old school music and current nice stuff. Good to see the adults getting out and having some fun too."}
{"text":"Was there this weekend for the Halloween bash ... the place was packed ... never been in a club where you could literally not move anywhere without bumping into people and having to squeeze through with your drink in one hand and the other opening up a path. The club decor was great including the decorations for Halloween. Drinks were priced a bit high, but this is GTA ... the music on this night was a combo of top 40 and some retro hits. Dance floor is large enough and I'm sure on most nights ample. but on this night it was nuts. There are plenty of booth-style areas for small parties and several bars.  I'll go again on a night when it is not so packed."}
{"text":"I'll try this review again as my first review was deleted. They said that Dirty Martini did not water down their drinks!  Okay. They did not put water in my alcoholic beverages but what I meant to say is that they put LESS alcohol and more soda or juice!  Here's why I knowe the difference.. I do not have high tolerance for alcohol drinks (wine, beer or any liquor). So when I order gin and tonic or vodka martini (2 drinks and I am drunk! I get tipsy and really feel it). That weekend, 16 of us in a group were celebrating my sisters birthday, we all went in and still had to pay cover charge which is fine.  I ordered 3 drinks for myself and my sister. Neither one of us got tipsy so I ordered more. So. What is so different in their vodka that is different from most bars we go to? My friends agree that their \"alcohol\" is lightly poured and heavier on soda!  I will take my business elsewhere! Music was okay. Wouldn't rave about it."}
{"text":"Music wasn't the greatest. Basically the equivalent of listening to Virgin Radio. It's pretty small in there."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: My estranged nephew works at this bar.   However, in the time I visited he refused to make eye contact with me and repeatedly held his hands over his ears when I attempted to order, so I do not believe I am biased in this regard. Unfortunately he was the only bartender working at the time, and I was unable to try any of the drinks or food at this establishment. This does not mean I did not enjoy my stay! I had a crazy afternoon in this \"dirty\" (not in the sense of hygiene) swingers paradise! The people I encountered here will surely be imprinted on my mind for many years, possibly until death. Men and women alike were alive with the sound of music on this dance floor! 10 of us beeped and bopped to the rhythms of modern music! The dance style here is very different from what I am used to, but none-theless it was VERY enjoyable. For those who have not visited: wear tight pants(!!!) the women in this bar are not afraid to rub themselves across your gentleman's region! Thank goodness my wife and mother were seeing a film across the street at the time!  I don't know what they put in these \"Martinis\" of theirs (I was never provided with a menu on account of my nephew), but as the hours wore on many of my new found friends appeared to become very tired or sick. I am actually quite glad I didn't have a chance to sample any, as most smelled of rubbing alcohols, or sugars. To each their own I guess. My companion for the hour, \"Berta\", drank many of these drinks very quickly, and out of a tiny glass. It was very fun to watch!  All around I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this spot if you're passing through. I will be taking my son there for his 17th.  If I have anything negative to say (aside from the lack of respect from my sister's son) it is this: Unfortunately I had a run in with a manager towards the end of my visit, and was forced to leave before I was done having fun. Dave, if you're reading this, I'm sorry about the mess, but the police escort was highly unnecessary and insulting. Not to mention it was highly embarrassing to be reprimanded for public indecency in front of my new friends, who were clearly enjoying the show!        All the best, ~Steve"}
{"text":"Hostess seem irritated  that we did not have reservations. Martinis not served in a Martini glass and very little bang for your buck. Salads were average and chicken was a little dry."}
{"text":"Came here for a glass of wine before a movie. Walked in the place and was surprisingly impressed. We were greeted by a lovely fellow at the front door and was able to do so given we were not dressed up. We had a glass of wine each with good bar service. The decor was timeless and classic with modern touches. Glad to see a bar/lounge/club is promising in the Mississauga region. May have to come out on a dance night or a birthday celebration/party.   Overall impressed with a local Mississauga lounge to fulfill my dancing feet without being far from home and paying an arm and a leg for parking."}
{"text":"My first time there, with my bf. It's kind small, the ance floor wraps around the bar. It's very crowded. The music was great, top 40 and some 1990s, i didn't drink so i can't comment on the drinks. cover was $10 i went on a saturday around 12 it was super packed"}
{"text":"Good clean place with a good crowd and good music. Upscale place not meant for the 20 somethings... Which actually was very good. The food menu needs sprucing up - limited options and was a bit on the pricier side. Patio was a smoke-fest. If you wanted fresh air, your only option is to go out of the club.  Service was great and the hostess was knowledgeable and friendly.   Would I go there again? Sure... But I'd eat somewhere else before I walk into Dirty Martini's. That's the best combination, in my opinion."}
