{"text":"Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row in Tempe was so much fun. The staff is friendly and professional. The management is working hard to make this new restaurant/ bar the go to place in Tempe. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just the worse toilet ever. Takes you literally an hour to take a piss. As soon as you get through the line you notice that there are three toilets unused"}
{"text":"Wow. What an amazing atmosphere! Seriously well done . The Whiskey cocktails are so balanced and smooth. Really impressed with their attention to detail in every inch of this place. Also the steak and mac and cheese is a must have. This is NOT your typical bar food and definitely not your typical bar. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First timer at dierks and all I have to say is, amazing!!! My wife and I had Sunday brunch. She had the Blueberry moonshine pancakes with bourbon laced maple syrup. They were so delicious! By far the best pancakes we've ever had! Which is saying a lot!! I had country fried chicken with chorizo gravy. The chicken was absolutely fantastic as was the chorizo gravy. This place is a must try and a must return for more!!"}
{"text":"WARNING: NOT A COUNTRY WESTERN BAR

With Britney Spears blaring and not a cowboy hat in sight, I boot scooted right back to the parking garage.  This cowgirl is disappointed and had high hopes for a bar with Dierks Bently's name on it."}
{"text":"Just ate there, my mom had fish and chips that were undercooked but my food was perfect and Mere was an outstanding server! Will definitely go back soon and will ask for her again!"}
{"text":"Good music and the atmosphere is great but the bartenders suck. The bar is less than half full and they don't realize there are people to serve. So not good. What would you do on a busy night?"}
{"text":"Really cool place with some actual good country playing...not a ton of that hickhop crap! Haha.  Great happy hour prices and very friendly staff! Love it"}
{"text":"I took my friend from Nevada here and they refused to serve us because they did not believe her ID was real. She is 24 years old and we came here for lunch and ordered a Bloody Mary on a Sunday afternoon. I understand that they might want to be cautious about fake identifications being in a university town. My friend was very understanding of them questioning her out of state license, however they took 15 minutes to get back to us and here they told us that they would not serve us because they respected the right to refuse service to anyone. I am 25 years old and we both politely sat at the bar. We provided credit cards, work identifications and yet they still did not even bother to offer us an apology or ever offer to serve us food. 
Once again, I understand that it is in university town and the need to be cautious about fake IDs is necessary. However this situation was handled unjustly and inappropriately. 
I will never return here."}
{"text":"Sadly I have to agree with the other reviews regarding the service. My family and I have sat for 30+ minutes more than once before anyone comes to take our order. 
We also had gratuity added to our bill without any mention of this. We were a party of 5 and have never had automatic gratuity added for such a small party. Thankfully we noticed this before we added our tip. This did leave us all wondering how may times we have tipped on a bill that already had it added on."}
{"text":"Went there to watch the fight last night and got there really early. There wasn't many people there yet and it took like 20 mins to get a menu. Service was okay after that. My food was cold. They didn't play the sound for any of the fights prior to the main event. They blasted music during the introduction and post fight interviews for the main event. Everyone was there to watch the fight. Yet they didn't have the sound playing for most of it."}
{"text":"Once again, I was very disappointed with the service. We were seated and didn't get service for over 5 mins. We asked the hostess if we could move seats so we could see the football game better and she said yes. When we sat down at our new seats the customers next to us told us that the seats were reserved for the rest of their party. We went up to the hostess to ask her about it and she said they told the customers that they would hold the seats till the restaurant needed them if the rest of their party wasn't there. The hostess said we were fine sitting there as they now needed the seats. In the meantime, we were verbally harassed by the neighboring customers for sitting there. Then a server came up and told us we couldn't sit where we were seated because they told the party next to us that they would save the seats. We told the server what the hostess said to us and she said I'm sorry there are so many of us working right now between servers and hostesses and there has been miscommunications. When we were seated at a new table for the third time the server never had a good attitude toward us. And we were advised that we would yet have to move again at a certain because of a reservation. The workers at this location are very poorly managed and don't know how to show good customer service."}
{"text":"I came here with my family. After waiting, we finally got a table only for \"security\" to come and remove it. First the seats from under us, then the table. Their reasoning was they wanted to make more room. There are literally 50 people in this hole. There is plenty of room. Oh, and no Bud Light."}
{"text":"A fun place for a few drinks in the evening, especially if you enjoy playing corn hole or ping pong. It's also a good spot to watch football over a boozy brunch, but definitely wouldn't classify this as a good restaurant option in Gilbert. My husband loves the food and atmosphere, and while he'd happily come down for dinner and stay for drinks, the lack of veggie options and the seriously slow service mean we rarely bother having a meal here and instead will only stop by for a post-dinner drink."}
{"text":"Went last night with my friends and our server was extra friendly.  She recommended the mini pitchers and I was shocked at how inexpensive they were.  The pulled chicken sandwich was the best bar food I've had in a long time.  I'm going back tonight."}
{"text":"very slow service and decent food, nothing special. fun atmosphere though!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Aubrey was. awesome. Beautiful and friendly. Such a sweetheart, will come back because of her!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in but have had the food and it's awesome! The Burgers kill! Dope onion rings!"}
{"text":"I'm not much for reviewing but this place is awesome. This is a new standard in food and entertainment. Very different from the unique stage above the bar to the drink taps at the table. Overall the people were nice and courteous. Food was very good. It was date night with my wife and we had a great time."}
{"text":"Beth took great care of us. Great place, wonderful music, people are all open & friendly here. Drinks were exceptionally good."}
{"text":"Awesome concept....needs A LOT of work. Service staff is pretty much all inexperienced 19 year olds. Waited longer than I ever have for table and then again for average food. Games and music are great and it has potential to be an amazing Gilbert hot spot. We'll stick to just music and booze next time. Food is not worth an hour and half wait."}
{"text":"Katie and Natalie were fantastic!! Best service I've had in years and at any other Whiskey Row. 100% satisfied with all service. Always checked back with me to make sure I was fully taken care of. Thank you for everything, I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Melissa was absolutely wonderful! Serious  was super. I will definitely be back ASAP!!"}
{"text":"No a classy venue. Wait staff is not pleasant, and food is not very good. The crowd this place attracts is truly the problem. Not a good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere and our server Aubrey was super friendly and kept checking in on us :)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great burger, fries were very soggy. A long wait so get there early. Waitress Aimee was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Fun spot, but was a little too packed the night I went. There was a live band there which was awesome and the sound was great, but it just seemed a little too crazy even for me. Biggest problem was that the bar smelled like puke over where we were. Drinks were too expensive compared to other spots. If it was a little less crowded, would've been a great atmosphere, but overall would recommend El Hefe, Bottled Blonde, or one of the many other spots in that area."}
{"text":"If you enjoy good food, live music and great beer this is the place to be. 

This place has it all if you're a country music fan with live bands both new and established. The food is great I haven't found anything I haven't liked yet. The flat iron steak is delicious as is the alabama bbq chicken. Great atmosphere and a fun drink menu. You have to try a signature drink like the \"Stubborn Mule.\""}
{"text":"Well apparently the table taps ARE BROKEN (*it is THE reason I wanted to come here, even used it as leverage to get co-workers to go with me)
So not a good start...I mean Jameson ON TAP @ my table is a GREAT idea. Maybe not best idea, but still great in my humble opinion *shrug*
That and it sounds/feels like Tijuana on Saturday night on Saddlebag Rd...I really hope my stubborn mule is good *sigh*

Signed- 
Stubborner Mule"}
{"text":"Came in to enjoy a few beers along with the great country music. Hostesses were nice and friendly, the female bartender Alex was awesome but when she went on break, her 2 male bartenders completely ignored us. The bar was not busy and it took me asking a bar back to get the bartender so I could get my check. Took the bartender another ten minutes just to get my tab. Being a restaurant manager, I found this unacceptable and will never visit this place again. My sister, who was the one who wanted to try this place out, was so disappointed plus it was her birthday. So far she has told everyone she knows...not good for a business. Sorry guys :( and I do wish you luck!"}
{"text":"Fun place to party for our friends bachelorette! We got a table which was reasonably priced. DJ was great and everyone had fun!"}
{"text":"Love this place! First time here...on Mother's Day with my husband.  Natalie was awesome with her IPA's and great with so much information! Love the atmosphere and just everything about it! Planning on coming back and bringing our friends. So much to do with everyone!"}
{"text":"A few of my friends and I stopped in here to check out another friend's band. Security was very professional at the door, and the bartenders were quick and polite. Got kind of hungry and decided to try the food. Had the BBQ Chicken sandwich and it was delicious. The only complaint I have, and I understand it was late and relatively crowded but there weren't a lot of people eating, it took almost 35 minutes to get my sandwich. Would definitely go back and eat there again though."}
{"text":"Oh so great and the food is so good!! Went for brunch and had bottomless mimosas and it was delicious! My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and was helped by Beth and she was so nice and was on top of our drinks!! Must go!"}
{"text":"I went here the other night and 100% will never go back. The bouncer was such a dick. The place is packed with middle aged ladies who like to complain about their life problems. There are way better bars in Old Town. :-)"}
{"text":"Nice venue but sadly inexperienced personnel and long waits are running people off this place ."}
{"text":"Very nice location. Right in the entertainment district. Food was very yummy. 

A note to the staff.... Husband and I came for lunch while a band was doing set up. We came in at noon. The band was loudly doing sound checks.  Some was OK but there were at least 4 separate occasions where the sound people were blasting static at a deafening level. Then a few more rounds of blasting a Don Henley song that could be heard for miles. Add in the sound staff walking around the restaurant yelling at each other and it was very unpleasant.   Suggestion?  I know this needs to be done but do this kind of speaker check/sound check before paying customers arrive for lunch."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Corn were awesome! Drinks are great! Seating is mainly for large groups. Service was okay. Would go again and with a larger group of friends."}
{"text":"Worst bar service I've ever had anywhere in Scottsdale.  Sat at the bar with an empty beer for half an hour while the one bartender on that corner ignored us.  The location in Tempe is way better."}
{"text":"Whiskey Row is the best country bar in Arizona, maybe even west of the Mississippi. The have a huge selection of whiskey and an even better menu. They have great takes on the classic hamburger and comfort food better than my mama makes. 

This is a great place for lunch or dinner. Past 10 the place is packed with young and middle aged Scottsdale. They have bottle service with the most beautiful southern bells I've ever seen. 

People who don't like Whiskey Row don't like America. Jk"}
{"text":"Cheyenne was amazing! So energetic and sweet. Food was great and a lot of help with menu, will be coming back. Yummy pretzel!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst bar experience I have ever had!  Bartender was rude and annoyed to take my order.  Dancing and having a good time until a girl starts pushing me around saying that she was back and her purse was saving her spot.  She said since she was back, I had to leave where I was standing.  I replied that I wasn't moving and then she proceeded to push me around.  My husband told her to stop and then she proceeded to threaten us that her husband was s security guard and she was going to go get him and have us kicked out.  So that's what she did.  I tried talking to the security but they didn't care one bit about what I had to say.  Very unprofessional and sadly mismanaged!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the Kenny Chesney concert and was looking forward to checking out Dierk's Bentley's bar. We had the fried pickles and the Whiskey Burger which was amazing!!!  Unfortunately the service left much to be desired. Our waitress, Jordin, was MIA almost the entire night and it took forever to get our beers. The place wasn't even busy to warrant the slow service. Food -4.5 stars, Service - 1.

Ended up going over to the Scottsdale location afterwards. Night and day difference in ambiance and service."}
{"text":"I had made reservations for my sisters bachlorette weekend.  We are from out of state and thought it would be fun to go to since we are huge country fans. Reservation was for 830pm. I called because the hotel shuttle was late. The hostess said if we were there by 845 its ok but we have to be done eating by 930 as they turn tables into bottle service. We go there at 839... 9 minutes after and the arrogant rude manager refused to seat us. To busy on his phone outside to manage a restaurant.... he turned away a table of 8 bachlorette party because he didnt want to work. He argued with me and was still on his phone while talking to me. We own restaurants were we live and i would never in my right mind act like he did . Dirks he give you a bad rep not only as a restaurant but as a owner and singer. Its sad we had to experience this type of service. We walked across the street and were helped immediately had great food and fun atmosphere.  Wont recommend or go to this place again."}
{"text":"The staff is absolutely incredible. Best service in the industry by far. They believe in customer service and providing the best possible experience. I used to be a scottsdale snob but after my first visit I will be coming back time and time again. Thank you for your hospitality Whiskey and all the good times that followed."}
{"text":"The Alabama grilled chicken with white BBQ sauce is seriously the best grilled chicken breast I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had a great time and there was plenty of action on the dance floor. No problem getting drinks, didn't get a chance to try the food. Only down side was the DJ was all over the board with the music selections. Not really a big deal as we like all kinds of music but just thought the music would be more current country as opposed to Michael Jackson, top 40 etc. Really fun place!"}
{"text":"Old Town Scottsdale is quite the scene.  Went the other night and the whole street was crazy crowded.  Stood in line for only about 20 minutes and got in with no problem.  The place was packed and hard to get around, but that's expected on a Saturday night.  Miller Lite bottles were $4, which isn't bad.  The worst part was the 35 year old guy taking his shirt off and flexing for younger girls.  Classic Scottsdale I guess.  Would like to go during the day so I can check out the menu.

Oh and P.S. the bartenders dancing on the bar... yes, please."}
{"text":"Very fun experience. Lots of tasty beverage and alcohol options. Fun outdoor activities and lots of TV screens all make this place great!  4 stars due to it being the Scottsdale \"scene.\""}
{"text":"I have not had any food here yet. I went on a Friday night for drinks. Definitely a fun country bar! The staff was helpful and nice. If you come here you will have fun!"}
{"text":"Jadie was great! Very attentive and checked on us throughout the visit. Ask for her when you come in."}
{"text":"I am a strong believer that the employees of a workplace are what make the environment great, mediocre or bad. I LOVE the attitude and Vibes at this specific spot plus the food was Delish .. We Stopped in here and was served by a young woman named Aubrey, she had an incredible attitude. She checked on us to make sure everything was great and you can tell she was Genuine. AMAZING EXPERIENCE!! . Thank you for turning our dinner outing into an incredible experience. We definitely will be back for more"}
{"text":"No wonder today's young people are going deaf. Music was soooo loud for an afternoon. Almost impossible for us to talk. Was there for lunch. Waitress rushed right over, took our drink order and they arrived in a timely manner. However, it took her 15 minutes to get back to us (2 couples) for food order which only took another 15 minutes to arrive. Then we had to ASK for our bill. We're all retired and weren't in a hurry but come on! Food was just okay."}
{"text":"Been here Twice. Love this place. The girls are wonderful. Always with a smile & checking on their customers all the time. The Manager, is Awesome. Sadly I can't remember his name. He did give us a business card as well. I Love the food, Love the Drinks, Love the Place & Love the People.
It was My Mums Birthday & we went there for Brunch. I used a Groupon, which was good. Sadly they don't have the Brunch Groupon anymore. I wish it would be back & give us a chance to go there again.
Keep up the good work. I told the Manager, it looks like he keeps the staff happy. The Girls were working so hard & always with a smile."}
{"text":"The best night is a Thursday! They have great music as well as live bands! Your usual drinks as well as many specialities! But the part that shocks me is the good is actually really good!! Although most of it is fried they serve till 10pm and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Dierks Bentley Whiskey Row in Scottsdale, AZ is where it's at! The food, entertainment and atmosphere are the BEST yet! Just wished they had a bigger merchandise selection. I keep checking in to see if the camo hat is back....coolest hat ever! Wish I could order from the website but they don't carry it either!!! Any ideas where I can get this??"}
{"text":"Went here with family - 2 kids - and food was pretty good.  Atmosphere is fun and lively but loud.  Couldn't talk to the person across the table.   I would give this 1 more star if service was better.    Our server would disappear for 10 min at a time after our table was cleared.   Drinks ran dry several times for many minutes.   Took a long time to order as well.  I would come back and try the bar area.   They didn't seem short staffed.   Tip would be to smile and pretend you want to be here.  Be a little more attentive to customers."}
{"text":"Good crowd, decent prices and great whiskey. 
The bartender was sweet and very helpful. It was a nice, relaxed atmosphere and I enjoyed visiting."}
{"text":"BEST COUNTRY BAR BY FAR IN THE TEMPE METRO AREA!!! The girls are so sexy and the food is amazing. It's so much fun day or night! I absolutely love coming here whenever I go out!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. Maybe that's why I have such a bad review. It started out that there was a mix up with the dates and our table/bottle service reservation. I will say they did accommodate us in this aspect. However, I don't think we actually ever got the table service, just a table. And it took us over 30 minutes to get drinks. We ended up going straight to the bar and getting drinks in 30 seconds instead. We left early and paid our portion of the tab. When our friends went to pay the tab, they voided out our credit card payment and stuck him with the whole tab. ? Not sure why the did it.  I doubt we'll ever go back. I guess I will be going someplace else for some dancing."}
{"text":"Drinks good , 

Security called my family member a \"FAGGOT\" when we left! Wtf! This is BULLSHIT!! 

I can't believe a country singer would approve of this type of conduct! 

I am so upset that my family member had to deal with this type of racism and had to be belittled like this!! We were in town for a wedding and they totally screwed up our weekend! All we heard about was this place and how fun it was!

Also my friends wife was told by security that if she showed her boobs she would be allowed in!! Wtf! 

You need to fire your security! That is unacceptable!! I hope you contact me about this! 

We asked for the manager 5 times and they said he was unreachable! Really!! 

I hope people boycott this place !! Apparently they are bigots and demean women!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice atmosphere if you enjoy country music and a rustic feel.  The menu didn't feel like it offered enough selection and some items offered seemed out of place. Will return for discount burger night but other than that will not be in hurry to return."}
{"text":"Flys all over the dining room. Service is slow, even though only a handful of tables were there. If you sit back and observe the crew you will notice they just kind of slowly do the tasks required with serving. I totally understand I was there for lunch, it was a slow part of the day, but there was no pep in anyone's step. Food is not great, server argued saying the ranch dressing was blue cheese, told us they had no cocktail napkins, and couldn't give me grilled onions in place of fried onion strings! The manager was nice who just so happened to stop and ask how it was. He did clarify they did have napkins, and I could have swapped grilled onions for the fried ones... I gave this place 3 tries and this last time was the worst."}
{"text":"FULL DISCLOSURE, the place in Gilbert, AZ had only been open for a few days prior to my visit.  Was told the wait time was going to be one hour, waited two.  Not unheard of on a Friday night.  At least the atmosphere was pleasant, really enjoyed the live acoustic music. When we were finally seated, they sat us on a couch with what amounted to an end  table, there were six of us, you couldn't fit 6 glasses much less 6 plates had to eat with plates in your lap.  The couch was located in the play area, among giant jenga and connect four games and ping pong tables.  I do like the fact that they had them to entertain the kids however, it is not fun to be eating and have ping pong balls pelting you in the back of the head.  The staff was as attentive as they could be considering how busy  they were, they were definitely making an effort. The food was satisfactory, had minor new restaurant problems, pork chop overdone and tough, but it was tasty.  Hamburger cooked well when rare was the desired temperature.  Will give it another chance once they work out the bugs"}
{"text":"First time I've ever been to whisky row was today on a college football Saturday.  You don't ever expect much on that type of day. This place went over and above every expectation I had. Great service, great atmosphere, great music, great food and great hiring they did a really good job of hiring great looking, and quality bartenders(girls).  The manager was awesome and made sure we were well taken care of.  If you are ever in the Scottsdale area I would absolutely recommend paying a visit to whisky row and at the very least grabbing a few drinks.  Take it from someone that knows a little about football and bars"}
{"text":"We came here with a groupon, not really knowing what to expect with the food.  We were not expecting much, but were very impressed by the dishes.  We started with an order of wings.  Very unique way of serving these, as the wing had both the drumette and the wingette left attached as one piece.  They were crisp and just the right level of spice.  We then had a burger and a buffalo chicken sandwich.  Both were great options.  We had the deviled egg salad and the brussel sprout slaw.  Unique and tasty sides.  We will definitely come back to watch a game sometime, as the food is much better than the typical bar."}
{"text":"Whiskey Row is definitely one of the busiest bars in Oldtown Scottsdale its so fun, you have to get there early on the weekends otherwise there's a line out the door from 10pm-1am. I enjoy that the food is gormet, its why I will actually come during their lunch (killer happy hour too) they exceeded in making their concept of a day party. I go a few times per month since it opened and I love it!"}
{"text":"After 2 hours of wait the Manager replies his excuses in a sarcastic and rude manner.  Great place however the Manager does not belong there.  No followup or concern."}
{"text":"Solid food, good atmosphere and friendly staff. Great Job Alanna!"}
{"text":"Since opening in April, I've been to Whiskey Row quite a few times and the service has had some ups and downs. In my recent visits, I noticed a dramatic improvement in Customer Service and quality of the staff. I commented to a friend that there must be new management and recently found out that was the case. Had a great time last Friday and plan to take some friends from back East there when they come to town for Thanksgiving. Keep up the great work, we love hanging out at Whiskey Row!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and once again they don't fail to impress! Great band tonight Ryan Bexley!!! go here if you are looking for great country music and a different vibe in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Brunch was garage save your time and  money and go to a real breakfast place.  2 hours for the wrong order of eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. We used a Groupon to check this place out and found our new spot for catching a game and enjoying some good food. Haven't tried the late night atmosphere but we really enjoyed the Happy Hour experience. Our server Alana was friendly and attentive, told us all about the upcoming entertainment which we will check out soon."}
{"text":"If you have food allergies skip this place. No allergen menu is available. They will not substitute ingredients. I am dairy and alcohol free. There was NOT ONE SINGLE ITEM I could eat. I was given a choice of a dry hamburger with no bun and no sauce or a dry salad. So appealing (said with all sarcasm). Never coming back here. So since I had to talk to the manager and they never put my dry hamburger order in, they brought my husband's order out way before mine. As a gentleman he waited for me to be served as his food got cold. Terrible."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and drinks and the food was great and the service was even better. Our server Leslie and Jade the manager were both great and checked up on us regularly. Great place"}
{"text":"Came in on Wednesday with a couple guys for some drinks and food. We waited about 20 minutes for a table but it was well worth it. Sophie was our waitress and she was really cool. Got a great beer recommendation from her and our food was delicious. Fun atmosphere! Planning on coming back with a couple friends. Can't speak highly enough about this place! Finally a fun spot in Gilbert."}
{"text":"First time visiting this bar, the food was great,  and my server Sarah was very attentive to our needs and  informative about the happy hour specials and drinks that were a must try like the spring fling which was very good. You can also enjoy the games while hanging out."}
{"text":"We went the Whiskey Row this afternoon and had their Az. Restaurant week special.  I had the shrimp and grits, which was the best I have ever had.  Make it myself and it is not that good.  My hubby had the Meatball burger which is made with veal.  He said it was very good on flavor, roll, etc. but said it is too dry.  Needs some pork fat!
Had the banana bread pudding for dessert.  It should be outlawed-yummmeeeee.
Drinks were good, a little pricey, but we are on party row in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had a great time having beers and wings while watching some basketball.  Great service from the bartenders always with a smile. Downtown gilbert finally has a place where to drink some beers and enjoy a fresh atmosphere. Happy hour and weekends its a must! Salud!!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow/no service by the staff. The bar was not busy (only 3 customers).  The wait staff was friendly but unapologetic."}
{"text":"We arrived Saturday @ 7:00, my first experience. I was told the wait was going to be an hour and requested to put my name down. The hostess said she will be right back because she needs to help some other people. She came back to tell me the wait would be an hour and 20 minutes, I was confused but I still said sure put my name down. She walked away once more and came back to tell me the wait was going to be at least an hour and a half. I chuckled and said \"you've just given me three different times in the last five minutes\". I'm beginning to think they didn't want us there. I should probably point out that I am 42 and my wife is 39. There's obviously a younger vibe that is starting to arrive. We ended up getting a table with some friends that already there. They were quick to tell me they had a very similar experience getting a table. Our server was average, we ordered food and drinks which seem to come fairly quick. The food was good but very inconsistent from one plate to the next as three of us ordered the same thing. One looked really burnt the other one perfect and the other slightly undercooked. Many drinks followed and we made our way eventually to the dance floor. People are having a good time, live music was good but younger crowd was a bit sloppy. I only mention this because a girl bumped into my wife's chair and spilled her brand new full drink into my lap. No apologies as she didn't seem to be aware of anything going on. I went to the guy working the door who my wife had talked to several times throughout the evening to tell him the bad news. I was hoping to get a drink possibly replaced but he said \"that is not my deal, you need to talk to the bartender\". No thanks, that was enough for me. As we were leaving leaving it was hard not to notice the huge line waiting to get in. The feeling I got is that this place is so popular the staff does not have to try. I should point out every time I went to the bar to get a drink the service was speedy. They were super busy and motoring through it. We got out of there just spending $100 for the two of us. Chicken strips & rings were good. Drink service was average. Hostesses and other staff less to be desired."}
{"text":"Went for early lunch! Amazing Bloody Mary's and great food! The garlic fries are awesome! Our waitress made sure our drinks were full and that we were happy. It was a fun atmosphere. We will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to relax and enjoy an afternoon game you are in the wrong place. We were seated at the bar outside and told that we would be added to the waiting list. After seeing multiple people sit at new places we start to question whether we are getting a place or non  3 hours past, games over, no communication with any waiters yet. You are better off going to here next door."}
{"text":"Lively place to get a beer or two and some delicious food. Southern fries are spot on as well as an appetizer. I've been here at night and it is more of a club but during the day it is much more calm. Wish there were more bars like this around Arizona."}
{"text":"Our first time in we were excited to try it. Very disappointed. Fish and chips soggy, chicken and waffles dry, portions small, lonnnnng time to get our food- 40 minutes and another 30 after we paid and waited for our change. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm 96.2% sure that they water down those bottles A LOT. If you go here make sure you order something in a sealed bottle like a beer. The whiskey coke is just coke and brown water, the Long Island was just the exact same. Super let down when I heard so many good things. They also under count on their pours for shots. Good luck. Tons of good looking girls though. Bring your own hidden flask if you want a buzz though."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place, over all it was fun. 

Spacious, lots of people.

Good drinks. 

They played like 4 country songs and we were there all night. 

DB would be ashamed LOL."}
{"text":"I had a reservation that was confirmed (twice) a month leading up to the super bowl for 12 people.  5 days before, I got a call saying they couldn't honor my reservation and never provided a valid explanation way.  The person in charge of VIP bookings said, \"Don't blame me, ask our GM.  He changed everything at the last minute.\"  I reached out to the GM but he never provided a valid explanation.

This is a poorly run business.  Don't book a reservation and expect them to keep it.

We had a blast at The W instead."}
{"text":"Could be such a cool bar if they had a bigger dance floor.  Smallest dance floor ever!  And its suppose to be a country bar...  even Moonshine and Toby's have a big dance floor."}
{"text":"Not a fan, the bartender didn't even tell me it was happy hour, nor did she manage to tell me which items were on happy hour. Drinks are OK at best a little over priced if you ask me. The derby smash was good but it'll take like 3 of those and 36$ to make you feel anything. Service was below average won't be coming back again the place next door is better in my eyes better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"First time visit. Not impressed from beginning to end.  Hostess girls were cold and reqiured a 15 min wait with 8-10 tables empty with no other people waiting.
Ordered fish and chips. Got 3 small pieces of fish. Barely an appetizer. The cole slaw was shreded carrots. Waitress didn't know the menu.

I wouldn't give any stars but yelp requires 1 star. We have waited for a year for this place to open. So disappointed."}
{"text":"In from Chicago, Friday family fun night, great steaks, beer can chicken, drinks with yummy garlic fries and warm brownies for dessert! Live music at 5pm was a bonus! Four year old granddaughter, danced all night! We sat near the games, at a large low top (best table) went at about 4:30 to beat the crowd! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Not a good review. 6 adults, 3 hours. We left on an escort of staff. really? in at  8,out   by 11. Will spend many conversations talking about this night."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My server Mere was so kind so friendly and made me feel like I've been there over 100 times. Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This was a good time on Friday night. Very busy like all the restaurants in downtown Gilbert, but we enjoyed the music and typical bar food."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite bar! Kenny and Brad (with the big beard) from security are amazing! They went out of their way to keep me safe when I was put in an unfortunate situation. They went above and beyond to make sure I got home safe. I can't thank them enough!! I will definitely be coming back to see them!! Whiskey row is lucky to have you both! If your looking for a new place to go... I would definitely stop in!!! (:"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment on its first opening Friday night at 10:00pm and my experience was mixed. I got in the door pretty quick, said hello to my friends (large group) who had a table, then I proceeded to the main bar to grab a beer. The line to get a beer was about three people deep all the way around. I waited for 15 minutes and the line did not move an inch. I went back to the table hoping that one of the waitresses would take my order, only to find out that my friends had been ordering 9 beers at a time from the side bar and bringing them back to the table because no server ever visited their table. We did this the entire night! It was the most efficient way to get us all beers due to the long wait times for drinks. On average the wait was about 25-30 minutes for a drink at the main bar during peak time and 10-12 minutes at the side bar. Later in the night I saw there was a beer tub girl on the complete opposite side of the bar, but it was so packed I did not see it until the place cleared out a bit. The women staff are all beautiful and had smiles on their faces. The bathroom for the men's room was clean. Security was mostly friendly except for the few \"undercover\" security guards who look like trained marine snipers, posting up on top of the booth areas next to the DJ booth. This is Gilbert, not Tempe or Scottsdale, could've fooled me though. Overall, the music was great, the band was amazing, and the people around me seemed to be having a fun time as long as they did not have to wait forever to get a beer."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 5 times now for happy hour and each time has been just as good as the last. 
Their sliders are outstanding along with their fried pickles. But the artichoke dip is to rave about. 
Along with the food being great. The service is what gives this place 5 stars. My server Nicole has answered every single question I've had for her (on average of 3 questions per visit) and she even remembers me every time I come back. That makes me feel like I'm back home in Arkansas. 
Great place. Great food. Great service. 10/10 would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"very nice new place! the patio is also great! Have yet to try the food but next time I will for sure"}
{"text":"Well I went there hoping this was going to be a great place. It was soso. Expensive for me and then when I order a draft beer it came in what I would describe as a small brandy snifter. I had some beer in my life, but never in that yype of glass. Anyway,  I think if you're a millenial and want to be with the IN crowd, then this is it. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I have a feeling this bar isn't going to be another flash in the pan. They have a good location, a good layout, good prices and a good vibe. Cocktails for $5? Awesome. Good beer list? Great. They also have built in taps for table service. I don't like country music but it was still fun to watch people sing along and dance. For single ladies, there are a lot of really tall guys here. 

The bartender we had was fast and attentive. My friend ordered some mudslide shots from another bartender. She stacked the three shots on top of each other, put them on the bar and pushed them towards us. Know your bar surface. Things aren't sliding on that bar top. So I was then wearing those three shots. The bartender took off so fast you'd think her pants were on fire. She didn't say I'm sorry. She didn't offer me a towel. She didn't offer me a drink. She didn't even acknowledge it happened. SO RUDE. Then the guy next to me asked another bartender for a napkin and he yelled back at him sorry dude we ran outta napkins three days ago. Then he came back with one he found, unrolled it in the guys face so the fork and knife dropped right in front of him and tossed it at him. Seriously?

They also ran out of coors light. 

So some new bar problems they will overcome but they need to teach some of their bartenders some manners. I don't want to let those two ruin the rest of the experience so 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday evening right around 7 and the place was not that busy. A few folks at the bar where I sat.  Food was pretty good and caught the happy hour special, but the service was below standards.  A few bartenders that chatted all night rather than take care of customers.  Definitely need to improve on their standards."}
{"text":"Page is the best! Proposed marriage with an onion ring and she didn't say no! 

Food was good, beer was cold. Big place, lots of room."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday afternoon and very disappointed.    The fish and chips looked like pieces of calamari they were so small and their coleslaw was basically shredded carrots.  Will never return for food.  Atmosphere was nice but definitely not a place for good food."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and it was super busy. Place had a great atmosphere and everyone was having a good time. We had some sliders, my favorite was the hot chicken! The wings were ok, I just prefer mine fried. Our bartender Beth crow took great care of us, always had a welcoming smile, and helped us pick out a few cocktails from their cocktail menu. Even though they were super busy she still found time to help us with a smile. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I and a friend went to Whiskey Row , Gilbert Friday to hear one of our favorite local bands.  From the moment we got there the service we received was excellent.  We put our name in the wait list for a table and went to the bar. We found two seats so my husband stood.  The bar manager Matthew Thompson asked a server to bring my husband a bar stool.  Then when our table was ready we went to see if we would be able to see the band and once again Matthew was there to make sure we got a table with a view... he truly aimed to please his guests and showed us he is one heck of a manager... Besides the outstanding service our food was delicious from the appetizers to our main meal .  We will definitely be back.  Thank you Matthew for making our night perfect!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit to this restaurant/bar and WOW. Great first impression. The food and service was great. Ordered their burger with mushrooms...I was in love. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sit inside. We say on the patio. At 5'5\" tall my feet barely reached the footrest on my barstool. My feet dangled so my legs fell asleep.  
Our waitress could use more training. She didn't get the details of our order correct (salad dressing on the side, etc.). Side salad served with my meal.  The food was good (Alabama chicken and buffalo chicken sandwich).
The meal took a long time. Maybe not a big deal but we were on an hour and a half schedule and it was tight. Unexpected for a bar and grill."}
{"text":"Disappointed that's all I have to say! I was hoping for live country  music instead we got was a dj playing rap music. Come on Dierks keep it classy!"}
{"text":"Great drinks , service and atmosphere is awesome. We ate the wings , mac n cheese (awesome) and the fries ( with ranch chicken bbq sauce and cheese) amazing"}
{"text":"The place is half a
empty at 8 pm on a Tuesday and our party of 4 were told an hour wait. Ridiculous. I thought the 3 girls at the front to check in we're more interested in their own conversation than accommodating us. When we said the place is half empty they said they were going to call people in. At most there was 10 people outside. I saw all the advertising of the good looking food but the customer service is not there yet."}
{"text":"Beer is flat-service is horrible- they don't seem to understand how to treat customers at this location"}
{"text":"I still cant get over why there's a country bar in Old Town, but I guess it has worked out for the owners. It'll be interesting to see how this place will fare when this country music trend dies out.

I've  only been 3 or 4 times since they've opened and I was dragged there each time kicking and screaming. Drinks are strong and that's about it... not sure how to two-step and they don't play anything but country. Not for me, but okay for other people."}
{"text":"Lexi was a breath of fresh air !!!! Brought her a game to service... I wish more people didn't know about this place so we could enjoy it ourselves.... Kevin was a cool dude , will definitely be back...."}
{"text":"Lexi is a breath of fresh air in this establishment. Lexi waited on us with a beautiful smile as she served us drinks"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for brunch.  The chicken fried steak was outstanding.  If you like Nutella, try the stuffed french toast.  The portions are large which is what I would expect from a country themed bar and everything was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very slow service...food is just ok.  Should have listened to the previous reviews...most of them were spot on about the poor service. You order a drink and it takes 10-15 min to get it. And good luck getting a timely refill or chance to order another beer.  Sad thing is...this was a Thursday night and they were not busy at all!
I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap...this was mostly all lettuce with a tiny bit of chicken. Husband ordered the whiskey burger which he said was ok."}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment. Over priced drinks. The women bartenders pay you no attention if you are female. We waited over 20 mins to be acknowledged for a drink which is unacceptable especially being staffed how they were.  The food was burnt and nothing  to come back for. Oh yes not to mention the burnt chicken!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible! It says online that they take reservations so we called to make them and they said they do not take reservations. We told them we had a party of eight coming in and they said that would be fine there may just be a wait. We arrived 30 minutes later and they told us they could not accommodate any groups larger than 6 for the rest of the evening. I asked for a manager and was told he was busy... seriously?? Wow this place really is horrible. We had a bad experience in Scottsdale and now this one is on the list as well."}
{"text":"Butt cheeks everywhere, very unappetizing , waitress walking around aimlessly, bad bad service, nearly edible food."}
{"text":"I really don't know why this place gets such a low rating on Yelp.  I have been several times and found the atmosphere to be fun and energetic.  The bartenders are fantastic... especially Eric and Natalie. They have a great happy hour with food and drink specials.  Great selection of beer and wines and some creative house cocktails.  I haven't eaten there yet but I've got to say that the pork chop I saw come out of the kitchen looked phenomenal.  I'm going back for dinner very soon...  Try it.  I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Matt Thompson really rocked our world with free shots and carbs. He save our friend's birthday!"}
{"text":"Visited whiskey row on a Wednesday night and was told it would be more than an hour wait for two people. We ended up waiting 45 min and found a seat at the bar. The beer selection was awesome but it took a bit to be served. When we finally got to order I wanted the fish and chips only to be told they had sold out. I went with the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was ok at best. The food alone took another 45 min to come out and when it did the fries were lukewarm. The atmosphere was nice but I'd rather go somewhere with faster service and better food for that price."}
{"text":"Went last weekend for my wife's birthday with family. Over an hour to get a table, that's fine. Still didn't leave for another three hours. Service was horrible and slow. Anybody who had a meat entree it was cooked incorrectly.  Waitress missed who was on each bill. I guess if you go there for a drink or atmosphere,  might be worth it."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  We had lunch of steak salad amd mushroom burger.  Prosecco was very small poor. Chairs were uncomfortable because foot rail only works for those six feet tall or more. Everything wad slow in coming although they weren't busy. Waited 15 mins for check"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Sat at the bar for 20min and got no service. It's was 7 on a Friday and the bar wasn't busy. The two female bartenders walked by us several time without even looking at us. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome selection of beers, good food! It can get crazy on the weekends, but it's a new bar in town so it's understandable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just left David Nail and it was so disappointing with an incredible artist. First get rid of the girls on the bar, blocking the view and pretty sure David didn't like the confetti in his face.  Second, probably one of the worst sound systems."}
{"text":"If you have to be gluten free don't go here!!!!!!!!
Not sure how this place survives without any good GF options in this day and age. Also, they were supposed to have live music for brunch but that was missing. Instead we had sportsing TV BLASTING in our ears. :( I will never ever be back."}
{"text":"Reserved 1 VIP table which is $150 minimum tab, no prob we had min 15people. The tables do not sit that many people but you can sit on the edges, which are on top on the seating area. Reserved for 8pm, had to wait 30+ min, for a Reserved VIP table?? Why was this not communicated with the family seated in the area, with their barefoot kids RUNNING AROUND ON THE UPPER DECK AREA OF THE BOOTHS, AND the windows were WIDE opened.. Just unbelievable (from a parents stand point) Dallas, the manager was great, he, at this point, had no control. He was being bombarded by questions from employees, security guards, customers who were upset. It was apparent there was no communication. Our waitress didn't know the answer to any of our questions, didn't know the drinks, the food, about shots. I felt like they were short staffed and pulled strangers off the street to help out. Wasting time running back and forth to the bar to answer our questions. We frequent the one across the street from our house in Scottsdale, so we knew more than she did. As a business, this is totally unacceptable. Waste of productivity. We were left alone at long periods of time, needing to order food, drinks etc.  Did I mention they were absolutely crowded. 4 members of our party were going to be late and had to wait IN THE VIP LINE FOR 30min while they were letting people off the street in. Wha wha whaaaat? I know, because I waited up front the entire time. Crazy.. 
   The live band, and music was awesome BUT IT WAS TOO LOUD, LIKE A CONCERT WHERE I COULDN'T HAVE A NORMAL CONVERSATION WITH MY FRIENDS, OR THE WAITRESS to order the necessities. My party did get a free round of 3 specific shots for us having to wait for our VIP reserved table. I was the DD so iv would have perferred a free appetizer lol 
 1) Get your staff trained on the menu, drinks and specialty shots offered  
  2)schedule enough employees so that nobody is having to wait for a nother drink (we started order two at a time, because we didn't want to be without) 
  3) Communication Communication Communication. Let customers know ahead of time when they are expected to be done with their table as its reserved at specific time. 
  4) get rid of the round tables and replace with a  long ass table in those areas (two long ass tables in between kitchen/bar area, and possible a long table in between vip tables (near windows) and bar. I didn't get over to the west side of bar, so I dunno."}
{"text":"The place has a lot of potential and I can see that it will be a hit in downtown Gilbert since it adds the variable of live music to the equation.  We went on a Friday night at about 5:30 before the big rush.  The band that was playing was good, the food is your basic pub fare.  My burger was great and everyone else thought the food was good.  I'm not complaining about the food, I am more concerned about the service.  We were waiting for our change (which took 55 minutes from start to finish) and security came over to our table and told us we had to leave so they could remove it from the dance floor.  I completely understand that they wanted to open up the dance-floor for the next band but the way they approached us was the issue.  We are a family of about 12 people ranging from 72 down to 28 years old.  When we told them that we are just waiting for our change the security guy said \"Ok, but I don't care.\"  This was definitely the  attitude of their security team.  They literally took the chair from my 7 month pregnant daughter in law who was also waiting for her credit card.  I was shocked.  Meanwhile, there was another table right next to us that had about 5 people sitting at it who were just having drinks who weren't being asked to leave.  We did complain to the Manager on our way out and he gave us his card and said that he was sorry.  I sure hope that they do some more training for their security team, as they too are the face of the organization."}
{"text":"This is one of the better bars down on Mill Avenue. Went there before and after the ASU game and it was fun and alive! Bartenders take very good care of everyone no matter where you are sitting. Lots of great Happy Hour deals all week long! If you are going downtown don't pass up this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on a Wednesdays night and i was very surprised to see how busy it was. We enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"This Whiskey Row didn't play a single country song, I felt like I was in the El Hefe overflow. Literally, the girls dancing on the bar and how they were dancing and the dance music they were playing were the same. It took over 35 minutes to use the MEN'S restroom and it felt more like a club than how Whiskey Row should be. Shame it's a \"country bar.\""}
{"text":"For Easter we only waited 10 min at 11:30 am this was fantastic! Our server was amazing and the food was great!!  Plus an amazing live band singing all the classic and new aged country"}
{"text":"Won't go back. Overpriced food menu & food was barely ok. Worst part was charged $3/drink for \"rocks pour\". I've seen that practice in other cities & always irritates me as deceptive. Facility is showing signs of wear too. Plenty of other places to go."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give 1 star. I came in when the place wasn't busy and waited forever before anyone welcomed me or attempted to seat my party. The hostess, server and security were rude. I'll never go back. Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I was at Whiskey Row on a Saturday night and the line was about a 5 minute wait which was completely worth it. The DJ played country music from today's current hits to the country classics. Everyone was very friendly and the bouncers were very accommodating. Dance floor was crowded with plenty of people having a great time. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a country bar."}
{"text":"I took my family to Whiskey Row to celebrate my daughter's 21st Birthday. Management was VERY accommodating. The service was great. The food... DELISH! I loved the atmosphere and the fun things to do while we enjoyed each other. Not to mention that everyone who works there are VERY easy on the eyes and so nice to talk to. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to kick back and have a good ole time...  All ages will enjoy!"}
{"text":"DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CARD WITH THEM. They tell you if you leave your card \"it's 20% off\" or \"they're systems are down and they just will keep your card until it works\" AND THEN OVER CHARGE YOUR CARD BY 20-30 dollars.... they did it to both my friend and myself. Completely took advantage of us. Never ever EVER leave your card with the bar. Or just be prepared with cash."}
{"text":"Nice open air feel. Good food. Had the whiskey burger and whiskey wings. Both were very tasty. This is a country bar setting. Expect a good dose of country music to enjoy while you eat. We went for lunch and it was tame but looks like it can get fairly lively at night and during SF Giants games."}
{"text":"This review is not based on anything other than service. Was out in Old Town on a Wednesday for some drinks with my boyfriend. I have lived in Phoenix for 17 years and also work at a bar in Old Town. Came here because the crowd was good and music and we were just bar hopping. Went up to an open space in the bar to get a couple drinks..had my credit card out and waited. From what I could see there were 2 girl bartenders that night and it was a pretty busy night for a Wednesday. I'm in the industry so I totally understand being busy and not getting to me right away...no big deal...but what I don't understand is the bartender making drinks for another person RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME ....looks RIGHT AT ME. I smile and wait since I figured she looked at me so she knows I'm waiting. But she does no sort of ackowkedging of me or \"I'll be right with you\" or \"hey I'm so sorry I'm super slammed but I will be right back\" Nothing. I understand if other people were before me and she needs to serve others before me...great...just let me know..all I got was a bartender with a shitty attitude and look on her face...I've worked in Old Town for years and KNOW how busy it gets especially in season...but I also know how to give good service and acknowledge people even when I am busy. If you can't handle it or don't like it..then don't work there. Little did she know I'm a great tipper but after being repeatedly ignored I didn't want her getting any of my money. I can't stand people in the industry that act like that and plus its just super unattractive women who act like that. However the bartender Jordan at Dakota was AMAZING. She was sooo sweet and nice and personable. Their music and vibe was great."}
{"text":"The wings from this establishment are easily in my top 10 all time.  I cant explain or compare them to any other spot so your just gonna have to take my word for it and stop in for a sample of your own.  Plus its Deirks spot, who wouldnt be curious enough to check it out.  If you collect stickers, just ask your waitress and she will hook it up..TWO THUMBS UP HIGH FOR ME!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, the wings are SO good, and so is the steak salad! Our waiter was super nice (I forgot her name but I'm pretty sure she had red hair) and the hostess, I think her name was Sahalie, was very accommodating as well. I'll definitely be back for square dancing and 50 cent wings on wednesdays!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Dierks Bentley fan so this place has been on my list for ages. The food was great, service was attentive and friendly. We got a free appetizer with our Yelp check-in and shared an order of Southern Fries. I had the fried chicken and we all split the S'mores brûlée. great meal and a pretty great place. The only bummer was that Luke Bryan did a surprise set the next day so I totally missed out!!! Will have to come back next time!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Downtown Gilbert is such a beautiful area and this is a great place to get out of the summer heat, drink some beers and hangout. At night it is definitely a fun place to be. It has a great vibe and is a great place to have a night out with friends. 
Not only is the atmosphere fun and welcoming but the food is amazing as well. 
Definitely a great place to be."}
{"text":"The bartender's are horrible here.They don't even acknowledge you.Two times in a row this happened.They first time I had to go out of my way to get service from the guy.The second time the purple haired girl greeted a group of three even though I was sitting there waiting RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER about 2 or 3 minutes before.i walked out after that.Another  bar on Mill which gave excellent service said Whiskey is notorious for that. Dont waste your time here.Theres either very little bar training or they just don't care.Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Do not go here!  Bouncers out of control - saw one grab a customer in a headlock and pulled out of bar- illegal, dangerous and horrible customer experience. Management needs to get things under control - there are many other options on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Thanks MATT for making our daughters 21st birthday so memorable.!! We enjoyed amazing food and drinks that evening.  The live music was so great we had the best time with our family and friends."}
{"text":"My bartender/server, Kyle, was fantastic!! He was friendly, attentive and I noticed he was busting his butt along with the other bartenders! The place was packed, but he had a smile and looked like he really loves his job!
I will be back!!"}
{"text":"If you like country music and good food, then Whiskey Row is the place for you. They offer a really good brunch and happy hour. The servers are super nice and attentive. Its a great place to stop in at, whether it is a weekday for lunch or for a good time on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Wasn't our first choice but were talked into dining here by one in our group.  Service was not great.  It wasn't terrible it just seemed to take too long to get drinks.  Even had one in the party that had to order a drink three times before finally getting served-and it was iced tea.  
Food service was similar in that we started receiving some of our entree's before our appetizer order got to the table.  

Too many other choices in the area to return here.  Waitress seemed more interested in other tables.  

Most attentive of the staff was the food runner who checked on us on a few occasions as was more personable."}
{"text":"We had reservations at 8:30 but called to be late a few minutes...they said ok...when we got there they said they don't serve food after 8:45! Wtf! Over rated anyway"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Thanks Mandi for the great food and service! Go Steelers!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to hangout during the day but night time gets ridiculous. You can only have a table if you reserve one in advance which makes it a pathetic place to hangout. I watched several security guards harassing groups of people about the stupidest things that were no issue whatsoever. I watched several groups leave because of the harassment from security guards and there's simply no place to sit and eat. You shouldn't be able to reserve tables after 8 pm because it's just unfair to other customers willing to spend money. There was at least 8 tables that were constantly open and stayed open for an hour or more at a time that could have been occupied by groups of people willing to spend money themselves. Get your shit together Whiskey Row start making wise decisions and start evaluating your security guards before you lose more customers. It used to be an awesome place to hangout."}
{"text":"I don't get out much so when a friend suggested we have a girls night, I immediately thought about checking this place out. I'm a big country fan and the thought of dancing the night away to country music got me really excited. Unfortunately, this place sucked. It was a Friday night and it was crowded. The dance floor is SO SMALL!! What kind of country bar has a small dance floor?? We literally walked in, walked to the other side, then walked out. My friend perfectly described the atmosphere as a \"college house party\" where it's crowded, you don't really know anybody and you don't know what to do with yourself. All I saw were people standing tightly next to each other, holding a beer and making conversation. Ugh, I came here to dance!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service all around. I won't ever come here again! 4 different friends have all had issues with RUDE managers and waitstaff. Will let everyone I know not to come to this place."}
{"text":"Service here is ungodly slow! Can't understand why 3 bartenders would allow 2 people to sit forever to order. However once you DO get your food, I will say it's pretty amazing so I'll give them that. Go, but plan to have a few hours to spare."}
{"text":"Good fun bar in the nightclub district in downtown Scottsdale.   Fun open air environment with country music."}
{"text":"Just tried to go with the family. After I got the hostess' attention she said the wait was an hour, but that the bar was open seating and kids were allowed. So, our family sat in a big booth there. We sat there for several minutes and nobody  acknowledged us. Then a group of people started smoking right outside the open window. At that point all five of us got up and left and still nobody said a word. We are now across the street at Zinburger enjoying wonderful service and delicious food."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try Whiskey Row Gilbert because of the name. I've been to the one in Scottsdale once and it was \"ok\" but we decided to try this location because it's closer to home. 

When you walk up to the restaurant, you feel the energy. It was incredibly lively. There's a huge bar in the middle and games like ping ping and corn hole to play surrounding the restaurant. So far, seems like a very cool place.

After we were told it would be 90 minutes to be seated on a Wednesday night, we decided to stay and just explore the venue while we caught up. Their reasoning for the long wait was they're still figuring stuff and and didn't want to overload the chefs. We thought maybe it'd be worth the wait. 

We finally were seated and we all ordered burgers. Needless to say, the burgers were over cooked. They were edible but it definitely wasn't worth waiting 90+ minutes for. Food overall, 2.5/5 stars at best. 

A day after, my friend realized he forgot his prescription glasses at the restaurant so he calls but they're not open. He decided to go down and speak to the manager Mike. After my friend explained his situation to Mike, 45 minutes later Mike returns and when my friend asks if he found them yet, Mike says \"oh I haven't even gotten to that yet.\" Are you kidding me?? I understand it's busy and I understand it's not the restaurants fault for misplacing someone's personal property but to come back and say that, come on. At least show the customer you care a little bit. 

My friend gave them his card if they find them and still no response yet. 

If you want to go to a place for the name, bad customer service, and high priced food/beverage, this is your place. If you want a place that gives you great customer service time and time again, go across the street to Postinos or Joyride. The food is also much better."}
{"text":"Love this place. Has a great atmosphere with a friendly and energetic staff. I took my parents easter morning with my two kids and it was amazing. Our server Amanda was great she was full of smiles and was very helpful. Kept up with us and our busy crew. Over all love this place and defintly will be coming back with the whole family."}
{"text":"Four of us ladies came for happy hour before going to a show at The Hale Theater. Sounded like a fun place with good happy hour options. 
Both of their Redneck cocktails on HH were not available as they ran out of vodka. How do you run out of vodka?  So we ordered other drinks instead. 
We ordered all 3 apps which were on HH special being the fried pickles, southern rings, and fingers & rings, also got the pretzel which wasn't a special. The food was highly recommended by the staff but in reality was quite underwhelming. The chicken fingers were flavorless, the rings were tasty, the smothered fries were ok, the pretzel was good but the cheese could have been better (a cheddar beer cheese would have been ideal), and the fried pickles were surprisingly spicy, those were good. 
The service was mediocre. Have little intention of returning. Really had high hopes. Too bad."}
{"text":"We had a great night at Dierks. Bartenders kept us entertained, made awesome drinks, and were funny and kept the fun rolling. 10/10 will return"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Houston Texans Game. Calm for a NFL Sunday game time but the wings and fries were good and the bartender kept the beers coming...I'll def come back...maybe when the Texans play the Denver Broncos! Go Texans!"}
{"text":"I came this evening with my two daughters who visited from California and DC. While we were waiting for our table to be ready we decided to play at the pingpong table. Klutz I am, I bashed my head on the edge of the counter when I bent down to pick up the ball. I was bleeding and in quite a bit of pain. Immediately someone came running and asked what happened. They took such good care of me! Got me a chair, got some disinfectant and an ice pack and stayed with me until it stopped bleeding. Checked if I had a concussion and were so wonderful! Amazing! I am so impressed!

Oh and the good and drinks where delicious!"}
{"text":"Sorry sorry service read the reviews. Do not waste your time or money. With all the pretty lights in the heart of downtown Gilbert this place could be great, but again the service is going to kill this place!! Typical bar food nothing special. Just wasted $100."}
{"text":"Fun new spot in downtown Gilbert. Our server, Aubrey was adorable, and very attentive. We never had to wait for a refill and our food orders arrived quickly. She let us know about all of the things to do, like Giant Jenna, Giant Connect Four, ping-pong, & corn hole. This place is light, bright and open with a super fun atmosphere. They have great happy hour specials, tons of beers on tap, a fantastic looking staff, & good food."}
{"text":"Went here for my cousin's 21st birthday and had SUCH a good time! Arrived at 11ish and the line was not bad at all (though it was on a holiday weekend, so I'm not sure how it is normally), got in with no cover though there was a live band playing and were immediately served a couple beers at $4 a pop. Music was great - ESPECIALLY when Dierks Bentley himself showed up and did a couple numbers!! The dance floor was great, drinks were delicious and overall, we had a really good time. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was wonderful, food was fantastic and Maddie was super attentive and had the kindest personality! Will most defiantly be back"}
{"text":"What a fun night! My boyfriend and I decided to try Whiskey Row for dinner and couldn't been happier with our visit! It was such a fun environment, the building is huge with really well thought out design inside. The bar is in the middle of the restaurant, very cool to people watch and be social, felt really comfortable. I also really like the open kitchen! They had a really good vibe and energy in there. My guy and I started off with some of their specialty whiskey drink which they had an awesome HH $5, and started with meatball sliders. I love meatballs but usually restaurants don't a great job with them. I come from an Italian family , but these were homemade, hot, great sauce and had a yummy soft bun. Really impressed. My boyfriend got the Harris ranch prime flat iron steak with chimichurri sauce and I got the kale and quinoa salad with chicken, both our meals were excellent. Our service was excellent too. She was very attentive. We finished off their warm banana bread pudding. Omg! 
Definitely coming back! Next time I am going back for the live music on Friday nights. So happy we stopped in! Great Job whiskey row! Happy you came to Gilbert"}
{"text":"I'm pretty bummed to give Whiskey Row a 3 star review as I love Dierks Bentley, and I've experienced how fun this place used to be the first couple years. It was the best bar in Old Town. There was good live country music, actual country dancers, the girls that worked here didn't have sleazy lingerie up their buttcracks... but all that has changed.  The half country half pop crap they play is so bad it makes my ears bleed. Like nails scratching a chalkboard, just awful. Now the crowd is just like many other old town clubs- younger and douchey. So not a country bar. So not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Family and I went here for dinner on a Tuesday. We had a larger party, we couldn't call ahead or make reservations- that's fine, ok. We were told over the phone it shouldn't be a problem on a Tuesday. Arrived around 530, no one else was waiting- they told me it'd be about 15 minutes to get tables put together. There are high tops in your bar that were already pushed together- I asked your hostesses if we could just sit there and she said we'd have to wait for tables. You had 2 hostesses working, but it might as well have only been one. One was scrolling through her phone while telling everyone \"it's gonna be about 15-25 minutes, she'll take your name\" and then pointing to the other girl - I understand you do the electronic thing- cool, but your girl without the tablet looked bored. And for the record, if you have 6 parties of 4-6 walk in within 10 minutes of each other, it's inevitable that that last group is waiting longer than 25 minutes, so don't tell them 15, that's how you piss people off - that's like - service industry 101. We were sat 5 minutes to 6:00 - at the high top table I had originally requested to sit at, you can imagine my humor in the situation. Our waitress came and got us drinks one by one, which I thought odd, but we were still waiting on a few people- once everyone arrived our waitress took 3 people's orders... literally didn't ask the rest of us about food.. some time passes, she comes back.. then takes 3 more of our orders, leaving more humans out - I had to walk up to her and tell her we still had people who needed to order..?? She did the same thing with our checks- \"do you need boxes?\" .. \"yes please, and the check\" - boxes brought to some people and not others, checks brought to some people and not others.. I mean seriously, it's nice that you hire only good looking humans, because I'm super concerned with the ass that's attached to the beer I'm being served, but for the love of god, do you not put them through some sort of \"square peg, square hole\" test prior to hiring? Food was OK, drinks were OK, service was OK."}
{"text":"Food was average, server was new - pleasant but when I asked for bread or a roll with my salad, she said they didn't have any. First restaurant I've been to with sandwiches that don't have bread!

Open, fun atmosphere - love the setup and different types of seating and activities. Would go back for drinks if someone else wanted to check it out (drink selection was average) but would pick almost any other restaurant in downtown Gilbert to eat (can't go wrong with almost any other selection in the area)."}
{"text":"It's awful if you want to dance! If you want to   Stand in a undeserved 2 hour line to be smashed in like a sardines just to pretend you know the words to the country song then it's the place for you. It would maybe be better if they made some sort of large sectioned off dance floor. But it's not country at all! Unless you think axe body spray,bedazzled jeans and girls wearing a bra and cowgirl boots is country."}
{"text":"So my question is this..... How can you legally shut down a bathroom from patrons for over ten minutes to let a \"celebrity\" through. This is against health code rules. We want to love you as an Arizona establishment but between terrible service and excuses for everything it is making it very hard to enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. People were a lot of fun. Waitresses were very attractive. Girls behind the bar were as well. They had beer taps a the tables. They had a few games as well. Music was great and food was good. I will be going back. Oh and after 10, a few good looking girls were dancing up on the tables. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty small but the food is good. The service is fine, too. However, the atmosphere is simply frenetic and not in a good way! If I'm having dinner and drinks with friends, it would be nice to be able to talk not yell! Go late for the music, but go somewhere else for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great, fun vibe, nice crowd, great music! The whole 2 blocks are full of clubs and bars so u can hop if you don't love where you're at. Drinks were a tad weak but no biggie. The dj played remixed country, top 40 and some old favs..I'd Def go back! We grabbed pizza at the lil shop on the corner..highly recommend that too. Note it takes 5-10 mins to get noticed and recieve a drink...there's alot of ppl here, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch, no one was here but obviously the server was completely annoyed of our presence even though we were her only table and here for 5 mins. Had a few questions about the menu and she just would roll her eyes and seem very frustrated with us. Our drinks took a solid 15 mins because there was only one bartender which would be totally acceptable if there wasn't only 4 people sitting at the bar and us being the only table. We decided to close out and take our brunch somewhere else. Night club wise it's a good time, day time wise lacks hospitality skill."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very welcoming. The decor is very unique, and that is meant as a compliment. The booths are big enough for a good size group,  with the kegs in each booth.

Good country music and quality sound. I've entertainment was impressive as well. 

The menu was difficult to choose one thing. I ended up getting the mac n cheese and a meatball slider on happy hour. That meatball slider. ....I could eat 100 it was so good. They use veal and fresh seasonings and herbs. Homemade tomato sauce was a great touch. I loved the cheese sauce on the mac n cheese, it had a bit of a spiciness to it. 

My grandpa goes out to eat every day, if you ask him how his food is he always says \"okay\". He got the whiskey burger and he said \"oh my god this burger is awesome. This is the best bun I have ever had on a burger\" and he is still talking about it. 

Our waitress Taylor was very nice,  I really wanted to buy I've of the tank tops and she went out of her way to try and find one for me. 

We will definitely be back! Thanks Dierks!"}
{"text":"Worst service, so slow! Ordered chicken wings asked multiple times & they NEVER came out."}
{"text":"Hair in my drink and undercooked burger.  No apology about hair in the drink WHATSOEVER!  She just took it, walked away, and came back with what hopefully was a replacement in a clean glass.  
The whole thing was just weird.  Definitely not going back there."}
{"text":"Was in town for Spring Training and saw this place with friends and decided to head in. First let me tell you the SF Giants flag waving at the front was not an inviting sign.The service was awesome from the energetic hostess up front (forgot her name 3/22 evening) to the attentive bartender Maddie was her name. Her service and demeanor was refreshing on Mill as she was fast and helpful with recommendations (she was present)I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Jordin was a very attentive and friendly server. The food was amazing! I had three BBQ Chicken and subbed for the apple jicama slaw with French flies. The Cow Tipper is my go-to drink! I have not had anything here I didn't like!"}
{"text":"The women bartenders here are awful. They give female customers zero attention. One named Chelsea, walked past my boyfriend and I multiple times for a solid 15 minutes before asking us what we wanted to drink with a disgusting look on her face. But as soon as her friends showed up she was more than willing to pay them attention and get them drinks. No thanks, I'd rather go get a drink at postinos or joyride where the bartenders pay attention to you and actually engage in conversation."}
{"text":"Colleagues and myself had lunch here before leaving PHX a few days ago...we walked in to find only a couple of tables occupied -that might have been the first clue, however it was already around 12:30 pm on a Thursday so we gave them the benefit of the doubt on that one.

The hostess turned out to also be the waitress and the bartender because apparently there was no one else around. It took a good 15-20 minutes before we were able to order drinks, then it took another 15 minutes before they showed up, and that was after I told her we were on a tight deadline to get to the airport.

 We ordered the fried pickles as appetizers - HORRIBLE barely describes them. They had been fried earlier and apparently stuck in the microwave to warm up because the coating was rubbery and greasy. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich - 2 small pieces of grilled chicken with barely a smear of buffalo sauce, the fries - no exaggeration here, had clearly been fried earlier and dunked in oil again. They were oil soaked and dark and definitely not fresh.

The only item that looked vaguely decent was the Quinoa salad, however, one of the girls didn't get her shrimp with it as she ordered and it wasn't until she was done eating that they showed up - they were kind enough not to charge us for them.

Overall very disappointing  - service was lacking, food was bad, not a place I ever plan to set foot in again.  I think Dierks should probably stick to music and leave the food to someone else!"}
{"text":"Southern fries were super good and filling! Our server Carly was super friendly and great!!"}
{"text":"Great country bar in a packed area of college type bars. Had the wings for free thanks to this app. Were really good on their own, sauce was not my style. Bought two camo koozies for a dollar each because I bought a beer!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game but really bad food. Just gross. My husband is not picky and finishes everything on his plate, however, he left his burger half eaten and barely touched the fries (served cold). Honestly, everything just tastes frozen and bad. Maybe get a drink and watch the game but take your appetite elsewhere."}
{"text":"Looking for a bar to go to in Gilbert? Look no further... Whiskey has live entertainment, great food and service that can't be beat. I'll always be here for a great time with great people and an amazing menu. Drinks, food and good times they have the trifecta. Thank you for always being the best."}
{"text":"Update: No fault- my friend went home on his own. The security guard was actually friendly and patient while explaining the surprising new law. In the end, it was a great night! 

***NO ENTRY w/ VERTICAL ID***

Group 15 were denied at entrance (with 2 tables reserved for bottle service). Security claimed there was a \"new law in effect as of 7/24/14

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"}
{"text":"Just visited on my birthday last week, and had a great time. It still can get quite warm inside, even during the cool months, but they bring out fans when it's really bad. You need to get there early to avoid lines cuz it's pretty popular on Fridays. We had friends get there at 4:30 and get us a table for 8, which they didn't allow previously. Service was good--servers made sure we had what we needed before we needed it. Food is about the same--not high end, but it's a bar, after all, and it did the trick. A few items are available at reduced rate during happy hour, including plenty of drink options and apps. We love that we can play games, and I see they've added ping pong tables and a giant Pac-Man, but we didn't play those, just corn hole with a group of guys from PayPal. The bands are always fun, and dancing starts early. It gets kinda crazy on the floor by 10pm or so, and they move tables off the dance floor to make more room. All in all, it's a fun Friday evening with plenty to do and plenty to drink at reasonable prices. They even gave me a bottle of champagne for my birthday :)"}
{"text":"We met some friends on a Wednesday night and had some drinks. The night started out okay but the service was really slow. The night quickly turned to be terrible when food started to come out. Our server was extremely inattentive and never brought us things we asked for. For example our friends asked for ranch FIVE times until she brought it. Additionally, there was something wrong with their burger and they sent it back, they said they were making them a new one and it never came out. My husband asked for a sprite and she brought a lemonade. When it was time for our checks, it took at least 45 min to get our bills. We talked to a manager named Matt who was unprofessional and rude. He basically berated me for complaining and said I was in the wrong. Very disappointed. Hopefully their nightlife is a lot better!"}
{"text":"So I was so excited to come here with my parents to watch the U of A/ASU game. Arrived about an hour before game time and were told it was a 45 minute wait for tables so we put our name down and just went to the bar to grab drinks. First of all, we NEVER got called for our table. Literally ever. They didn't even call to inform us that the wait was longer than anticipated. Strike one there. Thank goodness we found seats at the bar so that we would eat and watch the game. As we're watching the game, this security guard comes up to us and rudely tells us he needs our chairs and starts arguing with my dad. I have never been talked to so rudely and disrespectfully as I have in this situation. Do your security guards think they can talk to people however they want because that surely will make me not want to ever return. Strike two there, I'm glad we left before we could get to strike 3."}
{"text":"Oh man I love this bar. They have Mason jars, Coors light, Mason jars, and lots of pretty girls everywhere. Man I love this place. If you love COUNTRY MUSIC and ENORMOUS TOTS you gotta come here. I guarantee you'll get a blumpkin, I know I did yeehaw!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I happened to stumble past a picture of this bar before our recent trip to Phoenix and immediately looked up reviews. While we were travelling with my parents, the menu looked delicious and it seemed like a unique place to visit. Quite a few people had recently mentioned purchasing a Groupon and so I checked and it was thankfully still available.

Parking was easy for us to find, but it was a Friday at about 12 noon. There are select street spots available but plenty of parkades around per the mall. We were immediately seated and had our choice of booth/table/bar options. We went for a booth for the unique tap service. Unfortunately it wasn't working and the booth was so large we all just crammed down at the end to be able to see/hear each other. It also wasn't the cleanest with dust and mystery debris all over it, but the wall decor and ample tvs are there to keep your eyes busy. I had read about the unisex washroom sinks and had a chuckle as I was at one point joined by a gentleman who wasn't aware and quickly and awkwardly finished zipping up his pants. I made sure my parents were aware for no such surprises for them.

The food here is amazing and wonderfully covers all dietary wishes. My husband loves mac and cheese and there it was. My mom prefers healthy options and went for a chicken wrap with a side of brocolini. My dad and I opted for burgers and the mushroom swiss burger was the best I might have ever had. The lemon arugula made the dish. I tried the deviled potato salad and found it quite good. You need a mint after but it hit the flavours perfectly.

If you check in through Yelp, you also get a free appetizer. We went for the fried pickles as they were most likely to be a hit with the table. We received 5 little spears in a stack, with a delicious ranchy dipping sauce. While they were good, at a reg price of $6, I might recommend skipping them as you're not really getting your money's worth.

Overall, this was the most memorable and enjoyed meal during our trip. My mom talked of it daily and we would have been better off to have enjoyed each meal here. I wouldn't hesitate to return for a meal or to enjoy a little honky tonk fun!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday with my wife and had an amazing time! The food was divine and for a bar was absolutely amazing. Our servers name was Madi I believe and she did amazing. She was very helpful with my wife's food choices and allergy's and came back multiple times to check on us throughout our time. She was very personable and showed lots of food and beer knowledge which was awesome. Definitely will be visiting here often."}
{"text":"We had some great service today and want to compliment our server Bui. Thank you so much for making our visit so nice. See you again."}
{"text":"Music was at a good level. I could converse with my friends without screaming. Great open space with lots of fresh air.  The one thing that was not good was the service at the bar. It was not busy and the bartender was staring into space for a moment then helped others who walked up after me."}
{"text":"I had just moved here from Chapel Hill , NC and didn't know anything about Gilbert . I had a few interviews lined up and had heard all about WR . So I went in around happy hour time and Beth was behind the bar . She was very welcoming and informative about local beers and even told me she had just moved a while back as well . It makes a difference when people are friendly . 

She recommended the pretzels and I believe one of the salads and they were excellent . 

So now every time I come back I visit Beth , whether she's at the main bar or the back bar on the weekends . 

You Rock Girl !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, underserved and poor quality. My chicken salad roll was lettuce and shredded chicken meat with sauce. My friend's patty melt was bread with thousand island dressing, pickles and a patty- no cheese, no mustard or grilled onions. She described it as disgusting. 
The drinks never got refills nor were they offered."}
{"text":"Do NOT, I repeat NOT waste your time. I had a 20% off coupon because I came for lunch and they were closed. Have been trying to use it for a week but something always goes wrong at this location. Took about 15 minutes to find parking, which who cares is no big deal. But then we walk in at 6:50, the security asks us if we are eating dinner and motions us inside. We tell the hostess we have 2 for dinner and she tells us they are not taking anymore names for dinner. At 6:50!!!!!! Why even serve dinner? Done trying with this place."}
{"text":"The venue is pretty cool. Places to sit, play ping pong or bean bag toss. We went on a Saturday night and there was about an hour wait. We grabbed a drink and just people watched till our table was ready. We shared a slider for our appetizer which was absolutely delicious. BUT then our entrees came.  I got the Mac and cheese with chicken. The Mac was super bland and not much to taste and the chicken inside was super dry and no spice or taste. My husband got the chicken and waffles. There was no syrup or sauce so the meal was super dry and well. The waffles were so boring. The chicken came in breaded strips. Needless to say my hubby was completely disappointed especially comparing this to Lolos chicken and waffles across the street. The band was to play at 9 that night but didn't come on till nearly 9:45. The music was good and it did get really crowded so There was no place to sit. Staff was friendly and the place was super clean but will not come back to eat here."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Headed over on a Sunday for brunch.  Our meal was delicious and the Bloody Mary's were excellent!  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  Loved the decor of this place...beautiful use of wood....very open and lots of room.  Wish we could've hung around for the music.  Will definitely be back and we'll bring others!"}
{"text":"I have so ambivalent feelings stepping inside WR. I do like the country of this place, even though it really isn't country at all. Not one bit, it is hip in disguise. Alittle hip hick if you like. Contemporary redneck swank, fashionable country chic or Hollywood hillbilly, I don't know. 

I mean, I had fun here. But it really is an iconoclast and kitsch ripoff of what is praised as country, because none of the clientele would be caught dead in a real country dive. But then again, I might be one of them. Shit, I categorize anyone that vociferate a yee-haw as a degenerate. 

BUT this place is happening and it has some of the standard traits of Scottsdale. One is hot vamps dancing on the bar pouring liquor in peoples mouths for tips. There is a dance floor that mostly contains club-hoppers that too drunk to know what bar they are in. But the overall vibe here is still nicer that most of the Scottsdale arena IMO.

I'd come back here."}
{"text":"This place was fun for being a country bar.  Food was ok but the parking, seating & services sucked. 

Food: we ordered fried Pickens & southern fries.
Pickles were ok- I didn't care for the batter beading though I did love it was pickle spears & not chips.  & the ranch dressing was refreshing. 
Southern fries (I think that is what they are called) - well. The chicken was over cooked to the point it was pasty.  The BBQ sauce tasted like cheap Kraft sauce & thank god we got the blue cheese dressing on the side because it was no bueno.  

Service: so apparently there was a live band playing so they allowed all tables to be reserved 2 hours before the show.   Those of us wanting a quick but was forced to eat at the bar.  The bartenders took 10 min to take my drink order & charged me $10 for 1 kettle One & soda.  When they denied my food they have it to the wrong person next to us. And when we told them, the server just picked up the food from the other person & have it to us.  Gross.. she touched the food! 

Great atmosphere & music but I will not easy there and only drink happy hour specials. Maybe sneak in a flask."}
{"text":"This time of year, Sunday Funday calls to me like a flower to a honey bee. Especially on a 3 day weekend. This time the location was Whiskey Row, which boasts bottomless mimosas and a yummy menu. 
My favorite part of the experience was the huge booth which easily fit our large party. A welcome reprieve from the crazy too-packed atmosphere that I've experienced on weekend nights. I ordered the egg white omelet, which was protein filled, if a little greasy. The mimosas were good to start, though seemed to be mostly orange juice when the refills came around. Please don't skimp on the champagne next time Dierks! 
All in all our group had a good time, and it was a good start to this week's Sunday Funday."}
{"text":"I do love the atmosphere, food and drinks.  Cool comfortable fun, Dierks does it up right!"}
{"text":"A strange start to our day. Walked in. Place is half full. Told there is a 15-30 minute wait. No big deal but the irony was they sat us in the booth that was vacant from the get go.

Our drink order was taken however forgot. When our server came back to get our brunch order she seemed oblivious that she forgot the drinks.

The three of us ordered different items. I had the all American cheeseburger but sub'd the American cheese for cheddar and added bacon. I ordered it medium rare. It came well done. One bite was pure salt. The fries were good but they were stingy on the ketchup.

Second order was a whiskey burger. No bun was requested and instead to be wrapped in lettuce. Burger delivered with bun. Sent back and they brought it out just on the plate as they have no full leafs of lettuce there. Only chopped. The least  they could have done was put the burger then on a mound of lettuce but nope they didn't. Additionally the burger was devoid of the bbq sauce and onions.

Lastly ordered was the breakfast sandwich. It looked amazing when it was delivered although my friend ordered the egg fried hard and it came medium (still runny yoke) she sent it back to have the egg cooked longer. They sent a replacement egg done no better than the first time.  She chose not to wait and rather eat the sausage and cheese with the brioche bun.

I'm sure they have the potential to get orders right here and I will give them second try on another trip. Let's just chalk this up to a hungover staff. It was a Sunday late breakfast time and the Cardinals did play the night before."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday lunch with my family of four. It took ten minutes to get a table, not bad. Once we got seated, the server was over immediately to take our drink orders and then our food orders. After that, it went downhill. It took thirty minutes to get our appetizer pretzel! Our server would walk by our table and completely ignore us--even when we purposely tried to get her attention! It took a full hour to get our burgers! They weren't busy at all. As soon as we were done, she was right over to give us our bill, though! I'd hate to see them when they are busy."}
{"text":"Come for the booze....not the food....fun atmosphere and the bartenders are very nice.  Good bourbon selection....."}
{"text":"Fun environment. Prices are a little high, food is good. The free music and going on a weekend is the best."}
{"text":"Came with a large party of 24 people for my coed bachelor/bachelorette party. Fun environment but on a busy Saturday night they only had 4 bartenders working. 30 minutes went by and we still hadn't even got a drink yet. We just stood there at bar waiting and waiting to get a bartender, nothing! The actual bar itself is huge so that leaves hardly any standing room for guests so everywhere I stood felt like I was in a walk way.  We called our party bus driver and told him this place wasn't for us and we left to another place that ended be much more fun, roomier and quick to get a drink in hand."}
{"text":"Not giving this a one star only because the service before cocktail hour was good. Came here at about 5 pm on a Saturday for a friends 40. We've never been so we wanted to jump on the bandwagon. ordered drinks at the bar and then got seated for our dinner. I got the wings but they were heavily salted so I couldn't enjoy them. So not worth $12. Could have gotten better wings from a pizza place for 1/2 that price. Our waitress was great and friendly. Cocktail hour came and it all went down hill from there. We only saw her one time that night and that was when she introduced herself and order our drinks. She came back with our drinks and then she vanished. Didn't see her for 45 minutes so we decided to close our tabs and go to another bar. Had to go to the bar and request our tabs to be closed because our waitress was MIA. the couldn't close them because she had our id's and cards with her?!?!?! After waiting for a grand total of one hour she magically appeared to close our tabs. terrible service, overpriced beverages, and overcrowded. I won't ever return to this tourist trap. I've gotten way better service at dive bars for less money."}
{"text":"Pricey but i enjoyed the chicken and waffles! Solid beer list, but mostly the basics are covered.  Good service.  No reason to go out of your way but you'd enjoy if you went."}
{"text":"We had Such a Great time at Dierks Bentley's !! 
The food was Great! Hot! delivered fast, large portions. The server was awesome. So attentive, the entire staff we dealt with were great.
We got a free shot ! The Music was awesome. This place has it going on.
It is noisy...but if you want quiet, this is not your place. So glad Dierks is in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Aimee, our server, is awesome!  This is a GREAT place to watch games!  This is my new hang out for Broncos games #broncosnation"}
{"text":"So we got there at opening on a Saturday morning at 10 AM. We were there for brunch. They weren't ready for us. They were still cleaning from the night before there was cleaning supplies sitting everywhere and they were filling helium balloons right near our table which was very loud and distracting. We asked for two of their signature big ass bloody Mary's for $12 apiece and the bar was not ready to make them as they were still cleaning and prepping for the afternoon bar rush. We got them about 20 minutes later without much of the fruit or olives - which came later. The Bloody Mary's are their own specialty concoction, and while I love a great Bloody, I could live the rest of my life happily without having this one again!  $24 for two regular sized strange tasting Bloody Mary's. 

For breakfast we had the big ass breakfast for nine dollars and this breakfast was terrific. The eggs were done right bacon is crispy and  it was very good and came out quickly. We asked for salt pepper and they had one set in the restaurant and it came out to the table covered in some red sticky substance that was very gross. We had them clean them off and we got them back about five minutes later. 

Overall it seemed like their brunch was a very forced affair and that they really didn't even want us there as they still had a lot of work to do to get the bar ready for another evening of country-western heavy drinking party fun.   As a clue to us, we were the only patrons in the restaurant for the 45 minutes that we were there.  Our question is, why even have a breakfast?"}
{"text":"Unless you want to spend 2 hours for one drink and an appetizer, go across the street. While I understand growing pains, after 2 weeks one would think these issues would be somewhat resolved! Waiting 45 minutes for cold fries and fried pickles is a joke! Awful!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Whiskey Row for my birthday!!!
Ate the fried chicken, AMAZING!! One of the best fried chicken meals I've had in a while.
Though the drinks were delicious, they weren't as strong as what I'd hoped for. 
Left Whiskey Row without even a buzz. 
But all in all I had a great experience and will definitely be back!

Thanks Dierks Bentley for making a great country bar in the city!!!"}
{"text":"Today I went into the restaurant for an early dinner and I ordered the mushroom burger. Awesome. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly and the aioli was to die for. Secondly my server, Alex, was more than happy to help. I must've asked her 1000 questions. Long story short, she was the best server I've ever had! She was extremely friendly and personable. I'm looking forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"great food  and good service definitely a nice bar with a lot of action"}
{"text":"Friday we arrived @ 8 planning to eat and then move forward with the \"planned table service\". We were seated approximately 10 min. Once seated I swear we were forgotten about. Before we knew it, it was almost 9 and not even waters! The tool who \"arranged\" our table service apologized and said he was gonna bring shots... twice. Eventually a server got involved and I mentioned the shots. My woman told them we want to order food and she wanted to start drinking now. At that point it would have made sense to simply inform us, that's not possible. Shots finally arrived and they did bring some complimentary appetizers and eventually informed us that the bottle service can't start till 9:30. So at 9:30 I'm like... hey what are you waiting for. Then they let us know the food all had to be removed from the table for this to take place. Laying all of this out ahead of time, sure would have been WAY BETTER! They actual bottle service finally started around 9:50PM. Also it was mentioned that part of this guy's job was to let your guests know to throw some money down. As far as I can tell, not a word was mentioned. The food was good and the server was very attentive once her job finally started. However as a whole, it was a major disappointment. I hope my one time contribution of $350 was worth me never going back..."}
{"text":"Had a blast at Whiskey Row in Gilbert this weekend.  Started there for brunch, the $20 bottomless mimosa special was great!!  The food was just okay, but to be expected.  The place is great though!  Bright lighting, cool indoor games, and a nice waitstaff. Live country music was AWESOME!!  We came back later in the night and it was like a completely different place!!  I didn't love waiting in line to get in, but we got there around 10pm.  There were no tables and the place was packed so we had to wait for drinks.  Ended up leaving and coming back around midnight; the country music was gone and it had a very \"clubby\" vibe but still very fun!!  Lots of dancing and music; great time!"}
{"text":"First and last time I will be visiting this establishment. Management is a joke. I recently visited this location with some out of town friends. They were in town for the baseball game and decided they wanted to check out this place as we are huge country music fans. I was the designated driver as I wanted my friends to enjoy themselves. We hadn't been there to long, maybe 30 min or so. It was a little after 8:30 and we were hungry, of course the kitchen was no longer open. We ordered a couple beers and shots (I had water the entire time I was there). I wasn't feeling well and went to the restroom. (I had been struggling with a migraine all afternoon but powered through since my guests were only here for the night) There were a couple female servers in there. I did vomit and of course felt much better afterwards. When I came out the \"manager\", some kid who was probably about 15 years younger than me was waiting outside the ladies room, asked me how I was feeling. At first I thought, wow that's nice of him... until he told me I had to leave the establishment because I had vomited. He said they can't have people vomiting in their establishment because I'm either drunk (which clearly i was not), or sick and therefore could get other guests sick as well. I didn't know a migraine was contagious... or what if I was pregnant. I didn't feel I had to explain myself and \"beg\" to stay at this location. I was extremely embarrassed and very mad. I went back to my friends and they were just as upset. Mind you none of my friends were drunk or anything as we had just arrived to that location. The manager was a complete joke even when one of my friends tried to politely explain to him that he was in the wrong. I expected more from this location. Needless to say we won't be visiting this location ever again. We of course went to another bar and managed to spend quite a bit of money there and had a great time."}
{"text":"Had a really great time with the wife on completely unplanned visit. 

Showed up the Saturday after the beer fest at maya (which was awful). 

Was able to catch the end of the Nebraska game (had no idea the bar was a Big Red bar) which is always fun and hung out till about 11. 

Drink prices and selection was great, music was a nice mix of country and top 40 and crowd was hype but not too young."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to have some appetizers. We got 2 orders of the chicken wings, the mac and cheese, fries, a veal meatball slider and a fried chicken slider with apple jicama slaw.

The wings were deep fried and topped with whiskey hot sauce which was a little spicy and a little sweet. It came with a side of Bleu cheese dressing and carrots. These are crispiest wings I've ever had. They weren't dry; they were pretty moist underneath. Good flavor too. 

The mac and cheese was really good. The pasta was mixed in a 3 cheese blend with green chilies and sun dried tomatoes and topped with bacon bread crumbs. The flavor was great and it was so creamy and delicious.

The veal meatball slider was good. A little soft though; it almost tasted like a veggie chicken meatball. It was topped with a tomato marmalade and smoked provolone cheese. Not bad.

The fried chicken slider was good. It was a fried chicken breast topped with an apple jicama slaw. Pretty good.

Our waitress was really cute and really nice. If you're looking for a good bar with a good atmosphere and good food, check this place out."}
{"text":"I went to this organization for the soft opening.  The bartender lost my credit card, 6 days later the card was falsely charged aka fraud and my card was actually given to another patron.  I called once received my bill realizing the problem the manager Jade told me it would be taken care of and offered me a free app.  Got my credit card bill the following month and not only was the charge not removed but I received a late fee because that was the only charge on it.  I then proceeded to call and got the run around and told to actually call my credit card company itself excepting 0 blame for the incident.  I went into the organization showing them the statement because they accused me of lying and they said they must look into.  I asked for the GM he never came out.  I highly recommend to be very cautious if here late at night and make sure bills are accurate and receive accurate credit card back with name on it.  This is the worst customer service and experience I have ever received at any restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Been at this part out for 20 minutes and haven't even gotten barely just got a glass of water or is not even that busy there this place is having issues for sure"}
{"text":"Now this is a Must Try and a Cool experience overall!!  First time and we were amazed to see that they have 4 taps of beer and a hard liquor at each table you sit at, different taps at each table.  You pay by the ounce of beer or liquor you dispense, so remember to pace yourself lol, oh and you can reserve tables if you have a preference of liquor.  Tried the Grilled cheese with bacon and an egg (AMAZING), fried pickly burger was very tasty and I loved the Vanilla Bean Lemonade drink, unusual but refreshing. A unique experience unlike any other and overall very friendly and welcoming staff, GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"This place was cool, Ill probably go back at some point. It was a bit crowded but it was a big place and I never had to wait long to get my drink which was awesome. The music was good. The only thing I thought was kind of dumb was the bottle service and blocking off sitting areas for these people. Save that for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I just wanted to write a review about the bar tenders that served us. Amanda was amazing. very helpful and nice. She was talkative, fast and went above and beyond. There was another bartender working and I really wish I knew HER name for this review. She was the biggest bitch alive. People like Amanda make you realize great hard workers! Thank you Amanda!"}
{"text":"Went out on Sunday for date night with my boyfriend 
we had the rings and fingers with plenty of side dipping sauces and each of us had double Tito's doubles were generous pours, and the staff were quite attentive. 
Fantastic establishment our bartender Chloe was wonderful she truly made the evening fantastic and quite memorable, great sense of humour"}
{"text":"Had the absolute worst experience here. We signed up for the taco crawl and this as one of the stops. We asked the hostess to be put on a wait list for a table because we wanted to get some food and drinks. There were 4 or so tables open and she said they had some reservations but there was a 20 minute wait but because we were part of the taco crawl we couldn't have a table. I explained again that we wanted to buy food and drinks, our 2 little tacos we had at other stops were not enough and we wanted to try this place. She told us we absolutely could not be on the list because they don't give tables to taco crawl people. They clearly have enough business don't want my business. I don't understand why they even participate in the crawl if they don't want people to spend money at their establishment. They shouldn't even sign up."}
{"text":"Let me first preface some of my comments. I am a huge Dierks Bentley fan and actually flew out from DC to AZ to meet with some friends who surprised me by reserving a table and coming out to Whiskey Row. I not only wanted to like this bar, but I wanted to LOVE IT! Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, or perhaps since I went on opening weekend (July 5th) some of the kinks hadn't been hashed out. 

We reserved a table for 10pm- which me and my friend's husband were eager to try to the beer tap that came with the table. We were a bit early so we went to the bar to order a drink. I looked at the beer list which was decent but by no means extensive. I was told that they were out of the beer that I ordered (First weekend open and you're already out of stock...?) so I simply ordered another beer. Drinks were reasonably priced with beer being around $6 a glass. Coming from DC, this seemed fairly reasonably priced. 

We were brought to our table where the waitress explained to us how the table would be charged. We had a $200 minimum and then would be charged for and then anything else purchased (either bar drinks or from the tap) would be added on top of that price. There is a electronic monitor that is supposed to identify for your how much you are spending. Unfortunately, a couple of things at our table weren't working. The electronic monitor was tracking someone else's table and our table tap didn't work, which to us, eagerly wanting to use the tap, made the table far less appealing. I requested that we could be released from the table obligation given the issues, but we weren't allowed to but they did reduce our minimum down to $150, although we made the price up by not being able to track the cost of our spending with the broken monitor. 

So there's the bad, but there is PLENTY of good. The atmosphere and setup is great. The band on top of the bar was amazing. The music was live and all country. Totally topnotch. Perhaps a bit too loud, but I think that'll eventually get sorted-out. The table (if it was working) was fun especially since it was Foosball table. 

Overall it was fun--- I'd go back and try it again. However, given the issues, I'd probably forgo the table."}
{"text":"Had a great time at whiskey Row... went I. With an old friend and ended up making new friends before the night was over! Friendly staff and patrons. Had dinner and drinks, everything was delicious. Would return again for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for Lunch with co-wokers great place LOTS of TV's and open space. We sat at the bar and the waitress was on it! I believe her name was Dani. Had the Grilled Chicken Breast with Broccolini Succotash it was really good! look forward to trying a few more things off the menu"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there. . . the Bartender is soo into her self and flirting, that she doesn't have time to wait on women.. the waitress got order wrong and reluctantly changed it. there were 8 people there. . .Such Amateur help, food is good and the atmosphere is better. . . Improve your help~~!!! I will not edit my review.. it should be worse!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was even better! 
Cheyenne had a bright and bubbly personality and she topped it all off with a gorgeous smile! 
She was super fun, service was on point and she made some great recommendations on food."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and took such great care of us! Then there's the excellent food AND music"}
{"text":"Service is terrible... sitting at the bar and still can't get a refill... Maybe someone will see this and tell them we would like a refill."}
{"text":"We tried to check this place out after dinner, and it was very crowded. Stood by a table for a bit and service was not helpful. We actually left after trying to get a drink for several minutes. This might be a good place for the young college crowd but it was definitely not a good fit for us."}
{"text":"This is a review for their OUTSTANDING brunch.  I haven't been there at night yet.

The food is way better than you'd expect.  My friend and I both took pictures of our food ... that's how good it looked ... and it tasted even better.  Try the Breakfast Sandwich. YUM!

Their servers are incredibly nice.  Plus they have an amazing mimosa deal for brunch.  $12 for bottomless.  So good.  As a side note, we were impressed how clean the place was.  We imagine they had to clean up a fair amount from the crazy night before.

I feel like it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting packed on the weekends.  For now, it's a nice change of pace from RnR's weekend brunch party."}
{"text":"Over priced. The ONLY bar in Gilbert over charges!!! DON'T GO HERE. Save money and go to Tempe"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service and service ever. The manager is rude condescending and disrespectful to paying customer. Find another great bar to go to! Stay away from here. 
Matt the manager is horrible and disrespectful."}
{"text":"I've only been to Dierks for happy hour or before the start of a night out in Old Town. They've got special dishes for fairly cheap on Happy hour that are different to their normal appetizers. Last time we were here we got the small mac and cheese and the bbq wings. The mac and cheese was pretty good, not a lot of cheese sauce. I'm not sure what kind of cheese they use, but it wasn't very sharp or pungent which may be good depending on your tastes. We've shared the regular wings before but went for the bbq wings this time, but both agreed we prefer the regular wings. The BBQ sauce wasn't our favorite (bit sweet) and the regular wings are \"naked\" with the sauce on the side. 
One of my favorite reasons for coming here is that they have Magic Hat #9 in bottles, which not many places have it. Hopefully they don't take it off the bar menu like Zipps did late last year! Overall, great place for happy hour, especially if you love country music! The food I've had here is pretty good for bar food. I saw someone bring their dog here too which is nice to see a dog friendly bar!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, nothing special. If you want good food look elsewhere, if you want to be surrounded by buckle bunnies and cowboys who have never been on a farm then this is your spot!"}
{"text":"We actually came here because of the wait everywhere else. This is a review I will leave open to another visit! Food was decent (mine was good, but Kelly didn't like hers so we swapped), service was great (my drink was constantly filled). I will leave this review as fair for right now but open because the atmosphere was great! I'll try it again and update my review
so stay tuned campers......
\"Mystery Leet\" out....."}
{"text":"Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row is the latest and newest place to open in Old Town Scottsdale. It's basically a sports bar / nightclub with a country music theme. 

Like most entertainment establishments in Scottsdale the servers are exclusively very attractive females and at Whiskey Row they are attired in outfits that you would normally see at Country Thunder - tight t-shirts, cutoff jeans shorts, and cowboy boots. Guys will enjoy the view.

While the theme is good old country music, the food and beverages are anything but old fashioned. The menu includes burgers, salads, shrimp, flat iron steak, grilled cheese, and chicken breasts. 

As for the drinks, Whiskey Row has installed the latest system where each table, and even the foosball table, has a set of taps serving alcohol and beer so you can refill your drinks at your convenience. Just order what you want from the computer screen at each table, use your credit card to pay for it and drink away. I doubt it unlimited though, other places that use this system limit you to a specific number of refills before the servers have to reauthorize you to get more, so you can't just sit there and get hammered.

Also, because the drinks are served in this manner they are charged by the ounce rather than by the glass. 

And, if you really want to do shots of whiskey the fun way, there is a dentist-type chair by the entrance that tilts back and allows you to have whiskey poured straight down your gullet. I have a feeling that's going to be quite popular with the Scottsdale clientele.

Whiskey Row features a combination of live music and a DJ, but it will all be country. The band will perform on a stage that is suspended above the bar and there is a small dance floor next to the bar as well. 

They are also showing the UFC fights and at least for the most recent one, they did not charge a cover which is a good deal if you like that sport.

I predict that this is going to be a very popular new addition to the Scottsdale nightlife lineup"}
{"text":"Great food. Live the sliders. But only 3 stalls for women. When it gets busy, it's a nightmare."}
{"text":"Finally a place in Old Town where I know the words to the songs (in stark contrast to the techno madness I hear everywhere else).
I really like this place. The J.I.M.B.O. redneck cocktail is a new fave of mine. Wish they'd bottle it in inconspicuous packaging so I could have it all the time. 
The Southern fries made my life. I have been thinking about them for days now. Soooo good. 
Love the open, airy layout of the place. Very laid back. 
For Scottsdale, of course."}
{"text":"Really yummy food I got the steak and the artichoke dip. Highly recommend those dishes. The only thing I didn't like which took away from my 5 star review was that it is unbelievably hot in the summer time when it's 110+ degrees on one side of the bar. They don't have the ability to close any windows so they just have window shades going down but it's still very hot so I could not imagine dancing in that. I know they have those big fans but I know being a girl you get ready for the day or night you don't want your makeup dripping down your face or your hair messed up. But I do love this location and I do love how big it is compared to the one in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and a large selection of beers and whiskey, what's not to love?

A true American country bar with appropriate decor and music playing in the background, something that I feel is a fresh look at a sports bar.

I had the Mac & Cheese burger with a side of fries and it was fantastic. The bottomless coke help wash it down and I was in and out in an hour - perfect for a tasty lunchtime break."}
{"text":"I've been here during the day for appetizers at lunch... and I've been here on a Saturday night, where we have had table service.

So it's interesting, during a day this is very much a restaurant bar... while at night it's more of a club/bar.

Which is great depending on what you're looking for... me? I'm more of a bar guy, than a club guy as I love a good conversation, good food, good drinks, and lots of laughs. Bars = not great for conversation... but great for getting up on the dance floor!

This place is great because it's close... and if you live in the east valley, you don't have to drive to Tempe or to Scottsdale.

Food - Serviceable food... I've only had appetizers for sort of a tapas style lunch and it was fine, nothing that stood out.

Service - Good service and it seems like they emphasize a pretty and capable wait staff... very attentive with regards to drinks and food.

Price - The pricing was what you would expect for a place in downtown Gilbert these days... fair value here.

The three stars is really with regards to personal preference... again being a bar guy vs a club guy... this isn't a place I would necessarily go but if you are looking for a place to dance and have some fun - this place is worth considering."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about clubs/bars... but they are so incredibly inept about getting bottle service!

So here's the scoop... I reserved a table a week and a half out for the girlfriend's birthday. First question, what package do you want? Got it. Second question, what time would you like to arrive? How about 9? 

NOPE. Sorry, we don't start service until 10. OK, fine, 10pm then.

I get there at 9pm and say that I'm there and that I'll come back at 10pm to start service as agreed upon. I come back at 10pm and they use their walkies to say get table ready and to wait by front for host. No host... no host... no table... 30 minutes go by (I'm just conversing with my party keeping them occupied at front). I ask again, are they coming? Oh, yeah, call again... no host, no host... no table. Another 30 minutes roll by. So now it is 11:00pm. Finally I get pissed and ask where my damn table is at.

Oh, OK, here it is. I get seated at 11:30pm. Awesome, now I have 2 hours and 30 minutes to drink a 30 pack and a bottle instead of 5 hours as I wanted (9pm). Half my party has already drank on their own tab and doesn't want to drink the bottle service.

Awesome. Another little nugget of joy is that when I am patiently waiting I see that there is actually indeed bottle service at some of the tables. So why tell me 9 is not available?

Also, some bottle of champagne got added to the service despite nobody drinking the table items that were already there. Not sure if someone ordered it without me or if DB thought it'd be a nice gesture to give it to me and charge me anyways? (If DB just lets anyone in the party put a bottle of champagne on MY tab, that is interesting too).

The only two things that were positive were that while we were waiting over an hour for the table, they came and gave my entire party a free shot. Secondly, everyone enjoyed their time there. Despite these fun items the facts still remain... I got seated way late... I didn't get the package I ordered a week prior... and worst of all instead of the party enjoying a table on my dollar they had to buy their own drinks most of the night.

Bottom line is that bottle service is a premium service. And to me being seated hours after me desired time and over an hour after the agreed time is just unacceptable. Dierk's is a good party place... but I felt like I was just a cash-cow patron. So long as they got me my table SOMETIME during the night, they could charge me the full package price. I get the feeling that unless you are buddy-buddy with the owners/servers/bouncers and come every week and get bottle service that you are going to get yanked around. This is generally my experience in Scottsdale and now here at Dierks.

One last note is that if you're looking for a country bar - this isn't it. I'm not sure I heard much country at all."}
{"text":"Seriously, why in the heck am I updating this review when I vowed to never come back here after blacklisting this place. Well, as you have it I went to Scottsdale last weekend and the group outvoted me so I played along (not without a drunken rant about how anywhere in Scottsdale is better than Whiskey Row).

In general, my opinion still stands of Whiskey Row. There was still three lines but this time we did get in. And as you have it we did try to grease our way in but were denied (just so you know, the going rate is +$20 per person). Just for the record I wanted no part in greasing my way into an establishment that I didn't want to go into anyways but my group tried anyways - you know how much more alcohol you can buy for $20 at some of the \"less popular\" places in Scottsdale? Yeah, I know that I sound like an alcoholic so leave me alone.

In any case we did get in. The place is a swamp both figuratively and literally. When I was finally admitted in I headed straight for the restroom. First off, line for the dudes. Not many places can claim this but WR does it quite well. Always a line, and this is of course completely true for the ladies too. My girlfriend reported that the women's bathroom was flooded. Gross. Nothing like a bunch of catty broads swimming their way through the bathroom - hope you wore a miniskirt and not your $200 boot cut  jeans! In short I can't believe that Whiskey Row has such a small bathroom. No thanks.

The dance floor is an absolute joke. JOKE. It is nothing more than a clusterfuck and I am pretty sure I have more room in my family room than this dance floor. Add in everyone hammmered drunk and this is a bonafide disaster. No thanks.

Once out of the bathroom we tried to get a drink at the bar. Nope. Slow service. And not only that... no Coors or Budweiser. What the hell? Where the hell am I? how the hell do you not have those two domestics... not even in bottle? WTF? What the hell is everyone drinking in here - catfish water? No thanks.

In short, there is still nothing appealing to me about this place - you have long waits to get in, the dance floor is one of the worst (even for bullshit dancing, much less country dancing), the bar is slow, the bar is dry, the bathrooms are dirty, and the drink prices aren't all that appealing. The only thing this place has going for it is that it plays country - and I love country.

Final result - this place is on my perma-perma ban list. If my party wants to go here they can but I'll go somewhere else by myself before going back in here."}
{"text":"One of my go-to areas no matter where I am in the valley! I can't tell you how their food is, but dancing there any night of the week is a blast. Thursday nights are best for country western dancing, and Friday/ Saturday nights they add in a little pop music.
This is a bar is targeted at a younger crowd, so if you are looking for traditional country dancing, this probably isn't the place for you. It gets too crowded for line dancing or two stepping. But, if you like other music or country with more of a beat, then you will enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"This review is for 0 stars but it won't let me write unless I leave at least 1 star. Never got served both times we went in mid-day, no crowd. I'll never go in another DB restaurant.  On the up side, now I know where not to go."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  It wasn't what we were expecting.  But the food was delicious.  The wife and I both had pulled pork.  Very tasty.  Great place to grab a bite and a beer."}
{"text":"I love this place!
I had the turkey pretzel melt and it was awesome.  My coworker seemed to like her salad, and for dessert we had the warm skillet brownie.  Great lunch!  Can't wait to come back for happy hour.  The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The service here is less than good. We sat for 40 min before we could flag our waitress down to order our food. Menu is small with not much options. Had the steak salad. It was ok. Nothing memorable."}
{"text":"I was excited to come check out Whiskey Row...And unfortunately I am not impressed.  It was rather douchey, not very country and just lacked any kind of appealing ambiance.  The bright yellow lights on the wall spelling \"TIP IT ON BACK\" were rather glaringly annoying.  The bartenders were not very pleasant, charming or energized.  I had one beer with my friend as we watched two 'interesting' bachelorette parties, some drunk golfers, and some other random gals wearing tutus...like I said not exactly country.  After that we decided it was time to move on to the next watering hole...not sure this spot is for me."}
{"text":"Great place! Cheyenne was our server. She was friendly, cute and provided exceptional service.  Food was awesome, great beer and drink selection, very nice atmosphere. I recommend the chicken and waffles with a 94' Chevy Redneck drink on the side."}
{"text":"After a negative experience at this bar, I was contacted by multiple persons including the General Manager in order to help resolve my issue. After an initial negative impression I am extremely satisfied with how the management handled the situation and was compensated well beyond my expectation. 

While any business can have an occasional issue with staff, it is clear that the people in charge of the business legitimately care about their customers."}
{"text":"Received an email from the new manager telling me he was sorry for the horrible service we experienced 7 months earlier. Hey things happen and sometimes places have off days. We went on 12/28 to have some drinks and dinner. After being ignored by 2 bartenders who wanted to chit chat and wait on patrons on \"their schedule\" we decided to call it a night at Dierks Bentley's and spent almost $300 at Clever Koi and had an amazing time. There are way too many places to go and have a great time in Gilbert to accept sub-par to terrible service."}
{"text":"This place is new so with any new bar, the crowd can define it.  Lots of tv's and good for groups if you grab one of their tables with taps at the table.  Curious how they are going to make it work with the band stage above the bar so people can see them play...

Bartenders are still learning the ropes apparently. Mine messed up my John Daly...all tea..when I asked for more lemonade she spilt half the drink trying to add lemonade and then transferring it into another glass.  My buddy saw another bartender drop a bottle on the dirty plastic mat behind the bar and then pick it up and didn't wipe it down or anything and just put it back.  

I'll give a few more chances but 1st impressions say...it needs work."}
{"text":"1st visit last night was amazing. The food was good and the service was great. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Gave it another chance after they reached out to me following my feedback. Had a great experience this time around. I think now that it's been opened longer, they've been able to fix some of the kinks.  Popular spot in downtown Gilbert and its gets very busy!   Looking forward to going back with some coworkers."}
{"text":"Awesome place cool scenery. Cold Whiskey, Hot girls and badass country music.what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We came here for a few drinks before, snooze. I am new to the Valley and the service was great, I'm down to visit when they have a band playing. Cheers"}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food. lots of drink choices. Lively. Attractive staff. But generally too crowded for my taste, especially on weekend nights."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I am rating Dierks the club, not the restaurant.

My group decided to get a table because they heard the line was long on the weekends. We arrived at 9pm and the line was from Gilbert all the way to the back of the building. It was not moving. The VIP/table line wasn't really moving either.

When we finally got in the table wasn't ready so it took something like 15min to set up. We got a keg for $250 if you're wanting to know prices.

The live music is OK. I think the music/acoustics are pretty shit (not necessarily the band). The dance floor is good - about as big as the Tempe location and better than Scottsdale but not as good as a place such as Denims. Every so often the band will stop and they will play recorded music (country line dances and hip-hop) which is welcome for line dances and whatnot. Lots of room to move around.

The tables all remained the whole time we were there so there was plenty of seating but it just felt weird. If you've ever attended a country concert think of being in the crowd but you have to bob and weave around a bunch of dinner tables to get back to your friends or get to the dance floor. Just feels weird.

I did order the fried pickles and the sweet tater fries. Tater fries came out cold but were still good. The fried pickles were the spear style and I didn't care for it at all. You take one bite and the whole spear comes out of the breading. I MUCH prefer the slices.

Dierks as a whole is a mixed bag.

Scottsdale location: Not country at all. Dance floor is small and the bathroom line goes through the dance floor. Bouncers are shitbags.
Tempe Location: Country earlier in the night. Always seem to have some UFC event going on until 10pm, then it turns into a club. Annoying. Bathroom line also goes through the dance floor. Nevertheless it has the best layout of the three Dierks.
Gilbert Location: totally feels like a restaurant that oddly has music playing. Layout is crap - one side is music blaring while on the other side you can't even see the stage (you have to watch it on the TV). Bathroom is not through dance floor. Massive line seemingly all night.

If you want a more country experience you're better off going to Denims or going to a concert at Ak-Chin."}
{"text":"Gave this spot a try since it recently opened--nice bar and atmosphere..Food was sp-so and nothing to write home to mom about but would definitely come back for drinks"}
{"text":"Food was good. 
Service could only be slower if it went backward.  Server never offered a second round on any of our drinks. Initially refused to break our bill into more than 4 checks even though we are 11 people.  Come on folks-this is 2018.  Your computer will do that for you. 
It took literally more than 45 minutes to get the checks. 
Can I give a rating lower than 1 star?"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible customer service. Like when I say terrible I mean the worst I've ever experienced. They are in chaos. We waited 20 minutes no waitress acknowledged us. I got up went to bar and asked the bartender if we had a server. She said she would check and turned around and started pouring drinks and never checked. We waited 15 minutes and still not one server or anyone stopped at our table. We got up and walked out. 5 people and they had no idea we were there. Lol.  Pretty amazing. On leaving a girl who appeared to be like 14 years old said she was the manager and apologized. I thought she was kidding about he manager part. She had very strange eye liner on and black hair she looked like she was maybe a hostess. But manager. That's the problem right there. This girl has no business being a manager."}
{"text":"A fun atmosphere that is full of people of all ages and backgrounds. There is a good amount of room and the bartenders are very nice. Drinks are priced typically for a Scottsdale bar.
I plan to go back."}
{"text":"Never been to a Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row before. As I am a fan of him, thought I'd try it. I was told they have games there too like corn hole, life size checkers, etc. Well, not the case at this location. Apparently, the Tempe location has games but not here. Wanting to hangout and have fun while eating today a little disappointed. I'm not sure why one location has things that others don't. But, I stayed and ordered food. I ordered the kale and quinoa salad ($9). You can add chicken for $4 but I chose not to. I misread the menu an s thought it said grape tomatoes. Not the case, it was real grapes. I picked them out and filled a whole plate with them. Ugh. It was already covered in lemon dressing that was good. However, they then cover it in pesto as well. Complete dressing overload. It was supposed to have mix greens too. I guess one, yes literally one (see the picture) piece of romaine lettuce is considered mixing other greens in too. Lol! Oh, and the quinoa was no where in sight. The manager stopped by to ask how the food was and I asked him if the salad was supposed to have quinoa. He said yes it's in there. I eat quinoa often, it wasn't there. I paid $9 for basically drenched kale with probably 2 tiny pieces of feta. Rip off. My daughter ordered chicken fingers and fries. I took a bite. The chicken outside batter was delicious. Unfortunately, the meat was so dry that I struggled to swallow the one bite and she only ate her fries and struggled to finish just 1 chicken strip out of 5. She asked for BBQ sauce to try to help with the dryness. That tasted sour so she didn't go beyond one dip. Then when I got the bill I realized that I was charged $0.50 for the BBQ sauce. Considering your ordering chicken strips and usually people use sauce especially BBQ, I was confused. But hey it's $0.50 so I just blew it off. The caveat was a 'tech fee' of 3% of your bill that I was charged. Due to my bill it was only $0.74.  When I asked the server what that was I was told that it was for their computer systems. Why should I be charged or have to pay for their computer systems? I'm there to eat food. Again, confused. I paid the bill and when the server brought my change back she handed me the book with it. Well, she shorted me $1.75. I will NEVER go back there. Not only was I charged for ridiculous items but I was robbed. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Had reservations for a 6pm dinner, told at the door by a high and mighty hostess, families not allowed, no one under 21 in the dining room.  What kind of a place is this??? Not one of the 4 Yelp reminders , not the website, said there was an age limit on dining at this establishment!  My 2 cents, skip this place, they don't want customers, they just want drunks! DB NEEDS TO STICK TO MUSIC!"}
{"text":"My brother was brutally attacked by the security guards of whiskey row then brutally beat by the Scottsdale and maricopa county police all over trying to get into the bar because of his white air forced ones wasn't allowed at this bar. We will be fighting this and will be pressing charges."}
{"text":"Had a great time with a friend, Staff was very friendly! Food was amazing! Wish there was avocado on the chicken Cobb salad though !"}
{"text":"Bar and food is awesome!!!!  Make sure to belly up with Gabby, Chloe and Robert.  Best bartenders ever. Shot ski is always available!!!"}
{"text":"Told to wait for 40 minutes that turned into 120 minutes. There were lots of empty tables for our entire wait. Seems like the front of the house isn't managed ( this was a Thursday night, very busy) and left to the college girl staff. 
Food was fairly good, my chicken (on a salad) was kinda dry and my wife had a dry pork chop. The table service was great. And I loved the beer selection.
Give them a couple more weeks and they might have their act together."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, a crown royal on the rocks is $13 at whiskey row; $11 at bottled blonde....guesstimating $9 at Bev.  Post shortly.   $13 at bevy.  Moral of story.,.......drink at bottle blonde!!!!"}
{"text":"We loved it here !!!! The happy hour is the best ! good tasty appetizers and the redneck cocktail spring fling is the tastiest drink ever ! 
We came here for our friends birthday and we had a blast ! good atmosphere , good music !!! Most def we will be back !!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and had made a reservation for 7 and when we showed up, they had not saved my reservation. The whole point of a reservation is to know that you have somewhere to go to eat which can be difficult with 7 people on a Saturday night. On top of that, the hostess was rude and unaccommodating. If you have a big group, look into a different restaurant."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best restaurant on Mill! Great food and great service!  

Haley is awesome! Super cute too"}
{"text":"i'm normally not one to write reviews but the service i got at whiskey row today was absolutely outstanding. our server katelyn was fantastic. she was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  her customer service was outstanding it really made me want to come back! i ordered the steak salad with a water and it was pretty good! the atmosphere in the building was very cool too. the open concept is great this time of year in arizona. all in all i was very happy with my visit i'll definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the \"go to bar\" for a great time. I come here almost every weekend and it still never gets old.  You can't find a better atmosphere anywhere else in old town. The owners Justin Cohen and Ryan Hibbert put a lot of time and effort into this bar and obviously have successfully made it into one of the best country bars in Arizona. The owner Ryan Hibbert of Riot hospitality have the best and funnest  bars in Arizona like el hefe tempe and El hefe scottsdale. I highly recommend this bar if you are in old town."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the backyard vibe. We had some out of towners meet here for happy hour the Friday before our wedding, expecting 15-20 people just to hang out at the bar or play games, but word got around and almost 100 people ended up showing up. With no reservations, we totally overwhelmed the place, but we were so impressed with how they handled it. Service was still great, and the bar kept up well. We got a lot of compliments from our guests on the venue, they did a great job. Definitely a good place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I had clients and family in town, and took them to the Gilbert location. We were having a great time and I went to the bar to order drinks. I waited in line as it was busy, when I got to the front of the line a man cut in front of me me, that obviously knew the bartender. He ordered a drink, and when I protested and told the bartender I had been waiting for some time, he told me to F off. I gave him the finger!and that's all, and he called security. Four men came and talked to me and thanked me for not causing scene and asked me to come talk to the head of security. I fully cooperated and talked him and he told me I was kicked out. Now let me just say, the dud who cut in front of me, taunted me while waiting and I kept my cool. With out sounding arrogant, I am a 250 ld, ex professional athlete and a former military man that could of done serious damage, but walked away! The head of security was Jordon, he would not give me his last name, and yes it was hard to walk away. I never raised my voice or acted in way unbecoming! I ask all military people in community to not do business with them or help Dierks music career, until he looks into this and takes appropriate action. I grew up on cattle ranch and am huge country music fan. So now we will see if the rubber hits road! What will you Dirks??  Please join me, as the little man"}
{"text":"Awesome food excellent service from our waitress Maddie McKenzie, Fried pickles and the pretzel were amazing"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I liked this place, given that most of the Scottsdale clubs were filled with belligerent people.  The music was fun, club had a nice modern country western interior, and I enjoyed  watching the music videos on the big screens.  Great place to drink some bourbon or whiskey and let lose on the dance floor to some good country tunes!  Also a great place to watch sports!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails. Inventive mixtures. 45 min for 3 cocktails and 1 beer. Came out one at a time with5-10 minutes between each. Manager says shift change coming on. Not our fault. Really wanted to like it. Love Dierks and a country bar. But unless they improve service I don't see it keeping any customers."}
{"text":"I already love Scottsdale Whiskey Row, so why wouldn't I love Tempe...... I do!!! These restaurants are well run and so much fun!! The food is unlike anything else I've ever tried. I personally can't get enough of the  fried pickles.. deeeeelicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I was out visiting my brother. Not a huge country fan, but had the best time ever. Food and drinks were creative and delicious!! We had a great time and would go back again and again. Staff was friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Nothing special, high prices, small portions, girls in tight short shirts taking selfies behind the bar for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Cheap beer at happy hour but wings were cold, barely warm.  The artichoke dip was good.  Service was decent but not great!!  So the waitress asked how things were and took the wings off without us asking so all is good!  Then the bar mgr asked what game we wanted.  Worked for me!"}
{"text":"Went there again and had a great time!  The beers were cold and full.  The food was fabulous!  The burger was juicy and the meat was tasty.  Love the mac and cheese and the artichoke dip.  The bartender was very nice!  Food was cooked perfectly!  I am glad I decided to give it another try."}
{"text":"Love this place! The bartender with purple hair is so funnn! Actually love all the staff here! Bright and cheery! Cheers from Chicago! #purplehairdontcare"}
{"text":"This is absolutely appalling. I was in on Saturday night on May 20th and witnessed a manager of some sort, a man who seemed to be in charge, screaming and CURSING at the hostess in front of everyone, including myself. It was a disgusting portrayal of disrespect of an employee and was devastating to see. I will definitely not be visiting this location any time in the future if this is the way they treat their staff."}
{"text":"Ate lunch today here and the ambiance & staff was excellent. However, the food was OKAY. Shared the grilled chicken wings with my husband. First there is no seasoning or sauce on them. They come in an order of 8 we got 7. Then my husband had the American slider and I had the fried chicken slider. They were good, but my daughter had the blue berry pancakes. Those were the best definitely their brunch is on par. Overall the staff was great!"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. The service was terrible for a football Sunday when there really wasn't that many people there. Just another overpriced bar in old town with nothing special to offer. They also overcharged for my food but we didn't feel like waiting around for it to be changed on the bill. Back to my dive bar!!"}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Dierks, I had been wanting to come to Whiskey Row in Scottsdale for some time.  I finally made it out this past weekend, even booked a hotel room.  Loved the way it looked and think the taps at the tables are beyond cool.   This is where my positive review ends.  We came around 6 p.m. to grab a bite, sample the atmosphere and get a drink or two and maybe settle in for the night.  The hostess told me that they were expecting a large party so they weren't seating anyone but we were welcome at the bar.   It must have been a really BIG party because there were a lot of open seats.  Anyway, after standing at the bar for over 15 minutes trying to get the attention of one of the two bartenders or any of the waitresses walking by, we couldn't get any service, not even a drink.  We finally decided to go to El Hefe and Wasted Grain and gave them our money they were more than willing to take.

My friends and I were so wanting to find a place to meet up once a month.  Sadly, it won't be at Whiskey Row.

It's a shame because I have never before written a bad review and I wanted so much to enjoy Whiskey Row but how do you enjoy a place that won't even acknowledge that you exist?"}
{"text":"First time here and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing. We had the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of bacon mashed potatoes and the kale quinoa salad with chicken. Both amazing! I'll be back for ur chicken sandwich for sure. Taylor was our server and was a delight! Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the bottomless mimosas. Don't waste your money. The first one is delicious and the rest taste like pure orange juice. Supposedly they do half orange juice half champagne (we just watched the bartender make a carafe and it was 25% champagne) Oh, and it's only until 2pm. That's not a mimosa in my book."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place one last try thanks to the professionalism provided by Kevin. I'm extremely happy to say that although the service is still a tiny bit slow, they seem to be making genuine strides towards improvements. I'm excited to visit again on my next trip to Arizona."}
{"text":"Eh pretty torn on this bar. The atmosphere was amazing... The service wasn't so amazing. Our waitress admitted that she forgot to put our order in but still charged us for it, and we, ourselves had to grab a manager to resolve it. Wrap was amazing would have loved to take it home if our waitress would have brought a box. Beers took awhile. Not amazing.... Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"We were just charged for the bachelorette party that we had 2 months ago, I understand that we owed the money, but after 2 months  you tend to forget that the money was never taken out, I just assumed it was taken out the night of the party. I won't ever go back to whiskey rose, I'd rather go to a bar that will bill me within a decent amount of time, not two fucking months later!"}
{"text":"Came in for the NE football game.  Had a great time!!"}
{"text":"We went to dance on a Saturday night but they had the whole side closed for a private party. Drinks are pricey. We ended up leaving after one drink."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a date on a Wednesday night. I enjoyed my Whiskey Burger, which had bacon, jalapeños and onion rings. My wife wasn't too pleased with her Fingers and Rings- the breading on the chicken fingers was not crispy enough for her liking. Our waitress, Haylie, did a great job. We enjoyed the atmosphere and both agreed it would be more fun at night during live music and dancing. Our next visit here will definitely be to enjoy the live music."}
{"text":"This is a fun bar to dance and enjoy beers! I celebrated my birthday here, and it was very enjoyable. I love that there is an older crowd around during the earlier hours of the evening and then the youngsters come later. It's nice to not have to be surrounded by teeny boppers but still enjoy a fun night out! The beer was great... Scottsdale Blond for the win!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Food was burnt. Service was an hour and a half. The hostesses have not a clue what is happening. It's sad that this place is literally ran by 18 year olds.

Went for the live music but left with only purchasing one drink. Our group had seven people. I was the only one that received a drink. Left for across the street and gave the sushi place our $270.

Will not be back. Way to go Dierks. I do hope another venue takes the place of this spot. What a wasted opportunity.

Amazing that many new Yelp users are magically giving 5 stars and taking a pic. Can you say FRAUD!? No credibility Dierks"}
{"text":"This place has been open for like 3 weeks now and is at 2 stars. This should tell you something. Me and my amigo decided to check the place out on a Saturday morning. Walking up to the bar, right outside the door on the street was a huge pile of barf with a red sweater laying in it. Obviously, #1 Elliot from E.T. went super hard the night before and #2 the crew here didn't feel it necessary to clean it up. I had a good laugh and moved to the front door where about 700 people were standing trying to get in. I overheard multiple people saying no one was helping them which is a great way to attract returning customers. I read that once in Time Magazine. We stood there for about 62 seconds and realized we are not total douche bags and left (not TOTAL douche bags....cmon). All in all, this place is already known for their awful service, food that would be better served outside a train station in Iraq and being a drunken jock moron layer. I have heard about the neck tattoo thing which is super rad and so 1923 but my review is strictly by just going to this joint. Oh and since I live about a mile away from downtown Gilbert, we can hear them blasting the worst music ever created in the middle of the night. This dump will be shut down within 3 months. Cant wait for it to turn into the largest Filibertos in America."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday night, food was delicious and ambiance was beautiful. Our server Sam, was so great! She was friendly and even with how busy it was she always had a smile and made sure we had everything we needed. My husband and friends will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Well the wife and I have usually enjoyed our time that we have went there but tonight we brought my brother in law and his wife and they are from GA and they really wanted to go there and everything was good but he was buying shots for us to have and I just ordered the beers and I had a tab. Well when it came to pay the tab they not only charged him the shots but also put on my card to pay. When I asked the bartender why were they put on my card when he already had paid she pretty much called me a liar and said that he only paid for partial, when he didn't I watched him pay every time and plus I not once said I wanted to order any shots at all through the night . The manager got involved and and my brother in law said yes he bought all the shots and guess what that charged him again for the shots that he paid for and shortly after we were kicked out, so this sucks because my brother in law had always wanted to come here with his wife and they finally do because they are Dierks Bentley fans and we are all scammed. So my suggestion to anyone is to just got to the other bars that are around there. I am sure they will treat you right and not try to rob you of your hard earned money."}
{"text":"Got here around 5. Understaffed but for the 20 people that were there service should have been better. Took 15 minutes to get a server to the table then 10 minutes to get 2 beers. Place was dirty too. Food in the cracks of the seats and the out door couch cushions were gross. The beer taps at our table had a hair on one rap and the other had some crap on it. Wouldn't drink from them. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Been 3x and it just gets worse.  Over priced drinks. I hope OHSO and the yard give  them a run for their $. All this place cares about is how short the girls shirts are and boobs pushed out, nothing about  service and quality.  Definitely will not return"}
{"text":"Don't order the country fried steak 
Don't order the fish & chips
Don't eat at the bar
Don't expect good service / common sense 

My first time & last time coming.
Bad from the beginning to the end."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and design of the place is really cool, but that's about all it has going for them. The food was mediocre for the price, and the customer service is poor at best. The hostesses were rude and clueless. We stood there waiting to be seated (only 2 of us) and they told us to wait while they seated a party, and then proceeded to stand there and look at the menus. Then they seated a couple people that came in after us, and then asked \"oh, have you been helped yet?\" The door was locked so people couldn't get in, but you'd think they would prop the door open to fix this solution since the door was broken. The outfits for the waitresses make no sense. I'm not sure how yoga pants, sweatshirt and cowboy boots go together. Should've listened to my friend who went the night before and said service was terrible. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Maybe some day they will serve cold beer. If you're going to be that busy, set up beer stations with iced down beers instead of waiting 20 minutes at the bar for a warm beer, that's all."}
{"text":"If it wasnt up to me i wouldnt have visited. My friend wanted to grab a drink. Walked in sat at the bar. Got acknowledged and then forgot about.... Im am industry person myself, 16years now. Hands down the worst service ive ever experienced. The girls behind the bar were to focused on their friends. We walked out without service. And i walked back to speak to a manager, spoke to the manager it felt like a \"no big deal\". Check yourselves. I wanted to think of you highly. Ive ran some of the best restaurants in the valley. I wasnt prepared for such a disappointment"}
{"text":"Mostly good results as we tried a majority of the food during the NFL playoff game on Sunday. The place was not packed with Cowboys fans or rowdy kids either, so that was a bonus. The highlight was actually the appetizer of rings and buttermilk chicken fingers. Both were outstanding. The burgers were the next course and the All-American was good, nothing earth shattering, but a solid piece of meat. The Bacon smashed potatoes needed some serious seasoning though so consider that and go with the rings for the upcharge. Finally, the bread pudding with chocolate and a scoop of ice cream was not a miss, but not the best version I have tried. It was flat and needed to gain some of that bread pudding height, but it tasted fine. The beers were 5 bucks each and it was a pretty enjoyable day unless you hate the Cowboys like myself."}
{"text":"Felt Dierks Bently's personality during dinner, but then at night it turned into a Vegas club (which I enjoy in Vegas). Great customer service, drinks were well made, the food was not bad, but also wasn't very good. The decor was great. They didn't overcrowd the place inside which I enjoyed a lot, but it also left a huge line outside waiting to get in so get there early. I've gotten bottle service all over the country and would never ever get if here: the tables themselves have a ginormous metal slab table in the middle forcing you to slide almost 10 feet around it and then you're stuck there, the table is so massive you can't interact with the other people at your table and most importantly there's no room to dance, or interact or do anything except sit there behind this huge table. They also open up the entire place to the outdoor elements meaning if it's over 100 outside its over 100 while in there. Also, the identity of the bar patrons were very odd: you had some folks whose were there for the country scene then some who were there for the club and don't like country making the vibe way too weird and lame."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and both times the this would be my review. The food is OK but on the pricey side. The service is terrible. We sat for several minutes before a waitress came to our table to ask for our drink orders. They were not even that busy. Then it took several more minutes before the waitress took our food orders. Our food finally came and some of the food wasn't even warm anymore it was cold. We asked for ketchup for the onion rings and french fries and we were nearly done when she came to check in see how we were doing. We said it would've been nice to have the ketchup when the fries and onion rings were hot. What I do like about the place is playing corn hole or ping-pong afterwards to finish up the evening."}
{"text":"I love coming to Whiskey Row Gilbert
Natalie at the bar is great!!Atmosphere and my Quinoa salad was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here from out of town just because it was Dierks Bentleys bar, but was pleasantly surprised by how great it was. We came on Friday during happy hour and the place was pretty quiet. The food was excellent. Highly recommend the whiskey burger and bbq chicken fries. The homemade bbq sauce is on point. Service was great too. I definitely would come by again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Fun place with lots of space.  Went around 5 on a Friday.  Had a good live band.   One bar was closed until 6 but they let us bring our drinks and sit there.  Great bartender started serving is 15 min earlier.  Food was good and crowd was lively.  Fun watching band, ping pong a.d beer pong"}
{"text":"The drinks were delicious and fast! Katie rocked that bar even when it was busy. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Love going there.  Staff is good. Food is great.  Kid's love playing ping pong and it's a great hangout"}
{"text":"We went on Saturday afternoon and watched the NCAA men's basketball game. They greeted us before we even stepped in the door. Huge bar, tons of TV's and great music! We had no trouble finding a place to sit near the corn hole games. We didn't eat this time but we plan to come back soon to give their food a try!"}
{"text":"Although I am not a country fan, I hauled my family from Mesa into Scottsdale to try out Whiskey Row because I heard the food was good and there was an available Groupon. We arrived at the restaurant just as Happy Hour was starting and it was near-empty. We sat down at an enormous camouflage-upholstered banquette table that made King Arthur's Round Table seem puny. My mom, brothers, and I practically had to shout across the table to each other, and when our appetizers arrived, we had to slide them back and forth like an air hockey puck. There are also 4 beers on tap right at your table (a cool touch, but we were not drinking at the moment), so we had to negotiate our food around this island, too. 

    I was pleasantly surprised that we could get the Happy Hour specials with our Groupon. We ordered a lot of scrumptious appetizers, as well as entrees. We had the fried pickles which came with a creamy cucumber ranch sauce that I could have licked out of the cup. I also had a picnic chicken slider, which was to die for in its fried chicken perfection. To bask in more fried chicken heaven, we also had chicken fingers and rings, as well as wings. All delicious! 

     For my main dish, I had a whiskey burger with extra whiskey bbq sauce. You can actually taste the whiskey. The jalapeños were a nice touch-spicy, but they didn't kill me. I opted for the side salad, which was underwhelming. 

     I gave my brother my leftover half of my burger so I could save room for dessert, which I split with my mom. We ordered the banana bread pudding. It is one of the best desserts I have eaten in a long time. The bread pudding was melt-in-your mouth with chocolate chips and a crème brulée finish. It was accompanied by vanilla bourbon ice cream. Again, you could taste the bourbon, which I really enjoyed. 

     The only draw back was the ambiance. At night, this place seems like it might become a college hangout. I'm not opposed to that, but it probably gets quite loud. 

   All in all, this was a delicious dining experience, and I am excited that a Whiskey Row will be opening in Chicago very soon."}
{"text":"Loved it and leslie,  our server.  Great spirit.  The sun was brutal. Food great. Atmosphere family friendly."}
{"text":"Alright so a country bar in old town, interesting? Yes. I think it adds variety to the many EDM and hip hop clubs and bars in old town.

I came on a Sunday night and it was easy to get in. The security at the front were friendly and nice. 

My friends chose this place to chill at before heading to Maya, and it wasn't bad. We drank and danced. The crowd there was very respectful and a couple of guys taught us how to country dance, the basic two step - really fun and cute! Better than bumpin' and grindin' at the clubs. 

It's interesting just to sit at a table and watch people dance. Really creative moves! Lots of throwing and twirling and flipping, goodness gracious! 

It's a pretty friendly and chill environment and atmosphere. Not desperate or hungry like the club or usual bar vibe. 

There's lots of free seating outside on the patio, as well as inside around the bar. 

The bathrooms were dirty though and unkept, which is usually rare for a place in old town. I found this very odd. There also wasn't an attendant in the ladies room, but apparently there's one in the men's room. Also, odd for old town. 

Our drinks were mixed well and I loved their whiskey variety and cocktails, some interesting concoctions! They were priced the same as anywhere else in old town.

The DJ was alright, but since I'm not a connoisseur in country music, there's not much I can say there. :P"}
{"text":"I would consider myself a bit country, and enjoy a good country bar.  Although Toby Kieth's I love this Bar and Grill is a little mainstream, I would consider it my favorite.  I had a lot of expectations because of Toby's, none of which were met.

I should have turned around and left when I got to the bar, ordered a Bud Light and a shot of Jack, and she laughed and said \"we don't like Bud Light here\".  I told her I didn't care what she liked, and she said \"we don't have any Budweiser here\".  HUGGGHHHHHHH?!?!

I get beer contracts and distributorships, but not having Budweiser at a country bar??

I grabbed my Coors Light, against my wishes, and took a walk.  I didn't find much that even came close to impressing me.  

I found a tiny, and I MEAN TINY dance floor in the back which doubles as a main walkway to get in and out of the bathrooms.  

The main bar in the middle is packed and lacks proper staffing.  It's almost too big.

The crowd is the standard, typical Scottsdale crowd that don't know squat about country, that probably wondered over from one of the other trendy hotspots.  There were more affliction t-shirts and high heels than button ups and cowboy boots.  Even the bartenders could use a lesson in western/country attire.  I couldn't tell who was out of place, the bar or the people.

There was a DJ mixing today's country hits.  Yes, I said mixing.  It's Scottsdale, what do you expect?

We were there for a birthday and had a reserved table, which do have taps in which you can pour your own beer....pretty cool.  However a majority of the space on the sides of the bar was taken up by these VIP tables.  Not ideal, by any means.

Overall I would never go back to this place.  I love Dierks and would have hoped he would have cared more about what he puts his name on, but the bar was packed and he obviously reaps the benefits of a full house.  Although the bar itself looked somewhat cool (if it were empty), it missed the whole country theme that Toby's has nailed.

If you want country (or Bud Light) stay far away.  Sorry Dierks."}
{"text":"I really want this place to be good.  Since Toby's shut down, the East Valley has needed another country bar, aside from Denim.  Once again, disappointment.

We went there before the Eric Church concert to grab some drinks an appetizers.  We figured a Tuesday night a couple weeks after the opening, things would die down a bit.  We walked in and there were a lot of people waiting, but about 1/3 of the tables were empty.  We asked how long the wait was and the hostess said an hour.  I looked at all the tables and she said their kitchen was havign trouble keeping up and they were slowly letting the tables go.

I've never been in the bar business, but has nobody worked in a bar before this place???  Is it reasonable to think aside from a few minor hiccups, this place should be operating at full capacity?  Again, I may be naive to the process, but this seems like incompetence is in play.

The interior is really cool and it looks like it will be a fun place when the original hype dies down and you can go in there to actually enjoy it.  I hope this turns into a more adult spot with less kids because there were kids everywhere when we went.

I hope to be back and change my review to 5 stars, because I really want this place to work, I just dont get the inefficiency and incompetence in play right now."}
{"text":"Glad to have a Dierk's in Gilbert! We visited for the first time during the soft opening and had a great server who kept our mimosas full and was super communicative about the food wait (as it was the soft opening and the kitchen was overloaded) 

We were super pleased. 

Hall went back again with friends for the Dierk's performance a few weeks ago and was again, super pleased with how efficient the staff was, how organized they were in filling the space and how delicious the food was.

The reason for 4 not 5 is I hope that they figure out the tattoo policy per the latest issues with the veterans being turned away as that could affect their business in such a family-oriented and supportive community."}
{"text":"We had a boozy brunch birthday for a friend last weekend at Dierks. It obviously wasn't packed at 10am in Old Town, but it was good for what we wanted. 

We did bottomless mimosas ($15 with penny refills in mason jars), and got some food. Our waitress was great, she kept our mimosas and waters full, and kept our large party tended to. We all split the monkey bread (holy delicious, gooey, cinnamon, heaven). I got the Big Ass Breakfast (sans the bacon), my boyf got the Breakfast Burger, we both loved them. The food was extremely slow for how good it was and how empty the place was. Who knows what was up with that- but overall, would definitely recommend for Brunch, or a Boozy Brunch. 

They also have a great liquor menu."}
{"text":"I have been here two times with large parties. Friendly staff but horrible service. Long wait times with empty tables all around. Seems to be poorly managed. Music however is very good. Maybe that's what Dierks should stick to is music."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I came here with a few other people on a weeknight. We were immediately greeted and ready to be served whenever. The drinks were awesome despite the fact that I don't care for whiskey much. The New Fashion and Smuttynose were my favorites. The tables have beer and liquor on tap for you to kind of do like a self-serve options. Very cool. While it's a western bar and some people get into it with cowboy boots galore, not everyone dresses up western style so don't be worried!! I plan to come back here."}
{"text":"What a cool place to come to watch the Broncos!!!"}
{"text":"Long lines, were not worth the wait..our order was wrong, and when it did come,  was just so so...the restaurants on the other side of Gilbert rd are doing it right...this place is long on atmosphere, but short on fast bartenders, and quality food.  We got here at 3pm..to avoid the rush and there was an hour wait, because every table was \" reserved\"  I will stick with Postinos, or Joyride."}
{"text":"First of all, we were told there was a 20-25 minute wait when there were 8-10 empty tables. What?! And then as we were being seated, we were told by the hostess, that the table had a 2 hour limit. That was no problem since we couldn't get out of there fast enough! Horrible service, the young waitresses walk around like zombies, warm domestic bottled beer, IPA served warm in the can with a warm glass, food delivered to table missing items that never did show up (please do everyone a favor and just write the order down!), sat in a booth against the west wall and had the pleasure of looking at thick dust with at least 30 dead flies. Yuck! Never again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink.  Bartender was helpful on selecting a drink.
A busy saturday night, and lots of room to roam around.  Band was playing later in the night, and it was loud."}
{"text":"Didn't get to try this place. It had a line wait for an hour, which would be fine, but after we asked the bouncer how long it would he, he elevator eyed my boyfriend and very rude like said \"You guys arent getting in here with those shorts on\". My boyfriend was wearing mesh-ish golfing shorts and a polo. I was wearing jeans and a flower tank top. As we walked the line, some were wearing summer and \"going-out like club dresses. But some women were wearing jeans and a top like me. Some men were wearing khaki shorts or jeans and polos too. It was the weirdest ordeal i have ever been too and i have traveled multiple countries, 30 states l, etc"}
{"text":"Amy took care of us, and she was awesome! took care of our huge group with a birthday, with all the people moving around and changing spots at tables. She's the best!"}
{"text":"A country bar that doesn't play country music. They cater to the hip hop crowd. The dance floor is open with no barrier, so there is just people standing not dancing. The bartenders or whoever those girls are, dance on the bar top like strippers and you put money in their leg garter. This place is a train wreck. Not even close to being a country bar. Change the name to some generic hip hop name if that's the kind of business your going to run.

Summary: It's not a country bar it's a hip hop nightclub. Two steppers go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere is great but our service was slow and not up to par. Several of us had the delicious chicken and waffles for brunch...Yum! Kids had fun playing corn hole and ping pong and we enjoyed the three men band and their cover songs. Good times."}
{"text":"Came here last night after already drinking at a few other bars down town. I've heard bad things about whiskey row but honestly we had a fun time. We waited in line for 30 minutes but when we got in there the place didn't feel crowded at all. We were able to go right on the dance floor and dance. I heard there were many rules to follow here and being my first time I didn't know them all. Josh, who was part of the security around the dance floor, was so nice. Seriously y'all need to give him a raise. He seemed like a guy that's going to enforce the rules but still allow you to have a good time as long as you're not being a jerk. Kudos to you Josh for keeping people in line while still being a nice guy!"}
{"text":"I don't have time to write a novel. The service at this over-priced establishment SUCKS! The manager doesn't have a clue about running a restaurant. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Made a trip to the Dierks bar for both a Friday night out and to watch the football games on Sunday.

Probably one of the best nights out I've had since I was back in college. Country Music, Waitresses in Daisy Dukes + Boots, Corn-hole, and ping-pong. What more can you ask for?

Fast forward to Sunday. We arrived and were promptly seated. This location has NFL Sunday Ticket so we were able to watch every game. Jordan was our waitress and was attentive and personable the entire time. Decent menu with a large selection of drinks. Food was awesome, especially the Southern Fries which were complimentary with a Yelp check-in. 

If I'm ever in the Phoenix area again I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cool place but the service is slow.. garlic fries do not have garlic.. Mochito doesn't contain enough alcohol (like other places in downtown Gilbert)..  overall - okay for a Saturday night dinner"}
{"text":"Had a great time watching the game . Food was really good as well ! Had the Mac and cheese along with the wings ! Beers were nice and cold and service was good . All round a great atmosphere"}
{"text":"First time to old town Scottsdale seemed to be a success!  This bar was amazing, especially for us country music fans!  The band was great, the service was good and the food was excellent!  The \"new fashioned\" drink is now added to my favorites, the fried pickles blow everywhere else's out of the water, the steak salad I had was beyond what I ever expected!  Next time we make a trip up from Tucson we will visit again!"}
{"text":"Slow service, out of 2 beers, no frozen drinks, ran out of ice tea, no tea bags to brew!  Waitress is in space."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. The place is very dirty and the menus were sticky.  The food was edible but uninspired. The service was adequate but a few of the young servers had attitude.  Will not return"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good music, and room for dancing when it's not too crowded. The food is great! Drinks can be a little pricey depending on what you order. Weekends can get a little crazy but what do you expect on Mill Ave on a Saturday night?"}
{"text":"I only give 1 star because I can't give anything less. My friend had her bachelorette party here and we stayed at this \"table\" for 2+hours spending an extraordinary amount of money on watered down shots; only to be told our table was sold. We probably spent more money than this table was \"sold\" for. This sale-out of a manager sold our damn bench. Sale outs"}
{"text":"I want to begin by saying that I love supporting local bars, restaurants and shops.  I have been rooting for this bar because it's bringing life to downtown Gilbert; however I have been here a bunch of times and almost every time we are here,day or night, we run into bad service by either the staff or management. 
Saturday night I was out with a bunch of my friends for a mom's night.  Half our group decided not to join us at Whiskey Row and opted to go home instead due to the poor service they have received in the past. 
That all being said, 4 of us decided to give it a try anyway.  We really enjoy the good music and the dance floor. 
I ordered the same thing that I previously ordered.  The bar tender got my order wrong and I asked her to correct it because it didn't seem right.  She would only make me a new drink if I paid for it.  When I questioned her about it, she called security and had me removed from the bar.  The manager told me that the bar tender was right and I was wrong.  I admit, I did get a little worked up because I felt I was being manipulated; however that was after the fact that the bar tender was being unfair.  It was disgusting the way the bouncers and manager (who would not give me his name) were treating me.  Other customers were standing up for me and they all decided to leave, on their own, as well due to this outrageous  situation.

They have lost my respect (which should have happened a while ago due to my friend's experiences) and my recommendation.  I look forward to the other businesses coming to downtown Gilbert so we all have another option.  I believe this bar is taking full advantage of being one of the only options in town and is disrespectfully treating their customers."}
{"text":"Meh... this place is nothing to be impressed about. The food was bland and overpriced. The service was absolutely horrible. Our waitress, Veronica, was practically a ghost. She was so bad that our table ended up being serviced by two other employees. Our glasses were never refilled, I had to go to the bar to ask for an extra set of silverware. Every time we asked her for something, we got the \"I'll be right there\" and never saw her. After she took our order, she wasn't seen again until the check was ready. Even then, it took her almost ten minutes to split a bill 3 ways, and she still got it wrong!! I will not return to this restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this bar we came with friends for lunch, did not look very busy but we were told 15-20 minutes wait for a table I counted at least 10 tables empty, I asked why the delay this is where  the rehearsed excuses started. No.1  not enough staff came in today we had a rush No2 We don't want to overload waitresses, No 3. We try not to slam the kitchen, after about 15 minutes we got to our table. Menu is limited and drinks  over priced, waitress took our order our drinks arrived in 10 mins  gave our food order after 10-15 mins waitress returned to tell our table that our meal would be  another 20-25 mins. when food arrived it was passable.      As  retired Chef I have these observations 1. As a new bar any problem areas should have been addressed before opening.  2. Get a manager over 25 with experience all I saw were 20 something people.  3. get a better control of your kitchen this is a joke too many people standing around NO HUSSEL. 4. Maybe the younger set will pay these ridiculous  prices but they need to be reviewed.  The only saving grace for this place was the waitress but she could only put out so many fires.    Finally in all my years as Chef   I have never seen such a fiasco called a restaurant  the overall staff have very little interest in service the food is low quality and high prices.  This definitely is a Place Gordon Ramsey should try to save"}
{"text":"We felt like listening to some live acoustic music during happy hour on a Friday night a few weeks back. We reserved a table and got a nice booth close to the stage. The table had a beer spout on the table that was impressive. Even if we weren't drinking any!! Super cute bar!! We ordered appetizers. The chicken nuggets and the fried pickles which are mentioned alot in the reviews,  then the sliders because the chicken nuggets and fries pickles were very good! Our waitress was there pretty quickly!! Made us feel welcome and offered lots of suggestions on the menu. We also noticed that the age groups varied from middle aged to the young which was nice. But we were there at dinner time so I'm sure it changes. 
 The music was great the young blonde woman singing had a beautiful voice and i thought the older guitar guy was good too."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place was getting so many bad reviews. As a lover of country music I was super stoked when I found out about this place. 

I ended up making the trek from Sun City to Scottsdale and let me tell you it was worth it. As soon as we walking in I smelled a wonderful aroma of vanilla and bourbon and the wonderful waitress informed me that it's their signature scent and they infuse it in the air. It was awesome!!

As we sat down we were greeted by a very nice server who gave us the run down of the place. I looked at the liquor menu and man was it extensive. It had a really great selection of whiskey's and bourbons which is to be expected. But they also had a really great selection of beer there. 

My grandma ended up getting the Dierks' lemonade which had whiskey and strawberry lemonade in it. I tried some of it and it was the perfect thing to be drinking in the dry Arizona air. Now when I went I was sick and I wanted some whiskey. But I also wanted a beer. Luckily, the waitress had the perfect solution. BEER COCKTAIL! Usually when you get a beer cocktail the liquor over powers the beer and all the beer does is provide a fizz. Not this cocktail! It had blackberry whiskey, fresh blackberries, pbr and their house sour. Everything complimented each other so well. It made a fantastic cocktail. 

By the time I got my food I was a little buzzed but I was really impressed with the food. It was all down south comfort food presented with a gourmet twist. The presentation was gorgeous and the taste was amazing!! I got a chicken salad wrap with tomato bisque. I think it was the best meal I had in Arizona. What was cool was that everything on their menu is really simple but they do it so well it tastes amazing!!

This is a pretty cool place. When I was asked to described this place I said it was a country gastropub. Which is pretty accurate. I kind of wish I could have visited this place on the weekend. It sounded pretty cool!1"}
{"text":"This is not a good place. Take your money elsewhere as there are plenty of other options nearby. I've been coming to Scottsdale for about 10 years now and this past weekend I was assaulted by the bouncers at Whiskey Row for no reason whatsoever, completely unprovoked. These guys are complete punks as it was me against 8 of them. I've spent a lot of money here and am still in disbelief about what happened. I write a blog and a column in Los Angeles reviewing bars and nightclubs and will be writing an article about his place soon."}
{"text":"Warning: Whiskey Row in Gilbert steals from you and doesn't tell you until after you ask for proof of payment. 

So, second time coming here. The first time, our service was really bad and one of us had chicken  bones in our food, but we decided to give it another shot. Honestly, still not thrilled. I ordered the Turkey Pretzel Melt with onion rings and a side of ranch. First of all, what kind of bar doesn't carry Coke products?! Secondly, the meal: the melt had some sort of unconventional slaw on it with brussel sprouts, cabbage, and red peppers plus possibly mayonnaise? On top of this huge mess of slaw, they also added a ton of thousand island. Needless to say, my sandwich was falling all over the place and the flavors did not really mesh well. It was all way to complicated. The onion rings had good flavor and weren't greasy (which is a huge pet peeve of mine), but the coating fell off all over my tray when I went to pick them up and I only received 5 rings (kind of a let down for a $12 meal). Lastly, the ranch I ordered tastes more like tzatziki and I'm pretty sure there was cucumber in it, which I have a bit of an allergy to, so that didn't thrill me (the flavor or possible secret ingredient). The service was better, but overall, the food tries too hard for how little it actual gives me and I most likely won't be back for a third time.


Update: about 15 min after I wrote the above review...

So, we had a gift card with $25 that we gave to the waitress. She came back saying we owed her another dollar (\"exactly a dollar\"), then never brought us a receipt or acknowledged us again. 
We asked the hostess to find her so we could get a receipt, and when our waitress (Kaylee) brought it, we realized that our total was actually $25.75. Meaning she basically stole $0.25 cents from us and lied about it? Kaylee explained that Whiskey Row does not carry change and that, instead of giving what they owe you back, they just round up to the next dollar and keep whatever the difference is. We asked that we get our $0.25, because at that point we were really upset and a manager came over and simply handed us a quarter and told us to have a good night, then huddled up with our waitress and the hostess and stared at us through the window as we left! This has left such a bad taste in my mouth! Do not go here unless you're okay with getting stolen from and then lied to about it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good music, great dancing, I always am served fast. I go at least once a week and am excited that I don't have to go all the way to Tempe."}
{"text":"Music is fun...high tops suck. Be sure to get a booth with the beer taps."}
{"text":"Walking into this place for opening night and Monday night football and I was just taken back by how beautiful the venue looks! This place also has just a+ food and beverage options! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wow! First time here and I was very impressed. Normally when I think of a \"country bar\" I think of very dirty dive bars with decent food but this place blew me away! They add a night life aspect to this upbeat country bar that really makes it stand out! 

Also to add to their amazing concept, I tried the food and it was TO DIE FOR!!! Their Country Fries were gone in 1 minute because my group enjoyed them so much. Also our server Kassie was amazing and helpful with choosing one of their IPA Beers on tap!

I will be returning here again!"}
{"text":"Fifth trip here. Beginning to dislike it. Turn down the damned music. It is too effing loud! I can't hear the server. She can't hear me. Others at the table have to yell to be heard. It's a terribly noisy place. Put some carpet down might help. But why is the music so loud? Then, rudely the hostess actually said \"You can't have a two hour meal\" implying we had to hurry and get out so others could enter. I should have turned around and left. Food as usual is good but dang drink prices are high! Saturday night and not packed. That's saying something isn't right."}
{"text":"I've been to whiskey row a handful of times, mainly for nightlife which I've definitely enjoyed. Every time Beth's been our bartender, she's super friendly, huge smile and has always taken good care of us! The live music and atmosphere inside is insane. Definitely something Gilbert needed! Haven't had any food yet, so no comments there. Will be back!"}
{"text":"hanging out in scottsdale for March into april. plenty of things to do, and whiskey row was right in the middle of it.  great bar and a place to get ready for various events happening in scottsdale.  always busy but don't let that stop u from entering, u will have a really good time."}
{"text":"Looks like a great place but we weren't allowed to eat here!  

Was excited to stop in and grab a bite to eat with my 6 year old daughter and a friend of mine. Was there in July on a Wednesday, about 2:30 in the afternoon. Super slow time for any business in az. Us and one other table in the entire place. Sat down and ordered a drink and then were told we needed to finish our drink and leave because no one under 21 was allowed in!!!! ( my friend and I are late 30's, not talking about us....haha)  I would never take my daughter to a club, obviously, but thought this was a restaurant and saw no problem with taking my daughter here for a lunch and some good music. 

If you're looking for a bite to eat and have kids....look elsewhere!!!!! Guess we will be going back to Toby Keith's from now on, lol!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Don't bother. Had empty tables but didn't want to fill them with paying customers"}
{"text":"Service was too slow. Not worth going back, ever. About 6 girls working hostess stand. Not one was friendly. Waited 40 minutes for a table (with half of tables empty). Once we sat at table we waited over 15 minutes until we asked if we had a server. Food was not that good. Sadly we won't be back. There is too much competition across the street. Not one employee here was friendly."}
{"text":"The food (lunch) was a bonus and pretty good for being 1 step above bar-fare....however, there is allot to look at. All of the waitresses are beautiful, half naked, look like they aren't a day over 21 and spend 23 hrs a day in the gym and tanning. I'd go here again for the view alone; and have the chicken sandwich and a fried pickle just to make it look like I came for lunch."}
{"text":"I had a great experience. Being new to town, my fiancée and I wanted to see what restaurants were downtown. We came across Whiskey Row and will definitely be returning!

We came here and the service was great. Mason and Hayden brought us our food and beverages very quickly and created a personal touch by asking how we were doing and having a brief conversation with us. This day was a special day as I graduated with my bachelors degree. About half hour later, Chase, the General Manager, came to our table to congratulate me and definitely made me feel welcomed. 

On the weekends they have live bands, discounted mimosas, and different activities to do while visiting. Inside, they have a bar that has 10 TVs that show sports games. The service and atmosphere is second to none. I highly recommend Whiskey Row to anyone who is in the area!"}
{"text":"So went on Friday night and evidently they stop serving the drinks on there menu after 10 I believe, probably because the bartenders can't make them. 

I waited 31 minutes for a bartender to address me as I watched them serve every girl in the bar before me. The menu says the beer I ordered was $5, I was charged $11. So I didn't order more because I was lied to. 

I left after staying and being miserable for two hours. When we left the music was so loud I couldn't hear anything like I was under water. 

I hope I never get dragged here again.

*Update*
I recently visited again and I was excited to get my drink almost immediately as well as the two people with me. They still don't serve their signature cocktails after 10 or 11pm, which sucks, but the service has stepped up. The music is still extremely loud but I would attribute that to the noise pollution they have going on with El Hefe across the street."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Dancing, games, good food and live bands. Partly air conditioned and not bad when the big fans are whipping the cool air around."}
{"text":"Our server Melissa was absolutely amazing. She constantly made sure everything was good and to make sure we were all satisfied. Super friendly and sweet. Great service! 10/10 would come again"}
{"text":"This is a fun spot to listen to country music! The place has a unique layout. The four-sided, square bar is the center of attention. The band/stage is above of the bar. There are TV's and projectors throughout so you won't miss the game while you get your party on. Lots of videos of Dierks displaying his sexiness (Bring it on!!!) and kindheartedness! I went on a Friday night and the place was packed! It was so packed that the dance floor was full of people just standing around talking. I wanted to get my \"boot-scoot-boogying on\". Didn't happen!  A great band was playing too! Some of the female staff and the lead singer of the band (female) danced on the bar. That was very entertaining...if that's what gets you going. Although it was crowded with the young and old alike, the bartenders and baristas were on top of it! No long waits to place a drink order. I've been to Whiskey Row before and I've actually eaten a respectable meal here."}
{"text":"The food was good tasting. But that is the only good thing I can say. Our cloth napkins were dirty and there was a fork on my seat from the last customer. My wife ordered well done fries and mine regular fries were cooked more than hers.  We ordered a soda that was flat. They were unable to fix it but I was still charged for it. I had to ask for every drink refill and my server spent more time talking to some guy at the bar than she did at our table. 

The food was good but not worth enduring the terrible service. I will not waste my time or money there again"}
{"text":"The food was sub-par. Definitely not going to eat here again. For a country bar, I expected the fried pickles to kick it out of the park. Nope. They were hard and poorly fried. I almost feel bad writing that because I love Dierks so much. 

Now at about 8:30pm this bar transforms into a fantastic club. They have great music, country remixes, and a decent crowd. I highly recommend this if you like more of the Dallas bar scene."}
{"text":"This place was a really good time. Great variety of music, and a decent size dance floor. Bartenders were fast and attentive, shot girls on the bar will pour shots for tips only, and they were everywhere. If there is a wait for a drink a shot girl is there to wet your whistle while you wait. Anna was the shot girl when I was there and she was awesome and made the night more enjoyable. I am only in town for a few days but will be sure to stop in again."}
{"text":"Fun , young , cool and very inviting. Right when you come to the door your greeted and brought to any table or booth (there all great). The restrooms are monitored and have colognes and fresh towels even when it's late and in a weekend.  Staff is pretty good looking too!!  Cool place to watch a band.  Did not eat while we were here just partied!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried chicken with chorizo gravy..oh Lord just order the extra gravy at the beginning. You want everything covered with that Fabulousness. The chicken was so moist, the potatoes and red peppers so good. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Broncos fans this is the place to be for game day!  Home of the Broncos in the desert and I have to say there is no better place to host Broncos football.  This is a country bar with live country music bands that play every now and then.  Great thing about this place is the location, smack dab in the middle of old town Scottsdale's nightlife.  

They also have a ton of tvs to view any event from any angle in the the bar including a 2 story projection screen on the back wall.  

Food is your typical bar food with a hint of country style.  Good meat selection with the traditional BBQ flavors.  Overall good food considering the options around the area but a little higher in price than I would like to see.  However, if you check in here, you get a free appetizer for the table so take advantage while it lasts.  

I give 4 stars for being an awesome place to host the Denver Broncos.  Minus 1 point for being slightly overpriced and at times very difficult to get to the bar to buy drinks when it is busy."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak salad which I highly recommend. Super flavorful and just very delicious. Sorry no pictures on that one. Staff is great, the manager came up to her table and started a conversation and once he learned we were from out of town he was very courteous.  When I come back to Arizona I will definitely stop in again"}
{"text":"I wanted to try it since they broke ground on it. Finally tried it last night and what a disappointment! :( the place looks like it's a lot fun from the outside but the atmosphere is meh, not the busy bustling bar you'd expect. 

The food was the worst though! Seriously, the worst fish and chips I've ever had! I'm even uploading a picture to show the almost empty batter shell with a tiny, microscopic piece of fish barely visible. You basically get batter. A lot of batter. The Cole slaw had raw onions in it. Really? And the fries were overdone and not even crispy. How do you mess that up?!

Three service was ok, 2 stars for that but that's about it. Unfortunately, nothing special."}
{"text":"I have not once visited this fine establishment of my own volition. I have, however, been persuaded by others to come here on occasion. You know, those times in life when you don't have a choice and you are a good friend ... 

Walking into this place sober is scary AF. All these men with thirsty eyes desperately scanning the room in search of that one special girl to have a one-night-stand with. I was glad I wasn't drinking. I wanted to wear a sign that said: stone cold sober. That way men with half their drinks spilled down their fronts would know to hit on someone else. My vision is perfect right now, yes, I can see how sweaty and gross you are. 

There is one thing in this place worthy of five stars, though. There is a dancer on the bar with the best ass I have ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's amazing. My friends and I just stare at it with a mix of adoration and jealousy. How can we make our asses look like that? Can I tip you for workout advice? Seriously, though, how much would you charge to tell me your butt toning secrets? I do squats, dammit. I went on three hikes last week! If I had that ass ... I'd NEVER wear pants. I'd be Donald Duck-ing it all day every day. Ladies, if you come here with your man, do not even think about getting mad if he stares at this girl's butt all night. You will be doing it too, don't lie. It's the only thing about this place worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Although I do not typically provide reviews for nightlife bars, I felt the need to share a recent experience I had at Whiskey Row. I am visiting the area with a few friends and we decided to find a place to grab a few cocktails before heading back to our hotel room for the night. We received a recommendation to come here from a friend familiar with the area. It was particularly crowded around the time of the incident (around midnight) and while crowds generally don't bother me, I was making my way to the front of the bar where there was more room to stand and was a bit quieter. While weaving through people to get there, I put the nastiest spin move since Braxton Miller against Virginia Tech in 2015 on another guy attending the bar. I am 100% certain that I avoided any physical contact with everyone around me and did not spill even a drop of my 3/4 full, $9.00 Bud Light. It was quite impressive I must admit, and I even received a subtle head nod from someone standing in the corner. Within seconds I felt a squeeze on the back of my shirt from a bouncer telling me I was \"too drunk\" and must leave. After respectfully and calmly asking for an explanation on the incorrect call, he had the audacity to respond by grabbing two other bouncers to help remove me. I was obviously upset I was being forcibly removed without a justifiable reason and instantly went into a \"Draymond Green-esque\" temper tantrum (surprisingly I did not receive a Technical foul). For someone who generally shows grace under pressure, my friends felt the need to leave the bar to help calm me down. After choosing another local bar that was much more receptive to my athletic nature, I realized I will not be returning to Whiskey Row until the management team decides to switch back to the normal security crew that doesn't blow calls worse than the NFL replacement referees. If you consider yourself an athlete and take pride in getting from Point A to Point B in the most efficient manner possible, then this place is NOT for you. For those concerned about the well-being of the innocent man whom I did said spin move on, I'm happy to report he is at home with his family and friends recovering from a successful double ankle replacement surgery (I'm kidding, his ankles are fine). Although I do not have video proof of the incident, please find the attached links for a similar comparison:

{"text":"Great atmosphere and great music! Lines are little long like mill/Scottsdale but it's a lot of fun once you finally get in"}
{"text":"Amazing place and great atmosphere! A bartender named Layla made our drinks and gave us great service!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to leave the most mature review I can, but the immaturity of the two bartenders tonight makes that very hard. I definitely don't know their names because they wouldn't give them up. I also no hard spoke to the manager for about 20 or 30 minutes trying to resolve the resolution. We decided that drunk customers do not fit well with bartenders and I thought we were on a good path. But then all of a sudden two bartenders came and called me a bitch and a cunt and he sided with them. I didn't know what to do from there and I was very embarrassed as a woman. Who calls someone a cunt? I must reiterate that this was the manager of the building!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. One of the worst of all time. Our server, Bui, took more than 20 minutes to even greet us at our table. She never apologized for the delay.  She took our order and then we never saw her again until it was well past the time we were ready to request the check. once we requested the check it took almost 20 min to receive and over 10 min to process once she received our cards. Don't go here if you're looking for food. This place is only acceptable if you are buying drinks from the bar. Food was mediocre at best. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Hello, I was curious who I need to speak with to resolve a problem I had with a promoter and manager in Scottsdale on 10/8. I was swindled into purchasing a bottle and bottle service which I was told would be \"comped\" and I was only liable for tipping the waitress and they only needed my card to hold the table but would not be charged. I was told this by the manager named Robert as well as a promoter named Bobby D. When my card was charged at the end of the night I was promised that it would be refunded into my account by the next day and I would only be charged for the gratuity for the waitress. I am afraid to contact the bar over phone as I do not wish to speak with the same people that promised me a refund. Thank you for reading and I'm looking forward to hearing back fro
m someone."}
{"text":"As for my one time experience here i was really impressed with the food. We came for lunch so there weren't very many people in the restaurant though clearly this place was built to pack them in. The ambiance was really cool with the whole bean bag toss thing that people are all crazy about lately for some reason. The design was really cool. Prices were a little higher than i would have expected. We got a free appetizer with the yelp app and that always makes me happy. Of the four of us eating i actually tried a bite of everyones food and i can say with certainty that every single thing was really really delicious. I had the beer can chicken which was maybe only delicous if im being honest but everything else gets a really really. The staff was nice, not super attentive and we had to flag some one down once or twice but overall a really great experience and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"To start, you will be hard pressed to find someone who love Dierks Bentley more than me, so I was so excited that one of his bars was opening up close to me and it makes me sad to write this review.  We went in for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and were told it was going to be a 10 minute wait, 20 minutes later we were finally shown to a table that had been empty the whole time we were waiting.  Once we were sat it we waited at least another 10 minutes before going and asking if we were going to be helped.  Someone finally came over and took our drink order and we ordered appetizers and lunch.  The appetizers came out and were amazing!  I strongly recommend the artichoke dip.  We waited and waited for our food and flagged down our server to refill our drinks and asked if she could check on our food.  She came out and said the kitchen was behind, but it would be coming.  Once we eventually got our food it was amazing, which is why they get 2 stars instead of 1. By the time we paid and left is was about 2:00.  We had gotten there at 11:45.  Thank goodness my boss was with me and I didn't have to explain over a 2 hour lunch.  The place was only about 1/2 to 3/4 full so I would hate to see how long it takes on a Friday or Saturday night.  Sadly, until the service improves I don't think I can go back."}
{"text":"Whiskey Row is THE place to go in old town scottsdale for country music and fun.  The service is exceptional and some of the best on the street. Couple of weeks ago I went into Whiskey row on a packed Friday night. Upon arriving the bouncers were very wecloming and checked id's at a very quick pace. Heading in doors the music volume was  set to the perfect pitch and the song choices are on point. The combinaton of  music and great lighting set up an awesome ambiance. Where I was most impressed was with the bartending service. On the occasion I had the opportunity to get drinks from Jordan, Lane and Mimi. Each one was perfectly crafted with a great ratio of alcohol to mixer as well I found them very reasonably priced.  As i sat at the bar the ladies checked back with me on how my drink quality was.  I personally was impressed by this as found this for as more drink orders came in they still knew to come back and check in on the customer.  I ended up staying there most of the night as a local band was playing and the energy inside the bar was extremely upbeat. With good music, excellent service and drinks I highly recommend whiskey row to anyone looking for a fantastic bar in old town scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Whether you're looking for a place to decompress after work or youre looking to get into some shenanigans, this is the place. The ambiance of this downtown Tempe location has a certain robust classiness to it; just like their whiskey. As a bourbon kind of girl, I definitely recommend you try their specialty cocktails and treat yourself with their chimichurri steak. Best part about this joint, it's connected to El Hefe: mingle at both establishments, challenge someone to a game of corn hole and dance until closing time. See you out there."}
{"text":"For the self proclaimed \"most technologically advanced bar in Arizona\" they have yet to master using an established website or their social media profiles to let potential customers that they'll be closed for a private party. They also appear to be perplexed by the use of simple signage and opt for the classic confused look and empty apology to convey information."}
{"text":"Good music.  Very expensive drinks.  Would like to check it out on a Friday or Saturday night"}
{"text":"Was a little bit shy about trying this place (with the low Yelp reviews )  but gave it a shot and glad we did, even though the band was a little loud  it still was a fun place and our bar tender Katie was awesome she  made sure we had a full beer and the southern fries were amazing. We will definitely come back and bring our kids after they return from their deployment"}
{"text":"Went to Whiskey Row last night for the first time and had a great time! Maddy was my server and she was amazing! I've been in the service industry for over 20 years so I'm a little critical and very expectant,  and she definitely brought her A-game. Kudos to her and Whiskey Row, I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I have been three times now and nothing had changed. They say an hour and half wait for two when there is over a dozen tables open. Their answer the kitchen is backed up so they can't seat the open tables. Seriously. Three times in a row crappy service. If you can't handle the tables you have set maybe don't open yet."}
{"text":"Went to Whiskey Row in Tempe today while at the Arts Festival.   There were hundreds of people enjoying the Art Fest, but the restaurant was not that busy.
We were seated right away at a table that was too small for our party of 6...we moved ourself to a nearby table.  A young waitress took our our drink and appetizer order and we were served in a timely order.  We ordered our lunch and...and the issues began.  We ordered a hamburger...NO Cheese.  It was served as a cheeseburger.  Along with with the cheeseburger, 4 other entrees were served...like I said, there were 6 of us.  We were told that the cheeseburger would be replaced with a hamburger and Mama's order would be coming soon.
No salt/pepper were on tables...so I got up and asked a server where I could find them.  She mumbled something about I would have to find someone to bring it to.the table???
We waited almost 20 minutes for Mama's sandwich to be served and almost another 30 minutes for the hamburger to come.  When we questioned the server about the delay...her answer, \" it's the regular chefs day off and he is really good.  There are a lot of ticket orders in the kitchen and today's chef is trying to catch up.  We have a lot of food and drink orders.\" .????
I guess we need to check to see when \"the regular chef\".is on duty."}
{"text":"Let me start start off this is about a policy that I feel discriminates against older patrons that  will not have us going back. It was Friday night and celebrating my wife's Birthday and were looking for a place to have drinks and listen to some Music. We arrived around 8:00 and found a spot by the back bar. Place was busy but bar service was very efficient and we settled down for the music to begin. Now we are an older demographic than
I am sure DB's marketing target's but here is the issue. Shortly before 9:00 they begin clearing tables and chairs from the dance floor. Its this next step that killed it for us.
A member of security tells me I will have to give up my seat. Why?since we are at the back bar not anywhere where we,would impede dancing. It is explained that no one is allowed to sit once the music starts. We are told we could go to the restaurant area but that defeats the purpose of our visit. It appears that DB's policy is no chairs on Friday and Saturday nights for anyone. According to the manager is its about dancing and safety. Not sure I buy either one. I do not see how stools at a back bar causes issue to either. What I can say is this if you are unwilling to make accommodations for older clients then we spend our money elsewhere. That's a non starter"}
{"text":"Tried a couple sliders, bloody Mary's, Mac & cheese and of course on-tap beers and enjoyed it all.  Bar is usually all 21+ but at early Sun. football games kids are OK."}
{"text":"Had a great time!!! A must when your in Scottsdale. Great service by our server and the manager. The food runner was a bit rude and arrogant. A short Hispanic male with an attitude but regardless we had a great time and great music from the live band!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Very busy food was OK nothing that great..Atmosphere is great though real younger crowd.No Place for kids that's for sure"}
{"text":"I'm giving a 3 for the service. Unlike other reviews the service was spot on as far as attentiveness according to the situation. The food however was just meh. The bacon brussels sprouts was not good enough to finish, the fries had a different tasting spice to them and the chicken sliders had way too much chili paste. I probably would not come back even tho it wasn't bad per se."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but both the hostess desk and wait staff were terribly inefficient- they appear to be properly staffed but seemed either inexperienced or apathetic. Very cool atmosphere...hopefully they can get some kinks worked out."}
{"text":"This is probably the most happening spot in downtown Gilbert. I wouldn't go there for food; when it's busy, it takes forever to get a drink; and as a country dancer, it's hit or miss. I prefer to go here to grab a drink after work... But other than that, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a game for the wealth of TVs and lawn games, but the food was marginal to bad. Everything tasted frozen. Even the fries were bad."}
{"text":"I originally gave this bar a bad review and i was super unhappy about the service. Now after Whiskey Row reaching out to me to actually hear my opinion, letting me know that changes have occurred and they would love to welcome me back- I of corse went back to check it out for myself. The service was far better and the female bartenders, they now have, actually respect the women they are serving, illustrate positive attitudes, smiles and much quicker service all around. Not to mention Olivia one of our favorites from another bar (awhile ago) is working here she is absolutely amazing. Much better experience and 100% impressed with seeing an establishment actually fix problems rather than ignoring them....got to love gilbert!!! Great job Whisky Row!"}
{"text":"Yep. AOK. Drinks were good and the server was sweet and prompt - we were a table of 7 at happy hour. Apps are fine and our fave was the artichoke dip. If, however,  you're trying to have a normal conversation here at happy hour, think again. Really loud. There was a good band playing an accoustic set that I really enjoyed, it just wasn't conducive to any lengthy conversation and we had invited someone new to the area. So overall, a fine HH experience - probs just not one you want to have if conversation is an important part of your evening."}
{"text":"I asked the bartender for an AMF, which is supposed to have 2.5 shots in it. She literally gave me blue curacao and lemonade, and thought i wouldn't notice."}
{"text":"I had a blast with my friends. It's a great addition to downtown Gilbert. It does get crowded quickly and sometimes makes it difficult to get drinks, but overall great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We checked the website before coming to the restaurant this morning and it said Sunday hours started at 9am. There was a couple who got there before us that talked to a server and she told them they opened at 10am (even though the couple said they called twice to confirm that opening was at 9am the day before). We tried to talk to the server by knocking on the door, but she ignored us and walked away. So, while we were outside, my husband called the restaurant to speak to a manager. The manager came out and said that they weren't ready, the weekend was just too overwhelming and they wouldn't be open until 10am. By this time, there was about 10 of us waiting outside and more people kept coming. My ultimate pet peeve with restaurants is lack of preparation (especially since they already have existing restaurants out there, so they cannot say we didn't expect it to be so busy; therefore, excuses, excuses, excuses). The other is just poor and rude customer service. As someone who works in an industry where costumer service is paramount, the least the manager could have done was to provide free drinks or appetizers or even as simple as to put us on a list so we can come back at 10am where we have guaranteed seating right away. Instead, he said that there were other restaurants already open that we can go to. Way to take accountability."}
{"text":"Holy hell, this place is PACKED... but not in a good way packed.  More of a \"this is absurd\" type packed.  We had a VIP reservation for 9:30 pm on a Friday night (which meant bottle service and guaranteed sofas/seating).  We got there around 9:35 pm and the bouncer literally said \"oh shit, you guys actually came?\" and we had to wait around for 10 minutes while they cleared out our section.  We literally put down a $500 reservation and we had to wait for them (yes, 2 bottles of vodka equated to about $500).  Sadly, for our group it was worth it just for the reserved seats (only because we were a group of about 20 ... if we didn't have the bottle service, we wouldn't have gotten in).  

So, here's the kicker ... we're bottle service, right?  I've only had bottle service a few times but NEVER did they put our bottles under lock & key. Okay, so I actually work in commercial insurance and am pretty proficient in liquor liability insurance so while this in and of itself wasn't terrible, the two girls in charge of pouring really didn't come back that frequently so people were constantly on different pages on drinking and some typically had to wait a pretty long time before they were allowed to have another drink (unless they went to the bar, which defeats the whole purpose of bottle service).  They were also constantly running out of mixers so we'd have to wait and wait until someone came over to refill the mixers.

Lastly, THERE ARE SIX STALLS IN THE WOMEN'S ROOM.  Yes, with the occupancy rate at HUNDREDS, there were six stalls installed in the women's room so be prepared for an outrageous wait.  We literally left because the group was split into 50% women and we had zero desire to wait 30 minutes to go to the bathroom.

To be honest, I'll be more excited when the rest of the bars/restaurants start keeping their hours open later and we'll have all the other great places to go late-night."}
{"text":"I've been to different whiskey row locations and I loved it! I love the idea of drinking games like beer pong and bags being implemented with the nightlife. Food is always pretty good and service is as well. 

BUT, my first experience at this location on mill was horrible. First, we got sat at a long table outside that sat maybe 8 people. We came with 6 people so it was a good choice for a table, expect for the fact that there were already two people sitting there. It was kind of awkward sitting down, and we both look at each other confused. The couple ended up getting up and leaving. Then, we were told that we were allowed to smoke outside by the same hostess, but when we started smoking, the manager came and told us sternly that we could not smoke there. Pretty frustrating. It also took about 10-15 minutes to get a refill on our beers. 

Apart from all of that, the food was great. So it somewhat made up for it. 
Like I said before, I have always like whiskey row and I'm perfectly fine to give this location another chance. Hopefully they tighten some things up."}
{"text":"Food is decent for bar food. Service is hit or miss depending on the time and crowd. Not a bad place to pass some time. One negative is sometimes it is really tough to park nearby so be prepared to walk a bit if you drive here"}
{"text":"Wow. Great location. Warm beer, rubbery wings with sauce on the side. Chicken Chile slider with over powering sauce. Wine, OK. Had to wait 20 minutes for a table, even though there were many open and clean tables. There were more hostess than food servers. They did have a live band that was very good. Too bad the rest of our experience was not on that level."}
{"text":"Look at response. More about fighting and being right than listening. 

Good luck, whiskey row."}
{"text":"Went to Whiskey Row on my lunch break -- had the meatball sliders and they were amazing.  The server was cute and love the new place.  Keep up the good work.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Me and a girlfriend went here for happy hour on a Friday night to celebrate her birthday and ended up meeting with a few other girlfriends later on to celebrate moms night out! We took advantage of the drink & food specials for happy hour! We both tried the American burger sliders / tomato aioli sauce / grilled onions / fries, but we both skipped out on the opinions! The burger was so juicy and fries were nice & crispy! It was only $5 too! Next visit I want to try the grilled whiskey wings! For drinks we both tried a fruity drink (unfortunately I can't remember the name) that came in a cute mason jar glass!!! I'm a sucker for drinks that come in cute glasses! Later on in the night we had a few shots of whisky thanks to the lovely couple sitting next to us and then tried the raspberry riser! All drinks we delicious & bartenders were very attentive and one of them even made my friend a birthday drink! They have super fun games outside like corn-hole & a giant janga. Later on in the evening they move all the chairs/tables and the whole place becomes more of a country dancing bar! Great music / great vibes / great drinks / great staff! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Cool place and has a great vibe, this review and the one star is solely for the bartender who was a complete bitch. My friend ordered two drinks one for me and one for him. Another bartender who looks just like the bartender that took my friend's order comes to me and asks me what I want. Thinking she was the same bartender who took my friend's order and is clarifying what my friend ordered for me I tell her my drink. She brings back my drink and at the same time the first bartender brings the two drinks that my friend ordered. I explain to her that my friend only ordered two drinks and I thought I was only clarifying to the other bartender what my friend ordered for me and she can take the extra drink back. She rolls her eyes at me in a very rude way and says no your friend ordered two drinks and you ordered one so you have to pay for three drinks and I can't take any drinks back! my friend ended up paying for the two drinks and I paid for the extra third drink that I never ordered which I ended up giving to someone else . It goes without saying that I didn't leave her any tips and left the place pretty unhappy about what she did. I'll still come back again but I'll never forget her face and I'll never order anything from her again."}
{"text":"This is a great bar and restaurant.  The waitresses are attentive and get you order promptly. Matt does an excellent job making sure the customers are taken care of and happy. We were seated within the time frame given and moved to a larger table to accommodate our party. The best part is the live music and dancing area!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the service is lacking. I also feel like the atmosphere is a little off. I want to be able to take my kids, but the waitresses are not in kid friendly attire. It is a great concept, but it could be so much more if they got friendly staff. For example, we took my girlfriend there for her birthday lunch and asked if they would sing to her.  They asked for ID. It was her actual birthday, thank goodness because sometimes you celebrate on a day around the birthday, but it killed the celebratory vibe. We didn't even want anything free, like dessert, we just wanted her recognized. They acted like it was a huge pain. I've never had that happen at a restaurant. Doesn't every restaurant have a birthday ritual for someone in their bday?!?"}
{"text":"If you love country then this is the place to be. The dance floor, people are always having a good time, it's more lounge club so going there with a big group and having a booth is always really fun!"}
{"text":"I'm one of the few ppl that love in this town that LOVES country music, and let me tell you, this bar is super fun for dancing and the burgers are UNREAL!! I'm not even a big meat eater and I love these burgers!! Fun for a more chill night out"}
{"text":"Ya know I normally don't bit*h but I was really surprised at the experience here. Was my first time, walked in went straight the bar as there was a 20 minute wait. Bartender saw me and walked away. Sat for almost 10 minutes while he spoke to the couple next to me on my right side. Say another 10 while he spoke to the girls on my left. He avoided all eye contact and wouldn't even give me a menu. I had to find another bar tender to help me. He walked around several times asking several others f they needed anything or if they were okay, but for some reason passed me up repeatedly. Can't help but wonder if it is because I'm the only non white customer at the bar. Sad to review this service from such a large upscale establishment. I get it's a country bar, but my money is green just like anyone else's. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone... sucks as there isn't a whole lot to do in Gilbert as is. Don't know the guys name but def grungy, has a nose ring, Mohawk hair... if I find out I plan to update post and write a formal complaint."}
{"text":"Don't order a salad to go from here. I've had the kale and quinoa salad in the restaurant before and it was delicious. I ordered it to go and was not impressed. There was a very very thin layer of kale and quinoa with massive amounts of feta (which is not on the menu description) and dressing. I ordered it with shrimp so it came to $15 for a disgusting salad that I couldn't even eat. They turned a very healthy option into a fat covered mess."}
{"text":"Food and bartender was excellent. Couldn't ask for better"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Peppy music, good beer and whiskey collection. Servers r nice. Ambience is wonderful. Good place to spend Friday evening."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my family, since we are visiting for The Finals Four. The hostess, Sahailie was very friendly and welcomed us in with a smile, we got sat right away and had excellent service throughout our visit! The music is up beat and the environment is extremely fun and friendly. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Whiskey Row. Out of all the bars in Old Town Whiskey Row has the chillest vibe and the nicest staff. They make drinks quick and the wait for food is no wait at all. Russ is the bar manager and he is SOOO nice. He handles his staff members professionally and always gives the best service to my friends and I - thanks Russ!!! :) oh and just a second, Chef Mike (head chef) is EXCEPTIONAL. I've ordered the steak, pretzel w/ cheese, a few of the burgers, and the house salad.... all great choices while watching a football game. And everything has been cooked to exceed my standards. If you're going out to watch the game, listen to a mix of music, or dance - Whiskey Row is great!"}
{"text":"I had never been to other locations of Whiskey Row but this one was convenient to the Livewire concert venue. Staff was welcoming, friendly, efficient. Happy Hour offerings were priced perfectly. In fact the entire menu looked great. I started with a bleu cheese bacon slider ... Omg melt in your mouth. As an entree I chose the Fingers and Strings which was the best wings and onion rings I have had in forever. My friend ordered the ribs. Cooked perfectly with a side of bacon mashed potatoes they were amazing. A few drinks... And off to the concert. Will definitely get back to this place !"}
{"text":"We dropped in here on a Friday night. We arrived early in the evening and it was not packed like sardines yet. We were able to listen to some nice live music. The band on stage was good. We were able to listen to several sets before they went on break. 

The drinks were good and we shared a few appetizers. The pricing was fair. Nothing outrageously priced.

As the night moved along this placed got packed. The staff was anticipating this and started moving chairs and tables. Mostly for what seemed like they were making room for standing room only. 

The staff was primarily good looking woman in short shorts. And some of the bouncers were easy on the eyes. One thing that i noticed that the customer base seemed to be more male orientated on the night that we were here. Hmmm.. this place probably turns into a meat market as the time moves along in the evening. 

We left and had to wind our way out of the crowd. One thing that I did notice that was interesting is that it seemed like people could smoke inside the bar? Not sure if this was because there was open air seating. However we could still smell the cigarette smoke. Which was strange since I am used to bars not allowing people to smoke."}
{"text":"Well the first time going to whiskey row was not a good visit. It start with a 30 min wait that was the cause of not being busy but because the kitchen could not keep up with the orders as told by the hottest when my wife asked (there were atleast 20 open tables that you could see just from the hostess booth).....never have I ever been told this when going into a restaurant. Then they sat us and it took the server about 5 minutes to get to us. The food was not great, the fish in the fish n chips was burnt. The cheese dip for the pretzel was room temp and hardened. The kids butter noodles has no butter sauce."}
{"text":"Great place to listen to country music; husband and I had a great time on our visit to Scottsdale. Arrived earlier in the night (along with a sandstorm) so had a spot at the bar near the dance floor. While we didn't eat and don't dance we totally enjoyed all the beers and the live bands! Awesome evening loving the music; only wish Dirks would have showed up!"}
{"text":"My friend loved the Brussels sprout salad but I did t love the bacon flavor in it. The artichoke dip was \"meh\", tasting mostly of cream cheese. The individual sliders for $4 a pop were tasty and just the right size. The passion fruit team was delicious and service was good. We will come back again to try more items."}
{"text":"What a waste of an evening. Good thing I ate at Postinos beforehand. Not that the food is any good at Dierks, actually probably just average bar food, but I have no idea as they stop serving food at 9pm on weekends. Wtf? All so they can take hooker looking waitresses around for 'bottle service'.
Now just that would have been more tolerable seeing as they do actually play country music, which some country bars do go away from later in the evening. But they took all the chairs and tables away so there is no where to sit unless you overpay for a booth on the outskirts.
Definitely won't be back and don't waste your time going as there are so many better places to hang out in Scottsdale. What a disappointment coming from My wife's favorite country artist. He could do so much better"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. How can a place called whiskey row have very little choices of whiskey and then when you order the one you want they are out. And then try ordering a beer and they are out. Employees have no personality. Shit service with shit food."}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try and really enjoyed the first night there.  Unfortunately it all went downhill from here on our second vist when we went with some friends.   Nothing to do with service or really the food.  Although I will say portions are pretty small on some of their dishes(chicken and waffles specifically) and beer seems a little pricey(9 dollars for some of the ipas).  It all was good until the table next to us was sat and was acting quite rambunctious and impaired upon arriving. With this being said they were still served alcohol.  The super drunk at the table decided it would be cool to flip women at the bar off  and call them not so nice names. All this going on while none of the staff noticed ANY of it.  Upon leaving the one fella decided to ask us what we were staring at.  I simply stop and ask him why he is asking us that and why he was acting the way he is and next thing you know super security guard swept in laying hands on my friend for no apparent reason.  Telling us to leave and laying hands on people before you know what is going on is not the way to do business.  The manager came out and acted like he was concerned about the whole situation, but clearly didn't care because as we left the other group was still their cutting it up and having a jolly old time.  Clearly they knew them or just didn't care to kick them out.  In summary if your looking for a place that has small portions, overpriced beer, and condones their patrons to be demeaning towards women then this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Whiskey Row has a great sports bar and diner atmosphere, and is nestled right in the middle of the Heritage District of Gilbert, AZ. So, beside having a blast at Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row, you can spend time up and down this revitalized Street. 

I had the chicken and waffle plate, which I have been wanting to try every time I've seen it at various restaurants. I love fried chicken, and I love waffles, so why not both! Whiskey Row landed a win here, with sliced jalapeños and a maple syrup infused gravy atop.

If you're in the area, don't miss out on the district, and while you're there, grab a chicken and waffle plate at Whiskey Row!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Went with friends at 1130am on Sunday for brunch. We were told there was a half hour wait and the restaurant had several empty tables.  Once we were seated we were told there was a 2 hour limit on the table.  Service was mediocre. Food was good.  Live music was great.  This place could be so great if it was managed properly. As we were leaving there was a considerable amount of people waiting with many open tables...."}
{"text":"Had a great time, but the patio couches are really dirty and gringy!! We were there during happy hour and apparently the appetizers we ordered were not on happy hour so a little disappointed with the staff not knowing what was what!!"}
{"text":"They have Cornhole here, my favorite lawn game.  But the boards are way too far spaced apart.

I also felt like a mom here - I'm barely 33 but again, it is in the ASU neighborhood so it was littered with college kids."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this location, as the other two locations are fantastic. However, I'm not a super model, nor am I a frat guy. So I got sh**t for service. I stood at the bar for a solid 20-30 minutes while the bartenders serviced everyone around me. The only reason I received service is because I was literally the last person standing there waiting. I made several attempts to order drinks and get the bartenders attention. I even stood there as a young man came up behind me and shouted his order to the bartender over my head. The bartender pointed him out, and literally took his order as I'm standing directly in front of him. Turns out they're buddies apparently. And forget trying to get service from a female bartender if you're a female, they pick and choose who they serve based on looks, muscles, and tattoos. It's absolutely ridiculous that these bartenders sit there and hand pick who they serve and who they don't. I'll drive to Scottsdale or Tempe before I come back here, and I literally live 3 minutes away. The customer service needs to be looked into here. You can have a great time and get crappy service and it ruins the whole thing..or you can have a crappy time and have great service and still have a good experience."}
{"text":"Went here for fathers day. Had the whiskey wings they were amazing got it free with the yelp app and had 32oz pitcher of beer for a penny. Have cool games and live music great spot to go have drinks."}
{"text":"Good food.  Started off kinda ruff.
However.. Management stepped in an made it a great experience. .
Rudy H. And LJ took care if us.."}
{"text":"Rudy and the crew are taking care of Broncos Nation today in  Old Town Scottsdale. .
Amazing game and great food.."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this restaurant several times, and each time we've been pleasantly surprised. It's awesome to sit next to one of the huge open windows. It really brings the outside in. Service has always been good, and the food has always been excellent. We've only been there for lunch, but everything that we've ordered has been outstanding. I would highly recommend at least checking it out."}
{"text":"Wow, I must say that was one of the worst bar/restaurant experiences I have ever had. The bartender was surly, rude and generally unpleasant. Not only that, she would take your drink even though you are not finished with it. 
The food was sub part, just not prepared correctly. 
Dirk, I like your music, but you should rethink the restaurant business....... Just saying"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last week and had a great experience!  We had family visiting from out of town and I knew my nephew was pretty picky.  He was thoroughly happy with his burger and fries and I really enjoyed my turkey pretzel melt sandwich with brussel sprout slaw - yummy!  The atmosphere was fun, the service was great and the food was surprisingly good!  I will definitely be back for happy hour as they seem to have some pretty great specials."}
{"text":"Ugh great spot but FAR too crowded. Takes a while to get a drink.  Food is good but very pricey. Dance floor needs to be bigger, need to play country music not remixed hiphop songs."}
{"text":"We took the family on a Saturday evening, 4/14/18, we only picked due to no one standing out front.  Gilbert was packed.  Checked in, music was so loud I couldn't understand if she said 25 mins or 45 mins.  We were seated within 20 mins.   Took about 25 mins for someone to even approach our table.  After she took our order we never saw her again.  Food came out after 30 mins, every plate was cold. And we didn't have enough silverware, still no one stopped.  I did notice about 10 guys walking around with security shirts,  not one person stopped by our table.  We had to flag someone down for water.  Food was ok, nothing to write home about.  It was so loud we couldn't talk at the table.   The whole experience was disappointing, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends on a Saturday afternoon after adulting real hard and running errands all day.

Lets say I got there between 3:00-4:00 ... they were not packed by any means. We were there for drinks and socialization and for some reason, we were told we could not have a server and had to order our drinks at the bar...??  Alright, Party of 8, without a server at one of the tables along the sidewalk. Awesome.

After a few hours we decided we wanted some food...requested a server for that component...after 20 minutes of waiting, we decided it was time to close out our tabs and go elsewhere since asking one of the many young ladies chatting around the bar to take our orders was a bit too much work...As you can imagine closing 6 tabs (some of our party were couples) took another 20 minutes and finally when the last tab was being closed a server came over to the table...

If you are looking for country music and average drinks to sit on a given afternoon? Sure give it a whirl, the seats are comfy, the girls are nice to look at and the beer is cold."}
{"text":"Legitimately the worst bartenders in Scottsdale.  Waited (and I timed it) 28 minutes for one of them to stop chatting with each other to get a drink and close my tab.  I could understand if they were busting their ass and just super busy, but they were just lollygagging and socializing.  If there weren't Broncos games this place would be worthless.  Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and unlike a lot of reviews I read, the service was very good ... especially for how busy they were.

We had drinks, watched a football game, enjoyed a little bit of the band and ate.  The food was ok. I wouldn't say it was the highlight of the night by any means because none of us were overly impressed.  It definitely was not bad.  I would go again and try other dishes.  I shared the half chicken with my friend with a side salad. Salad was just some greens with balsamic. Chicken was very tender, but not seasoned well. Another friend had the fish and chips.  I tried the fish and it was really good... but there were only two strips of fish... not enough to get full on.  Another had the pork chop.  He said it was just ok.  And my son had a burger which he said was good.  So... overall the food was average.  

You will be spending some coin at Whiskey Row!  Atmosphere is fun, inviting, and very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Dierks Bentley's Wiskey Row is a fun bar with interesting sights but great music. I was totally amused by the dancers on the bar who either look really bored or like they hate their lives. It's also a spectacle when the servers bring out the bottles for the tables with bottle service. The servers (women) were holding bottles with sparklers while riding on the shoulders of men. Were these guys the bouncers or were they hired specifically just to carry the girls on their shoulders? Lol. I love country music though, so I was digging the uptempo beats on top of my favorite pop country songs. Whiskey Row also plays top 40, so I thought that there was a decent mix of songs I heard while I was there."}
{"text":"Venue is really great but they have a LOT of details they need work out..  We put our name in Saturday at 5:30pm understanding there would be a wait but they had not called within 90 minutes so we finally ate at Postinos.  They finally text us 3 hours later to say they had to stop seating because kitchen could not keep up but will give us a free entree on a later visit.  People continued to stand  in long lines to get in even though there were at least 10 tables with reserved signs which was odd because when I called they said we could not reserve a table.  Could be a lot of fun for drinks, games and music after they figure staffing and service out.  Should not have been this hard given they have other locations in the area that they could have leveraged for a smoother opening.  We expected some chaos but this really was a  disaster.  I am being generous with my 3 star rating because the concept is awesome and I will try again in a few months when out of busy season and they have hopefully gotten things worked out.."}
{"text":"Think to yourself, \"What do you expect from a Dierks Bentley country bar in Scottsdale, Arizona?\" And that's pretty much exactly what I got. I mean, we stopped in mostly to say we'd gone there, and the pure Dierks Bentley country bar magic began to flow right away.

It began with bottle service. We didn't get bottle service, but someone did. In the which, a woman with camouflage shorts and a tight top got on some dude's shoulders, and they walked across the bar floor with some LED lantern and shot off confetti. It was so odd and just goofy but it's exactly what you'd expect from a Dierks Bentley country bar.

Then, the real achievement for the night: the band starts playing. There's a loft (?) above the bar, in the which the band set up the LOUDEST sound your ears will ever bleed to. I dunno what they looked like, though. Because the loft is so far up there, it might as well be a Pandora feed of shouted rock/country, as you'll never ever see them. 

The real home run, however, was just after the band started playing and two camo shorts girls got up on the bar to dance. And by dance, I mean, completely and totally go vacant while robotically shifting from side to side. \"Did I turn off the iron?\" one is thinking to herself. \"I wonder if we'll see a rejection of the economic policy suggested by Friedman and his pro free trade positions in favor of protectionism?\" the other one considers as her glassed-over eyes focus on the Scottsdale sky. Bless their hearts, they're very attractive and very over the idea of bouncing on a bar. It was horribly perfect.

This place is a perfect tenner. You have to stop in for like, 10 minutes. It's worth the show. I don't drink, but it looked like they're heavy on the row and light on the actual whisky. It's a well drinks kind of spot. Go in for the ironic profile pic, watch some magic, then get somewhere else where you can hear yourself think, and not sit under the watchful glazed-over eyes of the camo shorts crowd."}
{"text":"I gave this place a chance again, the service was on point. Attentive staff, helpful and efficient. The new manager stepped up the game and made it happen. Great job"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink with my fiance and my brother before dinner elsewhere. The service was okay.. it was not packed at the bar by any means, and it still took a few minutes for someone to acknowledge us and get our drink orders. It wasn't unbearable but it's not like they're super quick. The drinks were reasonably priced - we didn't order anything crazy, just two beers and a simple cocktail. We didn't order food because we had other dinner plans but based on the other reviews I'm not sure I would anyway.

I thought the setup was great. There were lots of TVs and lawn games like corn hole and Jenga. I could see it being a lot of fun for daydrinking.  Yelp describes three stars as \"A-OK\" and I feel like that's totally what our experience was, with nothing being overwhelmingly good or bad. I think we'd go back for drinks for sure, especially if there was a big game on or if we wanted to spend some time hanging out."}
{"text":"We are so happy that they have arrived.  Awesome place with live music and really great service. Eric is awesome as are every bartender we have dealt with.  Any issues with military  service  members or tattoos was Way overblown they are very pro military and patriotic ...I highly recommend this place...for whatever that's worth"}
{"text":"I love coming for Broncos games! The staff is friendly and seems genuinely interested in you comfort. Christina was my bartender and she made sure she knew me by name. At the Whiskey burger. Cooked perfectly and tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Good looking wait staff, BAD service.  Food was average.  The ambiance is nice, but the bad service and the kids hanging at the bar left me with a negative reviews.  People, please don't bring your kids to the BAR! Wtf?!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere great drinks,  good specials. Bands are always on point.  Food is typical bar food. Other good places in walking distance to e you down town Gilbert"}
{"text":"Went here for their brunch. While they do have a cheaply priced mimosa option for $3 it came with ice and the taste was not great. Their bloody Mary still costs $7 on their specials but the taste was good so I'm okay with that price. The food is just decent. 

The pluses for this place: service was awesome, friendly, and prompt."}
{"text":"The employees here have zero consideration for customer safety. Last night my friend went outside to have a cigarette, leaving her purse and phone inside with her friends. When she tried to go back in they said she was too drunk to enter. After telling them that her purse and phone were inside the bouncer would not let her get her things, nor did they have any employee bring her her things. They did not have to let her back in but it is their responsibility to make sure their customers are safe (according to the Arizona liquor board). There's no one that answers the phone there, so I can't contact a manager. I am disgusted that they would not allow someone to get her belongings and did not care about her safety at all. What kind of establishment makes a girl walk off alone with no phone or purse at 1 am? Still waiting to hear from a manager. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"on a charity bike ride.  This place jacked the charity out of $250 bucks.  They also made terrible drinks very slowly.  I will never go back to a Wiskey Row....Ever... Rude thieves work here. #boobcruise.   Oh and a 3% tech fee was pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"My wife and I met my brother and his wife out in Gilbert last Friday at Whiskey Row. I was hesitant at first but boy was I wrong!!!
The first cocktail I had was one of their signature drinks called Dierk's Lemonade. It's made with watermelon, elderflower liquor and bourbon and it is Dangerously delicious. My wife had The Little Heartbreaker  which she thought was really refreshing. 
The food? So good.... the grilled wings were great and their take on chicken and waffles was terrific as well.We then split the Kale and Quinoa Salad and I added Shrimp to mine. They were happy to accommodate us. My brother loved his Patty Melt and they got the brownie for dessert which looked so good. 
This place is really cool with a great vibe, perfect for a night out!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today much better!  Music wasn't blaring easy talking volume.  Service was excellent! 
We'll be back"}
{"text":"First time ever coming here when the sun is up, and it won't be the last! Killer food, great atmosphere and killer food (oh wait, I already said that). Burgers are top notch and the staff does a great job. See y'all soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing service from our server Kori! She was so attentive, remembered everything with such a large group, offered without even being asked to charge my friends phone and split the check for us without asking. Amazing artichoke dip too!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great.  Music is good.  I hear the food n drinks are great too.  However, on a very slow Thursday night, we sat in the bar for over a 1/2 hour without being acknowledged.  A lot of places in downtown gilbert to get a drink and more coming.  Tonight one of them gets our business."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place!  Its probably one of my favorite restaurants/bar to go to any night of the week.  The atmosphere is fun and electric and the food is fantastic!

One of those awesome nights was this past Saturday when I hosted my best friend's birthday party at Whiskey Row Gilbert.  I had made prior arrangements with the Event Coordinator and while she did an awesome job with communication, the reservation hadn't been made on time since we were communicating almost right up to the event.  No one's fault.  It's just how it happened, but when I explained to the Bar Manager what had happened and what I needed, he came to the rescue.  My hero! :) Matt Thompson helped us find two big tables to accommodate our big party and then he went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, taken care of, and brought us all a complimentary round of shots from the bar to get the party started.  Our server, Sara, was also incredible, very, very personable and never left us hanging, never left us waiting for our orders.

Talk about customer service!

This is our go to place.  In fact, my birthday is coming up and we are reserving tables for that night as well because really, where else would I want to go but to a place where I know I'll get treated well? Seriously?

My favorite restaurant for dinner and my favorite bar to hang out and dance.  Hands down!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this place so we decided since we were on the east side of the valley today we would try it out. It pretty much is a bar , lots of sports on different TV's, and waitresses wearing barely nothing. The service was ok , I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwhich hold the onion rings. I guess if you like food with a little kick then this is your place. The BBQ was good but a little too spicy for me , even the French fries tasted odd. 
When it came time to pay we noticed the waitress did not take off the groupon so we had to ask her to re ring the check, which she happily did.
Overall not my kind of place , but if you like food with a little kick, loud music and lots of beer, then you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I don't know, complaining about beautiful skinny waitresses at a bar seems a bit weird. I'm a girl and I see no problem with it!

Now on to other matters. This is not fine dining by any means. You go here to drink, to eat upgraded bar food and to listen to music.  And Whiskey Row is certainly overpriced for what you get.

You won't get fine service either from those pretty waitresses. But that kind of falls in line with the scene there. Honestly, I wouldn't expect anything less.

That being said, I do like the large, open atmosphere and they were fine with our party bringing in some younger kids. They have ping pong tables and some kid-friendly activities.

There are many other, and better, places to go in downtown Gilbert. But this place is what it is, and has carved out its own strange niche. I think it's a fine addition to the downtown scene."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, it was very crowded (which is what it should be) and the music played was good. New country mixed with current music and very easy to dance to. Drink prices we're normal for the atmosphere and not too pricy. Hard to get bored with much space to dance and when you get tired of dancing there is corn hole and giant Jenga. Minimal seating during the night time."}
{"text":"The most unprofessional bouncers in the world. Want to be fighters and start problems with the customers. I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Large raucous space, solid bar food, and a great place to enjoy afternoon happy hour with friends or without friends if that's your thing.  Friendly staff was efficient and the beer selection satisfyingly comprehensive."}
{"text":"The service here was wondeful! Tatum was super attentive and knowledgeable on all menu items. We stopped in for brunch this morning and it was all delicious! The Blueberry Moonshine Pancakes were delectable.  It was the perfect mix of tangy and sweet. I highly recommend it! My husband had the Country Fried Steak. The gravy was super good and not heavy at all. The steak was cooked really well and perfectly crispy. Make sure you stop on in."}
{"text":"Cluster @&$\". No service. After waiting at the bar for 15 minutes to order a drink, we decided to go elsewhere. Not even a look from any of the bar tenders so took business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I think I died and went to country heaven!!! Came here during spring training. We actually grabbed drinks DURING a Giants game, and the place was pleasantly comfortable, with great music playing. Drinks were relatively inexpensive, and apparently, when you have a ticket from a Giants game, you get your first beer free-ish. There was a DJ playing and by the looks of it, it gets a little rowdy. Only way I would want to add to this place would be some corn hole to generate some competition and conversation. They have digital beer taps at tables sitting around the center bar, which of course, has a dance floor ABOVE it. Super fun bar, I will be back for sure very soon. It may even be the location of my bachelor party. I will definitely be back when I am in Scottsdale again, and quite possibly another trip just to swing by again."}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday lunch. Food was amazing and the atmosphere was very fun. Lots of beers on tap too."}
{"text":"May possibly be the best bar ever.  My friend and I were in Arizona for a convention and we were at this place at least three out of the five nights and for Sunday football.  We created a \"beerlympics\" while we were there and played the games they had consisting of Cornhole, Connect Four, Ping Pong, XXXL Jenga, and Foosball.  Great time and the food was also very good.  Had the whiskey burger and southern fries.  Southern fries were amazing.  Over 50 beers on tap and also redneck cocktails on tap.  Country music also of course."}
{"text":"The sexiest new country bar on Broadway. 

We arrived at 4pm and got the last seats. A band was just starting and it was in between meal times, yet this place was packed. We ordered food and by the time we left, it was insanely packed. There was a massive line out the door that night too, even in the freezing cold when all of the surrounding bars had no line. So dang desirable! 

The food was great- lots of sandwich and fry combo options that were decent quality. The service was quick and the band was awesome. They weren't playing country music the whole time, but they did a fun mix. The bar has cool lit-up signs, lots of TVS, a rockin dance floor, stage, and sleek design. 

Exciting to have a new, modern spot on the strip!"}
{"text":"My second time here was yesterday for Yoga. I will never be back not even for a night out. Why allow Yoga to be there if we customers are such an inconvenience to your establishment and staff. The \"manager\" or whatever he was should not be in this business and needs to respect his customers. We bought drinks and our large group was going to stay for food but after the so called service we received we decided to take our party elsewhere. Yoga ends at 930am and you open at 10am but is it really necessary to take the Yoga teachers nicely rolled yoga mats and throw them? I walked over and grabbed them because that is not ok. Ask us to move them if they are in the way but throwing other peoples property is not ok. We were basically pushed and shuffled around so the staff can get everything put back together. I have never felt so unwanted as a customer in my life. I strongly believe there is more to a reason why our party was treated so bad and its disgusting this still exists."}
{"text":"Out for Sunday Funday, decided to give Whiskey Row another chance. Once again, extremely disappointed with the poor service. Can't wait for Ohso & The Yard to open to show this place what customer service is all about.


Hey, Kevin. The issue lies with your main bartenders. They act As though you are putting them out when you asked for a mixed cocktail. This has been a trend sent you opened the bar. I will be sharing this negative experience with all that I know. Your service is ridiculous"}
{"text":"We attempted to come here on St Patty's and ended up enjoying an evening at Zinburger instead. We showed up at 7:30 and were told that there would be no tables available until after 10:30 pm but we were welcome to try and find a place to stand by the bar. Too bad.... looks like a pretty cool place to have a beer or two. Oh well! We won't be trying again."}
{"text":"Struggling to give 2 stars.  Service was terribly slow. So slow we decided to leave and skip dinner all together.  Strangely the restaurant was only 30% full and many seats open at the bar. Had reservations @ 5:00 but not needed as it was empty.  Sat at the bar, ordered one round and a pretzel with intention to order dinner next.  Service was so slow we left and had dinner down the street."}
{"text":"Went in last night with a group of 7 on my recommendation from a pleasant previous visit. We arrived and were seated right away @ 6:30. It was 10 min before we were greeted by our server Taylor. We all placed our drink orders and didn't receive them until 7pm. It was not busy at all. Bad way to start off. We were told by our server Taylor that the bartender was new, thus the reason for the 1/2 hr wait? Not impressed. Where was manager or trainer overseeing the new bartender, and we all ordered either draft beer or wine, so no fancy cocktails. We also ordered some appys for happy hour. All but one came so we had to remind our server, so can't blame that on the bartender. We then all ordered dinner. It was fair at best. Food was not hot. Small portions for the cobb salad. It came with a soft boiled egg, which I didn't read on the menu, so asked for a cooked on, which they couldn't do. That was my fault. Manager stopped by to apologize for poor everything. We won't be going back and too bad, such a cool atmosphere. They need to train their staff and upgrade their food quality. so disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night and the place was busy (good sign). Our waitress was nice and all four of us got something different. Each of the meals were good. Only issue is we sat at a large booth which made it next to impossible to talk to the people at the other side of the booth. The environment at this restaurant is extremely loud so factor that in if you go there. My suggestion is to ask for a table as they are smaller and I would assume they make it easier to have a conversation. We will try that the next time we go."}
{"text":"The only thing I found interesting about the place was the self tap tables which I didn't sit at. The service was horrible, my Bloody Mary was disgusting, and the place was a sausage fest ( too many guys). Also I was extremely disappointed by the small dance floor. I knew Dierks Bently was a sellout when they opened their bar in old town Scottsdale. This place is not true to country roots at all."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time here tonight. Great service, excellent food and of course Dierks making a visit topped it all off!  We had the artichoke dip, fried pickles, and southern fries...amazing and half price at happy hour. Everyone was courteous and friendly, even security team!"}
{"text":"Felt very disgraced and put down the bouncer would not let me and a girlfriend in due to the fact we could not answer the name of the team on his hat. It had nothing to do with an Arizona team which is the state we live in nor were we intoxicated. I felt it was a sexist statement and derogatory question. I hope this review helps other women avoid this bar and helps the management better equip its staff for future visits."}
{"text":"When the wife and I can find a sitter on a Friday night, this is where I like to go.  The main reason I come here is because we like to dance and this is about as \"modern country\" as Phoenix has to offer.  Generally we'll drop in about 9pm and have some food and socialize, then at 10pm the live music and dancing starts in earnest.  The last time we went the band was Georgia Chrome and they play a good mix of country tunes and couple rock tunes (Journey, AC/DC) as well.  It's nice.  If you value your hearing, you'll wear some ear plugs, though.  This place gets very crowded after 11:30pm - as in \"I can't get to the bar\" crowded.  But once I do get to the bar, I haven't had much difficulty ordering drinks so long as you use good bar etiquette and stay clear of the bar dancers.  My only complaint is that the dance floor could be larger.  But we'll sometimes find a less crowded spot away from the dance floor and get our groove on.  When we leave at around 1am, there is always a full house and a line out front."}
{"text":"A country themed bar with no manners of what a gentleman or host should be! There were 2 ladies that had stools at the side bar and had already cashed out but security rolls up and tells them for space saving purposes that they had to take their stools literally removing them from where they sat!!! They could of waited a few minutes knowing they just paid and there was not immidiate room saved since now they were just standing...Also way over priced...for 2 domestic bottles and 2 shots of fireball came to a whopping $30...disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"Really cool place if you're into country music and decor and everything. Ran into it unexpectedly and had a few happy hour drinks. The bartender was really nice and I loved the interior decor as well as how it opens up completely to the outside! The Bloody Mary was great and they had a really big menu of cool drinks."}
{"text":"I'm  not a country fan. My friends are... they liked this place.

I do have to say, the pay per ounce beer seating looked damn cool, I do want to try that if I go back.

The \"red bull\" vodka did NOT taste like Red Bull, but I guess that could have just been me.

They have an extensive list of beers and great indoor / outdoor seating. I may go back next time I'm in Scottsdale and I'm getting dragged around."}
{"text":"So disappointing. We were so excited to find a Broncos bar. We were off to a late start Sunday 9/13/15, arrived at about 1:15pm, so we knew it would be almost impossible to find a seat. We were right. Standing room only. But we noted how much room the patio had where at least 3 hightop tables could have fit to be more accommodating on busy days. We also noted that ZERO staff even spoke to us except the security guy checking IDs. The waitresses were busy, sure, we get that. But to completely ignore two people who were attempting to patronize this establishment (we would've come for every game, tip really well & write Yelp reviews) was plain rude. The waitresses all looked annoyed. We were never asked if we needed anything, never directed to an area of the overcrowded bar where we could order, never told when we could expect a table, never even saw a smile or eye contact. We left a little pissed & won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had a great time here last weekend! The Chargers were in town so there was a big Charger fan meetup planned here. They welcomed us with open arms! The drinks were great, the food not so much. Now, I am not a country girl...I am a city/beach going girl so I don't ever listen to country. In fact, I loathe it, but despite all of that I had a great time here! Our server was attentive and very friendly. The customer service was amazing! Thank you Whiskey Row for making our stay even better. They helped soothe my achy breaky heart after a crushing 1 pt loss to the Cards!

Go Bolts! :)"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang before Sun Devil football games. Good service and comfortable surroundings."}
{"text":"Shitty Customer Service, the women bartenders are more worried about their looks, i.e. ass hanging out of shorts,  than serving customers. You have to yell or wave them down and when you do they look at you like you're  the problem.  Great atmosphere other than all the San Fran Giants crap."}
{"text":"Everyone in our group enjoyed their food.  We especially loved the sliders.   Cute rustic atmosphere.  There is even an area where kids can play oversize Jenga and that bean bag game.
They advertise themselves as a Packer bar and it was fun to watch the game while we ate.
The only downside is that at $8 a pop for a Bloody Mary, I would have expected them to actually put some vodka in it."}
{"text":"1st time here today for Happy Hour and will definetly be back!! Drinks, food and staff were all super great"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went for the first time on a Wednesday night - so it was not very packed. I have seen photos from weekends where the place is standing room only. The service was extremely quick and the food delicious. The music was a little loud for conversation, but overall, I loved it. Will definitely be back and I highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Whiskey Row is a great night-time spot, if you're going out in Old Town and you don't mind paying $12-$14 for a small glass of moonshine. The tables have taps that are kind of unique - you can pour your own beers, and at the end of the night, they charge you for the volume of beer that's been poured.  Honestly, if I were rating this place on the night-time vibes alone, I'd probably give it three stars. The service is pretty awful, but the place is cool and the honky tonk vibe is unique, relative to the rest of Old Town. (Being from Tennessee myself, I appreciate having what feels like a little vegas'ed-up slice of Nashville out here in AZ.)

Now, the DAY time rating for this place ought to be a single star. The food is mediocre, the service is terrible and no one seems to really care that it's bad. I've been here for brunch twice. The badass bloody mary comes with an awesome slider (probably the best thing I've had there), but the drink itself was WAY too sweet. I have no idea what they're putting in it, but it was almost too much sweetness to drink. The omelette was unseasoned and cool, like it had been sitting. (The rest of our table was pretty disappointed with their food too. about 6 of us had bloody marys and only one person really enjoyed theirs.) The service is slow, inexperienced, and if I had to guess, the girls who spend the night dancing on the bar (no judgement here - it's just that they might be a little better at the bar-dancing than serving. I've been a server - I get that it can be tough... but the place wasn't slammed either time that I was there and the service was still awful). 

On our second trip, we ordered some fried pickles as an app. The server that brought them out dropped half of them on the floor and 15 minutes later, brought us TWO individual spears of fried pickles to make up for it (less than what had been dropped). You only get like 8 in an order, and honestly, if you drop half of it, you ought to just bring another order or at LEAST what you dropped! We repeatedly had to flag people down for refills and ultimately, checks. For the price of brunch here, you'd be much better served to go over to RnR, Breakfast Club or Daily Dose. RnR is constantly packed, but at least their servers pay attention to their tables, and you get a decent amount of food. This will be an occasional evenings only place for me in the future."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food, awesome service, and a laid back vibe. Glad we chose Whiskey Row for a small Birthday get together for one of my longest childhood friends. Of course we are all grown now in our 30s, and trying to get together with kids in tow on a week night was a challenge. 

It ended up being the perfect spot. My friends' kiddos had a blast playing Jenga and bag toss while we sat nearby and caught up on old times. Our server, a young blonde girl (sorry, I don't remember her name) was super sweet and attentive. The manager and bartender were also very accommodating to us. Even took our photos a few times. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and southern fries (OMG delicious) and I enjoyed the JIMBO cocktail. I would definitely recommend this place for a low key and fun weeknight. 

I'm sure the weekend is a whole 'nother animal, but I wouldn't mind checking out this place in it's peak party time slot. Thank you Whiskey Row for making our night memorable--i was pleasantly surprised! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food...service was good at first, then large group came in and I think she was just overwhelmed.  Definitely will go back here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops for delicious hearty bar food! I always get the chicken and waffles, but their whiskey wings and the fries are also spectacular! It's also a hoot if you like live country music, or keg service at your table! Check them out, opening soon in Gilbert, too!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's hard to get good service in here if you're sitting and eating but the food was amazing I was surprised at how good the food was actually for a bar but I like that they open it up and there's lots of air in there also it's always got the game on which is a huge plus considering I watch SEC it is loud and they do play country music when I've been here all the time sometimes it becomes a little monotonous also please note that if you don't like waitresses a really short clothing you probably shouldn't come here or scottsdale altogether"}
{"text":"We've been to the one in Scottsdale, apparently there must be a demand for this bar to make a 2nd one within 10 miles?
Saturday night, packed in college town, seemed ok. Our bartender seemed a bit annoyed that 2 40 year olds were sitting at the bar. We felt kind of slighted as we sat there. We did order a burger which was decent, nothing that blew us away, took 30 plus minutes to get it. Our experience in Scottsdale was WAAAYYYYY better than this. I have nothing bad to say about the bar except the snooty staff. When you have 20 bars to choose from within walking distance, I REALLY think your customer interaction and satisfaction should be ON POINT every second. We went and day drank the very next day and believe me.......we walked right past this place, no desire to go back in."}
{"text":"Came in with my boy DJ Circle to have the \"Chef Special\".....apparently reserved for friends and not on the menu! Mike the chef brought us the BBQ Rib pulled sandwich with slaw. Amazing. I don't even eat slaw typically. Next we had the \"Picnic Sliders\"....fried chicken sliders. Yes. Last we had the \"Mandingo Burger\". This looked like it was off of Man vs Food. Today....man won!! I didn't even know this place had food like this. Definitely coming back!! Thanks mike!! Compliments to the chef!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great music. wide open. Lots of seating. games (beer pong,ping pong) indoor/outdoor vibe is great. Happy Hour specials. great addition to downtown Gilbert. definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. But do yourself a favor and don't go for Sunday brunch. Corn Cake Benedict was basically hard boiled eggs on pancakes. And pancakes were burned. They lost our card when we gave it for payment. How does a great place get so dysfunctional?"}
{"text":"My hubs and I went here for a Saturday lunch (we kind of randomly picked a place) and it was fine... It seemed like it was a manager who seated us and he had no clue where to put us, so we said a booth was fine, and he put us in a booth that was seriously meant to seat about 12.  Our waitress got drinks quickly but that was the only thing that happened timely.  I had tomato bisque with grilled cheese (SO GOOD) and my husband had their Mac 'N Cheese burger.  We waited about 10 minutes for drink refills and another 10 minutes for the check and had to flag her down for that.  I think she had one other table...   It's probably a great bar at night, but I would not recommend anyone come here for lunch or anything.  I'm not sure why they're even open during the day...?"}
{"text":"Popped in here with a Broski of mine after work for a few beers and apps. Again, another tale of two experiences with a Tempe/ Scottsdale restaurant. Sat at the bar and ordered a Dos Equis and lime. Bartender was not friendly. Not mean or rude, just really indifferent to me being there. I then order the meatball slider and fries on happy hour for 5 bucks. Sweet deal if you ask me. The slider was done very well with the meatball pressed to be more like a burger. It had good sauce and cheese. The fries tasted very good but were not crispy. Like they had been sitting in there own heat and became soggy. Would have loved to eaten them crisp. 

More goodness: buddy shows up and we order the grilled wings for 11 bucks. Holy crap these things are good. So I pride myself on being a wing connoisseur as I eat them everywhere. Mainly because I don't need to attract women as I am taken and eating wings is probably the least likely food to eat to attract a chick lol. 

That is where the positive ends. The server then takes my beer menu from me doesn't ask if I want another, serves my buddy a second beer and then takes my unfinished Dos Equis and clears my setting. WtF. I know what your thinking, what did I say to piss her off. And I can honestly say, I didn't say anything rude or insulting to have my beer stripped away from me like a woman with a baby being ripped out of here arms. It almost brought a tear to my eye. 

So, we asked for the check, she ran my card, you know the one they take as you start a tab as they treat everyone like criminals as if you're going to skip out on your bill even though your 35 and dressed business casual, of which she didn't ask to run it as my buddy owed me HH and it was his turn to pay. Oh well, we left and went to Casey Moore's for a few more beers and had a much better time. 

Don't worry, I yelped that too."}
{"text":"Oh Whiskey Row, how I love you. Being from the South, it's a little piece of home right here in Scottsdale. I always have a great time. The music selection is awesome- they have amazing live bands. Georgia Chrome and Laura Walsh are some of my favorites. The stage is above the bar but sometimes they make a bigger one on the dance floor, which is kinda disappointing because the dance floor is the most fun. I've eaten some of their food items that were good but overpriced in my opinion. This bar is just a kick ass atmosphere and there's nothing like it in Old Town. 

The one bad experience I had was when I had an attack of my movement disorder while out one night at Whiskey. The bouncers and manager handled it so unprofessionally. They couldn't get me out fast enough when I just needed a minute. I understand the liability but a little compassion would have gone a long way than just treating me as if I was drunk."}
{"text":"Great location! Big bar with outside patios in front and back. People watching on the front patio made my night. I love the hummus and pita appetizer. Nice and helpful staff :) we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday and ate dinner. I got the Cobb salad and it was great. I ordered a Moscow mule to drink but didn't like it too much so the server took it back and I ordered something else. 

We stayed after dinner and watched the live band while drinking a few more drinks. I recommend getting there early to avoid the long lines. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Great service, lively atmosphere. Just don't EVER order the black bean hummus. I wouldn't feed it to my dog. I honestly thought I'd been punked when i a) looked at it and b) \"tasted\" it."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. Bar was pretty busy. We had a table and were there for about an hour when a staff member approached and said we were going to have to move, as our table was sold. I asked him how they could sell our table, as we were buying drinks and spending our money too. The bouncer proceeded to put me in a full nelson and threw me out of the bar. I highly recommend, not, frequenting this establishment."}
{"text":"This is not a great bar for a home team football experience.  We made a reservation for 10 people wanting to see our Cardinal team win. Had to ask the manager Kevin multiple times to get the game on TVs close to our table.  

The food is good, but the service is ok.  We waited for more than 10 minutes to get our initial drink ordered.

Agree with Sally D.  Holly was very nice but really slow"}
{"text":"Place is lame af. Worse experience here compared to any bar/club I've been to in the entire world. The only decent thing about this place is that the go go dancers are hard working and sweet. 

The bartenders - I waited forever to get the bartender to address me. After getting our shots, my group didn't have the patience to order any mixed drinks. Like I said, I've watched grass grow faster.  

The main reason I'm even writing this review is that the security here (primarily those who are tasked with carrying the waitresses around for bottle service) are extremely unprofessional. I was walking towards the bar when a giant security carrying a waitress on his shoulder decided to knee me in the back to make me get out of his way. 

I am a human being, you can say \"EXCUSE ME\" or have someone else gesture, but please do not contact my body in any way. I understand that I'm short and you're busy carrying girls so that they can serve some table with their bottles, but you need to understand that you can have another security guard help you clear the way with flashlights or use other ways to get my attention. 

Actions and employees like this subject this establishment to liability. But for the fact that it was our first night in Arizona, and I did not want to screw up everyone else's night, I would have taken this all the way up to management. 

I would never recommend this place to anyone. But if you're looking to wait forever for your drinks and be subjected to offensive contact, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin..

Food was horrible. How do you mess up a salad?
Over prices drinks, small size cup. Cider selection was crap.
Kelsey the server / customer service was terrible.
Took 20 minutes for her o ask if we needed help, after we went to the bar and ordered our drinks.
How do I have a 2 hour seating time, when NO ONE is even at establishment.

This place has a restaurant environment feel, with country music playing. Not like Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Overly aggressive bouncers, on slow nights bar tenders lack personality and 50/50 chance the draft beer taste old and stale. Only good thing is the DJ and bottled beer. food is so-so."}
{"text":"I can't wait to see Kelsea Ballerini! Whiskey Row- Gilbert"}
{"text":"Great and friendly service. I have been twice and ordered the steak salad and hummus appetizer, both are outstanding and I am craving them as I type! The salad dressing is a delicious mixture of a GOOD blue cheese dressing, balsamic dressing, and I believe a hint of lemon and garlic. I highly recommend trying it. Atmosphere is very comfortable and extremely spacious. I have only been on weeknights."}
{"text":"I really do like this place but so many negatives I had to give it a three. I'll start by saying the service and food is great! I enjoy the mini second level area which is perfect for a band to play. The beer table taps sound like a great idea but honestly it had major drawbacks. The beer took about three refills (16oz x .35) to stop foaming and poor properly. If youre there with a group forget about splitting the tab or figure it out beforehand. The waitress were dressed a little to skanky for a chill happy hour for me. Their red bras hung out the side and shirts were tied up high and shorts wore super low. I get it's Scottsdale but I thought they were trying too hard? Lastly, the parking!! Ahh it's impossible to find a place to park where you won't get towed or have to walk a mile. It's a fun place if you plan on staying all night but I would never go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"You can tell from an earlier post about the service problem we had. The Manager made contact to personally assure us that what we experienced would never happen again. We believe he's sincere and appreciated his apology and invitation to return very soon. We probably will but on a rotation basis instead of frequently as a favorite. Although the place is nice and the food's good, the brutal truth is with the rapidly expanding dining scene in the east valley, if a restaurant doesn't make your experience darn near perfect there are many others beckoning you in, and without a compelling reason to return to a particular place chances are the next or newest place will get a try instead. I also note from other recent posts that service here has been problematic for them as well."}
{"text":"What a letdown. The building itself is really cool and I imagine would be awesome with a live band and a full dance floor. But the staff is HORRIBLE. The hostesses weren't remotely friendly at all and told us our party of 5 would wait an hour when we arrived. Just like other reviews, there were plenty of open tables. 

While we were waiting I decided to get my husband and I a beer from the bar. I stood at the bar for a good 10 minutes being completely ignored by the female bartenders. No joke. I felt like I was invisible. No one would even look at me as I held up my cash. Finally I walked to the other end of the bar and a nice male bartender got our drinks. He was the only staff member in the whole place who smiled and wasn't terrible. 

When we finally got to our table our waitress was also not interested in providing any level of customer service. Service was slow for the place having very few tables. Food was just ok. 

We had high expectations for this place and were very disappointed. Will be going to restaurants in downtown Gilbert that actually appreciate our patronage and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. Do not love their flooring! Some staff was friendly others not so much. Drinks were good. Overall it was a nice place"}
{"text":"Went last night To have a few beers before the basketball game. Beer was cold and food was great. Service was also very good."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I was promptly seated. Playing over a speaker system was today's hit country music. Moments after being seated our waitress came over and introduced herself, offered us waters, and broke down the menu for us. A few minutes later she returned with the waters and asked us if we knew what we wanted. We didn't know so she gave us a few minutes but returned the second we decided, like some mind reader. We ordered and before we knew it our food was there. It was FANTASTIC. I ordered the pretzel turkey melt with a side of broccolini. The flavor was out of this world. With the melt, from the pretzel bun to the lettuce, you can taste every ingredient.
I know with some of these celebrity chain restaurants the service or food can me sub-par. This time Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row definitely delivered. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"First time being here since it opened. The bbq French fries and atmosphere was great but our server Maddie was the best! Fast and attentive service with a big smile on her face the whole time. Will definitely come back and see her again."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, or if you're looking for a country nightlife scene. Gets a little crowded for how big the place is, but the set up is great for getting around. Also has HUGE booths if you're looking to get a table for a bigger crowd!"}
{"text":"Long wait times, insufficient seating, low staff, and high prices. 

Waited 3 hours for a table only to be seated on table on the dance floor. 30 minutes later the bouncer is placing us on notice that they will need us to finish up soon as they will be removing our table for the start of the night. Take in mind we were still waiting for our drinks and food. As the night went on our waitress was nowhere to be located resulting in management interactions. In addition, the security staff where rushing us out of our table. 

Worst experience ever!!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in there were many tables with open seating, however, we were a party of 2 and didn't seem to know how to seat us. Once we got seated, a waitress took over 10 minutes to finally stop by and take our drink orders. Service overall needs some work. I had the Tennessee Hot slider and it was tasty, however, the fries were underwhelming and not pleasant. Definitely my least favorite food to show up to Downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Not very happy with my meal or the service we received. Waited too long for my drink and our food. Waitress was no where to be found. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Okay so honestly I came back because I got a gift card. The food wasn't great and the service was decent until it came time for the check. SO instead of bringing the check, our waitress, Kaylee, asks if we're done and I tell her I have a gift card for $25. She says okay and that she'll go check if it covers the whole bill. She comes back and says I need to pay one more dollar and for once I'm carrying cash so I give it to her. And then she never comes back with a receipt or any change. I have never had a bill where the amount was totally even so we have to ask the hostess if the waitress will bring me a receipt because the waitress had disappeared. Kaylee, our waitress, said she had to reprint it, and honestly I don't know why she wouldn't have given me the receipt when it printed the first time but anyway, here's the kicker: Whiskey Row rounds up your bill and they don't give change if it's not a whole dollar. So my bill was 25.75 and I had to specifically ask for my change back otherwise they would have just kept the money they owed me and I would have no idea because they also avoid giving receipts. Pretty sure that's actually stealing, at the least it's dishonest and shady. This whole thing was frustrating and embarrassing. Save yourself the trouble and go try somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday fun day in Scottsdale! They have great tvs for watching football and pretty good food. It's never too packed so you'll get a table easily if it's not a Broncos game (Broncos bar). Recommend for Sunday football watching. No cover or required amount on tables. They also have good brunch food and mimosa deal."}
{"text":"I have been to Deirks Bentley's Whiskey Row few times durning college football, which they host all Nebraska Huskers games. Every time we go have been great service and pretty good food for a sports bar. 

GO BIG RED!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere with two foosball tables out back plus beer pong, giant jenga  and corn hole off the main bar area. They have a country theme, but it is far from a country bar (in a good way)."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and its atmosphere. I only get out once a week now to grab a drink and dinner and the only place that comes to mind and wanna go to is always whiskey row. The music and food is great and I love the fact I can play some games as I drink. But by far the best part is the staff. Aubrey wentz is the sweetest server and Beth Crow is so down to earth, even when she's running  around the bar she always finds time to make my experience there the best."}
{"text":"The food wasn't good, the fries were burnt my Mac n cheese was super greasy the fried pickles were not worth a penny but the service was phenomenal.. I'm giving it 5 stars based on the nights so much fun.. Free shots, cool bar tenders, amazing drinks and great music!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The bartenders are all awesome and Angel is undoubtedly my favorite person there!! We come here on the weekends for good music (**Country  **) and dancing. The most annoying thing is how small the dance floor is which gets overly crowded and takes away from being able to actual two-step. Besides that, this bar is perfect! Love it for football Sunday's, live music during the week & shenanigans with he boys at night! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great spot located next door to our hotel. Our bartenders were amazing and the appetizers were delicious. Would def recommend stopping by"}
{"text":"Been twice now, the first time was a Friday night to have drinks. The place was huge and very busy but we got in pretty quick. There was a live band and a ton of people dancing and having a good time. I checked out the menu and decided to go back for lunch with some buddies. I had the Southern Fries which I recommend heavily I would also share as the portion is big. They were awesome loaded with white BBQ chicken and cheese and we added jalapeños. I also ordered some sliders Meatball, and Tennessee Hot and Picinic Chicken. They were all awesome and will definitely be getting again. My one  buddy got the fish and chips and those were killer as well. My other friend got a burger that had jalapeño and pepper bacon and it was cooked perfect and you could tell they use fresh ground beef. The server said it was a local beef company nonetheless it was awesome. We had a great server and the place was really chill for lunch. We had a few beers and looks like they have a good happy hour so I'll be back for that as well"}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but the bartenders here are absolutely terrible. I gave the bartender 100 dollars and asked for patron shots he gave me 6 shots, and then gave my other shots away to some guy who he thought was with me. After telling him he shouldn't have given my shots to anyone but me. He started helping two other girls and when I told him I wanted my shots he told me he was busy helping other people. MIND YOU I JUST SPENT 100 dollars at the bar. Also never got my shots back that he decided to give to some random people. Never again will this place get my money I wish I knew the bartenders name because he deserves to be fired."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and it's a fun place to go grab a couple drinks with your friends 
I've been in for dinner and it's super packed with long wait times so I returned for lunch with some coworkers 
I would recommend the lunch if your in a rush or don't like waiting over an hour for seating 
The food is good every time I've been here and the service has not disappointed either"}
{"text":"I was super pumped to check out this bar and it is an awesome atmosphere but don't come here from Oregon if you have a change of address sticker on your license. They'll bend it in half and tell you have a fake."}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour for the first time the other day! It was pretty decent. They didn't really have a specific Happy Hour menu, as per informed by the waitress, and the cider that was on Happy Hour had run out, but my Crispin cider was only $5.50 so I was fine with that. My friends had the Whiskey Cheese Pretzel, and I thought it was yummy! They also had the Southern Fries, which they loved, but I didn't--but that's just because I'm not really a fan of bbq sauce! Other than that I liked the dish. The location was pretty spacious--airy, roomy with lots of seating but one thing to note was the fact the live music was a little too loud (a lone guy playing a guitar) where we were seated. We were seated diagonally to the singer, a good distance away, so I felt the staff there should have been more observant to the fact that the music was too loud. My friends and I struggled to speak to one another and felt like we had to talk over the music. Live music is all well and good, but shouldn't be overly loud or overbearing to the audience. Other than that, I think this place seems like a chill spot to hang, drink and get a bite to eat. I'd like to come back and try their other main dishes--the prime flat iron steak sounds delicious! I've only been here on Friday nights and weekend nights; the lines are usually long and it usually is packed to the gills with sweaty, dancing people. I would recommend people to go this place during the day or during the evening when it's a lot more chill and less intense."}
{"text":"Savory, cheesy, delicious Southern Fries with the greatest service from our server Nicole. Whiskey Row is one of our favorite places to eat and drink. The food is reasonably priced and high quality with an awesome environment. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Husband and I thought we would try dierks and were so disappointed. Went in found a seat at the bar. Set there for 15 minutes and was never approached to see if we wanted something. There were alot of waitresses standing and walking around but not one approached us. We ended up walking out and went to a place that actually had service. Truly was excited to go there but very disappointed"}
{"text":"A place like no other in downtown Gilbert! Whiskey row has an atmosphere that's fun & energetic! Several beers on tap but not so many that you can't decide. Just the right amount to give every beer lover a good choice. The food menu also has several choices but you aren't overwhelmed by having too many choices. It's an open & fun environment that is still family friendly. Young & energetic servers are all over the place to help you with your needs. Great for a girls night out or just to hang out with your spouse. I have been given the opportunity to interact with the VP & I must say WOW! He is on top of all that is going on in his restaurant. With a VP like that this place is going to be nothing less than successful! Whiskey Row is the place to be in downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Aubrey was a great server. We had a selection of menu items and they were all great. The steak salad was really good. I had the Brussels sprouts that were really great. In the past servers had been on their phones but we didn't see that today."}
{"text":"Omg the Mac n cheese recommended by the bartender was so great! Dan kept the beer flowing during happy hour too. Such great service can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Came in to \"seat yourself\" sign at the entrance, then sat at a table next to another table already getting service, it's Tuesday so not very busy. Sat around for about 15 minutes before asking the bartender if we could get a server to come to our table (which was also right next to the bar), tried waving at the server nearest ya briefly. Set timer. Still sitting here without any service another 10 minutes later as I write this review. Obviously the review is based on the service or lack of it since we have not been able to try anything or even order yet."}
{"text":"Good appetizers, good food, good drinks - nothing was amazing.   Our server was great, the whole staff was very friendly.   The place is pretty cool, it's bigger than it looks from the outside.   The patio is awesome!  They have games set up outside on the patio.   I'll be going back :)"}
{"text":"Finally,  Gilbert has been needing a place like this for many years. Great bands; country and top 40 hits played, good drinks, dancing and more. Great mix of people of all ages."}
{"text":"Atmosphere  is fun! Live band plays all day on weekends. Food is really good! we had server Alexia and she gave amazing service!"}
{"text":"We went to Whiskey Row in Tempe on NYE, and mentioned concerns we had in a review. Kristopher the DJ answered my review & invited us to come back, so he could make it right. He sure did! Last night he treated us to cocktails & made us feel like VIP's at the Scottsdale location. I really appreciated his hospitality, and thank him for a super fun evening. If they treated me that special,  I'm sure they will treat you well too."}
{"text":"Sickest new place in old town scottsdale. Another addition to that block to make it the only place youll need to go to party. 

The food is super good surprisingly, i got the bbq chicken and potato salad. BOMB. 

If you get bottle service they have beer taps on the tables, and better yet they have hard alch on tap too. Once table has goose...on tap.... sickest thing ever. 

The lines are insanely long, but that should shorten as time goes by so definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Ok so we went for dinner for a Birthday Evening! Things were great, our waitress offered us more stools as our party grew and we ordered drinks, but the manager came over and told us we could not have the stools and be needed them back, as we were already sitting on them...because we didn't ask for them when we asked for a table! Really, you dont have extra stools to  accommodate a few extra people joining a large party who is about to drop a bunch of money, just cause we didnt anticipate a larger group! Sad! Customer service needs to improve! The food looked pretty but tasteless really, I dont think I will go back!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch when the wait was so long at the other places. Glad we did! We got seated right away. Service was quick and the food was delicious.
Usually I would not expect the food to be good at a bar however I was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"At first I thought it this place was just gonna be another bar in old town Scottsdale, but the food is actually really good, had the mac n cheese burger, and they also have quite a few unique drinks, got the cow tipper.  All the times that I have gone they have good music, if not a live band playing, and the Manager that has helped us several times, Courtney, always makes sure that the food and service is up to par... hopefully it stays fun and doesn't die out like a lot of places do in old town....One thing to keep in mind if you get a table inside, is that the beer/whiskey dispenser at the table charges per ounce and can add up pretty quickly!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing service.  I arrived about 6:15 to partake in Happy hour and saw several empty tables was told there would be a 10 minute wait.  Nearly 25 minutes later we were seated at one of the many empty tables.  During the wait I overheard other guests complaining about the lack of service but we still stuck it out. 

Long storey short we asked for  waiter and by the time she arrived with a very cold and what appeard to be a fake apology  Happy Hour was over.

Very poor experience to a great sports bar.  I guess we will be keeping our Whiskey Row visits to the Scottsdale location for after hours and night club purposes."}
{"text":"Maddie McKenzie was a wonderful waitress with fantastic recommendations. Food was wonderful and ambiance was 10/10. Will be returning."}
{"text":"This was my first time out in downtown Gilbert and I decided to check out this place since it's one of my favorites in old town Scottsdale. I went on a Saturday night, and boy was I surprised with how crowded it was. The line was wrapped around the building. When I say this is a country loving crowd I mean it: and I am one of those people. I always go to the one in old town Scottsdale hoping to swing dance and line dance but it doesn't quiet happen. If it does it only about half a song. This location is for those that love country dancing! I had so much fun. I was expecting to be drinks to be a little cheaper than in old town Scottsdale but they were exactly the same. It is a little expensive but I love it! I will be going back here for sure on those nights I'm looking to line dance. Also if you go a little earlier around 930/10 there's more people line dancing and swing dancing before other music starts playing. This place has a ground in their 20s to early 30s but also some that are older as well. This place also has a lot less people that are sloppy like old town. I liked and didn't like that they don't allow drinks on the dance floor. It was nice when I was swing dancing and didn't have to worry about any drinks flying around. It was obviously annoying when I was the one with the drink in my hand. This place was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"This was my first time in for lunch and I have to say that our cute blonde server named Hailey was very thorough with the menu and very patient with us since it was our first time. She had such a great attitude and a very cute personality. We definitely will be back and hopefully on a night Hailey is working so she can be our server."}
{"text":"First time visit today and it was a terrible experience. Despite the server Michelle's one good review, she was apathetic and 100% not customer service oriented. We waited 20 minutes to have my drink order taken. I asked some questions about the Bellini, and was confident about it, so ordered it. I got it and couldn't taste half of the ingredients--it also was not served as our server describe it would be. Supposedly, they were doing quality assurance follow-ups on the drink, but the server didn't come to check how I liked it for 20 minutes. I waited 30 extra minutes to close my tab with her. Not a great experience, service took too long, and server did not go the extra mile to assure we were 100% satisfied. Won't be coming here with our friends again."}
{"text":"Of all places for a country bar to open, Scottsdale is an interesting choice. I like this place particularly because of that very reason. If you've ever been to other country bars in Mesa, Glendale, Cave Creek. Most of the Scottsdale douche bags have given up on the bar and found their way next door to HiFi but I'm terrified they may return now that they're mixing country music with hiphop/EDM. Alcohol prices are very reasonable given the location, still waiting for a reason to try the food. I spoke briefly with a (Manager?) Courtney. I'm pretty sure she is one of the reasons (the mortar to the brick so to speak) this bar does so well after watching her work, as she's pretty on point about keeping it clean, stocking the bar and making sure everyone gets taken care of. Suggestions; next time you build a bar, don't design it so people stand around on the dance floor right in front of the bar. Keep playing the unmixed country music and bringing in Class A/B artists! Also couldn't hurt to try out the local talent!"}
{"text":"My first time going to Whiskey Row and is was definitely a great time! Our server, Hallie, made the experience one of the best I've ever had. She went above and beyond for every request. She chatted with us and was super quick about everything. Our food was also delicious. My only issue was how expensive the drinks were. I definitely would come back again and recommend this place and Hallie to every person I know! I am honestly shocked by the amount of \"poor service\" reviews. We had so many people check on us throughout our 2-3 hours stay that I can't imagine how anyone could say the staff is not attentive. 

Thanks Whiskey Row!"}
{"text":"Good pub food. Skillet steak was spot on and beer selection was ok. Our server was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Thank god the girls wear fake lashes because
the food takes an hour.  \"We were not ready for the 11am game\". Well start taking a lap around Scottsdale because you're a Broncos bar and the game was at 11:30am.  Maybe you should replace your GM with an unlimited bucket of coors lights."}
{"text":"Saw a movie at the nearby AMC and wanted to grab dinner after with my party. We started walking towards Gordon Biersch but saw Whiskey Row on the way. \"Hey let's give this place we've never been to a try\". Wish we hadn't. 

It was super loud inside (due to the TVs/sound system) -- to the point where we could barley hear one another at our table. Our server came fairly promptly and was nice. We put in our order and the beer came quick and the food followed soon after. Personally, I enjoy a gap of 15 minutes or so between beer and dinner but the food was out in under 10. That was impressive considering the place was fairly full. 

My main reason for the low star rating is the food was just so weak. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and it was so underwhelming and disappointing. It didn't taste abjectly bad but I've had much tastier McDonald's food for 1/4 of the price. When I order chicken and waffles I look forward to the sweet and savory. The fluffy waffles with syrup and then the crispy fried chicken. I got two tiny waffle pieces with some very bland honey. Both waffle pieces combined were about the size of one eggo or less. The chicken was little better but not much. Seemed like a costco bag of frozen chicken with some soggy crust. 

Whiskey Row is trying to do some sort of elevated fancy version of chicken and waffles and it failed hard. In fairness, some of the other members of my party got burgers and they said they were at least decent. When it came time to leave it look a long time to get our bill and then after waiting 10 minutes for out waitress to come pick up our credit payment we scrounged enough cash together for the bill so we could get get the heck out of there. They did a couple things right, and I don't think I got food poisoning or anything, but there are so many other good places around to eat I don't plan to come back until they get some legit chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and good food. Good service but sometimes the music is just way to loud like bad speaker loud."}
{"text":"Nick Vivola was my bartender tonight. It was only a Wednesday night and I still had so much fun. My bartender gave me excellent service. Wonderful crowd. I'll definitely be back. Great way to spend your night. I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go! Great specials. An AWESOME staff! Beth C was absolutely wonderful. If you're looking for great food and drinks this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Super awesome staff. Great food and drinks. And the place was lovely and so much to do. I brought my work team here on a business trip and everyone left with nothing but positive things to say. Highly recommend and the area around is awesome too."}
{"text":"Happy hour food and prices are great but don't stay a minute afterwards as prices are high.  Not sure why, but on the evening we were there, the entire restaurant smelled like strong fish  Will try one more time before making a final decision."}
{"text":"NOT GOOD. Food was bad bad bad.... Had hummus and it had enough garlic in it to kill a horse, the veggies were supposed to be pickled and they were bland, the moscow mule was definitely NOT made from fresh ingredients, the music was bad and the bathrooms were dirty. 

Seriously, only gave this two stars because our server was nice, when she decided to come around and we were able to get seated right away with a party of 7. 

I guess this is the kind of place you want to be drunk before you walk in the door. Otherwise, your expectations may be too high."}
{"text":"Meh. Went there this eve. Had the chicken strips with their overly sweet house ranch. The breading looks burnt and the onion rings are standard. The best thing here is the redneck cocktail 94 Chevy. Our server was friendly but the food is just mediocre. As a recent transplant from OR, but formerly from MO, I'm really frustrated by the fact that restaurants expect you to tip on the tax. You tip on the food and service, not the tax, so the \"helpful tip suggestions\" at the bottom of the receipt, irritates me. That isn't unique to this restaurant but it appears I'm not tipping well enough when I am. As for this place though.. it's just meh. I'd only come again for drinks and music in the future."}
{"text":"This restaurant started off on a bad note because I had my medical service dog with me as I was traveling from out of state and was refused service to eat inside the restaurant. When I assured Chris that this was a medical dog that I had her jacket on he said that he did not care because health department code in Arizona trumps federal code when it comes to medical service dogs. He said that if I wanted to eat I would have to eat outside on the sidewalk. I asked to speak to Chris' supervisor but he said that he was the only supervisor in charge.  My daughter really wanted to eat at this restaurant so I said OK. Our food took quite a long time to make it to our table.  Upon the 1st bite of the macaroni I knew it did not taste right. With the 2nd and 3rd bite I knew something wasn't right. I flipped over my macaroni only to see that the bottom side was completely burnt. I brought this to the attention of our waitress and I asked could she please bring me more Mac and cheese as this was burned. She apologized. About 15 minutes later I ask again for the Mac and cheese and she said that a new batch was on the way out and that she would bring it to me as soon as possible. I waited about another 15 minutes I never received more macaroni and cheese. My food should have been comped from this experience but it was not. I did not leave a tip. Instead on the receipt I wrote failed Ada and failed to give me my macaroni and cheese . Chris refused entry into the restaurant based on the fact that he said he did not believe my dog was a medical service dog. He should be fired."}
{"text":"I'm 'almost' sorry for giving a one-star review because I never actually had the opportunity to order food. We went here and apparently wandered into an area where we were not allowed to sit. We didn't see any signs telling us this, but some young employee came over to us and VERY RUDELY demanded that we leave. So we did. She didn't say \"I'm sorry, you can't sit here\" or \"I'm sorry, these tables (we were in the bar area) are reserved.\" She just rudely and arrogantly forced us to vacate. Sorry, Dierks, but we tried to eat here and were not able to. Most likely, we won't try again. We HAVE told all of our friends to be very careful if they try to eat here. There is a wonderful restaurant just across the street (actually there are about 10 wonderful restaurants just across the street) and we ate there instead."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beers on tap.  Great patio seating.  Stopped in for Happy Hour and got the Macaroni and Cheese from their appetizer menu. Definitely worth the stop if you're in Tempe."}
{"text":"Great food!

Great live band!

Not a lot of room to dance, as they moved the band to the dance floor.

Our order came out after a long wait, but they compensated us much more than I expected they would, so they definitely deserve high marks for making up for their mistake!  That made me respect them a lot! 

I would give them a 5 stars if their dance floor was better, but they definitely deserve 4 stars for everything else!"}
{"text":"Just want to say Victoria the bartender is GREAT! We were served by her a few times at the bar and she always remembered us. She is so sweet and attentive! We stopped by again and she greeted us and remembered us! Great bartender and server, so achnowleable! Love Whiskey Row, great happy hour, and service! Look for Victoria! We will be back again..."}
{"text":"Meat market. Rude to veterans. Not going there cause its a madhouse on Friday and Saturday. TOO LOUD."}
{"text":"I'm from California and my sister is a huge Deirks Bently fan and she heard about this place and so we went on a road trip to find it ! Delicious BBQ pulled chicken sandwich lunch :) and I really enjoyed my mason jar mimosa . We sat outside and watched the Arizona state football game . All in all we would love to come back at night and see what the crowd is like ."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Wanted to like it there. Service sucked, food mediocre. Drinks were good. Ping pong was great. Brussels sprouts were dry and tasteless. Mashed potatoes lacking flavor. Beer can chicken awesome. Server was more interested in hanging out with server buddies than providing service."}
{"text":"Gilbert, AZ!!! Amazing time, Mere was a lights out server. Kept our drinks full and had a great personality! Corn hole games are tons of fun!! Music is up beat and fun!! If your in Gilbert don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Whiskey Row website and made a reservation on it via OpenTable link they provided for a 7:15 PM table on Saturday night.  Guess what?  When I arrived they told me \"we don't accept reservations for Saturday.\" what the heck?  I did it off their website and told them.  The hostess apologized and it looks like as of this morning, they removed it from their website.

I was entertaining 2 beautiful ladies and wanted to make sure we had a table.  Well we ended up in a cramped up spot in a smaller bar.  

The energy was very lively.  But it looks like a lot of older ladies are here with their family and religious friends.  Don't bring beautiful women here because you will get snobbish looks from these religious types (it's Gilbert after all).  Religious snobs.  Can't stand them.  

Service on the main bar is very slow.  We actually went to the smaller bar and got much faster service.  Unfortunately, they don't offer any of the craft cocktails/beers on the smaller bar.  The bartender said, \"What you see is what you get.\"  lol.  She was nice and friendly enough.  And the patrons on the smaller bar seemed much nicer too.

The fried pickles and artichoke dip were very good but only if you take a few bites.  Craft cocktails were pretty good.  I had to wait an extremely long time to get it from the main bar.

Parking is not easy in Downtown Gilbert on a Saturday night either."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great staff. Great music! and food is surprisingly great as well! whether it's middle of a Tuesday afternoon or 10pm on a saturday night... this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Lively Country Bar In Downtown Scottsdale

Huge TV screens surround the walls and display videos as music fills the air. 

Bartenders dancing on the bar pour shots of Fireball Whiskey into the eager mouths of patrons. 

An interesting mix of young and old people dancing on the floor is interesting to watch."}
{"text":"Cool Atmosphere, Good Band, Then Weird Rap/Club Music?

The band last night was actually really good and made for some good background music for our birthday party. Hey really did a great job!

The atmosphere is cool, the ceiling is like a big wooden barn. Above the bar is the old western tin roof bar style. All in all it's got a good feel to it. 

Not much of a cider selection... Reds on tap for $6 per Little cup... They did have Strongbow cans for $6 too which were better... No Angry Orchards or Maynard though... Pretty high priced when you are buying cheap reds in plastic cups for $6 each though... 

If you are at a table you might as well get up and get your own drinks.... We sat down and 15 minutes went by before anyone said anything to us. Then she took the order came back and asked if we wanted a tab and I said we would just pay cash, and asked my total. She didn't know... How do you not know the total for 2 ciders?  

Friends arrived and over the course of 3 more hours only at one time did anyone ask if we wanted anything else so we contributed to work through the crowd to the bar to serve ourselves... 

PS: We have learned never to do a tab after the last Whisky Row experience where we were at the bar only 4 of us and some other people knocked one of our drinks over and talked to us afterwards for a bit. The bartender then gave them free drinks on our tab all night somehow thinking we were all together and I was everyone's father or something and would somehow pay for anyone who talked to us. My bill was massive and I had only had 2 drinks and Donna had 3 as well..."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the this same restaurant in Scottsdale and had a great time during the Nebraska football season. We tried a different location on a Saturday night and we will never go back. To set the scene, usually it's pretty busy on Mill avenue on a Saturday night, but with most of the college kids gone for the summer it was pretty empty. We ordered drinks (which the waitress got wrong) and then ordered the smothered fries. Those were the only things that were good about this experience. We ordered dinner and I got the chicken and waffles and my husband got the steak. Our friends ordered food, but they completely messed up her order and did not get her food until we were almost done. As for the food, the chicken was burned and so were the waffles. I make it a point to try different places for chicken and waffles since it's one of my favorite meals. There was hardly any sauce so the food was very dried. My husband's steak was not cooked properly and the salad was brown. But what made this experience so low for a review is the tech processing fee they add to the receipt. We asked the waitress what this fee was about and she told us it is a credit card processing fee. The problem with that story is that the fee is placed on your ticket regardless if you are paying cash or a credit card. We hadn't even given our credit card and the fee was on there, if we were paying cash she said we still had to pay the fee. Now if you are going to charge someone a fee to charge their credit card, you need to say that up front or post a sign. But the idea of charging a fee to use a credit card is the price you pay to do business. I have never seen this fee in the many restaurants we go to in the Tempe area, so buyers beware. If the food and service was great than I might ignore it, but with horrible food, horrible service (not taking any price off the meal after getting it completely wrong) this restaurant is horrible to their customers. There are plenty of great restaurants on Mill...go to any of them and avoid this one at all costs."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun here! Definitely will be back. Waitress was scarce which was a bit annoying but they made up for it with great food! 

Pros:

Great atmosphere - good music, lively/loud bar scene

Food was delicious! 

Prices were reasonable.

They do a really fun birthday dessert, complete with a giant sparker! 

Drinks were yummy - I had the raspberry riser and it was really tasty! 


Cons:

Service was marginal - the food came out quickly but the waitress was super hard to find and didn't come back often enough."}
{"text":"For a \"whiskey bar\", the staff was a little light on whiskey knowledge and my old fashioned was less than great and overly sweet. The selection of whiskey isn't really that much more than average.
Fairly good service, and a very attractive staff, but don't expect the \"whiskey bar\" experience. Probably a good bar in general, but not what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"We wanted to bring our family from out of town to this restaurant this afternoon at 3 o'clock.  We were denied the option to dine in because we had a 1 year old and a 4 year old.  I was in shock that they would turn away business in the afternoon!  We were always a fan of the restaurant and wanted to share the experience with our family.  We were turned away without a thought and no apology was given.  We will never be bringing anyone to this restaurant again nor will be dining here.  Absolutely ridiculous.  We  went across the street where we were greeted no problem."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Whiskey Row on our Spring Training Weekend. Brianna and Allison are awesome waitresses. Thanks Ladies for putting up with us all night and sharing some laughs to. Great time!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location on Friday night to check out the band because they are awesome. But besides that everything else was pretty ridiculous. My friends and I walked up from the south side and we were immediately rudely greeted by a security guard that said whoa whoa whoa this is for bottle service only. The guy obviously was taking his job too seriously and it had a sense of hostility to it that we were already a little irritated. But we decided to wait in the line which was actually pretty fast. There was literally a security guard that approached people in the line and said if you throw the door guy a few bucks he'll let you in. So that was kind of crazy. The drinks are very overpriced and they only serve them in 10 ounce plastic cups. There was a long line for the men's restroom and there is a security guard that monitors people going in and out of the bathroom and at that particular time there was also a security guard in the bathroom. Honestly it was just so ridiculously busy everywhere and as other people have commented yes it does seem like you are bothering the bartenders or anyone else for that matter if you are trying to get a drink. I would like to go back when it is not so busy and when there is not so much over production of testosterone in the air. It would also be nice to try the food. But if it weren't for the band there is no way I would ever go back. Yes I heard all the publicity that was recently in the news and what is ironic about that is that one of the security guards himself had a neck tattoo. What really makes the place bad in the end, though, is their clientele. But I guess that's what comes with the territory that is country bars."}
{"text":"Wow... where do I even start. We had a party of 10 for someone's birthday, I expected to have to wait but when the hostess it was close to TWO hours I was astonished. She said they were short staffed... (it's opening weekend and you're short staffed??) AND (there were SEVERAL empty tables throughout the restaurant). Well since we didn't have a backup plan we decided to wait it out. We went in and stood at the bar for a drink. We stood there for probably 10 - 15 minutes before a bartender acknowledged us. After we got our drinks we congregated at a table nearby that was empty. About 5 minutes later the hostess came over and told us we couldn't sit/stand there. Its an empty table!!!!! So... we then went to the other side of the restaurant by the stage and sat at yet, another empty table (we're rebels). After about an hour and thirty minutes we finally got a table and then we waited for 10 minutes with no sign of a server..... at this point we're all about ready to leave. A person from our party goes to the front to notify the hostess that we still haven't been served (I've never even heard of anyone having to notify the hostess that a server has yet to come to a table). Within a few minutes a server magically shows up to take everyone's order. She was good, no real complaints about her. The food took a awhile (as expected) and as soon as we all ate we could not wait to get the check and get the (you know what) out of there.

Overall, this is a bar. Day or night it doesn't matter. Yeah there were kids there but it's definitely just for the younger, single crowd. Don't go for the food or if you're trying to have a friendly gown-up gathering. The atmosphere is fun but I think our overall first experience was so terrible that we'll never go back again and would advise anyone we know NEVER to go there."}
{"text":"Went for my wife's 40th Birthday.  We made reservation with Chelsea for VIP Party Bottle Service.  Having not done bottle service before, Chelsea was patient and explained everything to me. Thanks to a cancelation, we were able to get a larger booth.  We had 10 in our group and we were very comfortable in our booth.  

The crowd is very young and the place was packed (cheek to cheek) on a Saturday night.  We arrived at 10 and I was very happy that we had done the bottle service. The dance floor is very small not very well laid our for a country bar. All of the ladies in our group ended up dancing on the table.  They had a great time.

The bathrooms are undersized (4-holes in the men's room) for a club of this size.  Drinks were reasonably priced.  Our waitress was very busy, as would be expected in a hot Scottsdale club on a Saturday night, but she kept us hydrated.

The only complaint that I have is that they have these cool table taps.  Well the taps have been shut down because of some many problems with the metering device.  Our hostess Chelsea offered to turn them ON, but warned that we would be responsible and that there have been problems.  Kudos for shutting them down and not continuing to screw-people over, but get the damn thing fixed.

This is a very Scottsdale trendy spot (juiced up bouncers, hot little waitresses, too much Affliction-wear and young ladies in platform heels), with a mix of country music.  The DJ did a good job of keeping the dance floor (all 20' x 20' of it) packed all night.

I would recommend Whiskey Row as a great place to party if you like modern country music.  If you are looking for Jennings and Cash / Ropers and Wranglers, Jack Daniels and PBR this isn't your place."}
{"text":"This bar is really fun before 11 pm!! If you're looking for a country bar to go to, this isn't it. They play nothing but mumble rap/hip hop after. Live country music stops at 11pm and the crowd completely changes after that. Super disappointing as a country music enthusiast!! I recommend denim and diamonds if you're looking for a country bar to dance at and enjoy all night."}
{"text":"Place was not very busy. My bartender took 20 minutes to get me a beer. Which was not priced bad at all. They were selling domestic beers for 3.00. So that was a plus... So my friend and I drank our beers decided we wanted to do a couple shots and grab another beer. Please tell me how two white gummy bear shots and two beers cost 34.00??? If beers were only 3.00 then that means our shots were 13.00 each??? Like that makes no sense to me what so ever. If you ask me place is a rip off. Dance floor is a mess, everyone is everywhere. Service sucked!! I think my bartender might of been having a bad night... I don't know. Overall experience was not that great. In the service industry you should be out going and fun! Bringing the crowd to you.... having a shitty attitude will ruin your customers experience.. another plus side, the security guard was really nice to look at ?"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for happy hour! My husband and I used the free appetizer with the Yelp check in and got the hummus - it was excellent! We also had a combo of drinks- $5 for redneck drinks and$3 for bud light! We both had 4 drinks and the tab was $29!! Wow, that's awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived 6:00 Saturday night and quoted hour and half for a table of 4. Went to the bar and my husband ordered a Fat Tire draft to learn they are out of it. Really? I ordered a Lienenkugle grapefruit shandy. Bartender handed me a really short pour and said the keg was out and come back to get \"topped off\"   Learned later that he charged me for two beers. Geez
Nice to see they have such a big draft beer selection... but do they?

             ******** The live music was REALLY GREAT ***********

Finally seated for dinner and the first thing our waitress tells us is we have two hours max at our table and started pressuring us to order ASAP. She seemed annoyed when we ordered appetizers. She came back TWO times to ask for our dinner order before the appetizers were even served!
Fast forward to dinner... I had a steak salad. My medium cooked meet was so chewy and fatty that I couldn't eat it. I had to put the first three bites in my napkin before I gave up. Two at our table liked the fish and chips and one liked his patty melt.  Fries were soggy. 
Our blond female server (Kelsey??) was rude and made us feel unwelcome. 
This is our second time here and we both promised to never come back."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to think of this place at first. The music was really loud and it seemed like it may be a little too crazy but... We all had a great time!

We ended up swinging by while bar hopping for a bacholerette party and we all had so much fun! When we first got there, they saw my friend's bachelorette sash and immediately took us to a table where they proceeded to pop a bottle of confetti, dance on our table and treat us to a bottle of champagne. Talk about making an entrance!

Once again, the people in Scottsdale were so nice and came up to congratulate my friend and treat us to more drinks. We ended up staying here the rest of the night. We had a blast!"}
{"text":"The eating area by the Orange couches was so so filthy dirty. My grandson was playing on the Astroturf with the blocks his knees were black when he finished playing over there for about 45 minutes  the place was dirty and nasty food was below average ! The health Dept needs a visit here ASAP"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night, after the rush, and had the same service as all the other reviews. It took TWO hours to serve a party of five with one appetizer, individual entrees, no drinks, and no dessert. 

All the reviews about poor service are the normal. If it's a problem this bad that has lasted this long, there's a problem with management and the establishment. 

Food was good but be prepared to see your server MAYBE four times over the span of two hours. On a Tuesday."}
{"text":"First time at Whiskey Row Gilbert. So many choices for lunch and we made a great one. Joe's Real BBQ does not have beer. We had Four Peaks Kiltlifter and Peach. Southern Fries    amazing. Wings good flavor and crispy. Fish a little fishy. Turkey on Pretzel bun and Brussels sprouts slaw is a good choice. It was not very busy for late lunch.  Service and music very good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Love the indoor/outdoor feel, especially this time of year. Friendly staff and patrons! 
Our server could have been a lot more attentive. Ordered two drinks and two entrees. And the portion size on the chicken and waffles is misleading, so much smaller than expected resulting in it feeling overpriced. Which is too bad because it was actually pretty good. The place is worth checking out if you've never been."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. The banana bread pudding is absolutely melt in your mouth, roll your eyes back delicious.  Yep. Came here for dessert. Lol. Mere was an equally spectacular waitress.  I also had the steak salad and every bite was perfect.
My 78 yr old  friend was escorted in by a nice man named Chase - definitely the highlight of her evening. She enjoyed the fish and chips for dinner.
Wonderful fun energy.  Everyone from 12 - 80 seemed to be enjoying themselves. So glad we came here instead of the pie place."}
{"text":"This place has great food AND great dancing. You can go any time of day or day of the week. The guys that go here are insanely good looking and the girls on the bar are unnaturally fit. It's actually ~wow~ and makes me want to go on a diet but then the food is really good so then I just eat a lot instead."}
{"text":"Good food, good drink, great atmosphere!

Such a cool place. Loved the southern fries, whiskey burger, and brussel sprout slaw. More than enough food to share!

Our group loved the whiskey drinks served in mason jars, and also great selection of beer. Loved the idea of kegs on tap at the table too.

Really neat place, lively, and paired with great country music!"}
{"text":"Had great service from Tori! She was so sweet. 
Came in for a girls night and some drinks, but we were seated far away from where everyone else was seated so we would have stayed a lot longer had we been seated where we requested, which was a high top. There were plenty open. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Turned away!  Two hour wait.  Brought family from out of town.  Would have been the second go.  First go, the music was too loud for conversation.  Food was meh.  Eatable.  We had a burger as well as fish and chips.  Willing to give it a second shot because we love country music.  I am not recommending this place to anyone.  They don't have toilet seat covers as well.  The waitresses and seating hostess are skanky.  Not kid friendly.  Stay away, unless your too drunk to care.  Very disappointed.  So happy Oreganos is across the street and was our saving grace."}
{"text":"If I could give a lower rating for poor customer service I would.  Avoid this place unless you are desperate.

Sat down at a table (place was only half full at the time) had a couple of beers and about an hour and a half later when we wanted to order food was told we had to leave our table and get on their wait list because we hadn't put our name on the list when we arrived (now that they became busy I guess this is their policy - although they weren't busy earlier), and they refused to serve us food otherwise (as there was people waiting all of 20-30 minutes for a table).  This was confirmed by the manager.  They literally said if we didn't leave our table and come back, we couldn't eat there. WOW, really!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I am going to give them 4 stars for lots of positive reasons.

The environment is great! Very cool for all ages. Good beer selection, and the chicken and waffles are AH-MAZING! 

However, our service was so so so so bad. I am super lenient on service and will always make an excuse for a server because I know their job is hard and demanding but this was beyond bad. Our plates and glasses were never cleared. Literally, never, and a few people in our group had quite a few beers so it  was very cramped to have all those glasses just sit there. The table next to us sat dirty for about 30 minutes until we heard someone ask why it was still dirty since they had been on a wait for an outside table for.... about 30 minutes. I think they actually lost those customers because they never sat there. So although the table was cleared it was never wiped. This falls on management, etc as well and goes beyond just our single server. If one server can't keep up, or if a table is sitting dirty it is everyone's responsibility to make the establishment run efficiently.

We WILL be back because as I said the place is cool. I refuse to give a low star review due to one server or one fluke of a day, but hopefully next time is not a repeat."}
{"text":"I've had about 5 interactions with this restaurant and have a different story every time. Between phantom wait times, an hour to serve a single appetizer, and the general disinterest from the management staff when asking what the delay was, I would advise anyone to seek alternate establishments. The latest and greatest, as I sit at my table, is waiting for 30 minutes for a beer and our server flat out lying about forgetting to put our order in."}
{"text":"I'm not mad, I'm disappointed. 

One of my friends had a hair in his whiskey ginger. Another one has a bottle cap (yes a bottle cap) in his water. Our food took over an hour to get (Bronco game or not, you need to prepare for a busy day if you're going to be a specific team bar). 

Although our waitress did bring a round of shots (and comp a second order of fried pickles) to make up for their short comings, I'm still annoyed that said waitress was seen standing around as opposed to doing laps to make sure her tables were good on bevs, as well as with the kitchen not being properly staffed for the volume of a Sunday game day. 

Will I come back? Probably. It's the only Broncos bar in the valley."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this place. Started with a live band then switched over to a DJ. It's a country bar but they had a variety of music which was nice. It was pretty open and spacious even though it was crowded inside. Had to wait in line to get in but the line moved pretty quick. This is s great place to go for dancing, the dance floor was huge, full and everyone was having a great time! Need one of these near my house!"}
{"text":"The drinks are over priced, the bartenders were RUDE, one taking my REAL id because she thought it was fake. I told her all of my information but because I didn't have a second form of ID she made me leave. I wasn't even drinking, I was the DD for my friends but she still made all of us leave. Definitely NOT going back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  We waited for 50 minutes, come to find out the hostess never put our name down on the list despite taking our phone number. Continued to wait until being sat with a server who seemed to care more about talking to coworkers than refilling drinks. Our order came out wrong and the unlimited mimosas were mostly orange juice from concentrate. Not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time on a Sunday afternoon. I will start by saying it is nice to have a spot to go in DT Gilbert for late night, after dinner drinks, and live music. Just in for drinks on this stop, so I cannot judge the food. However, given all the awesome options on the strip, and most of the reviews I have read, I can't say Ill be eating at Whiskey Row anytime too soon. I found it odd that there were around 15-20 open tables when we got there, but they all had a reserved sign on them. There were not many people in front or outside waiting for a table. I probably should have asked about this, maybe they take reservations? We weren't eating though so onto the bar. We ended up sitting in Adirondack chairs and playing some Jenga and Ping Pong, which was cool. I enjoy burning a few calories while I booze. The beer selection is far better than I expected. It is probably the most extensive in DT Gilbert. Kind of pricey though for some low % brews. I will definitely have to stop back when some music is going, as I am sure that adds a lot to the atmosphere. Despite the bad pub the first week, this place is going to do just fine. They have some things to iron out, but there is no place like it in this area."}
{"text":"Rudy is the man! I called looking for a reservation for a large party, which I know is a challenge in Old Town, and he was super helpful. He was able to get my group booked and all squared away. He was easy to work with, super nice, and we were so excited for our day! We had the best time. The team is awesome, great drinks, good food, awesome prices. Thanks Rudy and Whiskey Row!"}
{"text":"Lousy service at the bar. Ignored by the bartender while he chatted with the waitress - - he wasn't making drinks.  I never got a beer even after hailing for service. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great evening. It was our first experience. The waitress was slammed but always had s huge smile on her face. She handled all her tables. The food was good. And the environment energizing."}
{"text":"It started out by them wanting to kick us out of the table we were sitting at until they realized we were purchasing drinks and food. 
The night continued and they kicked our friends out for no reason and didn't even look into the situation. No compensation for the tickets that were purchased for the concert that night. Our night was ruined because we all decided to leave. I would not recommend this place, always a bad experience every-time I come."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, and we've passed through before, but this time I was in for a company party and got to try their food, well, two of their sliders anyway. One was a basic hamburger slider, which, as far as sliders go, was a step above the rest. The other was a fried chicken slider. Different. Good flavor but a little dry. I preferred the standard slider. Service was a little slow. There was a big crowd of us, so it is excusable, but items that were said to be back out \"soon\", never seemed to make it back out. 
Like their sister locations, the look of the place is nice enough. Pretty standard sports bar, with outdoor patio, TVs circling the bar, and plenty of space to work with big crowds. The water is terrible. Not their fault, as I understand Tempe is having issues with their tap water, but definitely avoid drinking it or anything with water as a base."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to watch \"the game.\" One of the waitresses called me \"a pervert,\" but I probably had that one coming. Would highly recommend the fried pickles. Yum."}
{"text":"I was NOT impressed the first time I came here. It was crowded, I had to fight like the dickens to get a drink from the bar. And an annoying mix of greasy douches, clubgirls and obvious tourists trying to be country-trendy.

I can't say it was much different the second time around except that this time I was buzzed by the time I got there and I had my crew with me. So we could have been at a leper colony and still would have had a blast. 

Georgia Chrome was cranking out live tunes and they had very nice girls feeding us whiskey from the bar. So several beers and some moonshine later we wound up having a damn good time. It turns out I'm a decent two-stepper....who knew?

While this still isn't my first idea of a good time I would come again, but here's some advice:

-Have a few drinks elsewhere first. I don't recommend coming here until you're a little 
 buzzed.

-Have a sense of humor and be prepared for crowds

-Ladies: There are a plethora of sleazy guys here who WILL hit on you.
-Guys: There are a plethora of sleazy dudes who will not hesitate to hit on your girl

-As Blake Shelton would put it, the more you drink, the more fun you will have. The 
  moonshine is your express ticket to drunken funness but although it's not the real 
  stuff, you will hurt the next day.

Good times, worth checking out if you take the above precautions."}
{"text":"Stay away if you're there to drink! Drinks are over priced. Worst part was, I let them start me a tab for my friends and I. Some of my friends got tipsy but I did not. They tried closing my tab without me signing adding 20% as well as a bunch of other peoples drinks. Shots we never ordered, drinks we never ordered. This place will try as hard as they can to take advantage of drunk people. The bar tender had some friends there and i assume they were adding their drinks to my tab."}
{"text":"I finally was able to come try this place out, and I really liked it! Taps at the table, food was good and the service was excellent. Really want to come back on a weekend when there is a bit more going on!! I'd defintiely recommed coming here."}
{"text":"When we walked in, I thought this was going to be just another bar with typical bar food. The menu did have lots of usual suspects, and we tried the fried pickles during happy hour. Glad we did. The entire pickle spear was fried, not sliced like most places. Also, liked the interesting cocktails. We stayed for dinner. The grilled chicken was fantastic. While we aren't big country fans, we did like the music and atmosphere. We'd go back."}
{"text":"Always crowded and a lot of fun.  Their burgers are great and I love their selection of beers."}
{"text":"Always so packed so never got to sit - stood at the back bar and ordered a Michalob ultra and a house red for $18!!!! 
Never got a chance to taste the food - but heard (from here) it's tasteless."}
{"text":"It's a pretty cool spot but difficult to get the attention of the staff to reorder drinks as the night wears on..I was sitting at the bar right in front of their faces..other than that lively crowd. They played some good country music that you could dance to."}
{"text":"Definitely a disappointment for me. Was not packed by any means still took forever to get the food. Tables were not being wiped and cleared food was mediocre at best what are chicken strips and onion rings when I finally got the food the gentleman dropping off said chicken and rings but that was not what was on the plate it's like he didn't even look. 
Came in because I heard the band thought it would be fun to listen to music and have lunch band was good rest was a disappointment seems like it should just be a college bar down by ASU not in Gilbert"}
{"text":"My second time to Whiskey Row. First time two weeks after opening I did not expect great service. Went back again tonight. Service is still less than acceptable. The restaurant was very slow and getting a drink was a very slow process. It appeared all the hostesses were more interested in visiting at the East end of the bar than making sure the customers were being served promptly. I wonder how much money they lose when business is busy.?"}
{"text":"Michelle at Whiskey Row is our waitress & by far the best I've had out here this weekend. If you ever come here please make sure to ask for Michelle!!!p"}
{"text":"A fun atmosphere, especially for lunch on the weekends.  You can play ping-pong, corn hole or a giant game of jenga while waiting for your food.  Line dancing on Thursday nights and live music on weekends.  We have been there a few times and have always been glad we came."}
{"text":"Right in the middle of the action, this place has the same set up as the surrounding establishments: patio/lounge seating; bar in middle; additional seating on perimeter of the inside. 

Went to Dierks for a buddy's birthday. Group of 10, east to get reservations, great table set up. Service was very slow which is even expected at a busy place- but our appetizer took 47 minutes. Spinach an artichoke dip! We asked the server if she was sure she placed the actual order because everyone else at the table received and had already eaten their appetizers at this point. She tells us \"there were 30 orders of dip ahead of yours\".....um...yeah right. No one in the surrounding tables was eating this dip FYI. The long awaited dip: gross. It comes in a mini skillet but it was cold...like sour cream cold. Not sure if this was supposed to be warm. It tasted like it came from a freezer and they microwaved it to thaw it out. Blah. 

Food: I ordered the grilled cheese and soup; greasy. Nothing else to say. Fiance ordered the mushroom burger: greasy but no other complaints. Others at the table seemed to think their food was \"greasy, but okay\" as well. 

Drinks: Smutty nose is delicious. It's $11 so it's somewhat worth the cost.  

Pros: fun atmosphere, good music (if you like country music), busy but not annoyingly packed; great bathrooms; good cocktails 

Cons: service is not great (slow and not always accurate); food is low quality and greasy

Overall: probably wouldn't ever come back here with so many other options literally next door."}
{"text":"This is a review for the restaurant/bar during the earlier evening 6pm-10pm before they brought out the band and had an hour wait outside. 

The atmosphere and staff were friendly and fun.  Prices were very reasonable all around.  Came here for a friend's bday with a large crowd and I feel like we were taken care of nicely.  Fun spot."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service and mediocre food.  There was a long wait for a table, and an even longer wait to order and get food.  I would have much rather grabbed a burger at Red Robin, at least their average burgers are priced accordingly. It's a shame to have a Celebs name on this place."}
{"text":"Whiskey Row has the potential to be a fun bar but their bartenders are awful. It's practically impossible to get a drink if you're a female."}
{"text":"Had hamburgers and frys. Menu is not very extensive. Food tasted good and I didn't have any complaints. The service is not the best. Counted about 18 different staff members who all appeared to having a great time visiting with each other while are drink glasses wait empty.  The food is nothing special and nothing to make me say I need to return in the near future."}
{"text":"Look left. Look Right. Bachelor parties in site. Like this location much more than Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Amazing all day specials. Great staff. Awesome design with fun quirks hidden. Great all day specials and loved the redneck cocktails. The food was bomb. From corn dogs to tomato soup I loved every bite. Highly recommend the fish and chips you don't even need sauce since they're so delicious. Definitely a must stop on the list of Scottsdale things to do. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"I don't think I'm a fan of this bar... The food is awful, for one. I came for happy hour with a group of friends and we tried multiple items on the menu and none of them tasted any good! I'm a foodie so I was really disappointed (the menu sounded really good with creative items, they just tasted awful). The drinks were better and reasonably priced. 

We came back another night to see if it would be a better experience than happy hour, which it was. They had a really fun band that night and the stage is above the bar so it was pretty cool. It was definitely crowded so my only complaint would be the lack of space. There were hardly any tables, so I would think there would be more space for standing and walking but there really wasn't. People were constantly running into me. All in all, I'm sure I will return, as I enjoyed the band, atmosphere (for the most part), and location."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a beautiful addition to mill. Upon entry there is a breathtaking flag mural and collection of cool shirts/hats for sale. Immediately upon entry we were greeted with smiles. 
They seated us in a large camo booth. Our server Corrine was quick to introduce herself and offer drinks and menu descriptions. I ordered the chicken and waffles. BEST ITEM
EVER!!!!! Sweet honey sauce on top...

I will return to check out their nightlife."}
{"text":"Loved the foos-ball tables with attached table taps. Tried the picnic chicken slider and loved the fresh taste of the chicken and bun. I will definitely be back again on a weekend night."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review based on our visit Saturday night. It was really fun. The first bartender wasn't great. Kinda rude and not very attentive. We moved down the bar the rest of the night and had a great bartender who remembered our drink orders and I didn't have to scream my last name to her for our tab because she remembered it. The band was really good and played fun music that we danced to all night. 

The two star mark down is for the EXTREMELY LONG bathroom lines and the overly pushy and rude security. We get it. No drinks on the dance floor. They made sure to get that point across if you even got close."}
{"text":"Went in last week on Tuesday to celebrate with a friend that was home visiting from the military. We received okay food and horrible service. When you first walk in the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is beautiful. I love all the rustic wood, metal chairs, huge indoor yard with tons of games and the stage for live bands on the weekends. This place is huge too so you can fit a ton of people. It was pretty boring on a Tuesday! Just families having dinner, no band, and not many people but it was a Tuesday so I understood.
 
We sat at a large round table for the 6 of us. We were then greeted by our server Laura. Luckily we got there before 7pm so we got to enjoy the happy hour menu. I got the Spring Fling that is $5 on happy hour and served in a mason jar. It was very good and refreshing. Our friends wanted a pitcher of beer but was told from our server that they do not do pitchers even though we saw many tables with pitchers of beer. A friend also tried to order the Mockingbird cocktail but was told they were out of tequila. Really?! This entire place is out of all types of tequila? weird....
 
We ordered the fried pickles for appetizers. We got 1 free for checking-in on yelp. The fried pickles were crisp, delicious and came in long spears served with ranch. I think they made their ranch homemade because it's very weird and taste like a cucumber salad ranch. None of us at the table liked the ranch. I got the Whiskey burger that wasn't very good. The meat didn't have much flavor and was over cooked. There was barely any cheese and no BBQ sauce that was supposed to be on it. the fries were decent.
 
Our server Laura came to our table probably once every 20-30 minutes. There was many times we had to flag her down to get something. I had asked for bbq sauce that didn't come on my burger and it took 15min to bring to the table as my burger was now cold. We had also asked for another round of drinks with the appetizer and they didn't come till 15-20minutes later after we had our food.
 
It might be fun to just grab a drink, play games, and listen to the live band on the weekends. I wouldn't be back during the week though or get their food again."}
{"text":"Reservation for 8 at 6pm. Seated half the party at 5:50, didn't receive any service, not even waters, until remainder of guests arrived at 6:15. This is a beer bar. Their tables have taps built in, yet they hire waitresses that do not drink or know beer and could not give valid descriptions of beer on menu. Everyone ordered dinner. 7 plates arrived together. Last meal arrived TWENTY TWO minutes later, after being told by several employees \"it will be right out\". Because the fish went from frozen to deep fried, it was not good, and was not eaten. Comping that meal was a given. But what about the other seven meals that got cold as we politely awaited the last meal of our party? You couldn't offer a discount? A free round of drinks? Dessert? Nothing? 
I assumed this was a country bar with country music, country dancing, and a country atmosphere. Not so much. Every television had the UFC fight on. Ultimate review: Typical, Trendy, Scottsdale bar."}
{"text":"Good food. Slow service and smelt like throw up. Expected from Mill ave. The only in gilbert is wonderful"}
{"text":"The reason: daughters 21st birthday

The Goal: Bar hop and PARTY!! 

2nd Stop : Whisky Row

Its 10:30ish on a Sunday night and man can this place bring you down, this is not a hot spot yall. Maybe had 10 people in there, but for my daughter's 1st night out clubbing she liked the relaxed pace.

Bartenders are friendly and easy on the eyes, small dance floor, drinks were strong and just what the night needed.  We had fun here but lost  1/2 her party, something about having to work on a Monday haha.  

I wouldn't mind coming back and checking Whisky Row out on a not so slow night, seems like it to could be fun place."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We took out of town business guests to Gilbert and was severely disappointed. Our server, Arianna G, was so busy chatting it up with a table of guys she had to be tracked down by myself to order drinks and pay the tab.  We waited 30 min for a dang brownie to be made. I will NEVER bring back a group of executives again. What a waste of good money."}
{"text":"Meh,,,,  food is mediocre at best, wings were barely cooked, service is slow,, obviously it's a college scene.  Gilbert is wayyyyy better."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday Morning for breakfast, It wasn't so busy, we waited 50 min for our food. By the way we ordered our food immediately once we were seated. Service was horrible. Waitress came up to us maybe twice to check up on us. Food was decent, and the live music was good I appreciated that it wasn't too loud. Disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"the service stinks. waited for over an hour and no service not even water. we left and went to the hub. much better service."}
{"text":"My fav place for Sunday Funday! Chloe made us delicious drinks (Jimbo) yuummmm! Great service, great food, great environment! Definitely coming back. Actually can I just move in?!"}
{"text":"Good ole country place! Food is great! The grapefruit beer is nice, great way to go from a blue moon."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Great food recommendations from the staff. Both the waitress and manager were friendly and provided stellar service. Had the steak salad myself and my friend had the whiskey burger. Both of us were very satisfied and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.. lots of creative decor and plenty of room to spread out, large garage doors for bringing the outside in."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 20 minutes, made eye contact with every bar tender as they walked by and never once acknowledged me or my date. I will never return under any circumstance."}
{"text":"The outside patio type area ok. But the service is lacking and honestly the most entertaining part is watching drunk soccer moms and dads let loose."}
{"text":"We've been here about 5 times and every single bar experience wasn't good at all.
The bartender took a while to take our drink orders, and we were rarely followed up on.
Right now my glass has been empty for about 25 minutes and we have been trying to pay our tab for the same.
Basically the bar service seems to be subpar for 5/5.
We are bar people all over town and this is the worse bar for customer service.
Sorry.
Great music and decor though!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Better than chili's but not the best on Gilbert road. Atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"Came here for a company outing. Had the best damm service from Maddie, Nicole, and Alex... food was awesome, drinks were great and the service was extraordinary! Highly recomnend and try the deep fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Cool ambience.
Jordan, my server, was great! 
But a \"tech processing fee\" is passed to the customers w/o advanced knowledge. 

Should be called \"tacky fee\""}
{"text":"I am not even sure where to begin. My husband and I attempted to visit Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row, here in Tempe for my brothers birthday. My husband and I have been to Whiskey Row many times in the afternoon, as my husband's tattoo shop is just a few doors down. We had decent service every time we had been there in the past and had never had a problem. I wish this had been the case on the night of my brothers birthday. We were a few minutes behind my brother and his friends, so they were already inside. When we got to the door, one of the security guards put his hand in front of my husband as he was walking in and told him he was not welcome in their establishment because he had visible tattoos on his neck and they do not condone gang activity. The bouncer would not even look my husband in the face when this occurred. He kept his head down and insisted that we leave the premises immediately. We were speechless, and had to ask the bouncer if he was joking. We thought there was no way that they were not going to allow my husband into the bar due to having tattoos. And to assume that it was gang related? My husband is a successful tattoo artist here in the valley. He is a father to two beautiful little girls, and is nice to everyone he meets. We are completely disgusted with this level of discrimination. I do understand that all establishments have the right to refuse service to anyone that they would like, but this has gone too far! I am not sure why we are allowed to visit this bar during the day, but as soon as the sun goes down, my husband and I were treated with a level of disrespect that it not fair to anyone. My husbands shop has had many company lunch parties at whiskey row, and my company has also done the same. We will never go to Whiskey Row ever again, as well as we are spreading the word to all of our family, friends, and clients who all agree that this establishment is not a place that any of us would like to support. Many of our clients and friends are refusing to visit Whiskey Row again, due to this exhibit of discrimination, and we will continue to spread the word. Bars are a dime a dozen around here, and there are many who not only support the local artists, but promote their business, and welcome them with open arms to enjoy the music, drinks, and good time. I am not sure how Dierks Bentley would feel about having his name attached to such a disgusting act, and we have every intention on making this issue public, reaching out to Dierks Bentley on Twitter and any other social media avenue possible, until we receive an answer. This is 2016. A year where everyone is free to express themselves how they see fit, and not feel they must be silenced, or stay home because of the way that they look. The general manager Kevin O'Connor as well as the rest of the Whiskey Row staff should be ashamed of themselves, and this discrimination should not only be corrected but prevented from occurring in the future. Nobody should ever be subjected to this type of treatment at any time."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was absolutely horrible. It was not busy yet dirty dishes sat on our table the whole time until we left. We ordered a second plate of the amazing deep fried pickles that we wait for AND waited for. Finally 25 minutes later we flagged someone down to ask about them and found that she had forgot to order them. As I said, it was not busy and most of the time she just stood over by the bar area. Appetizers came out at the same time the entrees, sides were wrong and she only check on us one time in 35 minutes. I spent a lot of time in the service industry and alway tip 20%++ but today the service wasn't worth a dollar"}
{"text":"First time eating there was today for lunch. I had the Whiskey burger. Was a very good burger, the ranch dressing that I ordered with the fries was just ok. The service and attention provided by the waitress was top notch."}
{"text":"We went in for Sunday brunch and wow!  Everyone loved their food.  Stuffed french toast, chicken fried chicken w/eggs, and mac +cheese.  I loved that they offered a full menu along with s great selection of breakfast cocktails.  Service was awesome and everyone was really friendly.  The manager, Kevin even stopped by our table to make sure we were doing well.  This was my second time there and it won't be my last."}
{"text":"This is a cool place. When it first opened up, it struggled a bit with customer service, but since then has really changed its game. It's got a good vibe, good cocktails, and an overall welcoming attitude. A couple people that we wanted to point out, Adam the manager, Mike the assistant manager, Casey the bartender and Natalie the bartender have all been good to us. Ask for them and you won't be disappointed. On top of that, we've been surprised about how good the food is. It's almost unique and Gourmet in a way"}
{"text":"I visited on a Saturday evening two weeks ago and this place has a lot of potential - but my first experience was a swing and a miss. When I got there, there was an hour wait. Okay fine, went to Joyride for a taco and a margarita. Then when my friend and I returned...

The atmosphere:
The decor is cool, and this may be the old lady in me, but the music in the main dining area is SO loud. You feel a little like you're trying to eat dinner in the middle of a club dance floor. I'm all for jams and get that this is a music bar, but let your diners hear each other. We were sat at a table in the middle of the main floor - a booth may be a better experience. From what I could see from my vantage point, the stage and patio areas seem really cool. Oh, and the bathroom was clean. Bonus points!

The food:
Unfortunately, the food was lackluster at best. The website has dozens of pictures of amazing looking sliders, so before I went, I decided I wanted to try one. I was debating how many to get, and the waitress described it as a \"large slider\" (...which I was thinking, it had better be for $4), so I ordered one American slider. My friend ordered two American sliders and we got an order of onion rings and a mac & cheese \"entree\" to share. Now on to the rough stuff...

First, it took well over 25 minutes to get our order. Second, it looked like they ran out of slider buns, because my slider came out on a bun that was obviously a large burger bun cut into fourths. And, for the record, a \"large\" slider fits on a regular hamburger bun, cut into fourths.  Third, the kitchen must have been in a rush because despite waiting quite a long time for our sliders, all three came out so bloody that the bottom bun had turned red. Typically, I'm not one to send back food, but I don't like food poisoning, so I sent it back and asked for a re-fire. A replacement slider came out a while later and was definitely cooked well done... BUT it was still on a fourth of a regular hamburger bun and was missing the tomato aioli - one of the two ingredients on the slider. 

The onion rings were nothing spectacular, but they were pretty tasty. The macaroni was actually really good. They use thick spiral noodles and a rich, creamy, flavorful sauce. But, it comes out in a small mini skillet, so if you're really hungry and are expecting the $10 portion to be enough to be an entree, you may want to order another side too. 

The service:
Overall, our waitress was quite good. She apologized for the food issues and was generally attentive. My only two complaints are that the food took a long time to come out (not the waitresses fault) and I was a little disappointed that we didn't get offered a comp drink or food discount since they were out of buns and we had three undercooked sliders... but what can you do?

Overall, I really want to like this place, so I'll definitely chalk this experience up to growing pains and will give it another chance. I'll update my review after my next visit. Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place was a huge let down. The appearance is what drew us in, and the lack of service is what drove us out. We were sat, waited 10-15 minutes at our table and was never acknowledged. They weren't busy and there were plenty of staff on hand taking selfies at the hostess station and ass-showing servers just wandering around. It's too bad bcuz the place looked really fun and entertaining!"}
{"text":"Good music big place small dance floor. My only peeve is the security guys take away the bar stools while your using them to allow dance floor room? Its not in the way, very odd??? I would have liked to sit instead of stand"}
{"text":"Meh.   Had big chalk signs that advertises CRAFT BEER HAPPY HOUR - ALL BEERS HALF OFF. But only offered water (colors, miller, etc) as the half off special.  Went for the craft beer happy hour - left disappointed.   Oh. Food was decent - my two stars is for the false advertising and the waitresses \"meh\" attitude towards me for asking about the huge chalk sign on the far wall offering craft beer happy hour"}
{"text":"Thought Whiskey Row in Scottsdale would be hard to beat but Tempe does it.

Cold beer, great food and amazing staff.  The GM Chase has a perfect mix of employees who all well know that they are working but all still have a lot of fun doing it.  I dare you to not be happy and upbeat at this place.

Live Music is a killer way to end the week on a Friday. 

I'll definitely be back and that says a lot given all the choices on Mill Ave.

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Maybe it is an Arizona thing, walk into this bar...half the people are wearing plaid the other half look like they are clubbing in skin tight dresses and too much makeup on. The first thing I said to my friend is WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE WE?! Great place for people watching, they had a live country band playing which was cool, but besides that it was an interesting mix of people."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to having a great evening dinner with some friends who also have never been to Whiskey Row before and wow all I can say is I was not impressed. First I called to reserve a table and apparently you cannot make any reservations. Upon arriving at the restaurant the atmosphere was super cool and laid back. The host told us the wait time was going to be 45 minutes. It took over an hour for a table (that was not even ours) someone was willing to give up their table that was ready because they were just there to have drinks and they didn't mind standing after all. Our food took another hour to come. It was fresh and pretty good but overall the place needs more staff and help. If it was not for the activities like beer pong, corn hole, ping pong or other stuff I bet people would be walking out left and right. We ordered a long island iced tea and when our waitress brought it to our table it was pink and tasted like grapefruits. We had our waitress Tori send it back and the bartender Iwana had an attitude it seemed having to remake the drink. When she remade it, it still tasted off and the color to this drink was a yellow pineapple tint color. We told the waitress again and even instructed her how to make a proper long island from my previous bartending experience. Iwana refused to make it again and blamed the drinks mixers already premixed. WELL while we were waiting an hour for our table we had got a correct long island from one of the other bartenders - SO I got up from my chair and went to the original bartender who made it correct the first time and she even noticed the color and stated Iwana must of used the 'sweet tea ice mix' or some mixer from behind the bar. Another mishap was a person from our party wanted ranch for dipping their fries in. Once that was brought to our table it tasted like Cucumbers! Apparently they don't have plain ranch - it's premixed with the taste of cucumbers for some odd reason. Well that wouldn't be a problem IF I LIKED CUCUMBERS! Heck, at least tell me ahead of time 'oh by the way.. our ranch is infused with cucumbers..' The only reason this place got 2 stars was because the atmosphere is chill. The food is good. The experience was horrible. The waitress did not offer to take the drink off our tab or even bring out a manager to soften the vibe we got overall. OH and another thing - On each of the tables is a RESERVED sign.. very misleading to the people who call in to make a reservation but you don't accept them. The waitress did explain the reason behind that is so people who are waiting an hour for a table don't just randomly sit an any open booth of table. I'm not sure if I will go back to Whiskey Row. I know this location is still pretty new but I hope they get the help it needs otherwise it will have a lot of unpleasant guests who will not want to return."}
{"text":"Our party arrived for our first visit here yesterday at 5:00.  The restaurant was only slightly busy and people were starting to drift in.  We all ordered our sandwiches.  I ordered a burger with no Thousand Island dressing.  It came with the dressing and also several pickles.  I sent it back telling the food delivery person (not our waitress) that I asked for no dressing and also I do not want pickles (these were not shown on the menu description of the burger).  My wife stated that I was allergic to pickles.  I was told there may be cross contamination and I stated that would not be a problem as long as they weren't on the sandwich.  They offered to make another one.  While I was waiting for the second sandwich to arrive, three different people came to the table to inquire about the issue and all apologized (one person blamed the waitress, we informed him that it was not her fault) and insured me they were working to correct the issue.  It took much longer for the second sandwich to arrive, long after the rest of my party were finished with their meals.  Imagine my surprise when the second sandwich had so many pickles that they were hanging off the side of the bread.  I went to find the manager  (the one that had earlier blamed the waitress) he offered to make another one.  I stated I did not want anything now as the rest of us were done with dinner.  He then offered several excuses for the poor service again blaming the waitress and he stated \"we are open 17 hours a day and we make mistakes.\"  All those at our table felt that the manager was getting uncomfortably aggressive when responding to the issue. He then make a comment that he would make it right.  When we got the check, there were charges for the two sandwiches they took back to the kitchen at $12.00 each.  I questioned the manager about this and he said I comped you half your bill.  I said but I didn't eat this $24.00 plus tax worth of food you added to the bill first.  He was adamant that he had made it right.  
There is a group of us that go out to dinner every Friday night.  This was our first experience here and the evening was completely ruined since I left there without eating after watching everyone else at the table eat their meals.  My friends were not comfortable eating when I had no food so the entire situation was a memorable experience that I will never forget nor will I ever repeat by going back to this establishment.  It's a shame too because the live music and atmosphere was fantastic.  They need better help and management that take less of an aggressive approach to the customer when they are unable to provide basic service expected in the hospitality business."}
{"text":"I am updating my review for a couple reasons.  First of all kudos to the management for reaching out to me after my last review and wanting to make things right by giving me the opportunity to explain in more detail as to why my experience there was not a good one, and then making a commitment to do something about it... which they Did!   That in itself says a lot.  They sent me a gift card and we did go back and we were pleasantly surprised that the dress code had  improved significantly  and my experience this time was actually very pleasant!   So thank you to the management for actually listening and caring about your customers.   We will continue to spread the word and make Dierks one of our frequent hang outs."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience.  Food was great, service was good and the drink selection was pretty decent.  Will be back if I'm in AZ"}
{"text":"Just another poser of a \"country\" bar. Real country bars do not play rap or music other than country. Think Denim and Diamonds on a bigger scale. Man buns, fake country swing dancers and overpriced drinks to match. When do we get a real honky tonk or dance hall in the valley?"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was subpar.  Drinks come out pretty quick.  Our party of 4 ordered food and then they brought out the food for 3 of us and told the other person it will be right out.  What seems like 15 minutes later you're supposed to sit there watching everyone else eat while waiting for your food.  Then right after you finish eating it seems they want to kick you out of your table.  Service needs some schooling in professionalism.  You don't bring out food until everything for the table is ready... and the kitchen needs to learn timing better to make sure it's all done at the same time.  Waitstaff seemed nice, likely a problem in the kitchen.  I don't expect management to respond here as I've read other reviews with no comments... smh."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! The chicken and waffles were out of this world! Will make this a stop every time I am in Phoenix/Tempe area for sure!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first visit. Great drink prices! Large open atmosphere in the area where there are ping pong tables, couch seating by the window area, and a dance floor and stage. There are also regular tables for seating, a large bar, and a friendly atmosphere all around. I didn't eat this time. Was there to see Dierks Bentley play for his home state friends, at his newest location. He packed the people in. One cute thing I liked, being a beer drinker, is that they sell mini pitchers of beer, probably holds about 32 ounces of beer. Cute as a glass! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly my experience here was the worst. Came on Halloween pretty early so it wasn't too busy. I sat at the bar with my boyfriend and we ordered our drinks, then we ask the bartender for a food menu and she hands it to us. Not even kidding the bartender never came back to check on us. She was paying attention to everyone else next to us but didn't even look our way. I mean.... I ask for a food menu so you would think I want to order food, right? Anyway, I put a $20 bill in front of me so that she could come over to us but even that wasn't enough lol eventually we called her over and she said \"sorry\" but that's about it. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend who said they had Beer taps on their tables...wait, what?!  I had to check this out for myself.  So, I invited a bunch of colleagues to meet after work for happy hour.  I reserved one of these tables online via their website.

We arrived and lo and behold....there are BEER TAPS ON THE TABLE!!!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dierks-bentleys-whiskey-row-scottsdale?select=kiB0dPVKVgs_o1eS0_1xmg#kiB0dPVKVgs_o1eS0_1xmg

Our server informed us that to activate the tap, we have to put a credit card down and then we can freely pour ourselves or she can pour for us.  There's an iPad on the table that's connected to the tap system that shows the consumption of each type of alcohol on the tap.  You pay by the ounce.

We were super excited and we all grabbed pints and started pouring from the tap.  We were like little kids opening a Christmas present....we had giddy smiles and big eyes...it's not hard to get a group of men excited about Beer.  We watched the meter on the iPad grow as we poured more and more Beer.  There's also a tap that has a Fireball-like Whiskey for shots....later in the evening shots happened.

In between all of the drinking, we tried the Chicken Sliders, which were very good and Fried Pickles, which looked like the Fried Silkworms in China I ate a few years ago.

The service was so/so throughout the evening.  Our server went from attentive to a disappearing act...they're really young and inexperienced here, so it's to be expected.

The vibe and atmosphere is very Old Town Scottsdale....it's a party place.  As the night goes on, the more of a party it becomes.  We left around 8 pm and people were starting to show up for the later activities.

Overall, it's a pretty fun place.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Our work team is always looking for a happy hour establishment on Mill Ave. as we all work in  the area.  They have a great happy hour menu from 3pm - 6pm -Mon-Fri, so we were excited to try a new place.  They have signs that say 50+ beers on tab, $4 selected wine, $5 entrees & apps.  Well, we got there and they only had 1 white and 1 red to choose from because they ran out.  We had a few in our party that order micro-brews and they ran out.  Please note they do not serve Budweiser products.  So, the happy hour drink selection for us was limited.  Our waitress was really slow and kept coming back to confirm our orders and the place was practically empty so it took awhile to get our drinks then we order appetizers which surprisingly came out pretty fast.  Anyhow, our waitress was really nice but a little clueless she really didn't know her beers, wines or the redneck cocktails she kept referring to the menu.  The place is a really nice & spacious great for large parties, it's unfortunate that our large party did not have the best service."}
{"text":"Really cool bar, fun place to hangout for Huskers games.  The burgers are awesome, but the Service sucks!  They are way understaffed, and the left hand doesn't talk to the right.  The glassware is always filthy looking, and the tap beer always tastes skunky.    Stick with bottles and burgers and you'll have fun!"}
{"text":"My family brought me here to celebrate my birthday. We had 630 reservations and they seated us at a huge booth.  The waitress- super friendly - brought us water right away and took our drink orders.  After everyone else arrived we ordered food- Patty Melts, Blue cheese sliders, chicken wrap, chicken Sandwich, Garlic fries.  Everyone raced about their food. I had one slider and an order of garlic fries and it was enough! Big portions. We started with the yummy grilled wings.   They brought me a free desert which was both yummy and quite dramatic. Only glitch that kept them at 4 stars was my mom didn't get her thousand island dressing for her salad until everyone was almost done eating.  Prices? 160$ for dinner and drinks for 7 people."}
{"text":"Super chill atmosphere. We played beer pong. Had a really good time. Bar tenders are super cool and, despite my hatred for country music, the ambiance is still really cool. There are lawn chairs to chill, yard games to play, and so many beers on draft. Will 10/10 return!"}
{"text":"Okay here it is, short and sweet:

Pros: 
Great Atmosphere 
Bartender Lexi is amazing- quick, attentive and the rest of the patrons love her too. 
Music- country hits all day- what's not to love
Air Conditioning is on- yeah it's hot out

Cons:
Sat down at the bar and slowly four girls looking for server jobs trickled in and were waiting at the bar for Manager Kevin - a few had already interviewed with him. They waited patiently as the all realized they were all scheduled for the same 3pm interview
(Side note- yes it's 3pm and I'm on vacation but seriously- this is a business and I'm still a customer AND in management so that is just poor leadership)
These poor girls were paraded one by one to a back booth in front of the 10 of us at the bar - poor form in my opinion. 

WORST THING EVER:
We are in Dierks Bentleys bar 
Dierks Bentley is performing live on National Television and not only did we have to ask for it to be turned on to SEE- but we still can't hear song number 5 that's playing live- Somewhere on a beach- fav song by the way
Guess we figured this bar would know when their owner was live on national tv. 

Overall- great place BUT... Maybe access to the owners schedule would be beneficial to the manager. ( I'll send him my fan club password)"}
{"text":"Great place to listen to music.  Great atmosphere   Bottle service was spot on and a blast"}
{"text":"Got talked into coming out to this place by a coworker and honestly I was let down.  We got sold on the taps at the table and when we arrived we were notified they were out of service which sucked but the service also left a lot to be desired our waitress while very nice was difficult to get a hold of, our food was on 3 separate checks (because of a work thing) and all of our food came out at different times, mine came out 10 minutes before my coworkers, they were also out of a specific whiskey we wanted (we came because it was advertised as a whiskey bar) and the waitress didn't seem to know the menu well.  

On the upshot the the atmosphere was nice and there was a good amount of people but ultimately I was left feeling like this spot missed the mark, if you're going to sell yourself on being a whiskey bar with taps at every table you should deliver on your promises."}
{"text":"I love this place...has always been a ton of fun! I'm a little older that most of the late night clientele but haven't been treated like the old lady at the bar. The band is fun and the bartenders are prompt and courteous. It gets packed around 10.  Good music good food fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Burgers are really good!  Not a huge country music fan but the songs they're playing are pretty good.  I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with my husband and friends. Great service and the food was delicious and out quickly. Never had an empty drink. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger last week with some friends, the food and service was good. Our server Jasmine made sure we never had an empty beer at our table."}
{"text":"My server, Brianna, was amazing! She was super attentive and made sure I was always taken care of. I saw her running around helping other tables too, even ones that weren't hers! That kind of hard work really rare to see in a server but she was constantly moving. The entire atmosphere is really relaxed and welcoming, and Brianna definitely contributed! She's a keeper! Will definitely be back and will be requesting her wonderful service and Whiskey Row's wonderful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place was great before 9pm. After, it was a normal college town bar and it was awful. It was packed, the music was too loud, and by the time my friends actually met up with us it was horrible! It wasn't even midnight! There was NO country music and the country music they did play was one song mixed in between club music. One song per 5 or 6.. maybe more club songs. Absolutely no country dancing whatsoever. It was terrible. I gave it 2 stars because before 9pm, the floor was occupied by tables which sucked because i expected dancing early on before it got busy. 

Now that I'm not surrounded by loud music (that was never country, at a country bar....) drunk people, zero dancing (again, in a country bar).. I will edit this to say that the service, music and drinks were great before 9pm. The fact there was no dancing? That sucked. Why have a dance floor with tables when you can have the tables around the floor outside in the space you have!? I understand there is dancing during the week.. but not on weekends? If dancing isn't popular, hire someone to teach dances more frequently to make it popular! 7pm classes, 930 floor opens! Maybe do a few drinks specials for one some immediately following the dance! The excuse that it's a college town and it's what is expected is pointless."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the atmosphere and I had an incredible bartender. She made me a muddled pomegranate and moonshine drink and it was amazing! Overall great experience. I will definitely be stopping back next time I'm in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere like live music. Bouncers seem like they are mad at life and want to control your night. Can't wait for O.H.S.O and Culinary Dropout to open so we can spend our money there"}
{"text":"We've tried since they opened to get in and today we finally got a table with no wait! The server was super sweet and knowledgeable about the menu.  My husband got there before me and asked about vegan options for me.  When I arrived the chef came over, introduced himself, and offered to come up with something off menu for me! I let him be creative and was so glad I did! I'm upset that I didn't take a pic of my plate but it was a beautiful assortment of colorful sautéed veggies with a grilled half romaine heart.  This guy is talented!!! It was awesome!!! I was super impressed with the food but even more impressed with the staff.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this location on a Saturday during the Art Walk looking for a good beer and lunch. The beer selection is pretty extensive. If they don't have a beer for you, then I don't know what to tell you! The menu is relatively small for what it seems so I was a bit disappointed in that but we found things that sounded good. 

Ordered the Southern Fries - definitely get them! BBQ smothered fries with shredded chicken on top. Very delish! I think ordered a steak salad and wasn't disappointed in that but it wasn't anything that made me jump out of my seat. 

Overall, it's a very large space with outdoor bags and seating. Plenty of seating around the wrap-around bar as well as booths for larger groups. Overall, the staff was good but not great. Very much college students working there so don't expect too much."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a girls trip. This place has a nice atmosphere. I am not a feminist or extreme in any way...but I was disappointed in the choice of attire the women wore compared to the men. Looks like DB didn't realize there is a \"Me Too\" movement."}
{"text":"I'm US combat marine veteran that presented a 50-state wide acceptable form of veteran identification and was turned away by the doormen whom claimed it was not sufficient ID. They stated my out of state MD drivers license would have been sufficient had I had it on my person and their \"state laws\" (of AZ) not only accept and out of state ID BUT REJECT A FEDERALLY MANDATED AND ACCEPTED PERSONAL ID FORM. This establishment is therefore most VETERAN UNFRIENDLY. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Not really a country music person but was out with some friends and decided to try this place out and man am I glad I did! The whiskey burger is what I tried and oust say that I would recommend that burger to anyone!"}
{"text":"Charged me for a drink on my tab that I didn't order...needless to say, I won't be be back.  This place probably won't be open long with a staff trained as poorly as this..."}
{"text":"Nice place and atmosphere for a relaxing Sunday afternoon. Good music and games. Food was great as well as the drinks."}
{"text":"A great concept restaurant. Wing appetizer was amazing, some \"other\" wing places could take some hints. Service was extremely slow, and not just because the kitchen was backed up! Asked or server if we could order and she asked for a minute, 35 of those minutes later we were able to put in our dinner requests. Majority of the food was bland and tasted as such. This is a great \"bar\" scene, not so much dinner spot. Not going to be in a big hurry to get back here."}
{"text":"First time here, most likely won't be back. 
  The bartender was amazingly unfriendly and unprofessional. Other servers were not much better. 
   I might have ordered food but she couldn't be bothered to ask if I wanted to order, (even though I said I'd be eating when I first sat down).
  Hate to judge a place on a single visit, but if management is clueless as to how incompetent one of their servers are, they are probably equally incompetent."}
{"text":"Cool bar decor...good food...cold beer.
Lets start with the negative.....i hate old town Scottsdale!
100 places to eat and drink with NO PARKING.
i do my best to steer clear of that $5 Corona tourist trap!

I had the burger with blue cheese, fried pickles and jam.....very delicious as were the seasoned fries.  11.00
Coors banquet bottled beer....love it!  4.00
My girl had the steak salad which was very good...13.00
9.00 margarita???  Ugh.....!"}
{"text":"Ok......its 110 degrees out, the snowbirds are gone so its safe to grab a meal in old town Gilbert. We stopped in to look around DB's place and 
ordered a drink. Coors draft and a froo froo drink. We were quickly relieved of 17.00 for our mistake. Check out the displacement of the spherical ice cube in the froo froo drink! Come on Dierks.... Really? 
The staff were friendly, the place was packed but sorry Dierks....we're out!!
Fooled me once!
I think we'll leave the crazy expensive
Tourist traps to the tourists. See ya!"}
{"text":"Water tastes unfiltered and chlorinated, just drink the alcohol. They need to do something about that-this is AZ. Pretzel app was  tasteless. Cheese Sauce was flavorless (although made from scratch) as was the pretzel-it was more like bread than a pretzel. Texture was dry and seasoning lacked. None of that \"pretzel\" flavor. Sweet potato fries weren't worth the money. Limp and sad. Again, aoli sauce was tasteless. They were \"out\" of house wine (both red and white) , as well as fish and chips. Basically my whole order. When they told me they were out of happy hour wine, I expected that they would have offered me another wine at the same price, but ... nothing. That was very disappointing.  Restaurant 101. Especially during opening week. Beers were good. The peanut butter one was good-different. I'd have it again. Cocktails were strong and small. I ordered 4 happy hour well drinks, but when I got home realized I was charged $9 for my raspberry Smirnoff and lemonade rather than $4 during happy hour. Minus one star. Sliders were decent. Meatball was ok, American was barely ok-boring. The spicy chicken one was spicy, and def the best. We all agreed we'd have it again. The mac and cheese was good-a bit dry in my opinion, but flavorful. Raspberry cornbread was good, bread pudding was ok. Not enough peanut butter flavor, again, in my opinion. The atmosphere is incredibly cool. Corn hole, beer pong, ping pong (always a bar fave). Adirondack chairs, fake grass, stage for bands. All of the waitresses were working hard. Things were slow (drinks, food), but it was day 2, so we expected that. Waitresses who weren't \"ours\" stopped by to ask if we needed anything, which is always impressive. Our waitress was Sarah. She was very sweet, attentive, actually ran when we needed things. We felt like we were her only table. She was very good. We like that kind of service and teamwork. Ladies bathroom needed some serious attention. Both soap dispensers were broken, paper towels and tp were scarce, and it was dirty. Men's bathroom was fine. Overall, 3 of us spent $190.00, which obv isn't cheap, but it was a fun night out. A great addition to downtown Gilbert, once they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the visit and the staff was attentive and nice. The selection of food was okay. However, the brownie for the brownie dessert was over cooked."}
{"text":"Went to Dierks because there was a 45 minute wait at the newly opened O.S.H.O brewery.  The service was good and the food was very good. Fried pickles for appetizer and Wings for dinner.  Ashley had a Cobb salad and all were very good.  I had an Ascender ginger cider that was very tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday with a group of people and overall we had a good time. We came around 11am for the start of the first football game & there was barely any one there so we got our choice of table. I got bottomless mimosas for $15 ($0.01 for each one after). They were good but I felt like I drank 10 and felt nothing, too much OJ and getting too sweet. So finally on like #6 I asked if they could hold the OJ and just pour the champs, she did so that was nice. For brunch I got the turkey melt, it was pretty good but super messy, sauce and turkey and slaw everywhere. I thought it would be like Culinary Dropouts turkey sandwich, but not quite. The fries were really good too. Then the slow part came when we got the check, I had somewhere I had to be after and I felt like we waited forever for the check. I kept searching around for the waitress but couldn't find her. Overall good experience, service was a bit slow, would probably prefer to come back at night for the bar scene not for a meal."}
{"text":"Love country, love loud music and having few drinks. But this place sucks. Paid for bottle service and the chic with the key to open the $100 bottle of titos, they keep locked is NEVER there. When she is, shes mad cause she has to her job and just plain rude. Hardly any country music. When they were not play hip hop you got Taylor Swift. C'mon!!!

Security harasses one member of our party for being drunk because a bottle fell off the tiny table in the little area they cram you in for \"private table bottle service\", after some one bumped the Table that the staff allowed cups and bottles to accrue on all night dropped off by anyone who passed by our \"private table\".  \"Ohhhhh he must be drunk\", no do your job you 5'5 \"bouncer\" wannabe and stop all the drunks from walking up trying to get a free shot from our bottle. And don't allow the tiny table accrue empty bottles.  Instead of standing there try to act like a tough preppy, do you job.  Not fooling anyone. 

Entire security team couldn't intimidate a 12 year old. Consisted of saved by the bells Zack Morris (the manager), a smaller Chumlee looking guy and finally a skinny tweaker. 

Overall Dirk, I expected more from you. Maybe when this place closer a real country bar will take it place."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night while we were in town. I didn't even know this place was here but we were walking around for a place to chill and saw that Dierks had a huge bar, dance floor, and \"backyard\" games. Granted it was still a Monday night so the place had at most ten people but we didn't mind. 

I got the Raspberry Riser and when you check in you get a free order of their Southern Fries. Y'all the check in deal alone is worth it! The serving was huge and I couldn't believe they were just handing them out. My drink was good and very refreshing. 

All in all, I'd definitely come back when things are a little more lively."}
{"text":"I have been to many bars in my years and I have to say, Tempe Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row is and will always be one of my favorite. From the atmosphere of a fun inviting scene for all ages it delivers to the staff that must have been specially hand selected by Mr. Bentley himself. This establishment has some of the best service my friends and colleagues have received across the nation. At the gate we were given respect and courtesy by the very stoic security manager, Marshal. At the bar, our bartenders are always well educated and deliver speedy service and to keep the crowd moving. truly impressive work from the bar manager, Troy, who will even recognize us from across the room and take the time to come over catch up with us and remember who we are and ensure we are enjoying our time at this location. The second time i came in we had the chance to meet Austin, the Assistant General Manager, who to this day will remember my name and welcome me with an amazing attitude. He is always running around ensuring his workers are on top of their tasks yet talking to people and deliver yet again another great customer service experience, i's starting to see a trend among this location. I've also had the pleasure of having Maddie and Nora as both my waitress and bottle service girl and i've never been more happy. She knows everybody in the building which just shows people love her and i can speak for myself and my friends saying we come back here for the staff.. Amazing job Mr. Bentley, You picked a game changing team."}
{"text":"I am a big Dierks Bentley fan and this spot is great! I love the music and casual ambiance. Service is great and the staff is very friendly. They have a wide variety of drinks on tap and their happy hour specials are amazing."}
{"text":"Some of the things I like:  It's the only large bar in the area.  They have some pretty tasty specialty drinks.  They have a lot of great beers on tap.  They have ping pong.  They have live music.  Here's what I don't like:  It doesn't matter when you come, afternoon or at night, the service is slow.  We came on a Saturday night and two members of our party were not allowed in because they were wearing athletic shorts.  Sure would have been nice to know this BEFORE we waited in line for 30 minutes.  They should really but a sign up or have the security guards tell people waiting there's a dress code.  And by the way, why is there a dress code?  This is a country bar in downtown gilbert.  This is the ONLY bar in gilbert that has a dress code and security.  This is not Vegas or Scottsdale.  Seems a little ridiculous to me.  It is also quite frustrating to deal with people who are not pleasant.  The security guards here take they're job way too seriously.  They told my friends they couldn't come in and didn't even apologize.  A simple \"Hey I'm sorry but we have a dress code\" would be nice not \"I can't let you in with those shorts on, step aside\"  This place is not worth it.  I would rather have a drink pretty much anywhere else in downtown Gilbert where the people that work there don't act like they are doing you a favor."}
{"text":"Fun place for lunch this weekend. Loved their Brunch Menu.  The Monte Cristo was perfect, the Mac and Cheese rich and creamy, the garlic fries were spot on-just the right amount of garlic, the only disappointment from 7 of us was the pretzel bun on the Turkey Melt.  Would have been great on a different bun.  Up beat noisy place---we all had a great time.  Service was perfect!  I don't know how those servers walk in cowboy boots all day !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday night and the place was packed! 

Took a while to get a beer but that was understandable considering the crowd. Bar seemed a bit understaffed. 

If you enjoy country music this is the place for you. 

They have booths with tap handles where you are able to choose 2-3 beers I believe and a liquor to have for your group. Couldn't figure out prices but it seemed really cool if you were with a large group. 

Fun place. I would really like to go there with a large group and take advantage of a booth!"}
{"text":"The menu is all just quirky bar food (sliders, Mac & cheese, hot wings) but there are plenty of beers on tap, separate bars, games (beer pong, corn hole, line dancing) and the atmosphere has a fun country party vibe. Much bigger than the other WR locations in the valley. Our waitress Cheyenne (like the George straight song) was beautiful and kind. Will come again. Glad the nightlife scene is finally making its way to Gilbert."}
{"text":"I'm from out of state and wanted to check this bar out because if the name ( I loveeeeee country ). Super disappointed. The DJ played a song for literally 40 seconds then changed it . Played 2 hip hop songs , then a pop song, then a Hispanic song, back to a country song, then back to a pop song. I couldn't enjoy a song . I think I would've enjoyed this place if it was earlier around 3/4pm to just hang out and grab a few drinks. The Drinks were super weak though . Ordered a few rounds of Jameson & ginger ale ... tasted like straight soda . I'll grab a beer next time ."}
{"text":"Not impressed... Friday night and early in evening. Bartenders are too busy talking with each other than to serve their patrons. 
I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our first time there.  Expecting most of the music being played would be Country.  Definitely not.  Just another Scottsdale joint playing pop music to a mostly very young crowd. I guarantee many fake id's were being used.  
We were there for a bachelor/bachelorette party.  We were kicked out of our table because they said they had other reservations but the tables sat empty and we had to to stand on the patio. Weird considering we were spending money.
Don't waste your money on mixed drinks. Over $10 a pop and just a splash of liquor. Stick with beer.
  This place was a major disappointment.  If I were Deirks Bentley, I wouldn't want my name on it.  We'll go back to Cave Creek or the west side for a REAL country bar.  Sad because it could be a fun place."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was slow. Especially for slow afternoon. Atmosphere was weak and waitress had no personality."}
{"text":"Fun, big, happy environment. The food is as expected, fried good stuff. We had the onion rings and chicken fingers, fish and chips, Mac and cheese, chicken wings and last but not least chicken and waffles. Now this is not a cuisine destination, it's a fun night out with friends destination. The place looks rustic but it's all brand new. Service was with a smile, drinks were poured generously.  We drove 35 miles to check this place out. We'll be back for the games and party like fun atmosphere. Ok, I really liked the chicken wings too!"}
{"text":"We had a large group for my daughters birthday and they were very accommodating. The food was good, we had an excellent time! BBQ chicken sandwich was the best!"}
{"text":"I do not understand all of the negative reviews. I have gone to Whiskey Row twice a week since they opened and yes, it can get busy and they do not take call-aheads, but if you wait around the bar long enough a spot will open. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and blows the other two locations out of the water. It is huge and has a dance floor, corn-hole, beer pong, and two bars to hang out at. Service can take a while when it is busy, but if you are having some drinks, just enjoy your time and be patient. Everything I have eaten was fantastic especially their burgers and the Southern Fries. The beer selection beats any other selection that is available at any other downtown Gilbert restaurant. If you come on a weekend evening expect that you will not get a table, because the wait is so long after 5pm. So get there early. The empty tables with the RESERVED signs can be a bit frustrating, especially when those people never show up. But just go hang around the bar and you will get a seat soon enough. Great place to hangout and it is definitely one of my favorite spots in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"First time coming here and probably some of the best security guys working tonight. Super nice as long as you're nice to them. Specifically Mike, Kenny, and Brad who were working the door. We had an issue with one of our IDs and Mike was super helpful and helped us print off a temp license for a veteran. Unheard of at other bars. Atmosphere was awesome and they had cool games like giant jenga to play which we indulged in. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"I had high hopes and expectations when I was invited to Dierks' new bar for a bachelor/bachelorette party.  I know we are in AZ, Scottsdale, but I thought it was a country bar and it ain't!  Its a typical Scottsdale crowd bar. I knew, that because it was Scottsdale, people would be in shorts and t-shirts.   I was still hoping it was a little country so I put on my big boy pants (wranglers) a polo shirt and my Dan Post lace ups to try and be very casual. We were overdressed. Most people barely had clothing on.  Most had tanks, shorts, & flip flops.  UGH, flip flops in a bar?  Shoes people, please.
The bar was packed and most the bar staff did not look like they were in the mood to deal will all the drunk idiots.  There were a lot of them.  It is not a Country bar like you might think, with Dierk's name on it.  You must check out the website. http://dierkswhiskeyrow.com     It is more like a sports bar than a country bar, though they do have live scheduled shows. 
The food other people in our party ordered was good.  It all looked great. I did not eat, this visit. 
I noticed several people giving 5 star reviews, I have a different standard.  The space is beautiful a typical trendy place for Scottsdale.  For God sake, do not wait in line to get in people. There are 50 bars within a ten block radius."}
{"text":"This is probably my third time in here, I'm usually here during the day. I decided to visit during the night hours. I had great service. My bartender Madi, was amazing. And as a bartender and being in the industry she was awesome. And to get technical she had the most consistent pours I've seen. Being in the industry you \"count\" when someone pours a drink. I've watched her pour over 20+ drinks and \"counted\". I was amazed. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our last experience here. Food is great but not enough servers. Then the manager carded my friend visiting from outta town after the server already carded her and said he wouldn't accept it and then continued to destroy the id. Very unprofessional experience. We were just trying to have lunch and he made a big ordeal as if he had something personally against her. Will never return to this establishment again. I prefer zipps."}
{"text":"Not a big Yelper, but had to comment that our bartender Katie was awesome - I honestly can't remember the names of the drinks she made us but they were LIT. Best I've had anywhere in Gilbert. Even though we live far away, will be going back just for that."}
{"text":"First off..let me start by saying.  I served my country with 2 tours in the Marine Corps, contribute to society, work full time, married and raising 2 kids in Gilbert.  I came down for drink lastnight with my wife and brother. Only to be denied entry!!!!  THEY ACTUALLY DIDN'T LET ME INTO THE BAR!!!  BECAUSE I HAVE THE NUMBER 22 TATTOOED ON MY NECK.  THE 22 STANDS FOR THE AMOUNT OF VETERANS THAT COMMIT SUICIDE EVERY DAY!!!  THESE IDIOTS THOUGHT IT WAS A GANG TATTOO.!!.  after speaking with the security manager. Then the general manager. (Both having tattoo sleves) they decided it was a \"brand new corporate policy\"   I'm sad to say, I was excited to check out a new bar in town.  Having \"policys\" like this WILL NOT be in their best interest.  MORONS!"}
{"text":"If I could leave this place 0 stars I would. Their beer is always warm and their service is TERRIBLE. However, the environment is always great."}
{"text":"I have never written a yelp review but I felt this was so bad I should. We waited an hour for a seat during brunch when there were clearly many open spots. When we sat down the waitress Sierra took our drink order but then returned twenty minutes later shocked that we wanted food. She said \"oh you want to order?\" Obviously that would be the purpose  of brunch. Then she brought me a drink with lipstick on it that had already been drank from. She said she would take it off the bill...but then proceeded to charge me for two drinks. She charged us the wrong price for another item and when we questioned it she just said \"that's just how they do it\". Then she did not offer the split the check among four people. Instead, without asking she took $45 cash put $11 on one card and $56 on another card. This in no way, shape,  or form made sense for what we ordered AND we wrote down on the check how it should have been split. I'm sure this establishment just assumes people will be drunk and won't notice when they are being overcharged. It was truly one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"We were invited down to try out a new place in Gilbert. When we arrived we were told they were not accepting walk ups as they were already to busy. We were invited to try a seat a the bar.  We entered and walked around looking for a seat. During our walk we observed no less than 8 empty tables with reserved signs on them, despite being told they don't take reservations. As we left we asked the hostess about this and we're told they reserved them in an attempt to seat the folks waiting for tables. This doesn't make sense.
  This place was loud and would not be a good place to go for a meal and conversation.  The food which we did not get a chance to try would have to be very very good in order for me to go there.
  There are many good places to go for a meal in the valley, I doubt this place will stand out from all the others. I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Indoor games for adults or kids (ping pong, corn hole, jenga). On a Sunday with football, all games were on. Music and game announcing rotated on the overhead sound. Menu is small, but has a variety of choices. I recommend the Brussel sprout hash/ slaw. It has a nice kick! I heard is really hopping on nights and weekends. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Totally unprepared, incompetent, unprofessional and rude management. Don't open your venue until you are truly ready to do so. This is your third location, you should have launches down to a science.
Don't tell me you can't open on time because you were busy the day before. Don't say sorry if you don't mean it but do provide vouchers to people you turn away. Otherwise it's like saying; \"sorry, (but not really), now piss off\"."}
{"text":"Sophie the server was absolutely terrific. Super friendly and very helpful with the menu. I would highly recommend the Whiskey Burger. Mason the hospitality technician/ food expert, displayed great customer service. Constantly asking if I needed anything! I would come back everyday if I could. Whiskey is without a doubt one of best restaurants in Old Town Gilbert. Go there, Do it, Don't be lame."}
{"text":"Was there for a few hours last night (11.22.15). Didn't hear a single country song. Asked the DJ and he couldn't because the owners were shutting the country down that he was trying to play... Dierks Bentley is a COUNTRY singer and it's meant to be a country bar. So why not play country with a little bit of mix of rap and rip hop... horrible experience... don't portray yourself as a country bar and not play any even after being requested to play it they didnt... disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food. Had the buffalo chicken chips appetizer to start. Delicious. Not to heavy and simply a starter. 

The pulled chicken sandwich was great. Included a side. I did the deviled egg potato salad. It was great but the potato salad was really saucy. Very wet. Had to be careful while eating it to not spill on my self. 

I love country music. This place is country and sports bar themed. Tons of TVs and even a 4 beer tap at our table. Super nice. 

Will be back again for sure. 

Oh the iced tea (was driving) was raspberry flavored and didn't know that... Gross."}
{"text":"Attending Tempe Arts and craft show. Slow service, no server came to visit for 15 minutes. Once a server noticed we had been sitting for a while, she volunteered to help us.  Food came out fairly quickly. Mac n cheese- a solid 6- not quite cheesy enough and a little dry.  Turkey pretzel sandwich- messy and hard to hold, flavor was good- an 8. Buffalo chicken sandwich- a 5- also a messy sandwich, as well it was cold and the sweet potato fries were cold and old. Kale and quinoa salad- a 7; it was descripted as having grapes, there were three in the salad.  Also feta, maybe 4 small pieces.  Not what I expected with the quinoa, it was mixed with the salad sparsely. When a salad is named kale & quinoa, you expect it to be half and half.   It had good flavor. Two Dr Peppers were ordered and came out as two diets.  I asked for bbq sauce for my onion rings, it was never brought.  Cant say I was impressed with food, it was average. Definitely NOT impressed with the service. There ate too many restaurants in Tempe for me to take a chance if spending my hard earned money here again."}
{"text":"Pub crawl stop. I really like this place. It's like Coyote Ugly meets OHSO. There are taps at the tables. This was our favorite thing about the place. People were well-dressed, second favorite thing. Lots of young professionals, all guys, really. (Hint, hint for the girls). Waitresses are all cute, slightly under-dressed but it all goes. The service was perfect, beer was cold. Got real busy later. The wings are not hot wings. They are tangy barbeque wings so don't expect buffalo style. But cook and presentation was good. They have a happy hour menu as well, if that's your thing. It's a country bar, but the music was mixed while we were there. Lot's of energy and there were free shots of Jack to be had. Mixed aged crowd."}
{"text":"I like Old Town better. But they did also have live music here. They waitresses were filming some commercial or something and ignored our party much of the time. They need to remember what they do...they food still pretty good, same menu as the other. The decor matches Scottsdale, mainly. This is a great place to meet friends and they have many long tables for big groups."}
{"text":"Mediocre dj and mediocre drinks. This place is a 1 star at best. The music selection is just a spotify account and the drinks are poured mindlessly. So if your looking for shit music and shit drinks this is the place for you. The staff was not friendly and the security staff was absolutely out of line. Also the security staff act mindlessly. Who do they report to?? Why are people being kicked out? They dont say why, they act as judge and juror with out reason. Their behavior is irrational at best. Overall this place is a cest pool. As soon as I walked in it reeked and the bathrooms were horrific. So save yourself the time and money, and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yes! Thank you for a nice evening. Cesar Chavez jr vs Canelo Alvarez great thoninly bar to have them in in the city! Cover band after was awesome, drinks were strong  and people from all walks of life, even grandma and grandpa looked to be having a good time. Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night for dinner and drinks.  We arrived in time for happy hour, so took advantage of the prices and ordered a Redneck Cocktail and a couple of apps.  The J.I.M.B.O. was good and served in a mason jar glass.  It didn't taste like there was any alcohol in it, so switched to a beer when it was gone.  The Chips and Dip were delicious!  We also tried the Corn Dogs...expected to receive mini corn dogs, but there were 3 actual corn dogs on the plate with 2 types of mustard and ketchup.  They were really good!

For dinner I had the Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup.  The Grilled Cheese had 3 different cheeses (American, Provolone and Goat) and I ordered the candied bacon for an additional charge.  Totally worth it!  The soup was tasty...not a plain tomato, but a creamy tomato soup with some cheese on top.

My dining companion ordered the Bad Ass Bloody and the Strawberry Shortcake for dinner.  The Bloody was served with a slider on top.  It's a great concept, but the drink had an over abundance of celery salt in it and wasn't finished.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience.  It's nice place.  I would have preferred to sit at one of the booths...they have taps on the table that I would have liked to try out!  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The bar is nice as a bar, but thats all this is, a bar, that plays country music. LAME! No dancing? Way LAME! The screens and tv's are huge. We watched the Silva / Weidman fight here and really liked the visibility and lay out of the tv's. I'm sure I'll come back for football season and other fights, but I expect a lot more from a name like \"Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row\"."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and our server Tori rocked made everything wonderful will be back!!"}
{"text":"Server autogratted us when it was only two of us... sitting at the bar. We would've tipped over 20% for sure, we are in this industry. Horrible service, too."}
{"text":"always a good time. Was here for the Derby with a few firends. Mint Julips were really good and service was actually pretty decent considering it was a sports event."}
{"text":"Food...BOMB! Everything they do in the kitchen, they do right.
Music is good and usually pretty loud..
Bring a group of people and sit at the bar. This is where you'll get served the fastest..servers make themselves scarce and don't talk much.
 It's worth a trip, for fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Whiskey Blow does not deserve a Star!!  

We sat in the bar for over 30 mins and had to literally  flag down this steroid junkie bartender.  he did took our drink orders but another 15 mins went by. . . .  nothing.  not sure if he forgot or he was too busy thinking about his next testosterone cycle.  the other bartenders just look right pass us like we did not exist. The place was not even crowded.  Total waste of time!!!"}
{"text":"Music is great and the servers are hard to ignore but don't expect much from the drinks.  They know what attracts the crowds and it's not the pours.  My most recent drink (the waitress had to write down our 3 drinks because she forgot them then only brought us two) was a Kettle One soda sans Kettle One.  So order a beer, sit back and enjoy the music and company so you don't get hosed!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  Not only did they have great food and awesome service ( Ioana was our bartender) but, they literally thought of everything from putting their large tables near the stage on wheels to branding their eco lab soap dispensers.  When I visit AZ to see my parents again I will definitely be back.  Everyone including Ioana and the blonde manager were so very helpful..... I'm sorry for not catching the managers name.  Thanks so much again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is busy - crazy busy. We came early on a Saturday 5pm and it was a madhouse -- cannot imagine what it would be like after dark and when the band is playing.  Probably a good idea to wait til they get settled and figure out how to handle all the customers."}
{"text":"Always a good time. For food, their grilled cheese and tomato soup is a must. Cocktails are served in mason jars.

For nightlife, it's just awesome. I love country music so it's great when Georgia Chrome is there playing live. 

A little disappointing for the Cave Creek folk I would imagine to see such a small dance floor and so few legitimate country fans... Zero two-stepping too, unless you want to be mowing people down. But altogether a fantastic addition to OldTown."}
{"text":"Picked this place out weeks before coming into town to go to brunch before going to a spring training game. The first problem is that the hours on the website and on the actual door of the restaurant are wrong.  The second and more important problem is that they don't serve brunch. Well, they do actually, but only during football season.  They have a brunch menu online, and there is nothing saying it's just during football season.  We were also told that some of the drinks on the menu weren't available anymore. 
The plus side is that the lunch food we ordered was very good, and the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere later on I'm sure was great, but they really should have up to date information on the website, the door, and on the menus."}
{"text":"The location, music, drinks and food were all amazing! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend and had a blast. Our bartender Beth was amazing. She was fun. Made sure we had our drinks filled ever time. And she kinda got us a little tipsy so we could dance.  had a great time and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"YES! I dare you to try to have a bad time at Whiskey Row - it's not possible. Amazing food, wonderful service, and the cocktail menu is unreal. Try the Old Fashioned on tap - so good. 

Such a good vibe - I've found my new home in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location. This location is not as big as the one in downtown Gilbert, but the fact that it was near empty and easy to get seated on a Saturday afternoon, it's a plus! 

Service was good but food sucked! When at Dirk Bentley's I always order the same thing, Patty Melt with a tall beer, side of fries and ranch on the side. Always! Creature of habit I guess. I was disappointed with my overly seasoned, attack of the pickles patty melt. Like it could have been a pickle sandwich with the amount of pickles that were in my sandwich. The dill in the ranch was waaayyyy too overwhelming for my liking. A Patty Melt is hard to mess up and the cook at this location definitely messed it up!"}
{"text":"We've been here enough times to leave a 4 star review. Don't come here if you don't want to wait for a table and if you're looking to dining or drinking at a quiet place. The live band and games are great entertainment when you have kids like us. Great selection of food and beers. Their Old Fashion drink is great too!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch on Monday and sat at the bar great beer selection   The barbecue chicken with white barbecue sauce was fantastic and serve with broccoli any one of my favorites surprisingly healthy for a cowboy bar"}
{"text":"We are locals with friends visiting from out of state for a Spring Break.  Our group of 6 arrived at about 7:45 pm on Friday night.  First we tried to sit in the dining section and told it was already booked and to go look for open seating.  We were excited to find a table on the dance floor open.  Then someone there waved us away because they were tearing down the table.  Next we found a terribly stained couch by the lawn game area but were told we would have no service and would have to wait on ourselves.  About an hour and a half later the band started.  Not sure why the staff was preparing for so long and refusing us service our entire stay for preparation of the band.  No one there seemed to want our business or value us as a customer.

This experience was at the Gilbert location."}
{"text":"Don't assume because a place is slow that your food will come out in a timely manner.  The only thing that made the wait for an appetizer bearable was the Seahawks game that was on.  As I write this review I am at at 45 minute wait time for an APPETIZER!   These kids running this bar do not have their priorities in order.  They keep complaining about the large tables but you know what?  This is NOTHING.  I've been a waitress and I can tell you someone is NOT doing their job here.  I'm sure Dierks Bentley would be ashamed to know how crappy these employees are. Take your name off this restaurant and save yourself the shame Dierks.   Or just hire someone who wants to work."}
{"text":"I wish there was half stars on Yelp.   I don't want to give it 3 full stars, but not as low as 2.  So technically, 2.5 stars. 

I think because this is a new place it's still working out the kinks.  They do have a great patio so that's a plus.  Some of the cheesey club dwellers do come rolling in with their over gelled hair and big cuffed shirts ; and the stripper heel girls do come teetering in.  BUT, laid back people even it out.  So I can work with that.  

But the service was eh.  They messed up a check for a friend of mine. Charged her for one of my drinks (but was on mine correctly). It took 25 minutes for them to fix it.  I mean come on.  

I do like the upper stage, pretty cool. I think they are just experiencing growing pains.  While it's a little too flashy for me to go regularly, I'd go again."}
{"text":"Not a country fan at all but my friend convinced me to go along  because Georgia Chrome (a country cover band) plays songs on Thursday night. Arrived around 930 and I was glad there wasn't a cover (at the time). Not sure if they charge a cover afterwards.

Area is very nice, very clean and tv screens everywhere. Staff was very friendly and I was able to seat myself and 2 other friends comfortably. Ordered the grilled cheese with fries as a side (you can substitute any side for the soup). I was very impressed with the sandwich - it had 3 types of cheese combined with jam and it tasted awesome. Fries were better than the standard bar food. I also tried my friend's tomtato/pesto mozzarella sandwich - I recommend that as well.

The band plays on top of the bar on a stage and they sound really good. Didn't recognize any of their songs but they did play some cover some mainstream songs like \"Don't Stop Believin'\" so I was able to sing along to that I guess. Had a great time and I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"What a great place for a Saturday night! A lot of fun, country music, a lot of people and great drinks. There is usually a long line after 11, you should expect to wait 30-45 minutes unless you want to pay a few dollars or are a group of girls. The place gets really busy, so get there early and find a good spot to hang out."}
{"text":"What an awesome place, live music on the weekend with a huge dance floor! Went to celebrate my wife's birthday and they definitely made it very special for us, she had an amazing time!

The bar is great for food, drinks, hanging out, dancing and having an awesome time! So happy to have a Whiskey Row in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick drink, bartender said he could not make the signature drinks cause they were out of \"the special ice cubes\" so I asked to have the Paloma mule the bartender seemed unsure of what that was, fist attempt was not correct nor was the second attempt so I left without having a drink."}
{"text":"The southern fries you get free is an amazing appetizer when you check in so we will be ordering even without. The wings were good and so was the food ,The service was great, server Alice was very on the ball and super nice and my kids had 2 Pokemon stops so kept them busy while we watched Cards game."}
{"text":"If I could leave a half star I would...sat at the bar and once we got water the bar tenders didn't check back with our drink and food order for about 20 min until we had to tell someone and then once we got food she asked if we needed anything and hasn't been back. Currently waiting to get our tab and has taken another 20min...Very unfortunate for an awesome country bar to have very poor service!! Even my friend that lives in Scottsdale for the past 3 years says that every time she comes here the bartenders are very very bad at serving the customers at he bar. Maybe they don't want to serve a group of four girl with no men around?

Big country fan!!! Unfortunately, not the place for me :(

Mac and cheese was good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fun atmosphere for all ages, food is great, prices are very reasonable, and wait staff is super friendly and attentive. If you go, ask for Maddie, she's the best!"}
{"text":"Horrible seating arrangements with really  uncomfortable chairs. Too loud you can't even speak to those you're with. There's  lots of open space in there it almost seems incomplete."}
{"text":"Had a great time at whiskey row with a large group of people (mix of adults and kids). Food was fantastic (the fettuccine is awesome). Our server Mere was great and patient even though we were moving around quite a bit."}
{"text":"I usually have a nice time and even when busy bartenders usually attentive and on the ball.  

I was there on a not so busy Saturday afternoon.  Bar area not full yet still crappy service.  I felt very insignificant to bartender.  Although I'm not looking for affirmation, I was looking for a beer.  I'm generally a nice tipper but the only way to send a message is to leave small tip.  Kills me to do it."}
{"text":"Best bar in scottsdale if you want a 2-1 ratio of girls. I love this place.

I found this place 2 weeks ago and have been here 5x.  Amazing everyone"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar to come to in Scottsdale because it's trendy but still plays country music, which I love! The couple of times I've been with a table have been significantly better because it can tend to get really crowded in there and the line can get really long (and if you have a table you dont' have to wait). I always have a great time when I'm here--I just wish they had a bigger dancefloor!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Mostly attentive and engaging staff, a pretty big space and it was not all country music (which was nice for me, a mostly non-country listening guy). 

Was here during my bachelor's weekend in Scottsdale, came with a big group and actually stopped in a second time the following night. The crowds were a good size. Drinks are generous with the alcohol and the shots are a good pour...I left pretty freaking hammered. 

There's shot girls. Go-go dancers. Trivia nights. A lot to offer actually. I was kinda ticked that after 10pm it becomes all bottle service to get a freaking seat. 2-3 rounds of golf into a weekend and my old a$$ ain't standing all night long getting bumped into by mostly drunk millennial with fistsful of drinks. 

It was ok...the drinks were ok...the apps were ok...the scenery ok...just ok. Tolerable is a good word. Something I'd need to experience again for an evening, probably not."}
{"text":"it was just ok.  only 2nd time here.....waited at least 10 minutes before waitress came......I had to change booths while I waited as the booth I was satin had food crumbs on the table...in the booth and table was sticky.  Food was eh for bar food...."}
{"text":"What a train wreck!!! I see Toby Keith's playing out all over again. Successful bar with a great business model ran by a bunch of spastic 19 year olds. We were on a countdown timer for a table, 1.2 hours, we watched it count down as we spent the time running up a bar tab. When it finally got to zero it switched to \"29 parties in front of you\". We went up to the hostess stand only to be told people weren't getting up and they could assure us it would only be another half hour. After that half hour we went up again to be told \"oops, I think I deleted your reservation\". Once we finally got sat we were served well vodka and charged for deep Eddys (which is not a clear liquor so the drinks wouldn't be clear and taste like crap). We told the server, she just shrugged her shoulders. I got chicken and waffles and the chicken was so black the people I was with thought it was steak. And the waffles would have served as better Frisbees. Total we spent over $350 for four of us. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to state that I know working in a bar in a college down may be stressful to the staff considering the influx of drunk people they must have to deal with on a nightly basis... with that being said the way my friends and I (who were not drunk) have been treated at this establishment is totally unacceptable. 

To make a long story short, when I asked the bartender for an orange juice and vodka he mistakingly serves me an orange blossom beer. I pay and tip him anyways, because he looked stressed out and ordered the orange & vodka again and he slams his tray of cups down and rolls his eyes pours the drunk and abruptly slides it to me without even looking at me. The people around me were just as surprised as I was but I did not make a big deal and left. 

This past weekend my friends visiting from Kansas City (who ironically are related to Dierks Bentley) wanted to stop by his bar, the bar back was on some sort of ego trip and was extremely rude to us for bumping the trash can an inch out of place while trying to order a drink at the bar. 

We left soon after and went across the street to CASA and had a much better time."}
{"text":"Had my birthday breakfast here with a friend. The blueberry pancakes were delicious and the breakfast sandwich looked amazing. My friend really enjoyed it. I got the bottomless mimosas, the waitress constantly walked around with a pitcher refilling it, but they squarely aren't strong. I normally hate bloody Marys but this one was good. Ordered extra spicy. Good food good service. Definitely will come back for brunch."}
{"text":"Mike with security is a great guy! Our friend didn't have a horizontal license so he said to go on the dmv website and get a temporary one and he printed it for her! Great considerate security guy while completely following the law! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge country music fan and have been waiting to go to Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row bar. I was excited to see there was one in Scottsdale close to the hotel we were staying at. 

We came in for after dinner drinks on a Wednesday. It wasn't super crowded just a few people at the bar, but the space is huge. You can sit indoors at high top tables or booths, there is a huge bar and there is also outdoor seating. Above the bar is a stage that has live music on weekends. The DJ was bumping some great country music so that was fun.

There are TVs around the bar to watch sports and the decor is very rustic and country feeling. You definitely feel like you're in the south when you're here. I would love to see what it's like on a more crowded night, it seems like it could be fun."}
{"text":"How much fun is this place! They have beer taps at the table! Totally awesome. It weird reading others reviews about a country bar being here, like no ones heard of country?  Its not that unusual. It not like they opened an opera bar or something.  Im not a huge country music fan, but i do enjoy some, and i had a blast here.

 You must order the chicken wings! !!!!!!!! Holy smokes, these are good. Not the traditional small party wings like most places, but the big ones. You know, like the size of real chickens. Anyway, their twist on buffalo sauce was amazing. Not to spicy at all and full of flavor, almost a hint of a tomato base. Absolutely delicious. 

 The beer on tap is awesome,  you serve yourself. Genius! They charge by the oz. And you never wait for a refill or have to wait for a waitress.  I've never seen this before and think its extremely brilliant. Wait staff is awesome and the service was great, even on a packed Friday night"}
{"text":"Service was great, personal beer pitchers (32 oz) are a must! All the sliders are great, wings are delicious, and the pretzel plate is amazing! To top it off great county music!"}
{"text":"No wonder this place has crap reviews. The bartender just accused me of grabbing her ass (really?!) and while getting escorted out my ass was grabbed by as least 3 guys. You will be hearing from my lawyer you assholes."}
{"text":"The bouncers at this place are AWFUL. I mean disrespectful to women all around! I was here a few weeks ago and got a call so I walked outside, leaving my friends in the bar. When I went to re-enter the bouncer physically pushed me (I'm a 5'2 small woman) and told me I was too drunk (I hadn't been drinking that night at all). He made me wait outside for an hour before I could go back in and there was no line what so ever. He also called me every name in the book when I told him I would report him on Yelp. Very professional. I will absolutely never be returning and will be telling all my friends that play in spring training."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place every weekend, my friends and I LOVE it here! No matter if were having a big celebration (we've gotten two tables here in just the past few months), day drinking with mimosas on Sunday or stopping by for a few beers after a weekend dinner we are never disappointed. Great crowd, great music and great staff!

Special shout out to Mason and his staff for making my husbands birthday SO awesome on Friday. You all are the best! :)"}
{"text":"Whoever owns this should be ashamed of themselves. I have never been treated so poorly as a patron. Rude bartenders, so rude they wouldn't serve me the drink I asked and paid for. When I used the ladies room and there was no toilet paper, I tried to alert them to this problem and the bartender threw a bunch of napkins at me. And laughed. Women are not treated as human beings in this place. If you have any respect for yourself as a women do not come here."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. Even worse when it's slow. Two stars for country music but everytime I come here I sit at an almost empty bar with no one to greet me for at least 10 mins. Being in the service industry myself, this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bad service, dirty and the girls are dressed so desperately like Vegas \"workers\" if you know what I mean.
I thought this was a great Gilbert place to bring the kids/family but come on. 
Dress code to get in? This is not LA.
Food was mediocre for the price, water never got refilled, waitress were more interested in being \"nice and cute\" than giving \"good\" customer service...sex does not sell for the more educated! 
If my water is not refilled, you forget napkins (twice after asked), don't bring the extra sauce... your tip is \"solely\" based on your performance! 
 I go back to a place based on service, food, price and cleanness and the kind of people that goes there. 
This is definitely the desperate women crowd and lonely man type. Sorry!  
Not going back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and setting looks very inviting/fun which is why I gave the 3 stars.  We placed our reservation and we were told it would be approximately an hour wait.  Not a problem , it's to be expected with this place just opening, and it was lunch time on the weekend.  We decided to go have dessert beforehand and then returned after our hour was up only to be told it was going to be another 30 minutes before our table would be ready.  This wasn't good news since we had a very hungry group including children so we walked across the street to Oregano's and when we were almost finished with our meal, we received a text message that our table was finally ready!  Very disappointed that this was almost 2 hours after placing our name on the  reservation list!  I may try to actually eat here in a few months once they get everything figured out, staffed right etc however it won't be anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner 20 minutes before happy hour ended. Took 30 minutes just to get a drink order. Watched 2 couples walk out who were sat before us. The 3rd couple sat 10 minutes before us and we got our water before them and then they left when the waitress who didn't seem sorry even though she said it took our order. So far it's bad, might check back in later with another review!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't waste your time trying to eat at Whiskey Row in Gilbert. The service is terrible and the staff doesn't value their customers.  Downtown Gilbert has many other great options to choose from. 

My family of 4 stopped here for a late Mother's Day lunch. The place had a good vibe and there was a live band playing (they were really good too!). It didn't look very busy as there were empty tables waiting to be bussed, however, there was still an hour+ wait to be seated. We wondered around downtown Gilbert for an hour until we were paged for our table. The menu is pretty sparse, but has the typical burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc. The server was slow to take our order, but not unexpected considering how long it took to get a table. What was completely unexpected and inexcusable was the next hour that we waited for our food to arrive. The waitress only stopped by twice during that time and had to be reminded to refill our water glasses.  Unfortunately, I can't comment on the quality of the food because we eventually got sick of waiting and walked out, with our waitress nowhere to be found. The hostesses apologized and told me \"Happy Mother's Day\" as we left.  We walked down the street to a locally owned favorite and were happily eating delicious food within 15 minutes.

This place is a blemish on downtown Gilbert's reputation of being home to quality, family friendly eating establishments that value their customers and community."}
{"text":"Yummy Moscow mule, no copper mug but still tasty. Worst sliders on planet Earth!!! Terrible!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to have a drink and watch the ASU game.  The two bartenders had no interest in waiting on us - specifically 4-5 minutes for them to make eye contact after we sat down (only 8 customers at bar). After one drink and asking twice if one of the TV's could be changed with each time the reply was \"I have to get the manager to change the channel\" we moved on to greener pastures where we got great service and drinks.  Very likely we will not return to DBWR."}
{"text":"At the end of the day I think I would have liked this place better if I would have stopped in for HH...or brunch...or a weeknight...or w/just a few friends. Basically, I just think coming here w/14 other girls on a Saturday night for a bachelorette party, although super fun, is also kind of a chore. 

I really do like the place itself. It's a really big area, and I like that the bar wraps around like a square and that there's plenty of bartenders. If dancing's your thing the dance floor seems pretty big as well.

Like I said, we came for a bachelorette party, and although I didn't personally take care of any of the details, there were a couple small snafus. First, when we called to book a table (this I was actually present for) we were told that we didn't \"have\" to get bottle service, but would probably have to pay some sort of minimum on drinks. They would contact my friend who personally spoke to someone \"soon\" to go over the details. It took somebody a couple weeks to get back to her, but when they did they did inform her we would in fact have to get the \"minimum\" bottle service. Honestly, it really wasn't that big a deal. Like I said, there was 14 of us, and the minimum bottle service was $200 (we got Grey Goose), plus they would throw in a round of shots. 

We got the table for 10 o'clock. However, when we showed up we were told we didn't have it until 10:45. Again, I didn't personally take care of this detail, but they did scramble to get us a table ASAP (it took about 20 min). 

Overall, we had no major issues, and I thought this place was fun. When we left the line to get in was around the corner, and if I were to just randomly come here on a Saturday night I don't think waiting in a long line to get in would be worth it. 

I'd like to come back sometime to try the taps at the tables."}
{"text":"Stopped by to watch ncaa basketball at 1pm on friday. 45 minutes wait although I counted 12 empty tables. Apparently the didn't have enough staff to seat all their available space. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Could use more items on the menu
Thousand Island had what looked like grey poupon in it!!??
Had no seafood cocktail cause for the fish
Great onion rings
Good overall"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good crowd, decent prices and very competent bartenders this is your place. We had a great time with friends and met people from all over the country. 

This place is fun, loud, exuberant and engaging."}
{"text":"It was quiet on a Thursday night. People were still having a good time on the dance floor. The bartenders can have a little attitude. Almost made us feel bad for asking for a drink like we were bothering them."}
{"text":"Apparently nobody that works here gets paid or something cause they are all grouchy AF. Seriously. With the exception of the security/bouncers & the door girl everyone else was rude & hateful. We told a waitresses that there was vomit on the bathroom floor & an hour later it was still there so we told ANOTHER waitress who proceeded to roll her eyes at us & say \"ok\". Gross. It seems they don't care how filthy that is. If you don't mind dealing with waitstaff that treats you like you're a burden to them then this is totally your spot. Such a shame. I love Dierks and I love country bars."}
{"text":"I came in here as a recommendation from Sahalie. We are visiting from Oregon for the Final Four tournament. I was pleasantly surprised with the happy hour, food, atmosphere, and how friendly everyone is. Sahalie was very knowledgeable of the menu and pointed out to try the steak salad and/or flat iron steak. I had the steak salad and the combination of blue cheese dressing and balsamic glaze was divine. My hubby enjoyed the flat iron steak topped with a chimichurri sauce that was cooked to perfection paired garlic fries and creamy horseradish. He said the combo was to die for!!! Thanks for the recommendation Sahalie! This place is a gem! We will definitely be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"This place is going to blow out a lot of bars in Tempe because there is nothing like it down here.  The atmosphere was awesome and the food is incredible.  Try the fried pickles.  They do the full spears instead of the over breaded chips.  I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Update:  I want you to know that Management truly cares and looks into issues brought to their attention. Am very impressed with Kevin's response and interest in our experience. That is a huge plus when Management truly cares! Have bumped this up to 3 stars today. 

Went here just for a beer with my family just now. All we wanted were a few drinks. There were all kinds of empty tables in the bar area but all the seats at the bar were taken. We were told we could not sit at an empty table but would have to wait 25 minutes for an assigned table.  We decided to leave and go to a different restaurant across the street at the time the Manager was approaching us. He said \"Where are you going?\"  We explained we didn't want to wait for a table and only wanted a couple drinks from the bar .....in the meantime the hostess started smirking rudely.  There were seven in our party. I can say none of us would ever go back. Not that great of a place anyway."}
{"text":"Fun and craziness. Love it here. With my boy Sam and Kyle. Good food and a ton of things to do."}
{"text":"9 tables open, fully staffed, 1.5 hour wait... \"we have to seat those on our guest list first\" cue tumble weed in the front waiting area.... Postinos it is. Figure it out guys."}
{"text":"I took my mother and mother-in-law here yesterday for brunch and to be honest I was slightly dreading it!  

I really wanted to go for the atmosphere and they were offering a champagne special that we did not want to pass up!

So with that being said, we showed up around 9:20am, assuming we'd be waiting in a nice long line, since the last time I went to Whiskey Row there was an hour and 45 minute wait but this time there was no line. (Which I was grateful for) 

I attempted to open the door to see if maybe they had it open to start a list but the door was locked (which was perfectly fine, it didn't open until 10 so I honestly didn't expect it to be open)  Just a moment after I tried to open the door, a gentleman opened the door. (I assume this gentleman was the manager) 

I explained to him I was just hoping to get put on the list if he had one, but no big deal if not.  He then told us to come in.  He said we could not only come in but said we could go ahead a choose a table!  I was SHOCKED! (PLEASANTLY).  

The service was FANTASTIC! I was surprised because I assumed with it being Mother's Day it would be a little crazy but our waitress Gabrielle was fantastic and so was our food.  

Based on this last experience I would def. go again!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 910 pm for my birthday. We tried to order some of the speciality drinks from the bar and were then told that they don't make those after 9 pm bc they are too complicated.  But we could order a pitcher of one of them? Came from out of town to go to whiskey row. I am very disappointed and sad to say that I will not return. On the bright side we went across the street to El Hefe and we helped right away and served anything we wanted to order."}
{"text":"We went last night (around 10pm) thinking we'd hear live music on a sat night(nope) and almost a non existent dance floor! Waited line for 20min and watched several girls with Mini dresses gain VIP access and bump our place back in line! I'd go back for day drinking and to try lunch only because I love DB music!"}
{"text":"Great  food, great drinks, friendly staff, and VERY competitive pricing.  Not sure why anybody would give this place anything less than 4 stars! I've visited on MULTIPLE occasions and have yet to have one negative event.  You can't beat their Saturday/Sunday brunch, and the nightlife is amazing as well. We will be returning to Dierks many times!"}
{"text":"We came for a ladies night/reunion and thought Whiskey Row would be fun to come to. We arrived around 6 and were told it would be an hour and a half wait for a party of 6. No big deal, it's a Saturday night. 2 and a half hours later we were still waiting for a table. Every time we asked about it, we were told it would \"just be half an hour to forty-five minutes later. Meanwhile tables were coming and going. The hostesses were pretty rude and snappy. I understand it's busy, but you still need to take the time to acknowledge people and look them in they eye when you are speaking with them. I'm very disappointed as I'd heard great things about the other location."}
{"text":"I really regret having to give this place only 2 stars.  We were expecting to be much happier with the food and service.  They have a HUGE opportunity to capitalize on the forever waiting lists for the  Sunday brunch crowd in downtown Gilbert, but are failing miserably.  The brunch/ breakfast menu is meager, with only ala cart and/ or a minimal selection of breakfast items.  Although the place was more than 1/2 empty, it took about an hour to get food to the table. After all that time, eggs were cooked wrong, what was supposed to be toast came out as a warmed up piece of bread, green chili breakfast burritos had a minimal piece of green chili that was actually only in one half of the burrito.  We asked the manager why so long, she said there was a party of 20 that put the kitchen behind.  I say, with a place this size, if a party of 20 puts the kitchen behind, you need to replace or retrain the kitchen staff.  Gordon Ramsey would certainly have pitched a hissy fit here. 

In my opinion , if you are going to offer breakfast/brunch, and you'd like to put a dent in the business all of the other great downtown breakfast places are doing, you've really got to step up your game, cuz we saw a whole lot of unhappy faces on customers as we were leaving today.  
All that being said, they do have great cocktails, and there are plenty of open tables on a Sunday morning.  
From now on, the game plane is to check in at one of the great breakfast places, Farmhouse or Snooze, and wait it out with a couple of cocktails and a at Whisky Row.  Sorry, but unless things change here, there no way we'd come here for breakfast/ brunch again."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time since it opened on a Sunday evening, was very disappointed in the service. First, it took approximately 10 mins to get waited on for a drink refill. There were 5 bartenders working and not once did one make eye contact with us to ask if we wanted another drink, instead they mingled away with other employees and did not seem to pay attention to their patrons. Almost felt like we were a burden to them. Food was great however, it took 30 mins to order a side of mayo. I understand they are just opening their doors, but come on this is a bad way to keep your locals coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Old Town Scottsdale has the rep of being just a nightclub district, but this place actually has amazing food and a killer happy hour. Don't get me wrong, it is a great bar/nightclub but the food is totally underrated. They make their own fried pickles from scratch and have mini corn dogs made with CHORIZO sausage! Never tried anything like that before but loved it. For the meal I tried the Shrimp & Grits, and for the size of the shrimp it was surprisingly affordable and the grits had chunks of ham in it (I didn't even know what grits were before but loved it lol. Kinda like mashed potatoes). My friend tried the Whiskey Burger and said it was delicious. Grilled jalapeños and bacon under melted cheddar with BBQ sauce. They also have a great drink menu. I tried their New Fashioned, which was served in a mason jar over crushed ice and had fresh blackberries muddled into it. The bartender told me how they use a blackberry whiskey in it and a type of bitters that really makes the drink. The staff is polite and personable, and the girls aren't bad to look at either ;). The layout is cool; big bar, nice open patio, wood panel walls that give it that country feel and the stage where live music performs is ABOVE the bar. As far as an overall restaurant/bar/club in Old Town, this has to be my number 1 spot! This place has everything and you could catch me here any day of the week."}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar. Service was SO SLOW to order. Finally ordered chicken and waffles...DISGUSTING $14 for a half of one waffle with a chicken tender cut in half that were breaded horribly, fried so it left them dripping with grease and tasted fishy! Yes like tilapia. The waffles were burned in the edges and mushy not fully cooked on the inside. I didn't eat them. The jalapeños over took the entire flavors that were of just greasy fried food. HORRIBLE WORST EVER. BUT...the fried pickle app was very good. Stick with a burger. The guy next to me had one it looked fantastic. 
I should've taken a pic of how awful my plate came out too."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for what it is - a country bar crossed with fraternity row. I went there for the later portion of a combined bachelor/bachelorette party, and it worked out for everyone's wants. The features ranged all the way from \"whiskey girls\" dancing on counters with bottles (not quite my thing, but interesting) to fancy gin/strawberry/seltzer drinks served in mason jars (totally my thing.) We had a large group packed into a curved back booth with its own draft pull, and when people from our party got up to mingle, the less energetic of us could kick our feet up and watch the big TVs. 

Not somewhere I would likely go again, but that's just because I'm a nerd and don't really go for the places where ladies dance on tables with shots. But it was perfect for the occasion."}
{"text":"Jamie and Victoria are the absolute best!  They make our experience at Whiskey Row very enjoyable!  Great food! Great drinks! I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This bar is as country as Taylor Swift and the drinks are just as hard as T-Swift's rock and roll. 

Took about ten minutes before a legitimate country artist was played on a Saturday night. Drinks are pricey and good whiskey is (smaybe not surprisingly) completely absent from the liquor menu. New mMs for the bar may be \"Bad 80's Hits brings you Cheap Beer\". 

Sorry Dierks, your bar gets two stars. 

Plus side: anyone looking for a non-country bar with humans drinking alcohol can find that here on the weekends."}
{"text":"One star for the ambiance, but don't even bother ordering anything off their drink menu. It's a Tuesday night and they're literally out of everything. The server listed way too many drinks they were out of, and when we made a comment, she said this was better than any of the other nights. Then she threw out a comment saying they haven't been carrying most of the drinks on the menu. Again, it's a Tuesday night. I suggest they re-print their menu with the drinks they actually do have, and spell \"Dos Equis Ambar\" correctly. Also, my friend ordered a Dierks Dram, hence their name, and the server came back saying they were not able to make that because they're out of bourbon. As I'm typing this, bartender came by and we thought he was gonna say they were out of another drink, but instead said their French 75 has a strong whiskey taste so he wanted to make sure \"the drink wasn't for a girl.\" French 75 does not have whiskey in it and how offensive was that comment?!!! How is this place open?!???"}
{"text":"Not impressed.

Too noisy and the servers looked confused

The food is typical barfood and nothing really out of the ordinary. 

Our server took off with my credit card and then come back for 20 minutes then for the our drinks

Can be just a \"meat market\" place to hang out and check out the half naked chick to serving you drinks. Not the place I bring my little ones to.  

I'll bring my college kids here and just leave them to have their own fun."}
{"text":"Okay I have been to my share of bars and this is by far the place that I will always put at the top of my list. Whether you have a table or just want a fun night out this is the place on mill to be! Mickey, Maddie Mike are the best people who work here. I can say you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I gave Whiskey Row 3 Stars, that is my overall rating after 2 very different visits. My daughter and I visited for lunch last week, we had an amazing welcoming experience, our server Amanda was 5 Stars all the way, our order was taken perfectly, she was friendly and provided top tier service.  It was a great first impression.

So we came back today, unfortunately, we did not have the same experience. We stopped in mid afternoon, it really was not that busy and the hostess was not in anyway warm and friendly like we were greeted last week. She was doing some busy work adding cards to a binder, and she made us feel like we were a bother to her.

Our server today just kept walking by our table, not stopping at all. It was really odd. We saw our previous server Amanda interacting with her customers and we were bummed we were not smart enough to ask for her. If we come back, we will ask for Amanda.

I know that they are a new place, the staff does not seem well trained. I really expect more from such a high profile brand. It's a cool place to hang with your daughter. We played ping pong and even played beer pong, we did it for the sport of it, not a drinking game, come on, she's a teenager.

Mondo, one of the bus boys is super friendly and made us feel very welcome on both visits. Amanda even stopped by our table and said hello.

If you go, just know that it is a new place, and it appears that they are having a few growing pains. The food was good, I am sure it is a blast with live music in the evenings. 

My daughter just walked in as I write this review, she has declared we will be going back, and we will be requesting Amanda as our server."}
{"text":"What were we thinking! Just because your a great CW singer doesn't mean you know jack about running a restaurant.  Anyway we were desperate and decided to sit at the bar.  The bartender was a nice enough guy, and the food was passable.  The hostess could care less about the customers either on our way in, or our way out.  Too busy arranging \"dates\" on her cell phone to acknowledge us on our departure..   Suggest you try Toby Keith's restaurant instead.."}
{"text":"Holly was our server and she was fantastic! She helped us pick our meal and it turned out awesome. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star I would, went in there last Monday night, not packed, my daughter just graduated from ASU, we are country people, went in to eat dinner and celebrate, took over 30 minutes for a waitress to even give us a glass of water, then another 20 minutes to get menus, finally waved down another waitress, ordered a cocktail, she brings me a pitcher of beer, took away my glass, which by the way the beers are served in Cognac glasses, I had to drink the beer out of the pitcher, we ordered appetizers to go before dinner, arrived with dinner, horrible horrible service, the waitress was sweet, not the brightest, since she thought it was funny I drank out of the pitcher without a glass..no condiments to go with the dinner, one at our table didn't eat, the rest of us just had a , whopping $88.00 for a patty melt and a burger! One pitcher, the rest water...I will never go back in there ever again! Go next door to El  Heffes, much better food and service!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I had just happened upon this place. I typically look at Yelp first and I wouldn't have stepped foot in here with the amount of bad reviews it has. 

My party of 4 stopped in for lunch during the week. The atmosphere and the vibe was really cool. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. And then there was the food. Yummmmm. I had the bacon jalapeño burger and it was amazing! The jalapeño came in the form of a sweet/spicy spread and it made the burger top-notch. 

I would highly recommend for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here but was really disappointed in the food and the service. Our table ordered beers and the restaurant was out of the first 3 types of beers ordered, when they finally found one they liked it took about 10 minutes to get. 

We ordered the fried pickle appetizer which was good but they weren't fried all of the way through and so the batter was still a little doughy on the inside. It also took quite some time to receive.

My kids ordered Mac n cheese off of the kids menu which was really quite good, however it definitely needs to come with some kind of side. We ordered wings off of the appetizer menu which ironically came 10 minutes after everyone else's good arrived. They were mediocre. 

The service was not good. Our sever seemed more interested in socializing with friends than tending to the amount of tables she had. We had to wait long periods of time in order to ask for what we needed. You can tell there is a lack of teamwork here because it was pretty impossible the even flag down another server to get something and I saw almost every employee check their phones at least once, including the manager. As someone who has worked as a server, bartender and a manager I was really disappointed to see the lack of attention to his guests. He didn't touch any tables. 

Want to know how I was able to pay attention to all of this stuff? It took an hour and a half from start to finish with waiting for our food as long as we did. 

2 stars for the music and the cool atmosphere. That's about it."}
{"text":"Not a high maintenance guy generally, but took 15-20 minuets to get a light beer (bottled not even poured) when they weren't busy... feel like I should of been compensated: 

Update: just sent you an email"}
{"text":"Everything here was on point! The layout of the restaurant, the laid back vibe, the cool decor, and the awesome country music!!! In addition to a fabulously casual environment the food was delicious! Everything we got...loaded up fries, chicken & waffles, the wings...was amazing! Not to mention the great selection of drinks...I love a good cider on tap!! Oh, and the service! Our server, Melissa, was super friendly and very knowledgable about the food & drinks! I would definitely ask for her next time!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and I liked the many games offered. It's a great place to hang out with friends. Three stars are due to the many mistakes and length of time for our orders to be delivered to our table. Granted the staff are new, but it took a long time to even get our drinks and one was wrong. They didn't put lime wedges on the drinks that normally have them. The food was also slow in delivery altho the waitress did warn us of that. Not sure I'll be back to give them another try with so many other options available."}
{"text":"Such a great place! The atmosphere was a lot of fun. Aside from being a Giants bar (ew!! go Dodgers!) it was really bumpin.
The band was upstairs and away from the crowd, which wasn't my favorite, but the music was great and it made up for it.
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am rating the restaurant and not the club. We got seated right away (nice). However when it came time to order they were out of two things we wanted off the menu. How are you a restaurant and run out of menu items? Our group had 9 people and 4 of us ordered burgers. Two of them came out the way we ordered it. Two of them came out completely well done when all of them were ordered medium. Our waitress was super slow and zero personality."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend in AZ.  Went to Old Town Scottsdale to check out the scene.  Out of all the bar/restaurants this place was the best.  The live band was playing good music.  Came back the next day and the food was great too."}
{"text":"We had a great time here with bottle service of course!  
I only had drinks, didn't try the food.
The drinks were great, they make them stiff, which is always better than weak. (unless you're into that sort-of thing)... They have beer taps at the tables! which is sweet.  Love the live band that plays above the bar.  Pretty sweet.
If we ever come back to Scottsdale, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I really hate writing this review because I've always loved this place. My friends and I frequent Whiskey Row a couple nights a month for a night on the town...great drinks, great atmosphere, music and dancing. I've even seen Dierks himself perform here live twice! It's been my go-to bar in old town ever since opening night. I've had food here 3-4 times total. The food has been great but the service seems to be hit or miss. This is what disappoints me.

Last night, I met up with a friend that was in town that I hadn't seen in years! She'd never been to Scottsdale before so after suggesting many great local restaurants, we decided on Whiskey Row! I knew she'd love it as I do. 

The place was pretty dead, as you would expect on a Tuesday night. We decided to sit at the bar and order drinks and dinner. The drinks were great. We ordered an appetizer immediately after receiving our drinks. It took so long to come that at one point we wondered if it was forgotten. We ordered a simple and standard meal, a combination of sliders, fries and a cup of soup. This took approximately 40 minutes to arrive and is pretty unacceptable, especially because of how empty and not busy it was last night. My friend had clearly ordered her sliders with no cole slaw. Our server/bartender recognized that they came out wrong saying \"sorry, they still put the cole slaw on your sliders\". Really?! He had no intention of making her order right...how she ordered it?! He should have told the kitchen this before he ever brought out our food. We were pretty shocked and definitely should have asked for correct ones .... But honestly were way too hungry to wait another 40 minutes. Now for the food....it was barely warm. Basically cold. Fries....pretty cold. It was very disappointing and seemed as if our food had been waiting back there ready for 15 minutes. 

This experience was pretty frustrating to us. Our of all the restaurants in old town, we chose this one. I highly recommended it to my friend who's not from the area. We were pretty let down. I think the only thing I'll come here for would be drinks on a Friday or Saturday night. Menu is great, food could be great...but when the service is sub-par and then your food is cold....you are turning customers away.

Thank you for being aware of this situation and I really hope something can be turned around because your customers deserve much better. 

Thanks!

{"text":"Was there on a recent Sat nt. 
Wish there was a live country band, but no. Just mixed music which was pretty good.
Drinks and service were mediocre.
Love Dierks Bentley, but could be a little more lively if they work on it."}
{"text":"Food is very off on proportions. The half chicken dinner was big enough for 4 people. The fish dinner wasn't enough for one. The buffalo chicken sandwich was one of the hottest ever and couldn't be finished and my rib eye was a mistaken for a flat iron steak on dill smashed potatoes and when I asked about it I was told I was wrong and that it was a ribeye. Other than those issues the waitress was rather attentive and the food tasted ok. They had only been open about a week so we will give them another try but until then 2 stars is the most I can give them."}
{"text":"First time here. Awful experience. Server was bad. Only saw her twice. Bus boy served our food. We asked for extra sauces and the bus boy brought our items. I went to the bar to get my own refills. We wanted a shirt and hat and guess what, only 1 person could get these items and then we waited a long time.  Food was good. Our server was only interested in her larger table and since there were only 3 of us, we didn't matter. Pretty close to leaving without buying any items. We'll probably never come back. Poor experience and very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's really too bad about this place !  It could be a gold mine ! Great atmosphere , great bands , and corn hole ! What more can you ask for ?! Service ! The service at this place is probably the worst I've ever experienced . I have brought my out of town guest here about 4 times , hoping it'd get better . No such luck ! The servers walk around looking miserable and seem to forget what they're actually there to do ! I watched the manager goof off with them , which is the only time I actually saw them smile , instead of telling them to get their asses to work ! We finally just went up to the bar for our drinks and the bartenders treat you like you're bothering them ! Ha!! Never again ! I'll stick to postino across the street , where  they know how to treat people !"}
{"text":"Claims to be a \"country\" bar but only play 1 country song once every 3 hours. Went there to listen to country and dance but they played hip hop/rap the entire time"}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazing food, and great atmosphere. My only complaint is they ran out of the peanut butter milk stout and vanilla stout flavors (which is rather odd at 5:30p) but the chocolate stout the waitress recommended was amazing so if nothing else it gives me an excuse to go back. 

Had the mushroom burger which was cooked just right with extremely tasty garlic fries. 

Definitely plan to return and try out the little game room section."}
{"text":"Not being the biggest fan of country I was very hesitant to walk into this place when I first moved to Old Town, but after checking it out with my friends a few weeks in, I always know I will eventually end up here every Friday or Saturday night. Remembering that I was there is probably another story. Great food, great atmosphere, the staff are all very friendly and attractive. Their bouncers are very laid back, but lay down the law when need be. Although I lose my dignity there with Taylor M. on more occasions then I am proud of, it is safe to say that this is definitely a spot to check out when you're out in Old Town."}
{"text":"If your gonna call your self a country bar. But when I walk in on a Friday or sat night trying to country dance and instead hear nothing but hip hop . it feels kinda shotty and like false advertising. More so if I go to get the same beer twice and two different bartenders try to charge me two different prices. Im gonna go ahead and leave right then and there. So many better actual country bars ."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. Came with a party of 8, even before the restaurant was overly crowded, and we sat for over ten minutes without being spoken to at all by any of the staff who saw we were there and ignored us."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It was a bit of a let down though. The decor is nice and what you would expect from a bar in Scottsdale. The service was okay. Our server was very attractive and polite but not the most attentive. The food was decent but definitely could have been better. I would give it another try and maybe I'll have a different experience. If they serve lunch, maybe the lunch crowd and service is different. The night time Scottsdale crowd is a special crowd"}
{"text":"My first taste of Arizona nightlife was at Whiskey Row! A group of my classmates decided to take on Scottsdale after our first exam. I am a hip hop/R&B girl at heart and I had never been to a country bar before (I don't even think one exists in SoCal hah) and kind of didn't know what to do with myself at first hah. However, the drinks started flowing and the live band began their set and I ended up having a pretty good time! I know I would probably enjoy it so much more if I listened and liked more country music but I always find myself having a good time here. It would never be my go-to place but I will tag along if somebody wants to go. I hope they can get more live bands playing as the vibe of the place is awesome whenever that occurs. =]"}
{"text":"Jamison and a \"flat\" zero carbonated ginger for 10 bucks??? Who's screwing who here??? Complete ripoff. Wing Wednesday tho!!!"}
{"text":"Came to the new location in downtown Gilbert for a Sunday date night. I was excited due to the good reputation of other locations. 
Started out with a bad hostess, but I still had hope. 
After being seated, I was very disappointed with the menu. There are not many options. You either get a burger or sandwich and with Zinburger across the street.... really? 
Any way, after waiting for 10+ minutes (timer was set, as it became a bet) we still had not seen our waitress. 
We walked out. 
So with it being a bad experience from the moment we walked in to door, I will not return."}
{"text":"This place is neat. It's busy and their food is good. Service a little slow, but given how busy it was on a weekday at feasible"}
{"text":"Could not have asked for a better experience and better food. Had and amazing experience with an amazing server. Daeila was so nice, knowledgeable, and on point! Thanks for making our vacation a great time! Glad we came here and can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"The bouncers are the worst/too aggressive, the bartenders are knock off hot girls, they raised their happy hour prices. What's the point of coming anymore?"}
{"text":"Get your stuff together. Are you a club, restaurant, bar...?? We showed up at 6:30 and they were not seating anyone else for dinner and not accepting names for a wait list. The front staff was horrible- the hostess made it seem as if we needed to leave and no one else was allowed in. After I pulled everyone in our group aside and explained what she said, the girl then came over and tried to re-explain and then said we could try to find space at the bar. They need to have better communication with customers.   We found a slot at the bar to order a drink but it took 30 minutes to get one and another 30 minutes for a check (this was at 7pm). I will give them one more chance in the future but they need to get it together and be customer-focussed"}

{"text":"As a small town farm girl, this was quite the experience. This bar plays THE greatest hits of country, new and old. What more could a girl want!? It's also got that city-bar feel so you don't feel like you're in a BFE bar. The prices are great and the service was quick. Plus there's GAMES. Who doesn't love outside games? 10/10 would recommend."}

{"text":"I have been here about 4 times since they opened and there is nothing good to say about this place. Rude hostesses. Servers who say they can get you drinks at tables you were seated at but not chance they will take a food order. It's expensive which I expect with the name of the place but the service should make up for the higher prices and it doesn't. To top it off, my wife and I had a date tonight and wanted to give hem one more chance. We talk in at about 7:50pm and are told they are no longer taking walk ins all night. There was nooone waiting and open tables available. So my conclusion is that they will not earn another $1 from me"}
{"text":"It was packed at lunch time on a Sunday, we got the last booth in the place. This place is surprisingly smaller than I thought it would be or maybe I didn't expect there to be that many people...all people under 30 years old. The food...everything on the menu looked good. But after a week of fried foods, I decided to have \"Veggie Row\" which consisted of raw and streamed veggies, hummus and a chick pea concoction...all on a school lunch tray...I'll post a picture. My husband ordered some sort burger that was considered a speciality because of it's sauce...but it didn't come out with any sauce and when he asked the waitress about it she said \"it's supposed to have sauce on it\" and then she just stood there...my husband said \"well, can I get some sauce on the side now?\" My teenage daughter seemed a bit uncomfortable in the place and when I asked how she liked her fried pickle burger she said \"this place reminds me of a country Hooters\"....very well described."}

{"text":"We had a great night here. Ioana was an awesome bartender. Her cocktails were amazing and service was spectacular! Ask for her when you go in!!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the worst customer service that I have ever experienced on multiple occasions. however this one takes the cake. 

I lost my purse there over two weeks ago and had called for about 3 days straight asking if it was there was told time and time again that it was not there. Last night I received a message that my purse was found and that they had had it for OVER a week. 

So you see my initial frustration where they've had it for over a week and never tried to contact me. But then when I go in to pick up my purse and talk to the manager on duty he basically said it was my fault and they had no reason to try and contact me I was the one who lost in the first place and that their customer service ends once the customer leaves, it doesn't go beyond that. Not to mention said it in the most condescending way. To me that is absolutely insane I've been in the food industry for over five years and I am always about the guests and making sure that even if my guest has left the building and has left something behind I will try and contact them because I understand the importance of leaving a good impression and being valued as a guest. I understand places can be popular and it's hard to contact someone but when it's someone's phone, car keys, I.D, debit card and house keys you'd think they'd try just a little. Or at least be sympathetic 

Needless to say I will never be going back to whiskey row they have absolutely horrible customer service and they do not deserve a good person's business"}
{"text":"First time here to Dierks Bentley's, sat at the bar and watched the fun crowd of all ages come and go, best part isBeth and Kyle they are great bartenders and made great recommendations on new beers like the Long fin lager and grilled wings. Corn hole and a live music! Great for date night and family night. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My friend was calmly sitting in a chair enjoying the last few minutes of 2017 and a staff members rudely pulled it out from beneath her RUDE"}
{"text":"Our bartender was awsome!  She poured great drinks and was very personable.  We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food, but the atmosphere was on point.  Chris Lane stopped in as he's on tour.  He came in with a wife beater and sun glasses.  Mind you it was midnight or so and he as kind of a douchebag.  BUT, that wasn't the bar's fault haha!"}
{"text":"Came here on Easter Sunday. Place was not very full. Hostess was yacking with other bored staff. Got a table and watched the people next to us walk out without ordering. Waited 10 minutes for service. Walked up to hostess and asked if we could get waited on. She smiled, said yes, and turned back to her friends. We waited another 5 minutes, received no help. As we walked out, I told the hostess how disappointed I was that we couldn't get waited on. She and her friends smiled and said \"Have a nice day.\"

No wonder the word on the street is that you're having problems."}
{"text":"Whiskey Row Scottsdale is the best spot to be for any country fanatic! The food is phenomenal the girls are beautiful and they have over 50 beers on tap! Line dancing is always a plus!"}
{"text":"After failing to get into El Hefe, we were directed  to this neighboring eatery. \"it is owned by the same owner\" Who can go wrong with anything that says \" Dierks Bently\"?  It wasn't packed, was playing good music, and we were seated right away. Our waitress came right away and took our drink order.  We weren't quite ready to order when she brought the drinks so she told us she'd come back in a bit.  I think we messed with her MOJO because we almost felt as though she'd forgotten our table. A young man asked if we'd been taken care of and he'd gone to find our waitress.  She arrived with an apology and all was good.  I ordered the wrap and have to say, I normally don't get them.  The only reason there was any left in my plate is because I simply couldn't fit anymore in my face.  The side I had opted for was an order of garlic fries and it was a very generous order. I felt bad for barely touching them.  Our server carried on great conversation with us.  The atmosphere is a little loud but if you like country music and various televised sports, you will like this place.  It looks as though they remove some of the tables and maybe dancing takes place.  We had just gone for dinner so not quite sure about that.  They have craft beer but they also have my favorite good ole Coors Light.  Same owner doesn't mean same menu. Thismenu is more directed to burgers and fries"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since opening and the service is unparalleled. The servers and bartenders and are attentive even when they are slammed. I had VIP bottle service last weekend and Matt and Dallas took great care of me. If you're looking for an awesome experience in Gilbert, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar yesterday with 4 other Dback fans watching a dumb soccer game. It's 1:45, the dback game started at 1:10.  I asked twice if the game can be put on with 2 different bartenders. Had to leave at 2:00 due to lack of response"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday to watch football. The food and the service were great. However, due to hosting a Broncos fan club they turn every TV to Denver when they are playing. I asked for one tv to be changed to the Cardinals game and the manager said no because the Broncos game was on. So if you come for football and your wanting to watch a game at the same time the Broncos are playing, forget about it. It's an unfortunate situation that alienates all other football fans... If only playing one team on all TV's wasn't an issue it would be a 5 star rating from me."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and it's definitely our last. We were disappointed from start to finish. Sadly. It's a really really nice restaurant upon walking in. But then we proceeded to be ignored for 15 minutes by every waitress. When I asked for the manager, the girl claims she didn't know where the manager was. So I told her what my issue was and then she came back later and said that she was actually our waitress. The food that we got was mediocre at best. The chicken was very very dry. We then ordered 3 white Russians. They come back as shots of all things! Any decent bartender knows that a White Russian is never a shot. We complained and sent the drinks back only for them to come back weaker. We watched him make them from our table and all he did was throw the shot into a glass, add a bunch of milk and ice. So they tasted terrible and we returned them. Then when we complained again, the bartender actually came over to our table which was embarrassing. And he said what is wrong with the drinks? We told him there's no vodka in it and it doesn't even taste like a white russian and we also mentioned that he just threw it in a glass and added stuff and he made a stupid comment that he didn't want it to be too strong because he didn't want us to taste the alcohol. Not only is that the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, but like I said earlier, any decent bartender would know how to make a damn White Russian. This place was a joke. Never coming back. By the way guys, why don't you hire some competent bartenders? Really."}
{"text":"If you're in your early twenties and thrive on drama, this is the place for you!  I fell on their slippery floor before i even passed the opening area where they card you.  Once we finally got our drinks after basically waving money from our bras to the bartenders (it was 9 pm), we were told to \"stay away\" from the dance floor. (Keep in mind, we did not party beforehand, though it was my friend's dirty thirty). We had to chug our drinks (approximately 2 each) in order to dance on the dance floor.  Once we \"passed approval\" to dance on the dance floor, I continued to slip and fall numerous times.  I have no problem with separating drinks from the dance area, but they really should reconsider their spacing regulations. I was my friend's DD for the night so I did not drink anymore than the two I had already consumed.  I continued to fall numerous times due to their slippery floor (granted there were spilled drinks though they weren't allowed on the dance floor) and was eventually thrown out because \"I was too drunk.\"  They were very forceful and the next morning there were bruises on my arms and legs from falling and from them pulling me out of the bar.  I promise to never return because of the rudeness and violence that I felt I endured and I would never recommend this place to anyone. Unless, of course, you're a younger and/or immature person that thrive on this type of behavior.  I wish this was a better experience for me, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Went to whiskey row Gilbert. Sat down for over an hour without any service. The restaurant wasn't busy, we got there at four in the afternoon. I can't even say we got bad service, we got no service at all.  We eventually went to the bar for water and a drink. We sat down back at our table and still no service. We drank our drinks walked the concierge and told the others standing in front of the desk that we waited for over an hour and got no service and still not one of the girls at the desk said a word. We walked out. Worst dining experience ever. The girls working there need training in customer service."}
{"text":"Just had a server. \"ALEX FROM OKLAHOMA!!!\" - unsure if she was capable of working with people in a social setting. Disappeared for almost forty minutes. Then gives us the eye when we don't tip more than 18%?? Yikes... good thing you're pretty."}
{"text":"Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to bring friends here from out of town. We are all staying in Gilbert for a wedding so it was more convenient than heading out to Scottsdale. We were so disappointed. The venue is nice but the drinks are overpriced and the entertainment was horrible. The worst part was that there was an inebriated drunk girl pushing and fighting with people and the security did nothing about it. We left early."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. 
We checked in for a table at 7:30 and were told there would be about an hour and a half wait, possibly a little longer. No big deal. It was a Saturday night in a busy area and we expected to wait.  What we didn't expect was to wait 2 hours and not ever get alerted they would not be seating us.  
At 9:15, there was a long line forming to get into whatever this place becomes after it apparently stops being a restaurant. Our online reservation said there were still 2 parties ahead of us. I finally went up and asked the security guard at the door if they were still seating for dinner and he said no.  I showed him the thing on my phone saying we were still waiting and he said, no, the kitchen was closed. He went and got the GM, hoping to salvage the situation (so, I appreciate him trying), but the GM only made the night worse. 
He basically made excuses that \"this is just such a different type of restaurant concept\" and that \"they didn't know they wouldn't have a table available\".  He kept saying he'd been a restaurant manager for 12 years and asked us if we wanted to have shots on him before we went and found food at a different restaurant. No, we wanted food. That's why we waited 2 hours for a table.  
He asked us to wait there and said he'd be back with a free appetizer coupon for us for next time (or something about appetizers), but it didn't matter because we waited and waited and he never came back. 
I have personally managed restaurants for several years and the actions in the GM's part were completely unacceptable.  
Don't waste your time at this place, which clearly has a learning curve to work on. I will also be emailing corporate about the experience because I refuse to let such bad service become the norm."}
{"text":"Don't open a tab here. The bartenders will charge other people's drinks to your card, and then refuse to give you an itemized receipt showing what you ordered. They kicked my girlfriend out on my birthday, refused to let me close my tab (I walked out with her to make sure she got into the cab safely), and then the next day had charged me for $150 worth of drinks I never ordered, as well as gave themselves a $50 tip. 

Just a bad place with dishonest, poor management, there are much better places to go to in Old Town."}
{"text":"Gave this place 3 tries, all on Saturday evenings. The line to get in is kept far too long considering the inside is half empty and just never moves. The big bearded door guy is kind of a d!ck but what door guy isn't. Finds any reason to not let us in and after reading some other reviews seems like management is no better with customer service. I've only been let in once, the mess of ppl at the bar trying to get drinks and the drink prices themselves is  outrageous, it's like this place wants to be old town scottsdale which is disappointing. I'll give them a try in a few more months to see if they've improved."}

She even came by to make sure I liked my beer that she recommended for me! You get carded coming in so make sure you have your id. There's tv's everywhere which are all hd and the sound is booming!"}
{"text":"What a train wreck. Hot food came cold. Drinks came after food even though ordered first. 

Waitress was non existent. Dirty wine glasses served. She needed to inspect it, instead of just taking it away and replacing. 

Not going to come back. Just save your money and stay away. Much better choices steps away."}
{"text":"This place is getting 1 star not because of the line we had to wait in, or your bartenders, or your servers, or your live performers, or your DJ choices. You deserve much less than this. I would rate a zero, if I could. This place has been a good time for me and my friends to come to, on our weekends off. From work, from kids, from life. However, tonight I witnessed 3 people fornicate in the \"bottle service\" VIP area. There were 3 people bump and grinding on each other while 1 of them got fornicated in front of the crowd in the max-capacity establishment. The girl on girl action then turned into girl on guy action, where the female was clearly having intercourse in the VIP area. Skirt hiked up, \"discrete\" intercourse. One of our group brought this to Whiskey Row's attention. To the security team, and was thrown out of your establishment for disturbing the peace. Not only is this entirely wrong, but this is Gilbert. Not Vegas. (Most) of the residents in this area have taste and class and clearly your establishment does not. Do not come to this place and DO NOT SUPPORT IT. Please share. Make this known. This place is trash and trash alone and giving them your time and your money only supports things like this."}

{"text":"This is a fun place if you're into the country scene. Drinks were average and average price and the music wasn't too loud and obnoxious like some bars can be. Overall it's a fun vibe."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here. I always thought it was just a country bar for drinks, but was shocked by how amazing their food was.  My sister got the tenders and rings and I got the kale salad, both exceptional. But the artichoke dip was even better! I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great time with great food and an even more amazing atmosphere this is the place to be. Located right behind their sister bar El Hefe this place is amazing. From the amazing food menu with delicious options such as the breakfast brunch and all american burger. to the over 40 top tier beers on taps and specialty cocktails you wont go wrong choosing anything. One of my favorite spots to watch football on the weekend or grab dinner during the week or even get a little crazy at night this place literally offers all you could imagine. A country bar located in the heart of Tempe has finally arrived and you wont be disappointing."}
{"text":"Had an excellent time at the bar last night the band was enjoyable. Our server was on the money. Had choice seats at the bar. Ordered sliders and they were delicious. No bud products, owner must have differences with Cindy Hensley McCain. Will be going back."}
{"text":"My first time here. Service was good. Food and drinks were great. It's super loud. They have recently declared that they are a Denver Broncos Bar/Restaurant which is way too unfortunate. They could be more neutral in their football selection and welcome a lot more fans. This was a turnoff."}
{"text":"Make sure you check in to get the southern fries which were super filling. We had just finished dinner and thought to get something to snack on, but we didn't expect the fries to be that big. They were really good though, so if I ever come back I'm definitely gonna get them again.

I ordered the Dierk's Lemonade ($11) which I thought was just okay. Although we didn't spend too much time here and the place was essentially empty when we went, I can already see how this place can just be a fun night out. There are backyard games as well as a dance floor with country music playing all the time. Get your dancing shoes and/or cowboy boots and head on out!"}
{"text":"Pros:
New age country music bar.
Dancing to live music.
Large open floor plan.
Great location in Downtown Gilbert.

Cons:
Sometimes its too loud to talk to someone.
It's always crowded, sometimes overcrowded."}
{"text":"The wait to use the restroom is ridiculous. I've never waited so long to pee. Not okay."}
{"text":"I lose my dignity here Everytime I come, resulting in terrible deductions, excessive binge drinking, and excessive alcohol withdrawal the next morning, cause dry heaving and dyer need for an IV. With that being said I come every week because of the smokeshow girls!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to see Kelsea Ballerini!  What a great birthday present this would be!  My birthday is tomorrow, March 15 and your opening is March 16!  Been waiting for the longest time for you to open in Gilbert!  Love livin' in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Racist bouncer on a Saturday night. Looked my group up and down and told me I couldn't get in with a vertical CA ID but he let a girl in the group ahead of us get in with one."}
{"text":"The bartender with the purple hair is the best! My girlfriend and I decided to grab a drink here after dinner, and will for sure be back simply for the service. Also, the drinks she recommended were great"}
{"text":"Went there on a business trip!  Wow! The service was awesome. Sat at the bar and I went two nights and it was a blast both nights. Food was great. Danielle was my bartender and she was super ! If you ever go and see her there, ask for her and tell her I said she was awesome! I'm moving to Phoenix soon and I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the drinks and the bartenders where nice. But security has some anger issues.  Sadly, I am a Packer fan and this is a Packer bar, but I will never come here again. And when I happened to be walking by another time (not visiting) they were giving some other people a hard time as well. Check your security,  they are going to keep you from a lot of business."}
{"text":"First time here. The patio is cool and service has been great (our server's name is Alex & she's been awesome!). Just enjoying a couple of pitchers and people watching. It's pretty chill & I much prefer that to the scene across the way. I don't even mind the country music :) Will have to come back & try some food!"}
{"text":"Sitting here on a Sunday. Told it would be an hour wait. Place is half empty. It seems the staff needs to catch up. Plenty of seating available on the \"grass area\". Not allowed to use it because it is a \"serving area\". If you don't serve it, it's a waiting area. You can't serve the rest of the place so why not let your potential customers sit and relax. Hey they might order a drink. This is a huge disappointment. I just moved here and was looking forward to this place since I have kids and needed to come during the day. I've counted at least 15 empty tables. Get it together. People want to enjoy."}
{"text":"I hate country.
With that said... I loved this bar. It had live music, great atmosphere,  and sapacious enough for comfort. (At least on a friday night)
The band was taking requests and singinf to the diffetent birthday girls. So much fun!!"}
{"text":"Only because I have to put something down. My first and definitely my last time here. I brought my whole family to celebrate my son and mother's birthday's. While the food and atmosphere was good the service has a lot to be desired for. I was giving my order and the server kept asking for my credit card. I asked her if I can finish the order and she repeated herself. Now mind you she had several of my family's cards already. Nope not good service. Then kept asking for water and was completely ignored!"}
{"text":"I love Whiskey Row in Downtown Gilbert.  The general manager, Adam, is so professional and accommodating.   This country bar is like no other.  I LOVE IT!  I hear the yoga Sunday mornings is pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"Great place nice open atmosphere, good food. I had the southern fries. Readable prices and good size portions. Nice music and servers were friendly and helpful. Get there early, we got there at 7pm but after 8pm it gets pretty crazy and long line to get in. Live music starts after 930pm."}
{"text":"This place is completely racist towards black people. I've gone in 10 times. Every time with black folk, I've gotten stopped at the door. This is a white person's heaven. Absolutely insane."}
{"text":"They didn't play or have country music over the weekend and they really weren't very friendly. Has to be an actual country bar around here somewhere but on the weekend this is just like all the other spots."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Saturday night and there was no wait. But what gives your bouncers to take my drivers license and bend it in half? There are blue lights and scanners for a reason. There was no need to take my license into the palm of your hand and bend it. Now, because this is unacceptable in the state of New Jersey, I need to apply for a new license. If my license had snapped in half, I would have had no identification to use in the airport to get home. I will NEVER return to this location. So scummy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and relaxing. Their brunch is great, I recommend the breakfast burger! Great mimosas and bellinis. I had a groupon for another location but the manager was wonderful and allowed us to use it here. Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great service and fun environment. Slow Tuesday night when we were there but friendly and nice server with delicious food and great drinks. Happy hour menu is very small but still great."}
{"text":"I'm not a country fan by any stretch of the imagination, however during the week this is a really fun bar. I would avoid the long lines on the weekends FYI. I also heard the grub here is pretty darned good."}
{"text":"Dierks still gets those five stars from me but this last visit I was a little disappointed in the food. The fried pickles were still the best I've ever tasted anywhere but the chicken fried chicken and gravy wasn't up to the Yakuts it was on my first visit.  The portion of the chicken was much smaller and the gravy wasn't the \" to die for\" quality we had before. We also got the whiskey sauced wings which were only partially sauced. I was a little disappointed. Maybe a new chef?? Not sure. I'll still go back because I appreciate the staff and I love the atmosphere at Dierks."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch and some drinks to try it out. The place is undoubtedly beautiful! Our server Samantha was amazing, she was so cute and friendly. Our food took along time to come out, being in the business I know this happens when a place just opens, but this was ridiculous. Samantha made sure our drinks were never empty and was very attentive to us and had us laughing and enjoying ourselves! She is the only reason I am giving this review 4 stars even though she is beyond a 5 star server. The artichoke dip is a definite must! It's a good place to try out and I'm sure it will only continue to get better once they get all the kinks out."}
{"text":"Lively fun place. Lunch was great and service excellent.
The almond chicken wrap and breasted turkey on preztel bun were super.. we will return. !!!   :-)"}
{"text":"Mix drinks are WEAK!!!  For $11 at least put a shot in the drink.  Need bartenders that smile and socialize.  2 female bartenders on New Year's Day sucked.  I think they were pissed cause they had to work New Year's Day, or on the Rag.  Had one drink and left!! If you don't like bartending get a job as a house cleaner.."}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite hotspot just because the music and food. Good girls night out or even fun place with couples for weekend brunch. 
Chicken and waffles needed some more sauce but loved the texture of waffles. Sauce was delicious but I personally love extra sauce on everything so I could of asked for more. Pretzels are always a must and my guests got chicken sandwich and it was scrumptious she said."}
{"text":"If you don't care about what you drink, then why not? But if you enjoy whiskey, and enjoy bourbon, well.... This place has Jack Daniel's listed as bourbon. If you don't understand, enjoy this place. If you're an adult, steer clear."}
{"text":"For my first time in Scottsdale we decided to visit Whiskey Row and it was great, however there were a few concerns. When we were seated, we were handed a regular menu and a happy hour menu. When the waitress arrived to the table she said happy hour was unavailable. We questioned because our reservation was canceled for Friday night and the deal for tonight's now reservation was that happy hour would still be honored. The manager was great and honored that, but I was highly disappointed when my bill came to table. Thursday nights \"special\" included \"$4\" Smirnoff drinks. I ordered 3 Smirnoff drinks and was charged $11 for each. When I questioned the charge, I was told by the manager that happy hour didn't start until 9pm; however, nowhere on the menu was 9pm stated for Thursdays night happy hour. The manager gave us free shots for my birthday, but I still feel the description on the menu should be honored. Loved the place and the atmosphere, but menu descriptions could use some work"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who was in town for the weekend. She wanted to grab some lunch and a drink. We walked up and down Mill Ave for about 15 mins before we decided to come here. Upon checking in, I got a an offer for free southern fries! Service was very fast and friendly. My friend ordered a cocktail that she didn't really like so we stuck to drinking a few beers and the order of southern fries.

The southern fries are really good! But the fries do get soggy kinda quick so next time I'll probably ask to make the fries extra crispy. But that BBQ sauce they drizzle on top is so good. It was a very huge portion as well for an appetizer! The chicken on it was very flavorful.

As for the beers go, of course, it is always good but I ordered the orange blossom (I think that's what it's called) but when the server came back, she told me they ran out. When she brought the bill, she charged us for the beer that I never received. She said she will void it out when she rang our bill but she never took the beer off the bill and so we were still charged for it. That's why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. She should have taken the beer off before running our card."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the positive. This place has a great atmosphere, it's huge, open, and there's plenty of seating and places to hangout.  There's a covered open-air section with a stage for live music, and backyard games like corn hole, connect four and beer pong. It gets pretty toasty but as long as you stand in front of one of their giant industrial fans every so often, you'll be okay. There's a large parking lot in the back so parking shouldn't be too much of an issue.

Now for the negative...they only seem to hire beautiful skinny girls under 25.  Is that a negative? Well if you're a self-conscious 30-something year old woman surrounded by a bunch of dudes gawking and commenting at the half naked women...  My waitress didn't seem to know anything about anything. We asked if they served \"whiskey flights\" and she didn't know what a \"fight\" was. We had to explain it to her. Turns out Whiskey Row does not serve whiskey flights. Seems like something they should offer. The guys in my group wanted to order \"boilermakers\" which is a shot of whiskey and a beer. The waitress could not tell us which beers paired well with whiskey. In addition, I ordered the pretzel platter, it was just one pretzel, not much of a platter.  Everything was so overpriced, I could not believe it was as busy as it was. People must come for the atmosphere, aka, to stare a women. 

**Lastly, please put purse hooks in your women's bathroom stalls. I don't like having to hold my purse while I pee!"}
{"text":"Update. Management reached out to listen and make things right. That in itself is impressive. I will be returning to have another round and adjust review accordingly. Thank you. 
Cheers to that."}
{"text":"I met some girlfriends on a Saturday afternoon, they had been open a few weeks or so. There was a live cover band, which was really good. But it was really loud and hard to have a conversation. I was there around 1pm and they still offered Brunch along with their lunch menu. I ended up ordering the Turkey Pretzel Melt and an Iced Tea. The sandwhich was soooo good! And the fries were great too! The service however wasnt great... the waitress didnt come by that often and had to ask random other waitresses to fill my glass a few times.. 

Other than that it was great! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"The music is the best for a country night out with the girls! I love the food and the location!! My new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"Slow service (lunch), even though there were only a few customers there.  Terrible food."}
{"text":"Just a bar. Nothing fancy. Advertises heavily for late nite food. Not true. Cane in on a Sunday at 10 pm. Nothing."}
{"text":"Just bad food. Service was actually pretty friendly and prompt. The fish and chips come with 2 tiny pieces of fish that are greasy. Fries were underdone. Chicken finger seemed like they were fried in old oil. Had weird date spots on them. Flank steak was ok but way overdone. Kids Mac and cheese was fine. Overall atmosphere is great, but unfortunately the food is so horrible."}
{"text":"I accidentally left my cardigan at this bar, so I came back later in the night to retrieve it. They wouldn't let me back in, which is fine because one guy in the front offered to find it for me. While I patiently waited, this other girl I happened to meet that night told me that \"she got me\" and tried sneaking in to find my cardigan. So naturally, one of the bouncers got her to leave. But after that, he grabbed and pushed me on top of that. I wasn't doing anything but waiting for that guy to bring my cardigan back and then all of a sudden this guy man handles me out of nowhere? Thank goodness the first guy was nice enough to go and find my cardigan, though. I'm going to post a photo of the guy that was unnecessarily rough with me."}
{"text":"A+ for the overall atmosphere, they did a great job catering to all ages, have live music, excellent lighting, gaming, and a superb bar with plenty of options. It definitely feels like Nashville when you walk in! If you come here to drink you will be very satisfied. 

The food on the other hand was a very big disappointment. The fries were cold and tasteless, I think they had them pre-prepped hours in advance. The hamburger patty in a regular full size burger was the size of a slider patty, I was shocked to see this - it was almost like they had too many slider pattys made so they slipped one in a regular size burger. We also got an additional two sliders (Tennessee chicken and Bacon Blue), the chicken breading was soggy and nothing that resembles Nashville hot chicken, the other slider was just ok. Garlic fries are the same thing as the regular fries, I didn't taste any real garlic on them just wet cilantro. 

Hopefully this is just due to them being new, getting the fresh and hot kitchen to table routine down. I would give it another shot in the future."}
{"text":"Not a place for food! 
Extremely small selection of choices. 
Quality was mediocre.
Cooking was overdone.
Hard to believe this will survive on being a \"night club\" only at night. 
Eventually the lack of return customers for food will shut them down if not for all the profit on the overpriced alcohol served to the on lookers. I've never seen so many non-country wannabes. This place is like Jekyll and Hyde daytime to night. I guess the traditional songs of trucks, lost dog, ex-wife's and boots needs to include a verse about getting indigestion from fake county bars."}
{"text":"The music was great, beer was great, happy hour deals are awesome. Definitely coming back, as long as Melissa is my server!"}
{"text":"The security staff should ALL be fired. I watched a steroid freak security guard push around a girl who was just waiting for someone to get her sweater. he had no need to do what he did and she has every right to sue the place. I have been there 2 times and each time have seen a security person roughing up people that did nothing. 

Its bad enough that this \"country\" bar is not a country bar but just another dance club with muscle heads wrecking the place.

Will never go never go back again and will tell EVERYONE I can to boycott and avoid this horrible fake country bar. Dierks Bentley should be ashamed to have his name on this place."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place.  I'm not the biggest country fan, but this place is growing on me.  HUGE bar and what's that ... taps at the tables?!  I'm not talking just beer, they have a wide selection of things you can get on tap right at your very table.  Live music above the bar and a great staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a few friends after a Yelp event. Great music country music and good drinks. I was the designated driver for the night and the bartender made me a delicious pineapple/fruit drink on the house. The bartenders were nice and accommodating. It started getting busy a little bit after we got there, but the ambiance was still decent."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more, as it is a wonderful injection of cozy redneck vibes in a sea of EDM and the chef is really great to boot! (pardon my pun) However, if you are doing anything but just drinking at the bar the service has always been painfully s-l-o-w and it is pricey for what you get. I most recently went in for lunch on a Tuesday, place was mostly empty and it did take us a full hour to get in and out. Seems excessive for a salad and sandwich. Fun atmosphere but I will not go there and order food again."}
{"text":"Original review: Terrible bar service. Bartenders need a fire lit under their ass. Moving slower than molasses in the middle of a blizzard. Took 45 minutes to close out our tab after waiting 30 minutes for drinks.

I have been having better experiences here now.
Definitely starting to get better bar service, bartenders are quick to take your order and get you your drink, even when it's busy. 5 star service!"}
{"text":"Shit ass lying bar. Gave money to announce bachelorette. Didn't announce. Lying assholes."}
{"text":"Food is good service is ok until I got the bill which was 102.00 which I gladly handed over my debit card and was told we need to run you driver license also because you spent over 100.00. I have never heard of such a thing I was born & raised here in Scottsdale & go to many bars. But this one will be last on my list of visiting again."}
{"text":"I've never set foot in a Whiskey Row before, and that was a mistake on my part. I've always avoided it like the plague because it just seemed like the typical \"grab a beer and watch sports\" type of place, but last night for dinner I decided to give them a chance. My SO and I were treated very well by the staff and the service was prompt about the food. The food itself was surprisingly good, the southern fries are fantastic and they give you a lot that you can share with others. The music is loud and country, which I don't mind but what's really great is the atmosphere and roominess of the booths! I had a great time here and would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This was just ok..... we arrived Sunday about noon and were told it was a 1.5 hour wait.  We looked around and literally, there were 15 tables/booths open, so we inquired.  We were told there were 72 people on a 10 minute contact for those tables.  Really?  15 tables opened up and 72 people were texted to come for their table?  Uh huh.  They said they do not take reservations or call ahead seating... but when we were told the bar is open seating, there were 'RESERVED' signs everywhere.  These reserved signs were taking up over 20 more chairs for people who... to wait 1.5 hour, had nowhere to be.  We finally went to the back bar, which was 'reserved' and were told we could sit there but wouldn't get service as it wasn't open.  (that makes no sense, flipping busy and the bar isn't open??)  Luckily, Arianna G. came by, said she would love to serve us and it might be quicker than going to the other bar and ordering ourselves.  So..... we spent 1.5 hour waiting on our table at the 'reserved' bar and chatting.

Then, finally, a table was provided. Coincidentally, I had paid attention and in that 1.5 hour, NOT ONE PERSON sat in that table.... ha!!!  But we sat and finally ordered and a half hour later, two burgers, wings and a chicken salad wrap came out.  The food is ok, the atmosphere with live music is what sells this place and the their screwy seating system needs work."}
{"text":"Great place if you want the employees to gossip and talk about you while you are eating.

My second time going here, I decided to bring my friend for the first time since I had a previous enjoyable experience. We were seated and my friend and I decided to go up to the bar to purchase our drinks. As we looked at what to order we asked for a sample of the moon juice and as usual, the bar tender (short male with dark hair and beard) asked for our IDs. As soon as he looked at my friends ID he made a sour face saying her eyes looked darker than they were (the photo was taken 5 years back). He brought us our drinks while still making a shitty face at her and we paid without tipping for his rude behavior. As we sat down I continued to see him call his co-workers over to stare and talk trash about us (mind you he brought around 5 employees) as we ate our dinner. As it was distracting he kept bringing our server over and over again and her service towards us turned sour in result of his gossip. I'm shocked at how a company like this can have employees that think it's \"funny\" to talk trash about their customers when he had a rude attitude to begin with all because of my friends ID picture. Do we need to call the police next time to verify that her ID is real? Absurd. Beware if your picture is more than 5 years old because the male bar tender will make a shitty face and talk about you to the other workers. We are definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Bait and switch. Still advertising on website and menu  happy hour 3-7 1/2 off 50 craft beers   Apparently this is no longer. Will not honor. Then change your menus. I'll never be back"}
{"text":"Apparently this bar, in Arizona, from a local country singer, is a Denver Broncos bar. Everyone is wearing their gear and the DJ is following their game. What a joke...let's exploit the first Fan base that shows promise. F You!!! Let's just have a normal sports bar on sundays. Sell outs? Oh and for whatever reason the turf area for adults to booze and play bags is always overtaken by kids; not necessarily their fault but a disconcerting reoccurring theme for a Sunday football hangout..."}
{"text":"This review comes a bit late but it's well deserved. I'm kicking myself because I can't remember my bartender's name. I think it was Morgan? Like I said it's been a while. So my friend and I came one early evening I think it was a Friday afternoon and it wasn't packed for the night yet of course. I'm not going to lie. I sort of judged especially it being by/on frat row. My friend and I sat at the bar and Morgan was super nice and suggested food for us. We ordered the sliders and boy were they amazing. We asked her where they would be showing the Mayweather McGreggor fight. She said right there! Of course right?! So next day rolls around and we get there super early to eat beforehand. Oh yeah food was super good. Beer, good!!! Lol. Morgan was very attentive as well as Chloe. So if you remember the Mayweather McGreggor fight took forever to start so we were literally there for hours. By that time our asses were sore from those seats at the bar. My friend and I were expecting to pay $50 to watch the fight and they didn't charge anything for females! Sweet! Pays to have a vagina! Lol. Had a fun time here with good service. Will be coming back here when I visit!"}
{"text":"This is a busy hot spot but I was impressed by the versatility of the restaurant to accommodate many different types of dining... the place is very large with different areas, we hung out near the corn hole lawn and eventually got a couch to sit at.  We had several kids with us and the kids had a great time!  Enjoyed the live music and the food wasn't terrible - it was definitely bar food quality but also not too expensive."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday for the first time for my friends birthday ,and we went to the bathroom of course had to wait in line there was about 20 girls in front of us which was to be expected but after about 35 minutes we were wondering what was going on the line wasn't moving so after another maybe 20 minutes we got close enough to see what was going on the security guard that was standing at the door was taking money from ppl to go on in so I finally got close enough to tell him that wasn't right and I asked him for his name and he told me that I didn't need to know that so when we finished up in the bathroom I called over another security guy and told him and he told me to mind my business so I spoke to the manager and he told me not to post anything on yelp I don't know if he ever did anything about it there were several witnesses to this and they also complained but we felt like he could care less!! WILL NEVER GO BACK !!"}
{"text":"This was such a fun environment and the food was delicious. We went for  my brothers graduation and my masters graduation. Loved the music, the games, and I loved that it was family friendly. The only suggestion I have to this place is more attentive service. It took a minute to get our drinks refilled, I understand it is busy, but don't leave me hanging! I love that there were games my nephews could play and o could enjoy. When I come to Gilbert again, I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend and his co workers to watch game 7 of the world series. The servers worked as a team and our server Jordan was especially attentive and sweet. Good food and good prices made for a great experience. Will for sure come back soon."}
{"text":"Place is fun and they have good food. Make sure you validate parking and be prepared for a warm interior(ac sucks)."}
{"text":"Love hanging out here for some day drinking when it isn't too crazy. Good food and our bartender Chloe was on point with recommendations and attention. Custom strawberry boilermakers and Southern fries, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night. I love the facility, it's great. Bigger than the other whiskeys and brings a good vibe to Downtown Gilbert. The live band last night was terrible. They did not sound country at all and looked like a wanna be metal band. The majority of the night they played rock n roll songs. Then they would play half a country song and say \"nahhh how about more of this!\" So not super impressed by this band that played Friday night. They need to a band with more country roots. Not to mention they played the most horrible rendition of \"Don't Stop Believing\"  that I have ever heard."}
{"text":"Food was good, just service needs some improvement.  It would have been great to get the appetizer before the meal.  Music was great but a bit loud for dinner.  I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to eat here. Walked in at 1:30pm on Sunday afternoon and were told it would be a 1 hour 15 minute wait for 2 people, even though half the restaurant had empty seating. No thanks. The hostesses were less than helpful so doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch late on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was just about empty so we sat right away and were highly attended to.
The atmosphere is incredible; love the design of the place. Complete with a dj booth, elevated dance floor, tables with their own taps (you pay by the oz), and tvs everywhere. The music is constantly playing (and is country obviously). 
The menu is great as well, something for everyone. I had the fried pickle burger which was fantastic! Even the fries were especially good: crispy and seasoned just how I like em. They also have a pretty expansive beer menu. 
Great place for families with children during the day/afternoon, however, I'm not sure about later at night. The place looks like it could get pretty crazy! For those looking for good night life, this would probably be a good time! They were voted best night life in the area and best country bar. I would definitely go back!

Update:: Went back the next day for dinner and it was every bit of amazing as it was for lunch. Try Dierks Lemonade, one of their signature cocktails... So good! Also, the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich is delicious as well. It seems you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Paige! Thank the good lord! 5 bartenders and this girl is the only one who is working.  Never met her before, you are so lucky to have her. Server Samantha is equally as amazing! Bravo Paige and Sam, you are what the bar business is all about and what its been missing. Every star belongs to the two of you!  I hope that you are appreciated!"}
{"text":"cool bar great music and attentive bartenders the place did smell of puke but pretty sure it was the bro's out sunday night and not the staff at WR"}
{"text":"Security guy on Steroids!  Absolutely worst treatment I have ever seen!  Arrived last Friday after 50 year old birthday dinner down the street.  Six people in our party. Yep all over 50!  Sitting at bar before 10 pm. Guy walks up and says, \"I'm taking your stools (bar stools)\".  One guy says not now.  The 275 pound bouncer ( that's an estimate) leaves to put on his official (I am so powerful) shirt. Comes back and demands very rudely to get out of chair. The 54 year old guy said no. So instantly the guard puts him in a head lock and lifts him off the chair. He did not resist in any way. The guard takes him out the door, still in headlock and half in the air. The wife kinda freaked out and ran after them and grabbed the guard to let him go. He then threw her to the ground.  She was definitely hurt.  Another guard came to stop the rage!  Manager came and said all would be taken care of!?!
Seriously, like nothing I have witnessed. We were sitting at bar having a beer. Guard could have identified himself and said he needs to take the chairs in 5 or 10 minutes because of 10 pm event. We could have finished up and left. But he really needed to show his brute and get these old folks out!
We love Dierks, sorry his place is run like this.  Sad.

{"text":"Cool place. Enjoyed the food and the games and party atmosphere is awesome. Not the best service but we will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Whiskey Row a couple of times, once for lunch and once for a night out. 

I had a Tomato and Pesto Mozzarella sandwich with Chicken. It was awesome! Everything on the menu looked great and I can't wait to go back to try more of what they have to offer. It's my understanding that their Executive Chef came from the Phoenician and as you can tell when you order from the menu she brought her quality of food with her. 

My experience at night was a positive one as well. It was extremely crowded and I had to wait in line for about 15 minutes but it was definitely worth it. Once I got inside Courtney was my bartender. She was not only quick to serve me but did it with a smile. She helped to recommend drinks and made sure that my glass was never empty. As someone who has a customer service background I noticed that not only was she making me feel like a valued customer but she was able to serve many others with the same geniune attention and service with a smile. 

The only thing I would change about my experience wasn't the staff who served me or the food & beverages I ordered but the overall layout. I wish the dance floor was bigger and the bar itself had a little more room. 

It's a great bar and a fun place to hang out. I will be sure to visit again!"}
{"text":"Racism at its worst . I was in last week for spring training/bachelor party for my uncle .
We were told oldtown scottsdale was a great area to go have some fun .we go to the first place we see that had  a lot of buzz and beautiful woman . We enter the restaurant and we were sat at a table . We ordered about 12 drinks and after that ... Not ONCE did a waitress come stop back at our table , she skipped our table deliberately and went to the two other tables next to us . We've tried to call out multiple waitresses but they all gave us the cold shoulder. Without trying to make a scene we just left and went to another location where they welcomed us with open arms and took our money happily and gave us vip service ..

Btw we are Hispanics from Los Angeles . This is the first time we've ever encountered racism at a club or restaurant . It's disgusting and they should be ashamed"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday morning to checkout the backyard brunch! Was planning on only staying for an hour or so but ended up staying for waaaay longer because we were having such a great time! Our server Sam, was such a sweetheart! She made great recommendations and had us laughing the whole time. Will definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"Good food but really a super fun place to hang out. My daughter loved the flat iron steak and the rest wad good too. Baggo game, life size Pac Man, live music...lots of fun."}
{"text":"We decided to try this.  Went on a Monday when we thought might be a little less crowded.  It was less crowded, but that didn't seem to help.

We sat at the bar, which was about 3/4 full.  There were 4-5 (hard to tell) bartenders and for 15 minutes we were ignored.  The bartenders seemed to enjoy each others company and doted on younger customers.  While we were waiting, we overheard a conversation next to us saying that they had made a mistake in what they ordered.  They left most of what they ordered, paid up and left.  On the other side of us, a women asked for another glass of wine and was told that they were out of it.  My wife finally called one of them over and all she did was tell someone else to get to us.  We waited another 5 minutes until she came over. The first wine that my wife ordered was not available.  They were out of it, so she got a different wine. I had a draft beer.  

We get menus to order food.  When we were ready to order, again we were ignored for a long time.  We decided to pay our bill and leave.

We might try again, but we were VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"So sorry to hear about JDs experience at Whiskey Row... We went last night and had a decent time, but it's definitely not a place for children. What many people don't understand is that Dierks Bentley doesn't own this restaurant (well, maybe less than 5% of it), just like Mr Wolfley doesn't own Wolfies. The names are bought like brands to bring in customers.
Im not sure about Toby Keiths, but I do know they are very family friendly and one is opening up in Peoria on Northern and Loop 101 before the fall. I hope JD and his family will visit and enjoy."}
{"text":"I can't really rate the food or environment, but their customer service is horrible. We were trying to take my two daughters there for their birthday with a large group of friends. Their corporate office was not helpful and very rude so we tried making arrangements locally and got more of the same. We were turned away because we had a large group of 20 that they couldn't accommodate. I guess they don't want 20 people's money or connections. We took our group of 20 to Top Golf which was a great experience."}
{"text":"**Updated Review** - Basing my review on multiple visits.

My original review I started stating, \"So beautiful on the outside but not much yet in between. This place looks like the best party when you drive by on Gilbert Road.\"

Originally when I visited it was the first week and it was very disorganized. Although the server tried her best and they understaffed on the opening weekend, I have still definitely come here to give Dierk's Whiskey Row (DBWR) multiple tries. My previous visits, the brunch was okay; however, the bottomless mimosas are deadly! So depending on what your priorities are, it may be just right or not enough.

My most recent visit was on a Friday evening with a group of six. Downtown Gilbert is crazy busy, so be expected to wait anywhere. While we waited we got a couple drinks from the bar and enjoyed the extra loud music and shouting conversations. The vibe is fun, still feels like a party and the drink I had wasn't too bad. When we got seated, we were seated on the dance floor and we ordered a few appetizers and our entrees. The fried pickles and fries were okay, but I would say that the artichoke dip was the table favorite and I would definitely order again. For our entree, my husband and I shared the patty melt, which is freshly baked marble rye, melted swiss cheese, caramelized onion & thousand island. It was good, I'd say a 7/10, not disappointing but I wouldn't order it again. 

It was around 9 o'clock we were warned by security to finish our food because we would have to clear out so they could allow a dance floor. Although this is fine, I wish they would have set our expectations or at least given us the option to sit somewhere else, because we were definitely forced to clear out within the next ten minutes. Because we cleared out, we drank less, ate less and spent less time at DBWR. Had we not been forced to move, we probably would have enjoyed ourselves longer, spent more money and had a better overall experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Big portion. Service is excellent. Music is a bit loud. Food prices are great. Overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"It gets a star for the music and atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend eating here though, the service is always awful & takes forever even when they are slow.  Its defiantly lacking on the wait staff. Also I think $11 for deep eddies vodka & sprite is a bit ridiculous..."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with 4 bartenders on a Sunday afternoon.  Every single one of them were horrible.  No eye contact to even get their attention for a drink.  Finally after 15 minutes someone asked if we had been helped.  Explained these dirty dishes and glasses are from a previous customer and if they can clean it up.  They only took the plates and did not wipe bar down.  Finally received our beer and ordered an appetizer explaining we would order lunch after we receive our appetizer.  Beer and appetizer came and went and another 20 minutes later could not get any one of the bartenders to pay attention to our empty beer glasses and dirty appetizer plates.  Finally after being completely frustrated I stood up to try and get someone to pay attention, I waved at a bartender for the check and she brought me a beer.  Then explained I asked her for the check, she disappeared, then asked another bartender for our check.  All in all I had to ask 3 out of the 4 bartenders for my check and finally received it.  Worst service I have received in probably 10 years.  Complete lack on understanding of their job duties and responsibilities to the customers.  We were not the only ones at the bar having the same service.  This is a fault on management for lack of training as the manager was behind the bar as well not paying attention to the customers needs."}
{"text":"Okay. 
So, maybe this review has to do with how I'm not typicaly into country. Dont get me wrong, I'll listen to it, I'll sing along to it, and I'll drink whiskey from the bottle like a country girl......... but the crowd at this place. omg. 
I wanted to murder whoever invented plaid. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! If it wasnt some white boy wearing plaid and boots (some of them attractive, yes) It was some strange girl in a mini skirt, and a sparkle tube top... what? Also, I had never seen a rhinestone belt, before this outing. I am thoroughly confused. Its got a very hick-LA feel if you ask me. lol 
Anyways, this place was PACKED on a friday, and I loved the live band. I didnt love the drunk girls trying to two-step ontop of my feet, but was so entertained by the chaos that is WR I didnt complain too much. The service here can be a little slow, because it is so busy, but I guess you cant fault the bar for that. 
I wouldnt come here for a mellow drink with a friend, but if you want to get blacked out drunk and wake up in a strangers bed the next morning... I think that this is the place for you."}
{"text":"During my first/last visit here, I was sadly disappointed. BUT thankfully I gave this place another chance! Some of my feelings on the overly gentrified decor are still the same but thankfully during this visit we got an amazing server and she made all the difference in our experience! Our food came out fast, fresh and delicious & you can tell both the FOH & BOH have made vast improvements over the summer. It was still very loud for a Sunday morning, and the music itself still didn't remind me of anything \"whiskey row\" but the service and food have made me reconsider this place which is a huge step up than the previous experience I had. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review based upon the fact that the bar staff at this place is really really friendly. At most clubs the bartenders are jerks at worst or indifferent at best. At Whiskey Row, they are genuinely friendly and I think that's worthy of two more stars."}
{"text":"Mere is the sh**. Great service for our craZy group of girls! Super busy and fun environment :)"}
{"text":"Me and my friends wanted to go check out Gilbert and check out this bar since it recently opened. First of all I get it it's a poppin place but holy crap that line was so ridiculous never have I waited in line that long! Then we were told if we paid the door guy 10$ a person he would let us in 50$ later he pockets that money and we cut the line but then we had to wait over 30
Minutes to get one dang drink I get it it's busy but I was passed by for people who just walked up to the bar. It was so over crowded and unpleasant . I've been to many many busy bars and this one was so unorganized!  We come there to have fun and have a few drinks not wait a total of 2 hours for 2 drinks and to be so crowded we are packed like sardines. This place has so much potential but something needs to change to make this a better experience for people. The one on mill ave isn't this bad at all! I'll never come back ever . I will say I loved they had a live band !"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your out of town guests. Love the sports on the tv s. The drinks and appetizers are great."}
{"text":"The wings here are not good the sauces a side is not a good combo. Also just a place to watch football but not if you are not a bronco fan. Every employee dressed with a bronco shirt not good for business it should have different teams not just one. The female waitress was nice but the men just starred cleaned our table and not even say hi how you doing?! Simple courtesy. I give 2 stars because of the location and all games and our waitress but not a place I would return to. Doesn't make you feel welcome by the states from employees and please change your uniform if you represent 1 team makes customers feel un welcome from opposite teams!"}
{"text":"I planned a bachelorette party here and while the venue was great, I was extremely disappointed in the staff. 

I was quoted 700 (including tip and tax) for a table for this event. I called and confirmed the reservation and price 2 times after originally booking. When we got there, we were told the total would be 860 and we either took that price or gave up the table. I felt manipulated and coerced into this price. 

If you're planning on doing a bachelorette or booking a table at whiskey row I highly recommend getting a contract in writing beforehand because I have a feeling they do this often!"}
{"text":"Had a friend in from CA, so we swung by after the Eric Church show 3/28 and even though it was just before closing Ashley went above and beyond the call of duty taking care of us, showing my pal swag to take home, sharing some history of the bar. What a great personality and representative for your brand. We will be back, Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I love me some country music, so when I came here with my baseball boys, I kind of expected some twang. Heard too much Luke Bryan and Thomas Rhett's \"T-shirt\" twice,  and then it was dance and not country. Come on, mix it up; it's a country bar! 

Lots of sexy ladies though, but the bathroom lines are the most ridiculous things ever."}
{"text":"First visit on a Saturday afternoon. Confused with all the reserve signs on the tables in the bar area and patio. We opted for an appetizer and a few beers. Spinach artichoke dip was fabulous. Not enough seating for two in the patio area this early in the day. Clean and fun. Wait staff sure was hustling. We will return for a meal soon."}
{"text":"Holly, our server, was fantastic! She helped us pick out our dinner and it was awesome. We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Update: 
This update is WAY over due. A few friends and I went back a week later just for the food. We had a picky drinker with us who wanted her drinks a certain way. The waitress and bartender were both super cool about making the drink as requested. We also ordered a lot of food and everything was delicious! 

Original post
Great atmosphere but I can only assume there's no waitress service on a Saturday night. It's 10:30pm and we came here hoping to get a late night grub. We've been sitting at this table for about 15 minutes and no one was came by. Otherwise, now that we know what to expect, well just come here for the party. Great spot."}
{"text":"Always fun at night time, but has a great food too! Went there recently for dinner and was served by heather (most adorable girl ever) and was so pleased with my experience! She gave us great service and left my whole family so pleased!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, I loved the staff.  This is an up and coming place to hang out for sure.  After the kitchen was closed, they still got us some fries to eat. They were great. Thanks a ton to the staff here !!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place and probably won't be coming back, which I am completely fine with.  Came in right away and sat at the bar, asked for a whiskey list hence the name of the establishment and none were to be found.  We had to move around to the other side of the bar just to see what they had and even then we couldn't.  For Whiskey being in the name they have a horrible selection to choose from.

Felt like our server didn't want to serve us or help us at all.  The way the bar is setup is nice but to get the attention of someone you have to yell or walk around to find them since you cant see through.

Just overall had a bad experience and I hate writing reviews with one star but had no choice with this one."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and I ordered the \"Big Ass Breakfast\" I wasn't very happy with my meal as 1) no toast with the fried eggs C'mon...how about some toast. 2) we had to keep asking for ketchup. Is Ketchup THAT expensive? 3) Same with the syrup for my wife's pancakes. I had to look around on other tables to get silverware, napkins and salt and pepper. I'm usually a big tipper as I understand the dilemma of the wait staff at restaurants, but this time I only left 12% as I didn't feel like they cared about me."}
{"text":"It just needs more country music to be played!"}
{"text":"We had a great time and the food was great.  The atmosphere is laid back and it's just what Gilbert needed.  PS....It's popular and busy so if you are looking to get in and out quickly, this probably isn't the place."}
{"text":"What a fun place!

There was recently a Chargers fan meet up for the Monday Night opener agains the Cardinals.  Our trip organizer reached out to Whiskey Row and they were happy to accomodate us on Sunday night.  They offered drink specials and also were leniant with their dress code so that everyone could wear Chargers jerseys.

It was packed!  However, the service was still fast and friendly, the drinks were strong and everyone left happy.  They played some Chargers videos for us, along with the \"San DIego Super Chargers\" song!

Note: There is currently a Yelp check-in offer for a free appetizer.  I had the Southern Fries, which were amazing.  They were fresh cut fries with white BBQ pulled chicken, melted cheddar, bleu cheese and whiskey BBQ sauce.  They are normall $9 and I would definitely order them again - it was a large portion and filling enough for an entree.

They also have a great beer selection and the music was on point (especially if you are a country music fan).

It didn't seem as pretentious as some of the other nearby bars/clubs.  When I am in the area again, I will make a special visit to Whiskey Row.  Thank you for your awesome hospitality!"}
{"text":"We just stopped by to get some dinner and drinks. There are literally 30 empty seats in the restaurant but somehow it is a 20 minute wait.  WTF??? Seriously???  Then I'm told you text people who live at the W6 apartments to let them know tables are open. Lol. I guess cash in hand for customers who are at your location isn't as good as people who currently are not at your location. Your business either has an issue with staffing or you obviously don't need the business.  Decided to go to ZTejas instead."}
{"text":"I have always loved coming here and have never had a problem until we came to visit two weekends go. We had a group of 6 and we showed up early (around 6:30pm) to insure that we got a table. We wanted to sit around... have some drinks and catch up with some old friends. We had ordered drinks and food (and were continuing to order drinks) until one of the hostesses came and told us (around 8pm) we had to leave because at 10pm they were going to open the booths up for bottle service. We were never given the option to buy bottle service either. After inquiring about it with a manager he said that bottle service was $500 and that we could purchase the package if we wanted. All of the other \"bottle service booths were empty.\" We suggested that \"Would it be possible to move once you had a paying customer for this? I mean we have spent over $550 for our table so far and were still drinking and enjoying each others company. We are not being obnoxious... just hanging out and talking.\" He told us no... that we could no longer sit there and that if we wanted drinks we would have to go up to the bar and wait.... but we had to leave our table.

It would have been nice to know this in advance. When we first go there we would have gladly waited for a table on the floor to insure that we weren't going to be kicked out within a couple of hours. We would have continued ordering food and appetizers but we were so frustrated that we just got up and left. Even after speaking with the manager... he didn't really even seem to care. 

Not only was the situation frustrating but even the service was pretty awful. Our waitress would come to our table and take a drink order from one person and leave before anyone else was able to put in their order. We all had our orders ready and this happened several times. It was just bizarre!

Also- I ordered the chicken wrap but Instead of fries for my side... i asked if there was a fruit option. I was happy when our server said they had a fruit medley... so i ordered it When my food came back it was delivered with two paper thin apple slices. Luckily my wrap filled me up but... two paper thin apple slices doesnt seem like much of a fruit medley to me!

We went across the street to OHSO and spent the rest of our night ordering drinks and appetizers. 

I don't think any of us will probably return to this establishment. Such a shame. Really could be an awesome place if the service was a bit better.

I even went online and emailed customer service and still have never heard back"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but compared to the one in Old Town its way better! So much more room to dance if you're into that. The crowd is a lot more respectful and it was an enjoyable place to meet up with friends. Thursday night seems to be the best night for dancing."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Taps were not working at our table and the wait staff was a bit confused but TV's are everywhere. Great place to watch sports. We had the southern fries as a appetizer and they were very tasty. I even ran into Mitch Moreland from the Texas Rangers."}
{"text":"Always been disappointed with the service here but I gave them another chance. No different this time. Very slow to even acknowledge guests waiting to be seated. It was late afternoon, it was not busy and there was plenty of help available but no one was even interested in helping us. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their Steak Salad! I use to work in old town and I would go there for lunch a couple times a week for that salad. I also loved the Yelp deals! I got a free appetizer just for checking it! And of course it is always a great time when you hit the town for a little country dancing in your high heels!"}
{"text":"So this was the first time here. Very unimpressive. 
Food is just barfood nothing special wasn't very good. 
Very loud.  If you're going with a group and want to hear everybody in the group you're going to be disappointed.  
Service was really bad, was not unusual to wait 20 minutes for a beer or just water.  
The place is actually nice and open.  
Will not be back."}
{"text":"Had a seat at the bar, no wait.  However, we did wait about 7 minutes or so to be \"greeted\", asked what we wanted.  No explaination of restaurant concept, happy hour offerings, food menu, drink list, specialty cocktails, ect....  I did eventually receive a chicken slider, which was good, as well as a artichoke dip, that wasn't hot and not mixed well.  Understanding that opening a restaurant isn't easy, I will return for another go."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome!!! She was the sweetest little thing, we just loved her. We only order appetizers but they were to die for!! Holy moly I've never had a better pretzel and cheese! Great atmosphere. The only \"bad\" thing I have to say about this place is the outdoor cushions were distinguishing. They're orange, which is a super cute color but they show every little/big stain. Kinda gross. Super excited to come back to Scottsdale and visit this place again."}
{"text":"Excellent food - love the pretzel roll turkey sandwich - always fun, always hopping- great service"}
{"text":"Giving this a four star because the Mac n cheese burger is probably one of the best burgers I have ever had! The coffin nail drink was delicious as well! The service was not that great when we got her around 6 but the server was more available as the evening went on. Also the artichoke dip was awesome as well! Better than most I have had! The guys enjoyed the beer tap at the table, kinda fun to not wait for a drink! I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great spot! A country bar that invites all. With so many options around Mill, Whiskey Row hit it right. Awesome food, drinks, good prices, friendly staff, comfy spot, etc, etc. Absolutely NOTHING bad to say about the place."}
{"text":"Easily the worst bar on Mill Ave. Terrible management, terrible personnel, terrible vibes, all around horrendous service from talking to managers out front to the unhappy waitresses forcing their way through the bar. Wish they never added this bar to the area."}
{"text":"We didn't know brunch was a thing at Whiskey Row but happened to arrive during it on our first trip to the Gilbert location.

This location is HUGE (at LEAST two times the size of the Old Town Scottsdale location). The atmosphere is fun and the service is good. There was a live band during brunch on Sunday, which we enjoyed.

I had a salad and my hubs had a burger. The kale & quinoa salad was very good and came with a lot of chicken for the $3 or $4 upcharge. Their version of a BBQ burger was good, but not craveable. The onion rings and grilled chicken wings were delicious, as were our brunch cocktails and beers.

My only complaint is the preteens playing \"beer\" pong in the game area. I'm sure it was just water in the pong cups, but we found the idea of 12 - 13 year old kids practicing beer pong openly a little disturbing. Their parents were right there watching them, so I guess there's really nothing Whiskey Row can do about it, butttt how kid friendly is too friendly when it comes to kids in bars?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, having been to the other locations plenty of times before. In my opinion, this is the best of all of them! Reading some of the other reviews after the fact makes me question whether they were reviewing the right place...

The environment was great! Yes, it was super crowded, but even with that, there was plenty of room to move around and it was relatively easy to get a drink at the bar. The live band was incredible and, although we didn't have the chance to play, I love that they had bags and other games.

Collectively, we ordered sliders and fries (regular, sweet potato, and loaded). Everything came out hot, tasted great, and was very filling. The drinks also came out fast and tasted just as expected.

We went out of our way to go to this location and would do it again!"}
{"text":"Casey (Mr. Sexy) is the BEST bartender! Drinks were amazing, food was fast and my friend and I were laughing the whole time from the great conversation. 
Did I mention he's crazy hot?!?! 
What else could you ask for on a girls night out!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere/set up etc. food was decent. Drinks were fine. But the service and communication of the staff was terrible. Took 15 minutes for a waitress who said hello and then never came back. Took another 15 minutes for a different waitress. Busboy kept grabbing our plates before we were done. We had a large group and the tabs were split (which was quite a difficult request for them) and when they came they were all wrong. We asked to have them put on one single bill which took 30 more minutes. The manager explained that \"all POS systems are different\" as his excuse. I'd like to come back and am sure that we will but hope this place gets its act together quickly. It was like everyone there had never even had a serving job before. We get it, you took forever to open so things had to be rushed, but downtown Gilbert is always packed - there should've been more training and more staff. Especially for a Friday night that was ALSO st Patrick's day. Come on guys..."}
{"text":"A few of my friends and I went to whiskey tonight and purchased a table expecting to have a great time. Everything went well until we went to close out our tab and were immediately confronted by management about not tipping enough when we tipped our bottle service girl $100 in cash and card on a $100 tab. She continued to tell us that she wouldn't serve us if we ever came back to the bar again. This is not the first time we've had a difficult time at whiskey and we are really disappointed with how we were treated tonight."}
{"text":"Great hang out spot for a chill happy hour. My waitress Leslie was awesome! Gave great beer recommendations, gave us attraction recommendations, was attentive and brought our appetizer out as soon as she walked away from taking our order. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our time at Whiskey Row!"}
{"text":"I generally love this place. Went in last night around 11pm with another friend. 3 woman bartenders. Maybe 30 people in this place. My girlfriend and I stood at the bar for 15 minutes and watched while the woman bartenders waited on all the men. No one even made eye contact with us. The \"new\" manager was standing out when we left. Told us to have a good night and I told him exactly what had happened he said \"I'll talk to them\" NOT please come back in and I will get you a drink. Horrible customer service if you aren't a guy."}
{"text":"Cool little spot right in Old Town Scottsdale right in the center of all the other bars. They do a great job at night and also during the day for lunch. Beautiful friendly staff."}
{"text":"My experience with Kate the bartender/manager and Keegan the bouncer was horrific. I ordered a 805 beer which was warm. I let Kate know and she offered ice (they apparently don't have cold glasses). She then asked for card and I lean to my friend and say \"This is why we don't come down to Mill.\" She then makes a smart remark about company policy (I never disagreed). Next, our friend ordered a Stella, minutes go by while Kate socializes with boys at the bar. Finally, we get the attention of the bar back who then has to get Kate to help us. Apparently, my comment \"Service at its best,\" upsets Kate so much, she feels the need to get Keegan to ask me to leave the bar. Excuse me, but I am a paying customer, who calmly pointed out the flaws in her service. Will I be going back??? NO, and I will make sure to share my experience with others."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! We started with the Southern Fries, they are hand cut fries with chicken, bbq sauce and bleue cheese dressing on them. The fries are absolutely delectable and 1 is plenty to share between 3 or 4 people.  I had the grilled cheese for my meal and substitued sweet potato chips for the tomato soup.  I added the candied bacon to my sandwich and I'm glad I did because it was some of the best bacon I have ever had. I can't wait to go back and have the grilled cheese again the twang of the goat cheese paired with the sweetness of the onion jam is amazing.  For dessert there we had Strawberry Shortcake. It was very good, and not too sweet.  The service was great! The only issue I had was if you're short and they seat you at one of the tables or the bar it's kind of uncomfortable because there isn't a bar high enough on the chair for your feet but other than that, my experience was very good!"}
{"text":"Sooo...If I could give half stars, this place would have received2.5 stars.  It was okay, not great, not bad, just okay.  The music was way too loud for my personal preference, and there were lots of tables available on a Saturday afternoon when we were informed of our 20 minute wait time.  My wife had the whiskey burger which was okay.  I had the turkey pretzel sandwich which was actually really delicious.  But I wasn't impressed with the wait staff or my need to yell in order to talk to my friends.  I probably wouldn't come here again considering the other choices I have in the vicinity."}
{"text":"crowded, yeah. dancing on the bar, yup. but if you love country music and a good time (or maybe just the latter) this is really fun.

ps: don't look up when you first walk in. it's kinda freaky."}
{"text":"Standard club in Scottsdale.  Twenty-something women (mostly all hammered) being hit on by 45-55 year old men (again, mostly all hammered)...  And if that isn't a sleazy enough scene for you, then your thirst for the sleaze will surely be quenched when the unitard/booty short wearing bar maids climb up on the bar (Coyote Ugly circa 1997...) and shake it for the folks waiting 30 minutes to get their over priced drinks.  Maybe I am just getting old, but when the girls climbed up on the bar...it just made me feel bad for them and the person that thinks this is still innovative/cool for business.

The DJ plays very little country music.  The drinks are really pricey.  Paid $18 for two 12 ounce beers...

It is a cool set up...but the over arching theme/act in this place, just made me want to go home and shower."}
{"text":"Live band is cool. Bar hoes are hot.  What else can you ask for? More fat people!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time, for the Chris Janson concert Friday night. The hostess & waitresses are really nice & friendly. We love the atmosphere. The food was really good & they have a good selection of food and beer & it's not ridiculously overpriced. It does get packed really quick, & security is on top of everything which was nice cuz people tend to get rowdy as the party goes on! :) but we definitely had a good time. Next time we go, it will be for lunch or a week day dinner, to see what the calmer environment is like."}
{"text":"By far the worse experience I've ever had at this place. My boyfriend was not let in to this place because he was wearing a plain white tee. What I think is interesting is while we were outside waiting to figure something out, a good handful of guys walked in with plain white tees with no problem at all. Because they assumed my boyfriend was going to cause trouble they gave him a hard time but no one else. My boyfriend was even willing to buy a shirt from there to put on with no hesitation but they didn't have his size so even with that it shows he was willing to compromise. But still wouldn't even work with him at all because they judged him from the get-go. Never will I give this place my money or time, I guess if you're not white you'd shouldn't bother either."}
{"text":"This place is SO COOL. The theme is great and the decor match the theme perfectly. The bar tenders were extremely nice and greeted us/ seated us/ served us so fast. Although this is western themed, you do not have to dress in the garb. Any outfit will due. I never drink whisky so asked the bartender to serve me his favorite and even though I do not like whiskey, I really enjoyed the drinks. This bar is the first bar that I have seen where there are taps on each of the tables so you are able to serve yourself as much (or as little) beer  as you would like (it automatically calculates the total based on how many ounces are served). Also, the tables double as games so you can drink eat and play at the same time."}
{"text":"Meh! Gorgeous women in no clothing dishing out below average service. I expected more. Food was okay, not great."}
{"text":"We just tried to go have lunch here today. It was fairley busy, but open tables all over. They told us the wait was going to be an hour and thirty minutes. I question as to why with open tables everywhere. The answer was that the kitchen was backed up. Ok i get it opening weekend not completely ready... so I asked are we able to sit at a table have drinks enjoy the atmosphere rather than wait in the lobby. I was told no, so I responded so you'd rather have potential customers wait in the lobby rather than spend money on drinks at a table.  The response was yes..."}
{"text":"Went there on Mother's Day for brunch with some friends. We were worried about it being a holiday how long the wait would be. To our pleasant surprise, the staff was extremely accommodating and seated us right away at a fun table/Foosball table. Our orders included: The Mac n cheese burger, Nutella Cream cheese stuffed French toast, and a cheddar bacon omelette. All of them were delicious... We didn't realize there is a Nutella cream cheese, which threw us off. We thought it said Nutella AND cream cheese. Where can we buy this stuff in bulk????? Also, on Sundays they have $15 mimosas with penny refills!!! Which the bartender adjusted to our taste as far as ratio of OJ. Be cautious, we had one mixed drink other than mimosas and it was PACKED with ice, next time we will ask for light ice. Also, I expected more bacon in the cheddar bacon omelette. BUT - I would also order everything again and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had heard some not so great things about this place but decided to go because there's nothing else in Gilbert and we had a friend in town. My expectations were low but it was awesome and we had so much fun. The music was good, dancing was fun and the drinks were reasonable. We also loved the games in the private area and had a blast playing giant jenga. Also, I read a lot of bad reviews about security before we came here but Mike, Kenny & Brad were really nice in security while we waited in line to get in. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and really fun atmosphere. They just need to get the check in offer like the one in old town has. They always have live music and the food is pretty good too. Best in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Ive been to the Scottsdale location at night and was not a fan of the bedazzled affliction shirts and drugstore cowboys. However, on the first Sunday of NFL football we decided to hit this spot up for some pregame beers and lunch before going to the Stadium. The crowd was super casual which was nice, my guessing was the rootin tootin drugstore cowboys were sleeping off their hangovers... We were quickly seated and drinks came quickity split. We ordered our chow and I got the whiskey burger with a side salad. I asked for a hardboiled egg and was DENIED! haha... apparently they don't have hardboiled eggs but makes me wonder what they use for their eggs in the breakfast menu... No worries though, my buddy got the same thing with fries. I showed the waitress I checked in and scored a free southern fires. They were pretty damn good... They are meant more for a bigger group since my buddy and I couldn't finish them. They have TV's galore which is a beautiful thing!!! I did however start getting anxiety because they would play a song loud as hell during commercials, it would only play 1/4 of a song them BAM back to the game... Then BAM back to loud 1/3 of a some... Then BAM back to the game... I dealt with it though. The food got to us and it was delicious. On top of this our waitress was on point.. The cooks could have tried a little harder with the salad... I feel like I was a kid, sitting at my parents dinner table and mom would throw a bit of lettuce, a couple carrot slices, and a cucumber slice and call it a salad. it was pretty mediocre, at least give me a 1 crouton... The whole place was nice and even the bathroom was clean, that was until some dude decided a public bathroom was the best place to unload a atom bomb, but the workers there were on it!!! I would def. go back during the day for more beer and burgers, next time ill skip the salad."}
{"text":"So since visiting ive been back a few times. The manager (Kevin) reached out and offered to make things right for me and he honestly truly cares about the customer. He offered to talk to the waitress and get her some extra training and also said he would handle the kid situation. 

So I decided go give it another chance and I'm glad I did. We got a new waitress and she kept me busy with a beer and my hand, was quick to get my order, and checked up on me to make sure I was alright. I do kinda feel like the days and times you come in affect the service you get a bit. They have the Varsity Squad working Thursday - Saturday afternoons and nights and JV working days and weekdays. However, it was a good experience eacheck other time ive come back. Only 1 times fid I have a run in with a hostess that had a attitude, but I didn't let her 1 min interaction ruin my experience. Ill def go back, management seems to really care about the operation and it seems to be a priority to right the wrongs!"}
{"text":"Came for a Bachelor Party and was significantly disappointed. We went on a busy Friday night with the understanding this was a country Bar/ Club... I felt like I was at a MMA event with all the Affliction everywhere.. The dance floor was completely packed with people just standing around fist pumping to techno country music... several people thought it was smart to try to grab at my cowboy hat and try to put it on, one guy in the bathroom line got frisky after I scolded him after he tried to grab my hat. Maybe I've just gotten to old (32) to deal with 21 yr. olds, but this was just not for me. I love country music and beer drinking rowdiness, but this looks like someone dumped a room full of \"North Scottsdale\" in a room. This is not for the true Country fan... I can barely see in there with all the affliction and ed hardy bedazzled shirts in there. Overall was a fun night (mostly because of my group). True trendy club at its best."}
{"text":"This place is super fun, but unfortunately we waited in line for an hour just to get in on a Saturday night. We got there before 10, didn't get in until after 11pm. Once we got in it was a lot of fun, the music, people, and dancing are all great but while waiting in line we saw people just walking up and getting in! The bouncer said they were at capacity which is understandable but we didn't get why they were letting people walk in and skip the line when we waited for an hour. Other than that, no complaints this place is one of the best country bars to go to in the valley!"}
{"text":"Went here Friday evening after work for happy hour around 630-7ish.  We ended up liking the atmosphere and posted up until like 11PM!  The music they played was actually pretty good, not ALL country music.  The crowd was interesting, 25-30 somethings with a few 50's sprinkled in the mix.  There was the normal Scottsdale crowd...you know, bedazzled jeans/belt buckles, shmedium sized shirts.  Then there were your random camo wearing cowboy hats.  And just your average people.  So it was a nice mix and definitely some great people watching.  

We had the Chips and Dip for $7.  It was.....bleh.  The chips were soggy and lip so in order to get the dip onto the chip you had to use a fork and fold it over. Eh.....

On a good note our bar tender was awesome !  She was super attentive (even once it got packed) and funny!  She made killer drinks and chatted it up with us ladies, and if you're a lady...you know that can be quite rare.  

Another interesting thing is their band is above the bar.  So, if you're sitting at the bar you just see flailing arms, the end of a guitar and the occasional hair flip.  The band on Friday was not too great so we preferred the DJ over the live brand which is surprising.  The later it got into the evening the longer the line got leading up to the door.  When I go back again I will be doing it the same way I did (happy hour into the night), I don't foresee myself waiting in line to get in. 

I am looking forward to going back and sitting at a booth with a little mini tap and ordering some beer and kicking back.  Maybe having food with a little more substance in hopes that it's yummier than the Chips and Dip.  I will definitely be back to this bar!"}
{"text":"Very attractive female help staff is always a plus.  All of the staff was surprisingly very friendly.  

Fair prices and top notch ambience

As far as a country bar not so much, more like pop country hip hop.  Men should not wear man scarves and skinny jeans. Enough said"}
{"text":"Tasty food and some sweet live music occasionally. Super hot waitresses all the time. Plus, it's Dierk's bar, C'mon."}
{"text":"1 star is too high of a rating for this place. Probably the worst bar I have ever been in. In every aspect. First off its a country bar that doesn't play country music. On rodeo weekend they played non stop hip hop.yeah RODEO WEEKEND. Ive been to probably 30 different country bars in my time and this is the only one that doesn't play country music. So now I just want a drink since I can't enjoy the music. I walk right up to the bar and wait about 10 mins before the angry blonde bartender asks me what I want. I order a jack and coke and other drinks for my girl and her friends. I take a sip and it's not jack. It's Evan Williams. I have been a bartender for 20 years and I have drank jack my whole life. I know what jack tastes like and what Evan Williams tastes like. So I go up to the same girl and ask if they have jack Daniel's and she says no we're out. So instead of telling me they are out of jack and asking if I wanted something else she just decided for me and charged me. Well I would never have ordered Evan Williams, that's for sure. So now I have a drink I can't drink and music that is just terrible. After the girls finish their drinks we leave to go to the next bar and realize 2 of the 4 girls can't find their wallets. So we go back and tell the security we have 2 lost wallets and they don't really care. Not a single person helped in any way. 2 girls both losing their wallets in the same place within 45 mins. They were stolen. We looked everywhere in that bar and they are gone. So now we have to go home cause 2 people don't have id now. I will NEVER step foot in that bar again and I will make sure everybody I know knows how terrible this place is."}
{"text":"Scottsdale Douche-bags male AND female, everywhere you look? Check.
Arrogant \"Im here for you when Im damn good and ready\" bartenders? Check.
Music so ridiculously loud your ears ring for three days afterwards? Check.

Thats Whiskey Row for ya!

PS. Really, Really,really ridiculously good looking women dancing on bar in short denim shorts and boots.... Not terrible. I will admit to that."}
{"text":"The brunch is SO BOMB HERE! Try one of their Bellinis they are to do die for. So refreshing!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thurs night with friends for Happy Hour. We arrived at 5:45 (as proof via our texts alerting each other we had arrived), we sat at a table to the rear of the bar. We sat and waited a while...watching our waitress walk by numerous times. When she finally got to us we ordered drinks and asked for Happy Hour food menus. Once again we waited...and wait. She finally arrived with our drinks & we were ready to order but she dropped of our drinks and hurried away despite our attempts to give her our food order. After watching her walk past our table again & again we FINALLY flagged her down to place our order...only to be told \"Happy hour ended 5mins ago\" :( We tried to reason with her but she pretty much blew us off stating there was nothing she could do. Fine! We ordered anyway. But after sitting there stewing for a minute we decided to speak to the Manager. The only reason, I gave 2 stars is due to the manager being so gracious and accommodating. He gladly gave us HH pricing once we explained the situation. Thinking that now the waitress would surely be more attentive considering that we had spoken to her manager but NOPE!! Our service only got worse. While she was polite, she was just very absent minded and oblivious to things like empty cocktails. 

The food was mediocre at best. The smothered fries were great but everything else was greasy (not in the good way) and bland. Such a disappointment cause I was really excited about the menu. 

In addition to the bad service and blah food, we thought it was odd that it was Football Season and they didn't have the NFL game on the big screen...instead of a loop of advertisements for the bar. We finally left to go watch the game elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were getting brunch across the street and was told the wait would be an hour so we decided to kill time and grab some drinks. 

The morning atmosphere at Dierks is very casual. I loved coming in seeing families playing with the provided lawn games enjoying the indoor/outdoor patio feel. 

The drinks were delicious and our bartender was great! Will definitely come back for their night life and for early drinks."}
{"text":"No line dancing on thursdays during the summer. Bummer! Kitchen closes at 8:30, couldn't even order check - in deal.  Good selection of beer. They charge 3% tech processing fee for card transactions."}
{"text":"First time here and it was awesome thank u waitress Nicole and the mini pitcher was the best idea ever"}
{"text":"The food is good. However, the service is terrible and you can tell it is because of management. The drinks are overpriced for what you get. You can pay the same price for drinks at any of the other restaurants in the Heritage District and get a way better product."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best spot in Scottsdale. Love the Bartender Dan. Great service and such a friendly personality. He's my go to. Jordan and Andrew are good friends too. This is home away from home. Love these guys!"}
{"text":"Love it! Fun place, great drink and cool cocktails.   Service was friendly and nice will be back next trip."}
{"text":"I have been to this new bar twice and have been far from impressed. 

First night: showed up around 9pm. There were still tables on the dance floor, so obviously no dancing was allowed yet. They do have a really cool set up with ping-pong and life-size jinga, which is the reason for the second star. It was really hard to get a drink, the staff seemed annoyed that I wanted a drink, and once I got one it was $17, granted it was a double but that still seemed like a lot. There are no cocktail waitresses... all drinks must go through the bar. They moved the tables off the dance floor around 1030pm and I was at the bar again. Security was taking the chairs from the bar at the same time they were taking the tables from the dance floor and while I was standing, they were VERY rude to the people in the chairs. They almost literally forced one guy out of a chair for asking why he couldn't finish his drink sitting down. The guy with the drink could have been more polite, but since security should be setting the example, they could have been much more polite. After those extremely controversial chairs were removed, all went well from there. 

Night two: showed up around 1130pm. It seemed near impossible to get up to the bar-- customers were just standing around talking and even dancing, making it near impossible for anyone to get a drink. They bar tenders not security attempted to get people to move so other could get a drink. It took me about five minutes to get up to the bar, because saying \"excuse me\" either got ignored or almost started a fight. 

Once I got up to the bar I waited another ten minutes just to get my drink order. It seemed like a cluster behind the bar. One bartender was arguing with customer, another bar tender brought over drinks that no one in the area had ordered... all while we had yet to get our order taken. Once we ordered, we got our two drinks, paid $36 for two drinks before tip (doubles, again) and we went to go near the dance floor. 

We walked to the very front by the DJ stage and just wanted to walk across the front of the dance floor to get to the other side where our friends were. Security ran up on us like we were fighting and told us we needed to get off the dance floor because we had drinks. Mind you they stopped us while we were walking across the front of the dance floor with no intention of stopping. 

That explained why people were clogging the bar area with dancing and talking. I can understand why a bar would say no drinks on the dance floor. Drinks drop drinks and yes it is annoying. However, it's a bar (a place that serves drinks) that is known for being a place to dance (on a dance floor). 

This place can definitely use some work. These two visits were more than enough for me. I'll try again in a couple months once they work out the kinks..."}
{"text":"This bar was a horrible disappointment. We went looking for bourbon and country music, and hoping for a country western vibe (albeit modern country, because this is Dierks Bentley).  What we got was the opposite of a \"whiskey bar\" - there were approximately a dozen bourbons you could find at any old bar. I felt like I was at a Hooter's - the bartenders were wearing bathing suits and worse were inattentive. We sat with empty rocks glasses for almost ten minutes. All country music was mixed until it was house dance music. Definitely NOT what was advertised.

\"Whiskey bar\"?  Where is the Pappy's?  What whiskey bar serves Basil Hayden's watered down?"}
{"text":"Holly was a horrible server and it took forever to get our food when there were only 4 tables in the restaurant. Food was mediocre, nothing special and not a lot of gluten free options. Priced well though."}
{"text":"Packed, which is because overall the bar is pretty awesome. Great music. Great drinks. Great food. Staff was much better then other bars we had visited UNTIL one staff from the previous bar told a bouncer our guests needed to leave based on something that had happened at another bar. Again when we asked why, no explanation, nothing. My feelings are simply the staff need to grow up. Go figure- they have the same owner and were affiliated with each other. 

But overall, the bar is awesome, cool atmosphere, cool crowds, etc. The staff could be better... not impressed by the staff or service."}
{"text":"The food is not great,,, specially the one I ordered (kale and quinoa) plus chicken. The chicken was cut too small, it's like a cut for small kid to eat. And very little servings for $4.00 additional price of the chicken is not worth it.  I could have just buy a rotisserie at Sam's club or Walmart for $4.99 for the whole chicken and more flavorful than the one they served to me....I definitely not coming back....Not good food..."}
{"text":"We Loved Our Date Night at Dierk's Bar! Having moved to Phoenix from Nashville last November and being huge fans of his it was like revisiting a part of our home yet in a cool venue with excellent music and superb service. The staff was courteous, professional and prompt. Even Security was vigilant yet helped the ladies in keeping our table clear. We were made to feel very V.I.P.  Great Job Folks and Thankyou Dierks. (Randy n Shelle Myrick)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great too. I had the jalapeño ranch chicken sandwich and it was fantastic. The other people I was with got the whiskey burger and said they loved that! The cocktails were good except a little too pricey. Overall my experience here was great!"}
{"text":"We were so extremely disappointed in this place! We had been looking forward to going for months after all the hype. When we walked in you could barely move from all the people...the bartenders were rude...dance floor was too small... Food was mediocre... We managed to find a seat at the bar after 30 minutes if standing butt to butt with other people. My husband went to the restroom and three different guys came up and asked if I wanted to \"hang out.\" If you're single I guess that wouldn't be so bad... We were also accosted by a crazy person when we tried to leave who tried to get our address and wouldn't leave us alone. We will never go back."}
