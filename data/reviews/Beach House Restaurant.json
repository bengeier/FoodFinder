{"text":"The Beach House is a long standing family owned and operated business in the South Hills - Finleyville, PA    A diner with great breakfast and lunch food. I am a regular here and enjoy eating here. It's small, it's busy, and it's reasonable. The food never dissapoints. Fresh ingredients, freshly and quickly made. Down home good place with friendly employees.  \". . . . i had to wait too long\" \". . . . they don't accept credit cards\" \". . . . their ATM was down\" \". . . . hire more wait staff\"  GET OVER YOURSELVES! It's not that bad. Unfortunately we have to read through it all and decide for ourselves. But! If you stay home. . . I get waited on quicker. It's all good!  Don't miss out on a cool little place for a great frittata or a wonderul rueben"}
{"text":"I and my friends very much enjoyed our food. I had the Greek frittata, it was very tasty. It was a bit of a wait for our food, but it was busy. I do wish they would take credit cards, but they do provide an ATM."}
{"text":"We were looking to try a new breakfast place and were drawn in by the French Toast options.  We got a table pretty quickly that quickly accommodated my husband, toddler, and me.  Service was quick and friendly and the coffee was surprisingly fabulous.  We both ordered combos - he had the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes and I had the Brown Sugar Cinnamon French Toast.  Both were fantastic.  Eggs/Bacon/etc was pretty normal but still good.  Enjoyable breakfast!  Just remember to bring cash :-)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for breakfast Sunday Morning.  Service was pretty decent and the food was, as always, very good.  We hit this place about once a month and find it good food at a good value.  If you've never been there, it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place was great!! We have lived near here for over 21 years and have never tried it until now. It looks small from the outside, but it's quite big inside. Very cute and quaint, beach themed. Seated within 15 minutes on a Sunday morning, every seat was taken and some others were waiting. The service was alright, the food was big portions!! Affordable, quality, and quantity. Those words all describe this place! Great place near home for a breakfast. You can customize what you get. They have a large variety! The coffee was alright, normal diner coffee. The frittatas were huge, filling, and cheap! Yum!! Absolutely recommend this place, will be back."}
{"text":"I really love the crunchy French toast!!! But when it takes 20 mins to get greeted, I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife has been urging me to try this place, and I'm glad we did. My son and his girlfriend were in for the Thanksgiving holiday and we were looking for some place different to take them. The food was excellent and reasonably priced.  The down side is that the restaurant is tiny so there can be a wait for a table. They also only take cash, so a stop at an ATM is advised."}
{"text":"Went back to the beach house again today. After I left my tip 5 months ago, obviously nothing has changed. My girlfriend & I went to have breakfast at 10:15. We sat ourselves, then after a few minutes I proceeded to get out own menus, bc we are pretty indecisive. I looked at my watch & it was 10:30, & yet have been talked to. The single waitress that was there took an order from another couple that got there after us. We still did not have any drinks. I tried to wave the girl over to get her attention, when she came over she told me she was really busy, & she would be with us in a few minutes, well at this time it had been 20 minutes & I wasn't waiting any longer. So we got up & left. Once again the beach house has failed. If they would just schedule one more $2.83/hr server. Because one server cant handle the entire place. The guests wouldn't have to consistently wait 20 mins for service. I WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there today with wife and 2 boys.  We had about 15 min wait which was expected due to it being a Sunday.   We were waited on fairly quick for drinks but that's about as quick as it got.   Service was slow and when I asked the mean older waitress for our check she rolled her eyes at me and provided the meanest look I have ever seen.  My kids always get juice or chocolate milk and so today they did get those drinks and they came like in little tiny glasses, not much bigger than shot glass.   So we looked back in the menu and they were $2.50 and no refill... That was for probably 4 oz.  never saw such a thing.  That really started the meal out wrong.  We were told the French toast was their specialty and it was thick and crunchy... We all got a side of it for that reason... When it came out it tasted no different than mine.  We all got eggs and sausage and potatoes and they were all not much different than any other diner.   The sausage was the big kind and that was tasty, I got the hot flavor and was a bit too spicy for bkfast... But it was my decision.  We all ended up full which is the reason for 2 stars,  otherwise the outrageous drink prices,  mean waitress, length of wait for ordering and food, including lack of taking credit cards  would have given just a 1 star  We heard how great this place is and couldn't wait to eat there and my what a disappointment."}
{"text":"Took my daughter in on a Wednesday morning for a hooky from school breakfast treat and it was great. It was spirit week at school and that day was neon day and the waitress was dressed in neon.   The food here is awesome!  As I have said before please ditch the Tupperware ketchup and get real Heinz bottles."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting someone in this area and we came up on this small restaurant. It sits in front of Mineral Beach. It is also very close to Trax Farm. When you walk in it is one big room with tables and chairs. It is beach themed. It's very cute, very clean, and definitely family friendly.  I ordered the Ham Scramble. It had ham, cheddar cheese, and breakfast potatoes all scramble in with eggs. It was huge!  It was almost the size of my plate. It came to the table hot. It was very good. The Cheese was melty. You got ham, cheese, potatoes, and eggs in each bite. I ended up taking half home to eat at another time.   My hubby had the Melted BLT. It was a grilled cheese with bacon, lettuce, and tomato. It too was huge. I rated it and it was good. The lettuce was crisp and the bacon cooked nicely.  I would go back if I was in the area. It's a nice little family place with an extensive menu so everyone in the family would be able to find something to eat.  Please note that they are a CASH ONLY establishment. They have an ATM in case you forget."}
{"text":"Was looking for breakfast near my home in South Park and wanted to avoid the chain restaurants. This showed up in the Yelp app so I paged through the reviews. 3 stars and a few bad service advisories had us nervous but we like to form our own opinion... We sat down and were greeted almost immediately , waitress brought menus and took and filled drink orders almost instantly. We had breakfast and lunch menus and were informed of the lunch special. The place was crowded but not packed at 12:30pm. We ordered breakfasts and they were delivered piping hot and quickly. The eggs bacon and home fries were good, the corned beef hash sausage wheat and rye toast and French toast were all very well done. After reading the bad reviews we are dumbfounded as to who wouldn't enjoy this place. We will definitely return and I will update this but can't imagine this not being a new favorite after our last trip."}
{"text":"Went with the whole family for lunch, however on Sunday's they only offer breakfast. Not being a breakfast person this was a bummer, but hey I can deal. I ordered eggs, hash browns, and a pancake, and in general it was good. The hash browns weren't cooked long enough, but the pancake was awesome- and the eggs were standard over-easy eggs. It was very crowded but the wait for 6 people was only about 15 minutes so that was great. Positive: it was pretty inexpensive, around $10 a person. Negative: It was incredibly hot and stuffy inside which was uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I usually come here for breakfast. Their selection is HUGE and the food is always good. The beach potatoes are delicious! My boyfriend gets the big beach breakfast and I get a Frittata. Sometimes I'll go for the stuffed french toast as well because it is simply amazing. Very busy, since it is one of the only restaurants left in Finleyville, if not the only one...."}
{"text":"The Beach House Restaurant is on the property of Mineral Beach Pool.  A well built white building easy to find on the main road, with ample parking.  Tables and bar seating fill the cute beach decor dining room.  The breakfast menu is large as are the servings.  The breakfast quesadilla consisted of 4 folded and loaded flour shells with tender ham. Another in our party had the Italian Fritatta as big as the plate.  Service is good."}
{"text":"I used to like to get breakfast here but when a restaurant is to cheap to offer it's customers the convenience of paying with debit and credit cards, I can't go there unless they have amazing food.  Let's face it, The Beach House has food that is just ok.  Their home fries suck.  I also think their menu is a little over priced."}
