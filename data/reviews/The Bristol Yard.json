{"text":"I've eaten there twice for brunch and left the place stuffed and impressed both times. Delightfully gluttonous. Both times I went around 12-1 and was instantly seated (despite the place being pretty small). I've only tried St. George spicy eggs benedict and the Glasgow. Both were sort of similar, a delicious slice of bread covered in meat and sauce, with a side of fries. Those dishes could use a little more variety on the plate (without ordering the Full Monty), maybe reduce the size of the main and add a side of baked beans or even more homefries. I'll definitely be going back. Could be a 5 in the future after I try a meat pie or some scotch eggs. Keep in mind it's cash-only."}
{"text":"Got some pies to go, a steak and mushroom, a steak and stilton and a cornish pasty, and all three were very good - the pasty esp. brought back a lot of childhood memories, since I haven't had one for well over 20 years.   However I do think that the filling for the pasty should be diced a little finer, since it didn't really stay together that well after I biting into it.   I can't comment on the dine-in service, but I did wait a little longer than normal to get the take-out, but it was understandable, since it was busy, it's a small place and there was one server.  They need AC asap, since it was a little hot.  Overall highly recommended based on the pies I ate, and I'll be returning soon to eat there and try some of the other food - can't wait to try out the made in-house bangers."}
{"text":"Went for takeout pies on a Saturday. They only had frozen pasties. I bought two. They were wrapped in tinfoil so I could not see them. In the bag they weighed as much as a bag of rocks. I heated one, but it was inedible. The filling was unrecognizable, the pastry thick and hard. Threw them both in the garbage. I suspect they were in the freezer for months.  Maybe it is better to eat in, but I do not think I will go back to find out."}
{"text":"I went for brunch on a Sunday with my boyfriend. Waited in line for about 15-20 minutes. This is a really small place so I was surprised we got seated so soon. I forget the name of the item I had but it reminded of a breakfast sandwich. Potato biscuits, egg, sausage and a homemade gravy on top. The biscuit was really good but the gravy was a little lack luster. The prices are on point and definitely make me like the place more. It has good vibes but the meal was just ok. Service was friendly as well."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING but the service was SO SLOW.  We came in for Saturday brunch two weeks ago. It was busy, we waited 20 minutes or so. Sat down at a table that wasn't cleared of dirty glasses for another 20 minutes, waitress almost seemed to be ignoring us until we asked for menus. Didn't get coffees or waters til 30 minutes after sitting down. Water glasses weren't properly cleaned.   When handed menus waitress said they're out of 3 items. By the time she came back to take our order (another 20/30 minutes) they were out of \"almost everything.\" It was about 1:30pm. I ordered a breakfast without meat, so I added a side of bacon to my meal. Food came and no bacon for me. Asked waitress, she pretended it was still coming and ran back to the kitchen. Came back a few minutes later and admitted that there's no bacon on the way, because she \"forgot to write it down.\" I said I still want bacon and she told me that now there's not enough for my order because the next couple of people ordered some AFTER me and they've run out. I was blown away and corrected her - if there's any bacon, it's mine since I ordered first. Eventually brought out the bacon, but still charged me for it.   Again, the food here is really really great. But that waitress was brutal. We were there for a total of 3.5 hours! She was insanely slow. Don't come here if you have something else to do after. It's a busy place, but there are only SEVEN tables and serving isn't rocket science."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on a Saturday afternoon and it was one of the better brunches we've had in Toronto. We discovered this place thanks to a review in the Star.  I had The Full Monty, she had the Eggs Glastonbury ($30 with tax).   Everything was made from scratch - very tasty and very filling. The bacon (from a \"secret supplier,\" according to the menu) is amazing and the beans are top notch because they aren't dished out of a can. Both meals came with the choice of coffee or tea.  The meal reminded us both of an amazing breakfast we ate at a B&B on a trip to England.  Meat pies and Cornish pasties are available for takeaway.  I'm looking forward to going back for dinner very soon.  The hours are a bit wonky (as of my visit), so you should call ahead or check their Facebook page for their latest hours. We were told they will eventually be open Saturday nights for dinner once they get a liquor licence  Cash only."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here today after looking forward to trying this place for ages. Dragged friends from the east side over for brunch. Once seated we waited an hour and fifteen minutes for our food. I had the Eggs Glastonbury and my eggs were undercooked (whites still clear and gelatinous), the scones were like flavourless hockey pucks, beyond dense, (I adore scones and I left mine uneaten on the plate, unheard of!), the sauce was underseasoned and to top it off my food was stone cold. I should have sent it back but I hate doing stuff like that. My three companions all loved their bacon but said the rest was just \"eh\". So many good reviews, maybe we just hit a bad day but we won't be ging back to find out. Adding this: The owner of this establishment contacted me after i posted this and was very angry about this review. He is absolutely right!, I should have spoken up at the time. As I said people rave about this place and its won a lot of accolades from magazines etc. so I am sure our experience was unique and I suggest you try for yourself. I hope this amendment  is enough so I will not be contacted again. If you don't have a good experience though and post, be prepared for a response!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious (breaded sausage with mash for me, tikka masala pie for my wife), service was prompt given the recent opening (though will need to continue to improve going forward. Bustling with excited people from the hitherto barren neighborhood.  No license yet but get the Shandy."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now. The first time was for dinner with friends. We waited outside in line for about 15 minutes, but that's understandable as the restaurant is small and popular. Possibly for this reason, service isn't a bit slow (but it's friendly!). Food is delicious and the atmosphere is cozy and comfortable.  The second time I came here, it was for breakfast. The restaurant wasn't open (and I wasn't too early). My friends and I waited, and after a few minutes, someone came to tell us they wouldn't be opening until until nearly an hour later. I'm willing to wait in line for this place, but not for nearly an hour. My friends and I went elsewhere. I'm not sure why they can't open when they say they will, but I really hope they get this sorted soon, because the food really is fantastic."}
{"text":"Sunday roast at Bristol Yard:  We'd been to the Bristol Yard for brunch and dinner and wanted to try their traditional Sunday roast. It's a 3 course meal starting with soup, then roast beef, really good Yorkshire pudding, potatoes & veg and ending with the always yummy sticky toffee pudding. Dinner is at 6 and is a real deal - only $25 (before drinks).  It was a really good dinner and was a nice way to end the weekend.    The place has always impressed me because they make so much themselves from scratch. Such as the custard on the pudding, (I think) the bread that came with the soup, the brown sauce, meat pies and gravy. Everything is good and tastes that much better because they make it themselves.   Now magazine put it on a list of top gastro-pubs, and while I think they deserve to be on a list of great places to go, it's not a gastro pub. It's like a British cafe but better. Unpretentious and relaxed with much better food than a greasy spoon, everything fresh and home made.   The place is tiny, only a handful of tables. Reservations required for Sunday roast, but so far we haven't had a problem getting a table on other visits. Music is great. It's easy to find free parking on side streets and is close to Bloor and the subway."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Bristol Yard was on May 18. My first impression made me a bit nervous--we arrived close to 6:00 pm (the restaurant was scheduled to open at 5:00 pm) and the door was still locked, as the kitchens weren't done getting ready for dinner service--but as they're still working out the kinks, it wasn't a big deal. We took a nice walk around the block and the dining room was almost full by the time we got back. The service was quite good considering that nearly every table was full and there were a number of people waiting for takeout--the one server manages the room really well. We ordered the veggie and chicken tikka masala pies, and all four of the sides--mushy peas, mash, chips, and salad. Everything was absolutely delicious--especially the veggie tikka, which has got this great sweet/savory thing going on with the squash and curry--and clearly prepared with care. We also wolfed down a banoffee pie, which turned out to be a deconstructed verrine of graham crumbs, bananas, toffee, and whipped cream--so good.   Bristol Yard also scores in terms of the room and the atmosphere. The dining room is light and bright, and strikes a good balance between being clean and modern (it's mostly black and white, with some wood) and welcoming. The banquettes are very comfortable, and although the tables are close together, it's not awkward--I actually quite liked the fact that it encouraged strangers to chat across tables, and being able to smell all of the delicious things that everyone else had ordered only made me want to return sooner.    There are certainly still kinks to be worked out--the kitchen ran out of quite a few items as we were eating, and the service did get markedly slower and more frazzled as the room filled up and the evening progressed--but The Bristol Yard is exactly our kind of place. I can't wait to go back for brunch--and to try the veggie bangers."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favourite place in Toronto to have breakfast/brunch.  I've tried a few of their breakfasts and have been wowed every time.  A few times that I've been, I've tried to order something that they had run out of for the rest of the day, which is disappointing, but it's a bustling place with a small staff.  I only wish for more seating because some days you just can't wait around to eat Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"The Bristol Yard makes excellent pasties.  For my birthday I rented out TBY and had them make me pasties, and they were wonderful---25 flakey folded pockets of divine Britishness (I grew up in Bristol, and spent my summers in Cornwall, so I have some measure of the range of pasties).  Great space, great food and great service."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times now and this is hands down the best spot for brunch in the area. The food is always quality, delicious and the portions are quite generous. My favourite dishes include the eggs maradona, eggs st george, and eggs glastonbury. Can't wait to come back to try their now offered dinner. Keep up the great work, love this place!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good at Bristol Yard (try the fried bread, baked pies, and house made sausage). But the experience was impacted by the poor management/service. Several items were sold out by 11:30 when I sat down (fyi, they open at 11). These items included hot sauce, which I thought was odd.  One server for 7 or 8 tables is very difficult to manage, so they need to put more staff out there. Also, turning the tables all at the same time and ramming the kitchen usually doesn't make for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Since my boyfriend is actually from Bristol UK, I was amazed to walk by on Christie and see their famous-but-not-that-famous suspension bridge on a sign. We've now been once and were not disappointed.  It's the size and style of a proper caf, but the food is slightly more posh. (For example, the bf still laughs at the idea of beans on toast for about $7 - or running out of it - but they do it their own specific way that isn't really dumping out a can on a plate.) In the end, he had the fish & chips and I had the veggie tikka pie. The bf has very high standards when it comes to his Britfood, but he loved what he had. Good solid crunchy fish that \"tastes like something,\" he would say. My pie was big and packed with veg in this amazing sauce. Not having a liquor licence yet means they've been creative by bringing in beverages hard to find anywhere else in town, like Irn-Bru and Bass Shandy. Honestly, I liked having a different choice for once (went with the shandy).  I think the wait staff are still finding their feet, but they were very nice and helpful with any questions. We just had a good feeling all through our visit.  I realize British food has become a little bit of a trend lately, taking pub food and glamming it up with prices to match. But if you want a balance of authenticity and creativity without pretension and a need to take out a second mortgage, Bristol Yard is well worth trying. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Being a fan of lunch and having seen Bristol Yard hit up numerous \"Best New Brunch\" lists, I dived in to try.  Disclaimer: I would probably rate Bristol Yard closer to a 3 1/2 over a 4, but definitely higher than a 3.   I originally came here for their breakfast pie, which was unfortunately sold out. I dont' hold it against them, but was a disappointment upon arrival. They also have a new menu, so a re-visit may be in order.   Arrived and ordered off the \"Breakfast Specialties\" Menu. I ordered the Eggs Bristol and my foodie mate order the Full Monty.   Eggs Bristol: the creamy Bristol sauce is delicious and perfectly balanced with the back bacon and medium poached eggs. My only comment is that the crumpets had a \"floury\" taste, which is not what I personally prefer, but chalked it up to UK cooking traditions.   The Full Monty: quite a beast meal to say the least. guaranteed to fill, ever aspect matched with a perfect breakfast meal.  A really unique and delicious meal, particularly enjoyed reading through the menu; felt more like reading a story than reading a menu.   Sidenote: interested in trying their dinner menu, particularly the Fish &  Chips and their various Pie's"}
{"text":"Opens at 11 on Saturdays.  Not sure about the rest of the week.  We saw pictures online that made it look quite teensy inside, so figured if it's so popular, there may be a line-up.  Fortunately, at 11 on this sunny, damp Saturday in January, there was no such line.  We got there maybe ten minutes before it opened just to be safe.  ****BOO - sign on door showing cash only****  This is something I hate and often will not choose a restaurant based on.  (as it's ridiculous in this generation to expect people to carry cash, whether or not they are evading their taxes).  However, since six of us had planned Bristol Yard ahead of time, we opted to pay the bank fees to use a private ABM at a corner store on the next block).  Atmosphere:   As I said, we knew it was small.  It was even smaller than small.  The sole female employee who unlocked the door to let us in, although petite herself, almost had to squeeze into a booth to open the door fully for our entry.  Two large booths on one side, where she originally suggested me we may sit?  It could squeeze six similarly petite folks if we were drinking only.  But since we are all of various sizes, we opted to take three adjacent two-seater tables next to each other.  (there were four two-seater tables in total).  Anyhoo...the place is as basic as it can get, with the added touch of many small, black & white, framed portrait photos of either celebrities or some other related people.  Halfway through the meal, I had figured out a few, but had to ask the server.  Apparently, they are all \"British or something?\" LOL  I saw Sean Connery, Kate Moss, a few others which I thought were American, but mostly unrecognizable faces.  In our time here, the last two-seater table next to us was taken by a solo male, and one of the booths by two girls.  No line-up occurred.   Menu:  This is the most interesting part of the whole experience.  The menu which doesn't appear to be online anywhere at all except Facebook, is very limited.  It is interesting nonetheless, with many tasty-sounding options.  Two and a half of us being vegetarian (don't ask), had chosen in advance to order their veggie sausages & egg combo.  When we arrived, we were told they had none of the veggie sausages left.  :(  Yikes.  But I do not get upset over such things.  The server recommended the Eggs Glastonbury or Beans on Toast to us.  The Eggs Glastonbury sounds like some kind of breakfast sandwich where big mushroom slabs replace the bread, with tomato and some other stuff.  Normally, I like these ingredients IN things, but not as the dominant part.  It may have been good, but I didn't like the sound of it that much.   Second option, I like beans IN things (burritos, quesadillas, salads, etc) but never been a huge fan of beans from a can sort of thing, where they are in their own sauce, and then on toast?  Didn't want this either.  So I opted for the Eggs Bristol, which is their version of Eggs Benedict.  Now, as I vegetarian, I asked for the back bacon to be removed and put on my partner's plate.  The server said this wasn't possible.  This, I didn't understand, so explained to her that I am vegetarian and not wanting the meat, nor wanting the other two dishes she recommended.  She then said it was okay to have the Eggs Bristol without the back bacon, but she 'would have to ask' to see if they would put it on my partner's plate.  This sounds hilarious to me, as I'm paying for it anyway, and it's a simple case of lifting it off my plate and putting it on his.  But I let it be.  It WAS good.  Two poached eggs on their own homemade crumpets, with their own version of a good hollandaise, with side of fresh homefries and a green salad on the other side of my plate?  The grilled tomato was delicious, but for some reason, I am against eating greens before noon.  lol   The others in my party did order the Beans on Toast, which seemed to be good and very filling.  The real meat was apparently good as well.  I was disappointed that the only beverages offered at 11am were regular coffee, regular tea, a few beers and tap water.  I craved a milkshake.  Not that I needed the calories, but it may have staved off my dessert craving which came immediately after my pretty filling veg Eggs Benny/Bristol.  Oh, apparently, another of the menu options (the popular Brighton Toast) was also unavailable that morning.  Maybe if you want something specific here, you have to call ahead to make sure they have it.  But we were all there, we liked what we had.  Service:  I already discussed much of the service in the menu part above.  The waitress did make the point of mentioning she was ve"}
{"text":"I have been twice now, and while in the end I have found myself having a good time, there was something off both times.   The first time I went to a quiz night, and the invitation specified that snacks would be available. Given that the event started at 7pm, I was really looking forward to those snacks. There were no snacks, and the kitchen was closed. And we weren't allowed to bring in food. The quiz was fun, though!  I was just there on Sunday for the roast. It was delicious, and I would certainly go back as the quality and quantity of food that you get for your money is incredible. However, again, there was a glitch in the kitchen (it happens!) and our mains were delayed about an hour."}
{"text":"This is an old review I forgot to post... I don't feel grumpy anymore! ---------------------- I feel like a grump, but I seem to have had a rash of bad service lately!  I was very excited to try this brunch place. We arrived at 11am on the dot since they don't take reservations. We waited. We waited. There were other couples waiting with us. Another couple had said that they had come on a previous Saturday, waited a long time, knocked on the door, and were finally told that they weren't open that day. (Strange). So now we were worried about the possibility of waiting in vain. We knocked on the door. Nothing. Finally at 11:15 someone came and opened up. Really, it's sort of unacceptable to say you open at 11, and not open at 11. Because the restaurant has black blinds we couldn't even see in to see if anything was happening inside.  The food was good. The service was a little slow, but there was only one server doing everything (expect making the food). It IS a small place, so if you're interested, do arrive right when they open. Don't go if you have somewhere else to be shortly.  Although we were the second people in the door they were out of quite a few things. No french toast, no eggs bristol, no crumpts. I ended up getting the bacon and eggs. The bacon was fantastic. Thick cut and salty. The sausage was mealy. Stick with the bacon! I'd almost come back just for the bacon! Otherwise...  Not completely impressed."}
{"text":"A proper british breakfast with an updated twist. The rough puff pastry for the pies is some of the best in the city. I've only been for breakfast but have been trying to get into their Sunday roasts. This spot is slowly becoming our go-to morning after spot."}
{"text":"The Bristol Yard is an unassuming spot in between Christie Pits and Fiesta Farms on the West side of Christie street. It's small, so don't show up for weekend brunch with a big crowd if you want a seat. There are two booths that seat four, a bar that seats three and another 4-5 tables that seat two. So come with a small party and you'll be happy.  Three of us plus baby had a 20 minute wait for Saturday brunch at Noon, but it was nice out and the owner (?) was attentive and kind so we didn't mind at all.   Brunch was very good, although I suspect it would have been better if we were meat eaters. Poached eggs with portobella mushrooms and a cheesy herb sauce over scones were a little heavy but full of flavour and generously portioned. Potatoes were crisp and delicious.Coffee was strong and plentiful. Really, we were happy brunchers all the way along.  Best, though, was the service. Our server (who might have been the owner?) was relaxed and warm and made the whole experience one that we'd easily want to repeat.    Vegetarian score: 7/10. Our host told us they have a great veggie shepherd's pie that I'm eager to try for dinner sometime. As far as brunch goes, there are 2-3 options. Not bad. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"If HUGE portions and satisfying brit brekkies are your thing- check it out. I like the space and our server was friendly and helpful. Good brunch addition to my general hood (you can find the spot right near Fiesta Farms)."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of fellow Yelpers, we popped round for breakie this morning.  This cozy restaurant is decidedly British. From the Union Jack over the entrance, to the portraits of famous Brits which adorn the walls. If you're in the mood for British comfort food, thesis the place!  I had the Full Monty. The menu warns that it's big, but it was even more than I expected. Consuming the entire meal? Epic fail on my part I'm afraid, but it was delicious!  One more thing, they're doing Sunday roasts (tradition!) and planning to add Curry dinners (new tradition!) on Saturdays in future."}
{"text":"Brunch at Bristol Yard:   I had been meaning to try this place for a while and finally got round to going. I was hooked the minute I read about \"The Glasgow\". Hailing from Scotland, I was excited to read about their take on a Scottish cheeseburger; lorne sausage, served on potato scone with smoked applewood cheese and poached egg, then topped with sausage gravy. \"Not for the faint hearted but then hey neither is Glasgow on a Saturday Night!\" Never have truer words been spoken (that said Glasgow is amazing on a Saturday night). My expectations were set very high.  The food: I had the Glasgow and my fellow diner had the Glastonbury. I found my meal very interesting, the 'lorne' sausage is not what I expected...I think it was homemade, not what I expected but it was well seasoned. My only complaint was that I found the sausage gravy a little over powering (too seasoned for my liking) and the potato scones were quite tough. The Glastonbury looked amazing. Both meals are served with smoked home fries and a choice of tea or coffee.   The Cafe:  Clean, small, busy (we had a 15 minute wait for a table), service was fine. Loved the decor from the black and white photographs on the wall to the squeezy sauce bottles on the table (just like a proper British caf').   Well worth a visit and despite my comments re the Glasgow I would most certainly order it again, whilst taking a drink of tea having just eaten my brunch I was reminded of something Billy Connolly (Scottish Comedian) said about lorne sausage, tea and Glasgow:  \"Above all, go to Glasgow at least once in your life and have a roll and square sliced sausage and a cup of tea. When you feel the tea coursing over your spice-singed tongue, you'll know what I mean when I say: 'It's good to be alive!'.\""}
{"text":"I have had at least one dinner and a couple of breakfasts here.  Everything has always been top notch.  You really get the feeling that they care about the food and are making an extra effort to make it special--and authentic.  If I lived nearer, I'd eat here way more often.    It is even the kind of place I'd take out of town guests (depending on the guests of course).  Not much seating--I assume there are lineups although it is kind of off the beaten path.  I think they still only take cash (a benefit in my book).  Within the last year or so they have installed taps although I'm unsure if you'd go here just for a drink.  The hours seem wonky too--I don't think it is open during many weekdays/weeknights so check before you go.    Highly recommended if you are looking for a proper breaky or dinner.  I'm dying to go for the Sunday Roast."}
{"text":"Holy geez, this place is amazing.  Amazing pies, and the mashed potatoes and mushy peas should be sold by the gallon and inserted directly into my veins."}
{"text":"Actual rating: 3.5.  I went for brunch with two friends on a Sunday afternoon. Though the wait was over an hour, I can't fault them for being popular. It would be nice to have a call or text back setup but the food made up for it.  First things first, the coffee was solid. After freezing our buns off, this was really welcome.   I sometimes like to add a bit of hot sauce on my Eggs Benny, so the Eggs St. George is the British spin on a brunch favourite. They swap out the usual English muffins for scones, which are disks of buttery goodness. The eggs were perfectly soft poached. The potatoes were decent, and it came with a roasted tomato adding a nice fresh touch.   A cozy little spot with friendly service, I'd definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend here for dinner on Halloween. I was skeptical of how good the experience was going to be because I had to wait outside in the rain (the 8th straight  day of bloody rain!) for half an hour until they opened. But I am pleased to report that this place was OFF. DA. HOOK.  I am not normally a big fan of English food, but I obviously just haven't had it done right.  They had two Halloween beers on special for 5$ a pint, both of which were delicious. Especially the Hobgoblin - packed with flavour! For dinner I had the steak & stilton pie, which came with mashed potatoes and mashed(?) peas. All of which were fantastic. The portions were sizeable and despite being full half-way through, it was so tasty I ate every bite and left feeling like I might explode, but happy and proud of myself for eating it all.  They offered a complimentary Halloween-themed desert of pumpkin ice cream on top of a home-made chocolate cookie. Both of which were wonderful.  So in the event I haven't said it enough - this place is great and I highly recommend going there. Especially if it's a cold, wet night and you're in need of some comfort food.  Our server was extremely kind and perfectly attentive and gave us lots of good advice about the food and what we should order. Also - the place has a lot of large windows looking out onto the street which was great for people-watching on Halloween."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review because I REALLY wanted to like this place.  I loved the idea of this restaurant so much: an authentic yet accessible approach to British food.  I was ready for anything that this place had to offer.  Yet, I was disappointed by the experience I had here because the food quality was lousy.  My boyfriend and I did not want to drink alcohol so we opted for the British specialty pops: Dandelion & Burdock Soda and Ginger Beer.  Both was them had strong and unique flavours so we thought we were off to a good start.  However, when the food arrived it was quite the different story.  My boyfriend had the fish and chips; both components of its namesake were terrible.  The fish tasted like it had freeze burns and the chips were burnt.  On a hopeful note, the house made tartare sauce was very good.  The sausages I ordered was adequate, if not under-seasoned.  The issue of my plate was the composition:  it was too mushy,  The order came with two sausages, mushy peas, and mashed potatoes.  I felt like I was having baby food because the textures were too similar.  However, the biggest let down of the night were the mushy peas.  I love peas and I really thought there was no way to screw them up.  Boy was I wrong.  I don't know what kind was peas were used but they had a bitter taste which the chef tried to mask through putting in A LOT of sugar.  Quite frankly, it was disgusting.  The worst part is that the whole meal experience was the sad feeling I had because I had such optimistic visions of this restaurant.    I really hope that the owner deals with the food quality issues and revamp the dishes because I like his motives and ideas of what this restaurant should be. As of right now, if I had my choice, I would rather go to the Caledonian (which isn't technically a restaurant but they make better food). So, in conclusion, I just want to say :\" C'mon Bristol Yard, get your act together!\".  Or else, this establishment would just perpetuate the rumours that British food is terrible."}
{"text":"I hope 3 stars isn't insulting, I don't mean it that way.  I'm a health buff who normally tries to eat light veggie meals.    --- I liked this place, for the experience of it.  I've only ever been to England once, and I wanted to relive British culture by coming here.  We called before going, to confirm likely wait times (5 min. was quoted). Also, we confirmed that they had a high chair (one).  The food was good.  Took ? 15 min. to arrive, so if you're heading there with a toddler, bring snacks/parts of a main course to tide your little one over, colouring papers and markers, play do, toys,... (and hand/facial wipes!)  Health nuts, esp. veg ones, proceed with caution, this trendy hotspot aims more to satisfy those who are fine with either an egg- or pastry crust- based meal. Not much for vegans, but there are 2-3 vegetarian options.  I had the Eggs Glastonbury, $12.  Came with home fries, two poached eggs, half a fried plum tomato, two \"fried toasts\" (reminded me of deep fried scones/biscuits), two small Portobello marinated or saucy mushrooms with a savoury creamy sauce on the side.  It was tasty and filling.  I'm open to coming again at some point, and would recommend this place to someone who's in the Christie Pits neighbourhood, who enjoys savoury meals that are filling but not for the healthful minded.  Or someone on a strict diet.  Expect English-styled breakfast entrees (eggs, sausage, ), and main entree pies (that might come with a side order of baked beans, home fries,...)."}
{"text":"So it being Sunday and being marginally hungover, I was damned if I was cooking anything. I've been meaning to try this place for a while but could never seem to make it work. The only beef I have is they keep kinda strange hours. On weekends they are currently open at 11am. It would be nice if they opened an hour earlier. So I had the breakfast pie. It comes with smoked homefries and a grilled tomato for 12$. I really like pork pies and this pie has two kinds with an egg in the middle. It nice the way the pork fat seeps into the pastry. The sausage has a nice onion flavour to it. The coffee is nice and strong.  We got a cheese & onion pie, chicken tikka masala pie and a cornish pastie to go as well. On the advice of the server we brought them home and didn't refrigerate them as they heat up better at room temperature. 20 minutes in the oven at 350 and they were ready to go. Cheese and onion pie was nice and oniony. Cornish pastie had nice chunks of steak and potato. Tikka masala pie was awesome! Huge chunks of chicken with a to die for tikka masala sauce. I want to go back and try everything on the menu."}
