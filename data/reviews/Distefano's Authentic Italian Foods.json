{"text":"They have really good pizza and pepp rolls and lets not forget the CANOLI....oh boy they are WONDERFUL. The cookies on the other hand are pretty bad. They dont have alot of taste and I felt that they could have been so much better for the price they are asking."}
{"text":"Outstanding cooking, everything fresh, nice staff, very interesting selection of imported Italian groceries, excellent baked goods, too.

This is a grocery and deli, with prepared foods they make themselves.  No on-premise dining."}
{"text":"Love this place! I like to buy a variety of eats for my home. On my first visit, I got stuffed peppers, chicken cutlets, broccoli rabe, crab salad, chicken cutlets and mac n cheese. All divine! Love the olive bar too!"}
{"text":"Next to my friends, this is hands-down the single thing I miss most about Cleveland. It's a family-run Italian market, deli and bakery. And they sell lotto tickets. Ha.

In 30-something years, I have never ever ever ever ever tasted a better bread than what DiStefano's makes. I admit that I often dream about it and wonder how I could ship a few loaves to Austin. 

Their sandwiches are fantastic, probably due to the fact that they use their homemade rolls as the base. My favorite: capicuolo and cheese. I eat this thing dry, it's so good. When I lived in Cleveland, I came in often enough that they didn't even ask what I wanted anymore. 

You can get hot foods, too, and everything I've tried is so homey and comfort-foodish that it makes me want to snuggle in the warming case with it. Mac n cheese, pizza, roasted chicken, bowtie pasta stir fry -- it's just heaven. They make a mean tiramisu, too. It's so light and fluffy, I've been known to buy two slices for one sitting. 

Keep in mind that there's a $10 minimum on credit card purchases, so be sure to carry cash if you're just grabbing a sandwich to go.

I think I'm stopping there on my way to the airport today for one last hurrah before I leave town."}
{"text":"We got introduced to Distefano's at a baby shower. Someone brought an entire sheet of Foccacia Pizza and we could not stop eating this.  It was absolutely delicious.  The texture of the crust was perfectly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The sauce was amazing.  It was just the perfect blend of salty, sweet, sour, and umami.  Let's just say that this is some of the best pizza I've had in a very long time.  It was simple and very unassuming.  

We went back today and got a full size round and it did not disappoint.  I look forward to trying the other items on the menu.  

The only problem is that this place closes pretty early."}
{"text":"This is a really good family owned Italian deli and grocery store. There subs are really good and affordable, though sometime a little light on the fillings and making them too \"bready\". I really enjoy their meatball or chicken parm subs. saucy hot and delicious. They also carry a nice variety of Italian ingredients that you can't find at a Giant Eagle or other large grocery store."}
{"text":"God I love this place, it's like the holy grail of Italian imports. They have anything you could would in import food. Great wines, great olives, and anything else you could want. 

They really shine with there food though!! I love their pizza here! It's not so much pizza as it is focaccia bread though. There is no cheese on it that is. It's like a really thick chewy pizza bread, baked with a phenomenal sauce on top and grated parmesan. Just try it! Trust me!!! Also, the gnocchi with marina are the bomb. All and all there pre-prepared food is to die for. 

I just can't get enough of this place and it will always be number one for imports on the east side. This place may not look like much, but it packs quite a punch! Please love it! A place like this must be adored and coveted!"}
{"text":"This is definitely an East suburb gem. Not only a great little grocery store, but they have a large deli selection (including specialty Italian meats), a bakery with fresh breads, cookies, cannoli, and more, a great hot foods counter, and a made to order sub menu, optionally toasted. Included at no additional charge - the expertise on the products from the Italian workers. They don't just sell the products, they know the products. Tell them you want to make the best pasta sauce ever and they'll help you out.

The hot foods counter is fantastic - I've tried a number of things and it beats the pants off of any standard grocery's hot food counter (even Heinen's). The roast beef, the pizza burger, and the pork chops are my personal highlights. The pizza burger is two slices of pizza, upside down with a massive freshly ground sausage patty in the middle. Delicious.

There's no place to eat at Distefano's so plan on eating in your car, or if the weather is nice there's a few parks nearby."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  It has a warm, family type of vibe. They have specialty items ( cookies, Italian sodas, sauces, chocolates, etc), and it's a nice gathering place.  I also tried the Chicken Parm, and it was so good!  Super yummy comfort food. This place will inspire you to cook a big pasta dinner for your friends :)  I think prices are reasonable.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Homemade like the way grandma had it!!! Brings back tons of memories of my childhood days. Great place for Italian food, bread and goodies!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars. It's not quite perfect, but it is very good. If you're looking for someplace with a large selection of food for your week's groceries, this isn't it. But if you're looking for anything off of their food menu then it's an easy 5 stars. The subs are great and made with good quality Italian foods, the meatballs and sausage are fantastic and my go-to when wanting homey Italian food, and the Sicilian style pizza will drop you to your knees if you've never had it. They have a great selection of cheeses too and I go here over anywhere when I want parmigiano. I only wish they had better hours, but it's a local, family-owned place so I can't fault them for short hours out of anything but selfishness because I eat dinner so late and don't always prepare ahead of time. All-in-all this place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place, great FRESH foods! Handmade too! This place truly is a hidden treasure!"}
{"text":"O Smelly Deli, How Do I Love Thee?

Is it the proximity to work?  The amazing selection of imported foods you can't find at grocery stores?  The friendly and helpful staff?  The amazing prepared foods you can take back to work to make everyone jealous?  The 87 varieties of cured meats ready to be sliced and wrapped for your later enjoyment?

A little of all of it...  my only complaint is that occasionally, some of the fried stuff gets a little soggy if you go in way after regular lunch hours.  

But, if you get in there by 1, maybe 1:15, everything is first rate delicious.  Nothing healthy about any of it, but you're not here to lose weight, are you?  No, you're here to eat well.  And eat well, you will.

And, if you are more of a \"keep the peace\" type than you are a \"create food envy\" type, you can pick up a pepperoni bread or two, and some great little cookies to bring back to the office."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for that speciality shop for special occasions.  For great Italian choices,  this is the place! 

Needed authentic Italian loaves of bread for Christmas Day dinner and heard about this gem. Checked it out and it was exactly what my wife was looking for.  First,  bakery was outstanding!  Fresh breads,  rolls,  cookies,  and anything you are looking for. Deli meats they cover anything you are in search of.  Olives,  olives,  and more olives! Meal dishes ready to  heat at home,  they got you covered! 

Deserts as well!  A great stop and for us Eastsiders a good spot to fill up your Italian desires!"}
