{"text":"What a nice surprise, this place is just like one of this thing that happens rarely in your life. I was looking around the area with no idea where to go for dinner and by reading sushi on the windows with my wife we said: yes why not it couldn't be bad if the place looks clean. By entering the place I immediately notice how clean it was and I said it's a good sign. By selecting the host dinner for just a bit more then 20 bucks I was delighted by every single thing that was brought to me. My wife took a selection of Sushi, Maki and more and I was amazed by the freshness, decoration and the taste of the food.  Las I'm an heavy traveller and used to Asian style restaurants in many countries, this one is a memorable one."}
{"text":"There aren't enough nice words that I can use to describe this place. The sushi is delicious. You can taste the quality of the food in every bite. The rolls are creative without losing any flavour (order the dragon roll!) the sashimi is generous. In fact the entire menu is priced so reasonably!  10/10 would go back and bring all my friends too"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious rolls, but the interior could have some improvement with better design and decor. I got take out and I'm quite satisfied with the food."}
