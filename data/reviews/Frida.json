{"text":"I have lived in this area on and off for years and for some reason never thought to venture into this charming cerulean nook called Frida, after the famous Mexican artista. I had all but given up on Mexican food in Toronto (save for a Chipotle burrito now and again - was that blasphemy?) but went into this place with an open mind and an empty stomach.  I had the guacamole and the tacos de cabrito en salsa verde, or \"goat tacos\" for the gringos. The flavor, oh the flavor! Coming from someone who has lived in California and New York, I assure you that the Oaxaca cheese and beautiful stewed meat are of the highest caliber. And for $11, the helping on the taco plate was more than enough. The guac was very nice, if slightly smaller in portion.   I must warn to the forest hill crowd who like their food nice and bland, this place is the real deal - entonces es mucho caliente! Even the normally comparatively virgin guacamole was doused in small diced chilis and hot oils. The salsa verde was perfect (the mildest sauce you'll find there) and the salsa roja was very flavourful with a great chili after-punch.   We were too full for desert, but spied across the room a plate of homemade deep fried churros. And we shall be back to try them."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends and the food was terrible.  The carne asada was burnt and the seasoning on it was quite unpleasant making it almost inedible.  The beans and rice were bland.  My friend ordered a  burrito that was supposed to come with avocado, when she brought this up with the waitress she retorted with \"well we didn't charge you for it,so there's nothing I can do\".  She couldn't understand that it was SUPPOSED to have it as per their description, and all my friend wanted was a discount for the chicken she added to it.    Only upside is that the margaritas were decent and did their job.  Service sucks, food ranged from inedible to meh, and they were pricey to boot...won't be going back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone way downhill.  We've been coming here for almost 4 years and it seems that they have changed the menu in the past few months.  We went last night (in Feb and the menu reads \"December menu\") and they have moved over to tapas style so smaller portions.  However, the prices have not changed.  It's just overpriced given the neighbourhood.  $11 for a small portion of guacamole and not enough chips!?  Very disappointing.  Overall the food was tasty but the service was PITIFUL.  By the time it came around for dessert (which we would have normally had), we just wanted to get out of there so we got ice cream instead.  We had reservations for 8pm and we were 2 couples.  We sat down and the server came to take our order immediately.  We didn't even have a chance to look at the menu.  She came back twice more in the next 10 minutes and we were just getting settled.  After all, it was Saturday night and were were planning to have a leisurely meal so we weren't in a rush.  They used to give you chips and salsa complimentary when you came in but now they charge you for it.  We were almost done the guacamole and the server came to take it away.  We told her that it wasn't done and to please leave it.  For $11 for a small portion, ya, we're going to finish it, thanks.  Before we were done our main course (approx 9:15), she brought over dessert menus.  It was just rude.  We would have said something but our server was the manager!    Note - their kitchen closes at 9pm on a Saturday night.  So in some ways, they try to be like a downtown restaurant located midtown but really, they should just accept their location and price accordingly.  It's really just too bad because the food is good but the value and service are a -10."}
{"text":"This place is getting a lot of crappy reviews, but I've never had a bad experience here. Yes, I've occasionally had some interesting waitstaff experiences (nothing drastic), but the food is good, the drinks are good, and the decor is really cool. Per some of the other reviews, they might need to get more organized there (if you're not getting waited on, ask someone to help you!), but in my expericence, it's not bad. Not the absolute best Mexican food I've ever had, but I've had some really good meals here."}
{"text":"Really tasty food, we ordered take-out a couple of days ago. The quesadilla fajitas was really tasty, if a little messy eating with your hands like I did, and the veggie tacos were very good too. We ended up without salsa for our tortilla chips, but they were nice and crisp, and the churros were a great end to the meal. Will have to take some friends along there in a couple of weeks, I think. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food, service, drinks, vibe. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I took my parents here and their burrito had a piece of metal shavings in it. They comped their meal but made me pay for the burger. The next time I went, our waitress gave us poor service and forgot half our food. It used to be good, but now is not professional."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Talk about authentic Mexican. Despite the location, Frida is absolutely fantastic. The drinks (classic mojito, classic sangria, raspberry sangria) are delicious, and the service is divine.  And then there's the guacamole. I don't know what they sprinkle in there, but it's hands-down the best I've ever had in my life. Smooth and tasty, it's worth the trip alone.  The presentation of the tuna steak and the shrimp were so gorgeous, you almost don't want to touch it.   Incredible food, wonderful atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"I didn't have a great experience here at all, and I'm not a person who has extremely high expectations. I was actually really excited to go to this restaurant, it looks beautiful inside with its tiled walls, and the Frida portraits.  However, my family and I had a really bad experience  because we got god awful service, and their winterlicious prefix was nothing great at all.  We went in right before the dinner rush, it wasn't that busy, yet the staff weren't very accommodating, or even friendly. Our hostess was extremely cold. Our waiter was really aweful. For instance; we got desserts but he forgot to bring any dessert spoons, we notified him, but he forgot, after 30 min, we ended up just taking the utensils from the empty table next to us, hardly put the effort to explain about drinks/meals, and made serious errors on our bill.   This  Frida restaurant made me come to the realization that upper class Mexican food is b.s., I don't really care for getting served miniature tacos and overpriced vegetarian empanadas. That's not what good Mexican food is about.   In conclusion: I don't recommend this place, and I would never go again."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had the guacamole and chips and all the tacos and all were excellent. A very nice balance of flavours in each. The sangria was also very good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but i've worked at a handfull of restaurants including canoe and the keg. To be honest the food was decent, nothing spectacular like some of the reviews written here.   I called in to tell them I would be late for the reservations I made for 6:30 but arrived late because spadina was closed and shortly after a gentlemen seated us, the only waitress made nasty comments saying that we came late and we'd have to leave within an hour despite having called in and speaking to her over the phone. If she didn't think they could take us anymore, she could've let me know but I doubt she would do that.. the restaurant was empty.   Slightly annoyed by her comments, we continued on until we found a lady bug crawling around in our guacamole. Which was terrible not only because there was a bug in our food, but because my girlfriend had a notion that a lot of mexican places served dirty food and prior to entering the place I tried to reassure her that it wouldn't be. I was wrong.   We wanted to leave the restaurant pretty much as soon as she started pestering us but the wait for the food forced us to be there longer than we needed to. We were literally the 3rd table there and it still took 30 min for guacamole to come out, served with a ladybug. yumm..  The rest of the food was mediocre but the waitress continued to be unpleasant verbally as well as physically. She had a broken nose so it was taped up and covered in blood, quite unpleasant. She really couldn't take a few days off until she recovered? I don't even care how she looked, but she just seemed like she couldn't cleaned up a little so there's no blood on her face, but it was her attitude throughout the night that really made it unpleasant. She was probably a manager or part owner cause of her demeanor so there was no point in trying to speaking to management.   I will not be going back there, Dirty, unpleasant, rude and slow. In all honesty I'd rather go to taco bell."}
{"text":"I am in love with the bean soup and would walk on hot coals for their churros. I have to get that off my chest first. Both are out-of-this-world-delicious. I had the shrimp and my partner had the lamb main - both were incredibly tasty and beautifully presented. The staff were friendly, helping me navigate through the menu, and the restaurant itself was really cool and artsy. I've been raving about this place to all my friends and have been back for seconds, thirds and fourths and there was excellent food, ambience and service each time. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had the seafood burrito for dinner on Friday night.  I was violently ill for the next 12 plus hours and remain sick.  Presently, I am on day 3 of recovering from food poisoning.  I have a pretty strong stomach.  The last time I had food poisoning for over 10 years ago and this includes a lot of eating foods of other countries including Egypt and Afghanistan.   PLEASE eat somewhere else.  I wouldn't wish this upon anyone!"}
{"text":"My first question to Frida's owner regarding the women's bathroom is this: You seriously think it's okay to allow customers to go in there? Knowing he'll say, yeah, sure, why not, my second question to Frida's owner is this: Are you f-ing insane? Do you see things most people don't, like cleanliness when there's only stained toilet seats and pseudo stalls? Do you see quality when others see terror? Do you see dead people with spray cleaner and mops? You must, because seriously, your bathrooms are like my first apartment: super ugly and super scary. The place is so dark, Sherlock Holmes couldn't find the toilet paper with a treasure map and Blackbeard holding a torch to light the way.  I also want to know why their rice and beans tastes like water. The rice isn't an M&M, yet it melts in your mouth. Not a good quality for a grain. The beans may or may not be legumes.  Why You Should Be Embarrassed to Own this Place: I make better rice and beans than you, and I'm f-ing Native American. Get a handle on your menu and your louvre, and I'll consider going back."}
{"text":"LOCATION: Street parking and paid parking, among semi-trendy ethnic restaurants and stores.  FOOD: Guacamole was great but needed more tortilla chips. We had:  -Sopa De Tortilla Azteca which is a soup with a strong tomato base (resembled hot n sour soup).  -Chiles Poblanos Rellanos: huge egg batter-coated pepper stuffed with the smoothest cheese ever. Twas great.  -Mole poblano which was a juicy chicken breast covered in decadant dark cocoa sauce  Filling portions.   COST: I spent $95.00 for two people  ATMOSPHERE: Your typical small trendy restaurant. Oddly decorated with some pics of China (confusing!). The menus need to be updated. They're large pamphlets.    MUSIC: Real spanish music. Not urban lounge music or another genre.  SERVICE: Nice waitresses. By 8pm on a Saturday the place was packed. So reservations are required or get there by 6/7pm.   This aint no burrito place. This is authentic mexican. I'd recommend it. I notice they did delivery too."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious was not the best. Only thing that was great was the wine, appi, and dessert. The main course did not do it for me at all. Had the cod the portion was so tiny and taste was not all there. The service was great there could not complain about that. I'm giving it only one star because of the main course."}
{"text":"Exquisitely crafted, sublimely presented, absolutely authentic, Frida is the best Mexican food I've ever had, it is a hidden gem in the city.  The service is prompt, warm and adept; everyone there is just fantastic.  The guacamole can't be missed, get one as an appetizer. The secret is in the addition of tomatillos for texture and their signature hot oil which is drizzled on top, but good luck duplicating this sublime dish.  I've had the Pollo Pibil and Camarones al Guajillo and tasted a number of the other entrees and everything is incredible.  The presentation is gorgeous, the attention to detail impeccable, my hat is off to Chef Pepe, he is truly a master.  The space is bold and bright, modeled after Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul's blue and red color scheme. It's modern and inviting, yet intimate despite usually playing host to a full house.  Don't expect to leave here without spending $50 a person with drinks, but it's worth every penny, this is a joyous food experience."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are okay, but this place is very, very unclean.  If you go, don't look at the floors, the walls, the bathrooms, the air vents... Perhaps the evening events bring in enough money that they don't have to worry about the times of day when people can actually see the filth."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very nice on the inside but the Mexican food is definitely not the best I've had.  I don't think I would call this place bad, but there is nothing special or desirable about it.  I would avoid weekends because it gets busy and the food is not as good."}
{"text":"Good food - but seems a little pricey for what you get. Enjoyed the tostadas and the churros."}
{"text":"I went to Frida on Sunday night with 2 girlfriends for winterlicious.  My girlfriend called prior to make reservations and the only time they said they were available was 5:15 pm.  The restaurant was easily accessible with a nice ambiance.  The winterlicious menu had a good selection and the food was very tasty.  However, I am very disappointed with the service.  This is what happened:  I have not seen my friends since before the holidays and while we were catching up, the waitress came by three times and somewhat rudely asked us if we were ready to order.  We felt pressured and then placed our orders.  We ordered all 3 courses off the menu right away and requested rasberry sangrias. Our appetizers came within 2 minutes of our order.  This was good.  However, our entrees appeared at the table within about 3 minutes after that!  We had not even halfway finished our appetizers and had to make place for all these plates on our little table.  Our entrees were getting cold as we rushed to finish our appetizers.  To add to this, we had not yet received our sangrias.  I tried to look for a waiter to get them but they were no where to be found - in a restaurant that was three quarters empty.  We finally saw a waiter and got our sangrias as we were almost done our entrees.  My friend then got a dessert that she did not order and the waitress, rudely, asked her if she was sure that's not what she ordered.  She assured the waitress that it was not and that she was not going to eat the dessert that was brought to her.  The waitress looked like she was doing my friend a huge favour by replacing her dessert.  Our entire meal took under an hour and 15 minutes.  The waitress then put the bill on our table and as we were talking once again interrupted us about three times to ask if we wanted a debit or credit machine.  We finally got the hint that we were being ushered out the door so paid for our meals and left.  I understand that it is winterlicious and restaurants are far busier around this time.  However, witnerlicious is the time people try out new restaurants and then go back another time if it's worth it.  In my opinion, I thought that this experience was definitely not worth it.  If you go, go for the food and not the service..."}
{"text":"Since arriving in Canada from the States, I have been on the hunt for some good Mexican food.  So far, the best I have found is at Milagro's, but I found out about Frida's and thought I would give it a try.  Frida's, as it turns out, is an overpriced upscale Mexican restaurant that has mediocre Mexican food.  I ordered the pollo pibil tacos, and the chicken was dry and tasteless.  I was looking forward to some good chile rellenos, but the ones I got tasted like tomato sauce thrown on some peppers.  My friend ordered halibut, and the fish was overcooked and tasteless.  We also had the mushroom quesadillas, which were probably the best dish we tried on the menu.  In the end, I was so disappointed that we felt it was not worth it to stay for dessert.  I for one am going back for another visit to Milagro's."}
{"text":"Good: Duck Carnitas  Bad: Their version of the Margarita.   That is all."}
{"text":"2.5/5! We went here for summerlicious. We had a Sunday lunch reservation, and we were a few minutes late, and as a result we were rushed through our entire meal. The waiter asked a few times if he could remove our dish prior to us being finished. Unfortunately, the service ruined the experience. In terms of food recommendations, I highly recommend the Sopa de Tortilla Azteca (Tortilla Soup), Baja Style Shrimp Tacos and Pastel de Queso y Kahlua. The Tacos de Carne are also great if you prefer beef to shrimp. If service was better I would give this place 3.5!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Frida, after reading all the rave reviews. I was somewhat disappointed after my visit. First off I have to start off by saying we did have a large party of 12 people and the restaurant was at capacity that night, we might have overwhelmed the kitchen. Let's start off with the good aspects. They have a good wine list, separated on the menu by different headings - full bodied reds, dry reds and whites, etc.. more restaurants should do this. The service was top notch, our server did everything he can to make our meal enjoyable. When they ran out of glasses to serve water in, he went and got wine glasses for us to sip water from. The duck mini-taco appetizer I ordered was amazing, large flavourful chunks of duck meat with awesome guacamole. We also ordered the ceviche de mariscos, it's a dish of seafood marinated in lime juice served with homemade potato chips. While i enjoyed it, a friend of mine happened to eat a raw one, and was having stomach cramps later that night. It went downhill after the appetizers were served. It took at least 45 minutes before we got our main dishes, we were all getting pretty restless by this point. Our server did his best to check in with the kitchen and gave us updates.  When the food finally came out, we were all beyond starving, the appetizers we had earlier were fully digested. The food was prepared really well, fresh ingredients and full of flavours. One thing that we all gripped about (at least the guys anyways) was the small portions. It barely made a dent in my stomach, most of us were still hungry afterwards, maybe the food was so good that we just wanted to eat more? After our long meal we decided we had enough and decided to skip dessert and have dessert somewhere else.   After our meal the chef did come out to apologize to us about the long wait, but that did nothing to quell our hunger. This place has great food, just that the long wait and small portions turned me off. Maybe the next time I visit it should be with a smaller group, and I should not have an intense workout before hand. I doubt there will be a second visit though."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for Winterlicious and it was a very disappointing experience. The ceviche app was served with some dried up chips not even some nachos which would have been more appropriate and easier to actually scoop. My boyfriends chicken was undercooked and so was my squid ink octopus. We kept getting interrupted and they were so eager to do a table turnover that they kept trying to clear our plates. Not once did our server come to check up on us or ask how everything was. The wait for our dessert was also very long not sure if she forgot to pick it up but even the desserts were not good, I especially went to try the churros but they were too dry for my liking and my boyfriends dessert was tiny and tasteless. Sorry not even worth a $35 winterlicious menu. Our server didn't seem very pleased to be working and was very unfriendly. We also noticed that we got charged $1 more on all our beers then what was written in the menu, we didn't say anything we just replaced it with her tip. Me and my boyfriend both work in the food industry and we were absolutely shocked at how bad the service was and how the food did not match at all Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"I actually really liked Frida, I'm glad I went there in disregard to the lukewarm to awful reviews on here. The service was really nice and helpful, not over attentive but definitely at hand when needed. I ordered the Spinach Enchiladas, which were a bit bland for me - the addition of my side order of diabla sauce was a good choice. The desserts are seriously delicious, we had the chocolate cake and the flan split between 3 people and had a bit of trouble finishing them after our ample entrees. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, complete with colored lights overhead and lots of Frida Kahlo paintings. From my drinking age companions, the signature margarita was good and they knew how to make a truly dry gin martini well. I didn't find the place uncleanly and the food was delicious with a lot of items you don't always see along with the good classic staples you would expect to find."}
{"text":"I went for Mexican for the first time. I really liked the atmosphere and service. The food was good too. But I kind of want to try other places. Also I found it a little pricey. They charge $15 for 3 small tacos. I could easily eaten 3 more."}
{"text":"Simply poor service. Went there for a drink, the place was pretty busy, so I sat at the bar. Ordered a beer and a buddy ordered some chips. We waited probably 10 minutes for the beers, chips never showed. I tried to pay one of the bartenders for the beer but he said he couldn't run the register. We had to wait another 10 minutes or so for the other bartender to pay for the drinks and left. Bad form, guys."}
{"text":"These elaborate and intoxicating reviews say it all, and are fully responsible for my uncharacteristic jaunt to Bathurst & Eglinton. Instead of revealing each intimate detail (read Kat F's review for that, then tell me you don't want to try this place?!), I'll touch on the highlights:  1. Guacamole. YES. I could live on this. Spectacular. 2. Drinks. OH!!. Fabulous. I recommend the raspberry sangria with my whole being. 3. Desserts. GODDAMN. Kahlua cheesecake was light and velvety, possibly the best cheesecake I've had. The churros were stunning - dancing with cinnamon and filled with dirty, sexy caramel secrets. Oh my god, now I sound like a food reviewer jerk.  For a main I ordered the halibut, which was gorgeously presented and lovely. But I really wanna go back and try something with, y'know, tortillas. Or just more guac.   PS: Amazing service!! This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Came here for a late Sunday lunch and paid under $20 for two people.  Their lunch menu is great - almost every dish was $6.99!  Good chips.  Salsa was ok.  The Mole Poblano Enchiladas were very good (not a lot of places know how to make a good mole sauce which is a rich, dark chocolate colored sauce and is made with onion, garlic, a variety of chiles and a little bit of chocolate - savory and delicious! ).  I wasn't too crazy about their black beans (and I normally love black beans)  it tasted a little off.  Although I did like their refried (pinto) beans.  Overall, it was great place to grab an inexpensive and satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food - tortilla soup is amazeballs, and the tostadas are incredible.  Even the tamarind cocktail is great.  The atmosphere leaves a little to be desired, but the biggest complaint would have to be the location.  Allen Rd and Eg.?  wtf?  But seriously, great place.  Worth the trek."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Had the chicken mole and loved it! Sauce was crazy good and portion size was more than sufficient.   Like the others who dined before me....the churros are the perfect desert to share with the table (7 mini pieces). Hot and fresh with an incredibly authentic cajeta sauce inside (Mexican caramel....very difficult to make well).   I'm going back very soon."}
{"text":"You can't build a restaurant off good salsa.  Frida is terribly inconsistent.  While this review will mostly focus on the bad, some aspects of Frida really shine.  They have outstanding salsas, guacamole, corn chips, and the \"little bites\", though overpriced, were delicious.  Thanks to one of our waiter's many screw-ups, I tried the onion, mushroom, chicken, and lamb.  Anyway, I arrived at Frida last Saturday and was greeted by the owner/chef's sister-in-law (maybe co-owner as well?) with \"You came to FRIDA, with more than two people, and no reservation???\"  I found her comment, espeically the way she emphasized the word \"Frida\", to be more hilarious than pretentious, and over the course of the night I found her to be very sincere.  I also appreciate that they pulled an extra table up from the basement, as the estimated size of our party grew from 8 to 11.  As we waited for our table to be set up, we noticed the walls looked like the inside of the changerooms at a swimming pool - small blue tiles.  Maybe that's influenced by Frida Kahlo? Not familiar with her work, so I couldn't say.  It didn't exactly scream \"fine dining\".  We ordered relatively quickly, as we were quite hungry.  Drinks took about 45 minutes.  They brought mostly the right drinks, and gave them to sort of the right people.  The correct half of the table, anyway.  At approximately the same time (a 5-10 minute window).  So that was something.    Complimentary chips and salsa, which were devoured in seconds, took about an hour to come out.  After another half hour or so, the chef's sister-in-law reminded our waiter that we'd been there for a long time with no food, and it would be a good idea to refill the chips.  So he brought more chips and left the virtually empty salsa containers empty.  Our appetizers arrived soon after.  By appetizers, I mean three orders of guacamole (ordered by three couples).  I understand that guacamole takes a long time to cook, so sure, two hours seems reasonable.  It also makes sense that they brought out the third order about ten minutes after the first two, so that one of the couples had to sit salivating as they watched the other two couples devour theirs.  Finally, the mains trickled out of the kitchen, and were promptly served to the wrong people.  I ordered three \"little bites\" and my friend sitting beside me ordered one.  Two came out of the kitchen individually, and the other two on one plate.  Two different servers failed to identify which was which.  The despressing part is that they couldn't tell the difference between mushroom and lamb.  Because the mushroom was in an empanada, I ended up eating my friend's order and only realizing it when it was in my mouth.  I explained the mistake, and they brought out another mushroom empanada, and added another empanada to a completely different person's bill.  The steak tacos, which about four people ordered, and six people tasted, were terrible.  Tasteless, lukewarm to cool, overcooked, poorly flavoured, poor quality meat.  I've read the other reviews, which fall into two camps: \"this is the best Mexican food ever\" and \"I'm from California/Texas/Mexico.  What's this inauthentic, overpriced shit?\"  I point this out because no one in my party is from Mexico or California, etc.  We just don't like shitty food.  (The other meals that we ordered - cheese and bean quesadilla, goat or lamb tacos, and the chicken - were generally described as \"disappointing\", \"alright\" and \"overpriced\").  The sister-in-law came to our table and asked how everything was.  We mentioned that a few people didn't like the half-eaten steak tacos that were left on the plates.  The sister-in-law offered to bring out anything else, but even though my girlfriend asked her for something vegetarian, the chef sent her more steak tacos, but this time with bacon.  It was a dish that he didn't put on the menu.  The funny thing about the replacement tacos was that the extra flavour made up for the not-that-good meat.  The tacos were served hot, and, frankly, were very tasty.  Why isn't it on the menu?    When the entrees were finished, the sister-in-law came out and explained to us that the chef was very upset that we didn't like the tacos.  He is very passionate.  He wants the people of Toronto to taste how Mexican food is back home in Mexico, and wants everyone who comes to his restaurant to feel like a guest at his home.  I thought \"what's with the guilt trip?\", but I'm sure a few of the people at our table just felt guilty.  Another (Mexican) reviewer here noted that when he went to Frida, the chef admitted that he doesn't make authentic Mexican food so Canadians will like it.  I think that's the wrong move, but based on all the five star reviews here, the chef is probably right in most cases.  I won't go back to Frida.  Even the great parts of it don't justify the cost.  It's a shame, because this restaurant has the potential to be excellent."}
{"text":"HIgh end prices for Mexican food but sadly with low end service. It's a shame that a kitchen that can prepare such delicious and intelligently prepared food is ruined by lackadaisical and understaffed front of the restaurant staff. The food is inconsistent though.  Some nights it soars like with lamb tacos barbaco, but other nights, the mole poblano chicken is accompanied by boring sides such as 1/2 (!) of an undercooked brussel sprout, 1/4 cup of tasteless white \"garlic rice\" and some steamed yucca.  Service is atrocious, with long waits for everything. We have been there twice in 2011 and bad service is consistent. We were not alone that night. The table of 4 near us was complaining also and we overhead the server offering free dessert as compensation.   Obviously other diners on this and other sites complain about the inconsistent service here.  Personally, I would go to any location of Milagro before going back to Frida again, not because the food is better but because unlike Frida, they actually treat you like they're happy to see you with much more attentive service. 2 stars for overall experience :-("}
{"text":"Had a  business dinner at Frida with my clients. I cannot rationalize the insanely high menu prices by any of the Frida's attributes. More specifically:  - Appetizers were tiny and mediocre. We ordered queso and they brought us four small tortillas for six people. I don't know what they were thinking. Also, we got about six chips for an order of guac to share. WAYYYY too small portions for a Mexican place.  - Drinks (margaritas) were badly mixed - too tart!  - They messed up our order and brought us an extra plate of tacos and tried to charge us for it. When we talked to the manager, she removed the extra tacos from our bill but was incredibly snooty about it, as if she had done us a huge favor! The misorder was their fault!  - Main dishes we OK, but didn't come with sides.  - Sipping tequillas were great, but after a sub-par meal, this wasn't enough to turn us around.   I will never go back to Frida."}
{"text":"I should have known better than to try Mexican food in madison, I live in CO and the bar is pretty high. I had steak fajitas. The steak was sliced into 6\" strips and the flour tortillas were only 5\", so there was always meat hanging out of the fajita and inevitably you were not able to bite through the meat so ended up with pulling a strip of steak out for each bite. The tortillas...dry and nasty Learn my lesson.  You are in Wisconsin, not the Southwest, avoid the Mexican food and go eat something the locals know something about."}
{"text":"I have been to Frida's twice. Initially my visit was a la courtesy of a Groupon, and my second visit was not.   FOOD & DRINKS On both my visits I have ordered the same food items. Guacamole, house salad and lamb tacos. Guacamole - quiet possibly the best I've ever had...period. And there is lots of it, enough to share with one or two people. House Salad (Ensalada de la Casa) - imho the fresco cheese maketh this salad. Delish! Lamb Tacos (Tacos de Barbacoa) - literally melts in your mouth. I have never had lamb tacos this good. Don't forget to get them with the oaxaca cheese!  Stay away from the chicken tacos. Steak tacos are bearable.  In my view - skip the expensive entrees and choose from the appetizers and tacos/quesadillas. Trust me you will be full.  We ordered the flavoured margaritas. I thoroughly enjoyed my two pomegranate margaritas ($10 a pop!)  SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE Reservations are a must. Get in before 7pm. After 7pm it gets loud and very busy. Its a very small restaurant so forget about any intimate conversations! Of course after 2 margaritas - who cares about privacy. The server/hostess/bartender all rolled into one is amazing and very friendly. We love her but she needs a helper(s)!   CHECKOUT $100 for 2 people includes $40 on margaritas, and tip.  Easy and no problems with splitting the bill at the end for purposes of paying by debit card.  VERDICT ....EXCELLENT....4.5/5....will be coming back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"The sangria is pretty good, and is more reasonable by the pitcher than by the glass.  There's also a happy hour special of 1/2 price apps, so that's Ok too.    I've been to Frida a few times over the last few years, always at someone else's suggestion but would not go out of my way to eat there.  The service is OK, and appears to have improved since my last visit.   Food value is fair, so while I'm not in love with the place, I don't leave feeling completely ripped off either."}
{"text":"This place was great! Super cheap, and omg SO GOOD! The fish tacos were amazing, and I was very impressed. If I was a local to the area I would definitely stop in here again and again."}
{"text":"I'm Mexican & I was missing home; this place is great I love their food I feel in Mexico... The hot sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"Place is an A-OK place to eat for lunch or dinner.  Considering I always get the chimichanga whenever I go to \"Mexican\" restaurants, I am pretty much going to have to grade it as such.  For starters, they have screwed up my order twice out of 4 visits by giving me chicken instead of beef.  Hoewver, the chicken was quite good when I decided to eat the whole thing on my last visit (yes, of course I shared the error with the waitress).  Its about $9 which I would consider pretty average for places of this type.  GENERAL STATEMENTS ABOUT FRIDAS: Servers were generally pleasant (college types) and helpful with the menu.  There are Frida Khalo pictures up all over the place.  Place turns into a salsa dancing club at night around 10pm (lasers, moved tables to create a large dancefloor, etc).  Place is huge with a cool lofted eating area.  Its kind of sad that I actually hold a grudge against the place as it used to be one of my favorite Madison bars of all time (Spices) before it turned to Frida's."}
{"text":"Pretty bad food but a nice ambiance sitting outside. Standard chips and salsa to start: chips overly greasy, salsa with no \"kick\" (and very little flavor besides pureed tomatoes.) We both ordered tacos: fish, and chicken. Chicken tacos come in corn tortillas: a little healthier was my goal but no: the tortillas were brushed in oil before being used to form my tacos so picking them up was more of a greasy mess. Also absolutely loaded with cheese and very little meat. My wife had the fish version. Deep fried tilapia in flour tortillas. Decent tasting, but again, very greasy. Standard sides of refried beans and rice came with both.   A nice day drove us to this place; a margarita outside sounded appealing, unfortunately we should have stuck with the drinks and no lunch."}
{"text":"The food here has always been mediocre, but the service has taken a serious nosedive.  Two friends and I stopped in to enjoy 1/2 priced margaritas, and were told we had to order $5 of food per person.  After choosing from the very uninspired list of appetizers, my friend was given a clear plastic cup to sip her margarita from.  Like a Solo cup!  When asked if she could have a big girl cup like the rest of us, the waiter informed us that Frida is \"switching to plastic\".  How environmentally informed of them.  Did I mention we weren't given any chips and salsa?  The atmospheric highlights included the flies swarming around our food, and the frat boys in their JC Penney ties shouting and gesticulating from the loft.  This place is also horrible at dealing with groups.  I went for a friend's bday, and they wouldn't split the check from 20 people to groups of five or even ten.  Half-priced margs or not, I will not be returning to Frida."}
{"text":"There's a large, beautiful painting on the inside of Frida's if you sit to the left of the hostess station.  Only, the painting is too big for the wall and it was hung sideways.  This is a good metaphor for Frida's.  The food is so-so.  The carnitas quesedilla is typically smothered in cheddar cheese and grease, so it's tasty.  But there's no spice and it's soggy.  The chips and salsa are average, unless you ask for the hot salsa which is actually hot.  The service is below average, even if you go when it's not busy.  Even though I go there probably twice a month because it's close to work, I've never had the same server twice which leads me to believe the turnover is high, even for a restaurant.    Frida's has potential.  The inside is beautiful, the menu has enough variety.  But everything is a little sideways."}
{"text":"Alright so here it is.  My review of Frida.  I had been longing to visit this resto after various people  gave rave reviews of this establishment.  So my gf and I finally decided to try it out last night.  We were close on one occasion but decided to visit Il Mulino which is down the street.    We decided on an early dinner and didn't think we would need reservations.  Who I  imagined was the owner (after hearing a later conversation) said we needed to be out of there by 7:45 because there were previous reservations made.  It was about 6 and our parking validation was until exactly that time so we were good anyway but in all honesty I was a bit put off by it.  My gf said it was nice of them to mention it to us.  We walk in the establishment it's very small and still has some inklings of the old inner decor of the buildings with a pretty bad paint job of a blue colour surrounded by Frida pictures all over the walls.  Can Restaurant Makeover be revived to help with the decor?    So we ordered a sangria and mojito to start.  My mojito was pretty strong but actually done right.  The sangria looked very syrupy and I wasn't impressed when I had a sip of it.  Then came our guacamole, my gf's fave.  It was a bit different I will admit with the arugula on the side with the guacamole drizzled with some spicy red pepper oil with a decent serving of tortilla chips.  The guacamole wasn't as tangy but I don't know if I fancy the spiciness on top of it.  As a side note, the waitress came halfway through sharing our meal to give us side plates.  Ya those were needed alright. My gf called her \"spun.\"  You'll see why later... HAHA!  Onto our meals...I ordered the mole poblano and my gf ordered the tostades de pollo. The tostades tasted kind of bland to me.  It was very plentiful and she didn't end up finishing her meal.  As for my mole, it had a charitable portion of veggies, platanos and rice with some sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  It was obviously made for presentation.  I also though this was way too spicy for mole.  I love spices and can handle hotter but for a dinner I don't think it would've been appropriate.    So my gf turned to me at the end of the night and said to me she can tell that I wasn't overwhelmed by Frida.  She was right.  Remember folks, I lived in LA in 2 years and experienced simple Mexican food from the natives themselves.  I had a better mole from Loteria in the LA Farmers Market.  I have had better Mexican food at much cheaper prices.  Mexican dishes should not be overpriced.  Because you have a better cut of meat, you should be charging an arm and a leg for carne asada.   So on to my story our waitress just looked totally lost.  She provided another bill to us when we weren't even done our meal.  She was just clueless and SPUN.  LMAO.  This place wasn't worth holding out for and ya I've experienced better.  MUCH better."}
{"text":"well, we went there at 10pm on a friday and the place was starkly empty.  some burley men were creating a dance floor by clearing the place of its furniture. so we expected a party of reveling dancers to come in (there were like 2 latino men at the bar, so we thought it was like an underground durangeno dance hall on friday nights. incorrect.)  anyway, 1.5 hours later, no one had come in and the burley men replaced all the furniture. no dance party at all! sad news!  anyway, we just drank a lot at the empty bar at the side of the restaurant. who can really complain.  as usual, it was nearly free to drink alcohol. i had two literal tankers of red bull and vodka for like 3 dollars each.  it seemed like the bartenders didnt want us to be there and kind of ignored us but i guess that made it harder to black out, which is a good thing for everyone."}
{"text":"Service was acceptable. Food was mostly bland. Price was much too high for the mediocre quality. The chicken mole was good but that's it. Drinks were nothing special either. Definitely would not return, there is much better Mexican in the city for less price."}
{"text":"i grew up in madison but  went to school in ny and now live in chicago.  most summers, however, i lived on the uw campus.  now i frequently visit as my friends/family still live in the area.  one summer when i lived on langdon my friend got a job here.  she needed a job badly, and had worked in food service at various madison area restaurants for years.  she quit after a mere 4 hours.  she said the management was extremely rude and made some remarks.  the only adjectives she would use were \"gross and sexist.\"  also, she said they take expensive tequilla bottles and pour in GENERIC BRAND CHEAP SHIT.  talk about a scam.  avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I went in, was seated and told, \"A nice young lady will be with you in a minute.\" I sat, closed my menu, stared out the window, read from my book, sent some texts. I then watched a couple next to me get seated, and receive drinks and menus.  I got up and walked out."}
{"text":"Je manque peut être un peu d'objectivité en faisant un review sur le restaurant Frida.   J'ai eu le bonheur de côtoyer des mexicains dans ma vie qui m'ont fait découvrir la culture et la nourriture mexicaine.   Mon café de olla est délicieux, ma sopa de tortillas aussi. J'ai dégusté 2 tacos de cochinita, mon préféré... tout ça au son de musique salsa mexicaine traditionnelle. Je suis venu vivre une expérience et ça m'a plu. Les tarifs sont absolument plus que raisonnable. Je vais revenir!"}
{"text":"the ceviche verde was whoua!!! no word... i ordered a second one. tuna tacos and shrimps tacos were really good too. and because food is good, it's hard to get a table , you need to reserve a bit in adavnce"}
{"text":"I had walked by this location countless times, bu tnever actually gone in. I had heard a few good things, and the fact that it's been around for a number of years on this stretch of Eglinton made me believe it had to be pretty great (restaurants don't always last so long around here).  My friend and I sat on the patio which was quite nice, and you get to walk through the kitchen to get there. I loved that. It gave the whole restaurant a more family feel.  We started off by sharing some tortilla chips and guacamole. The guac was great. Better than my own homemade version (which I find delicious). It maybe could've used a bit more red onion, but then again, I'm a bit of an onion fan. It was really smooth and had a good spice to it! The chips were also nice - I think they're made in house.   After that I had the grilled corn which was fantastic. It comes with a chipotle sauce and a lime for squeezing which gave the already tasty grilled corn an extra punch of flavour.  Finally, I laid my hungry hands on the Taco de Alambre (the vegetarian option). Inside were roasted peppers, zucchini, and cheese. When combined with the sauce they gave on the side, it was a really nice dish.   I really enjoyed the Frida experience and would like to come back again. The only reason it isn't a 5 star from me is because I found the portions to be a bit small for the price. I'm a bit stingy though... I mean... Frugal... Yea, that sounds better."}
{"text":"Frida's biggest downfall is the size vs. price. Either their portions should be 20% larger or their prices 20% lower.  Dinner for two, including a cup of soup, an order of guacamole, an order of steak tacos and chicken tostadas, one dessert and two drinks each came to $100.00 before tip.  The food is delicious, but there are many excellent mexican options in Toronto where the prices and portions are way more reasonable, especially given that Frida isn't actually that much fancier than places like El Ricon Mexicana or King's Taco on St Clair.    Service is fine, but again, nothing outstanding. It's worth trying for sure, but I doubt I'll be a regular visitor."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure what all this \"bad service\" nonsense is about.  I've generally been pleased with the servers here.  I've also found that the food is served fast and fresh.  Regarding the quality of that food: questionable.  The food is hardcore mediocre mexican.  It's nothing to write home about, but it's fast, hot and tastes fresh.  Just not that great.  The margaritas were really the reason that I dragged my ex to this place so much.  The margaritas were pretty decent and came in many different flavors.  Plus, they come in insane novelty sizes.  If you want good Mexican food, I suggest you try Casa De Lara, down the street.  This place is mostly for the drinking and the nightlife."}
{"text":"Limited menu consisting of tacos and quesadillas, which ended up being very similar. The tortilla soup was watery and had a fake broth taste. We had to order a fair bit to fill up and the tab was steep for what we had.  We'd hoped for more from a local Mexican eatery, but unfortunately probably won't be back."}
{"text":"It's fine but probably slightly overpriced.  Great location if it's not too hot outside.  The guac was not particularly spicy.  Lots of food but the quality is not wonderful.  Service was fine.  Not running back there but not likely to avoid at all cost either."}
{"text":"Went for dinner passing thru town in January. Had the salmon. Was quite good. Went again in June. The salmon was WAY, I mean WAY overcooked. It was so overcooked it was tuff. I told the waitress the person who prepared it was a complete novice. She offered to have it redone. I said OK, and to tell them to actually put some \"blackened\" spices on it! Although on the second round it was cooked properly, the food prep person just added (obvious) salt to the salmon, instead of actually putting a reasonable portion of \"blackened\" spices on it. Although it is a pleasant, interesting restaurant in terms of ambience, the owner is apparently too cheap to hire (or train) competent food prep staff."}
{"text":"The food at Frida's is LAME. Not so bad in the sense that you'll want to vomit, but certainly bad enough that you won't even think twice about throwing away your leftovers instead of taking them home. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it really is some of the most mediocre Mexican food I've ever had, and that you honestly can get more flavorful Latin cuisine at Taco Bell.   To start, the meat is dry and totally free of any significant spices or marinade, leaving you with a stringy and uninspired base for the dish. The tortillas are tough to bite through, even when soaked in the flavorless liquids that adorn your plate. The beans taste like they came straight from a can bought at the dollar store, and the vegetables aren't all that fresh. And because every dish they make is incredibly tasteless, Frida's will load up on obscene amounts of cheese to compensate. The cheese is equally as hopeless, tasting like nothing but chewy grease.   Frida's only redeeming quality is the atmosphere - a large, well-decorated 2-story loft - unless you're not a fan of looking at a giant picture of woman with a unibrow while you eat, I suppose. All in all, dining here is a horrendous, underwhelming experience. Don't waste your money. Casa de Lara is 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"First time here, overall the place has a nice ambiance but the food was only OK nothing really exciting. No dish really stood out other than the guacamole.  The tacos were plain, so was the consomme soup.  The halibut entree was nice however. If you want Mexican food and are in the area, do stop by you won't be disappointed but don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"Ordered the fajita tacos..they were supposed to come with peppers and zucchini. The taco shell was disgusting - I can't really describe the taste but my roommate called it \"soapy\". The veggies were soggy..I didn't see or taste any zucchini and I found a piece of steak in one even though they were veggie. I gave up after half a taco (out of 4). Would not reccomend at all."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with not so great staff.  Dined here with a pre-ordered party of 20.  Food was ready for us--laid out on a table next to our party and getting COLD.  One not very articulate server made for even more difficulties--it's not as if his job was really hard, the order was already made he just had to hand it out courteously.  I was here once before on salsa night-wasn't too impressed either."}
{"text":"Yes, Frida's is good....but it isn't awesome.   Christine \"meat is my middle name\" C and I ventured to Frida's for the stop for food event. We ate from the special menu (kinda like a Winterlicious or Summerlicious idea). I had mushroom empanadas to start, a shrimp mole for the main and cheesecake for dessert.   The empanadas were quite good. Not as robust in flavour as I would have liked, but quite good. The outer layer was more of a cornmeal texture that I quite enjoyed.   The shrimp was cooked to perfection, but the rice that was underneath - I swear it was just plucked from a bag and thrown on the plate. It did not taste cooked. At all. Quite disappointing.   My mango margarita was thick and smooth. But at $10, it should have blown my socks off, and should have been bigger.  I did have a sip of Christine's sangria - wow - that is a tasty treat!!   The cheesecake was hands down one of (if not the) best cheesecakes I have ever had. Not too firm, not too soft, full of flavour and texture. Impeccable.   The coffee was quite tasty with cinnamon notes. But, it arrived luke warm. I like 6 layers of skin to come off my mouth while drinking a hot beverage.   Overall, the highlights were having dinner with my friend Christine, the empanada's outer layer and the cheesecake.   As for the guac reviews, Frida's guac is supplied by a Toronto company called Mad Mexican. You can see one of the owners down at the bottom level of the St Lawrence Market every Saturday and buy a tub to take home. You will fall in love with it, guarenteed."}
{"text":"The fish taco (1.50 each) on Friday specials should be avoided. It's a battered piece of fish wrapped in a flour tortilla with lettuce, tomatoes, & sour cream. Gross and bad.  Steak tacos were wrapped in corn tortillas, my friend was not impressed with paying $10 (?) for 3 tacos, rice, & beans. The chorizo pasta wasn't too bad. Overpriced and mediocre food. Guess this is what I get when having a soft spot for anything Frida--huge painting of Frida beckoning you to come in."}
{"text":"Grey guacamole and tasteless tacos. Cafe Frida is better. On top of it the person serving me did not want to give me the receipt from the interac machine."}
{"text":"Food=Bad. Service=Ok.   Ugh. If given 20 minutes in the kitchen I could concoct tastier chicken tacos from old tires and sweaty socks. Even the tortilla chips were bland. Hands down worst \"Mexican\" food ever.   The single redeeming thing about the restaurant was the nice outdoor seating; the sun was nice.  I ate one of 3 chicken tacos and resorted to filling myself with the mediocre nachos and salsa. The re-fried beans were bland and the rice lifeless (I think it was Uncle Ben's).   I left my with my tacos in a to-go box. As I made my way down State Street a guy on a bench asked if I could spare my left overs. I offered them over with the explanation of how bad the food was. He didn't seem to mind.   Bottom line=Save your money. Go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"To say I was disappointed with Frida would be an understatement.   We went here to that we could hear Jazz in the Square while enjoying some sangria.  The sangria mostly just tasted like watered down franzia.  There was no fruit or anything in it at all.    After getting our pitcher of \"sangria,\" we thought we should order something even though we weren't hungry just because we were taking the waitresses table for an unknown period of time.  We ordered some type of cheese appetizer that was so bland I can't remember anything about it besides that it was gross.   The service was quite friendly and they weren't pushy trying to get us to leave so that is the only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Spent a while walking around trying to decide where to eat, and ended up stopping here.  The food was fine.  I liked my dish, but it wasn;t spectacular.  The service was really terrible.  We were sitting outside and saw our waitress three times.  When the order was taken and when the food was ready and when she brought the check.  There was no asking if we wanted more booze (even though she had already upsold us on the original margarita), and getting her attention when she was walking by to service the other table was impossible.  After she left the check we waited about 20 minutes for her to come and run the card, but that never happened.  Had to ask the hostess to take care of it.  She gave it to the server who, annoyed, returned it with a simple \"there you go\".  Hopefully she was just having a bad night but that wasn't the impression that I got."}
{"text":"Holy crap was this place awful.  I had read all the horrible reviews and thought to my self, this place can't be that bad can it?  I walked by and saw this colorful little spot and thought I'd check it out but then I realized it was THE Frida.  What a mistake I made, I've had better texmex at Taco Bell and it still gave me the runs.  The food was positively bland and but I'll admit that the waitress was very nice and helpful.  I can't understand why there were so many people eating there the day I went.  Well I guess they were actually all drinking tons of margaritas so at that point is doesnt matter what kind of food you are cutting the alcohol with. Also the fake Frida murals were hella cheesy.  Texmex cheesy."}
{"text":"The food is not good. I've been to Frida a few times since it opened, and I've never been happy with the food. The margaritas are pretty good, but definitely not great. If you can lobby your friends to go to a different restaurant, I would."}
{"text":"Love this place one of my favourites, we went for drinks and appetizers and they were really good, we took advantage of the 2x1 drinks promo.  Great ambiance and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I've been to Frida's about 5-6 times in the past three years and it seems every trip I enjoy it less and less. It's not because of the service. There was only one time where we received lackluster service...and the place was nearly dead. The host seated my husband and I, and then we sat for 15-20 minutes, watching another couple be seated and have their drink order taken by an attentive server. We try not to be dicks. We're reasonable people. So we kept amused by betting each other if our server was smoking out back or shooting heroin out back. The host finally came by to take our drink order, and then a sheepish & stoned looking waif of a server wandered over to take our dinner order. Your guess is as good as mine whatever he was doing \"out back\".  If the margaritas weren't so strong, I'd be giving this 1 star. I used to live a ten minute drive from the Mexican border, so I understand the logic of lowering expectations so far north of the border. But I think they could try just a little harder. I like their complimentary chips & salsa, but Frida's guac tastes like it's pre-packaged. The food is ok as long as it's hot, but the flavors aren't memorable. The last time I ate here, I sat in a broken booth with springs poking my rear, which caused me to slouch over toward the wall with the huge mural on it. From this viewing advantage, I was able to notice that this place hasn't been dusted or thoroughly cleaned in ages. There are large cobwebs and a thick layer of fuzzy grime coating the fake plants and the side wall where the broken booths rest against. The mural of Frida has reflective drips where some clearish liquid spattered her face and was never wiped off. Being an artist, it is sad to see Frida Kahlo's face disrespected that way. And if the dining area is this neglected, I'm not too hopeful about the cleanliness of the kitchen. I'd like to add that I'm not one of those people who carries hand sanitizer everywhere or bleaches her kitchen and bathroom, so for me to say something's icky may put it in perspective. Maybe I didn't notice how dirty it was in the past because I was too busy sucking down their yummy margaritas.  Here's the kicker: On my last visit, I was finishing the last of my margarita at the end of our meal when I saw a small roach scurry across the table. It practically fell into my lap, and brought back unpleasant memories of my infested apartment in college. I didn't do the \"girl thing\" and scream or jump out of the booth, but I might be done eating food here. However, I remain open-minded to having margaritas out on the sidewalk when the weather's nice. We'll see."}
{"text":"Delivery is quite slow, took an hour and a half.    Shrimp tacos were quite salty and were just ok.  You do however get 4 tacos, so there is plenty of food!   Would recommend if you want to try this place,  go in person."}
{"text":"My favorite Madison mexican restaurant.  The decor is vibrant and traditional and the food is very authentic and colorful with lots of fresh veggies.  Great chips and salsa.  All-in-all, a nice fresh take on a cuisine that can get very predictable.  A little more expensive than say, Casa de Lara, but I always look forward to eating here. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ahhh it's nice to have a homey, cheap neighbourhood taco joint."}
{"text":"Food was great Must try kahlua cheesecake 4 stars Service slow and understaffed 2 stars Decor  2.5 stars. felt cold and unwelcoming. the chairs didn't help they weren't cushioned at all.   For the cost its only fair to have the latter two brought up to par."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for Frida which finally pushed me over the edge to try out 'haut' mexican cuisine...The highlight of the night were these mini taco things that were absolutely succulent...not to mention the perfect guacamole...To be perfectly honest I was less then impressed with the mains and I think the prices are on the high side.   Frida is worth going to once, but there definitely won't be a repeat performance without another Groupon offer."}
{"text":"I'm a bit conflicted, since I feel Frida deserves three stars for its cuisine -- the food is basically alright. Flavors are kinda bland, cuts of meat are kind of tough. On the other hand, for Toronto, it's great. Having been raised in Southern California and spending most of my life on the West Coast, I have been rather homesick for good Mexican food *not* of the typical Tex-Mex variety. In this regard, Frida's fits the bill.   For my meal at Frida, I ordered the ceviche, which was my favorite -- the shrimps were large and the slices of scallop were huge. I especially loved the marinade, nicely spicy and limey-cilatro-y. On the other hand, the tacos I had were a little bit gristly and not very flavorful. The churros I had for dessert were good, but nothing special. Finally, I recommend the sangria. It's quite good -- sweet and fruity.  The service was pretty good and the wait staff were quite friendly. I'd go again, but for good tacos I'd rather hit up el Trompo in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"The sign outside said PATIO. But it was closed on a sunny Sunday lunch in July - strike 1. My 'local' appetizer was a mushy noodle and mushroom soup - strike 2. My entre reminded me of Shredded Wheat but with a sprinkling of sand instead of brown sugar - strike 3. Top it off with a ridiculous $70 bill for lunch for 2. I think the real Frida would be as disappointed as we were."}
{"text":"I went here with my family on a Saturday night. We were the only ones there around 7:00 but a couple people came in after. Wasn't too busy.   Food quality is decent. I got the mole chicken which was very bland, no flavour. The fish tacos were very good. Guacamole was good but such a small portion for $11.   One thing we noticed is that they charged us higher prices on 2-3 items then what were on the menu. For example, the large Mole Chicken was supposed to be $20 but he charged us $21. We decided not to say anything as it was very small amount, but this is illegal.   Service was decent, not a huge fan of the ambience.  Overall, 2/5 stars. I would not go back. Just didn't WOW me. There are plenty of other authentic mexican restaurants that offer larger tastier portions for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"The margaritas are good and priced right if you go during happy hour. The food, however, is awful. Nothing here is remotely authentic and, compared to the great places like Los Gemelos, Tacqueria Guadalajara and Francisco's Cantina, this place has nothing on any of them.  Frida's can be summed up with two words: overpriced and mediocre."}
{"text":"VOMIT ... I give it two stars because it had food, and I thin I got drunk ... The salsa was horrible.. WTF was it .. it was tomato sauce and some tabasco mixed together I swear, the service had sucked, I don't know how they stay in business... I went on a bad date their.. so I ended up drinking I think that was the only thing good about the place"}
{"text":"My mouth is watering at the thought of describing Frida's fare.  Having been to Mexico so many times, I've often longed for comparable fare in Toronto...only to have been disappointed. That is, until FRIDA!  The reviews tell you everything you need to know.   The key to Mexican cuisine is fresh ingredients. Let's be honest, how many times have we been disappointed with avocados purchased at Loblaws?   The head chef at Frida is Mexican and professionally-trained, I like the combo.  So far, I've had every appetizer on the menu and we all perfect. Actually perfect. The tortilla soup is BETTER than I've had in Mexico.   Yes, it's that good. Just go."}
{"text":"the outdoor seating was nice.  margaritas were pretty good.  food was not good at all.  So if you want to hang out on state street and have a drink, it's nice.  If you want good food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So now that I live up near this area, I had no reason not to check out this place after hearing about it on Yelp so often, especially from Kat.  Mexican places in Toronto have never really impressed me, and honestly I'm not hard to please with Mexican. I'm a cheap date. But yeah Frida's was VERY good. I was very happy with the quality of food and the service.  I would love to go on about it a bit more but really everything has already been said about it.  It's not the BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER OMGGGG but it's really good, especially for a Toronto joint.  Fin!"}
{"text":"Frida que adoro usted tanto! Usted tiene el lo mejor alimento mexicano en la ciudad. Como la revisión anterior por Kat, yo no pienso que 5.000 palabras es suficiente en escribir acerca de cuánto yo le adoro Frida!   Ok, enough of my crappy Spanish, I think you get the gist. We loved Frida! My SO took his fav FARC girls out for a personal farewell to my food loving sister Deanna and we hit up Frida. After reading the three 5 star reviews we were practically salivating at the chance to check out this uptown spot out and Frida had her food mojo on full blast.   For app's we had to have some of the guac with homemade tortilla chips. Guacamole has been so bastardized over the last few years in chain restaurants that they've turned it into lumpy green sludge but no so at Frida's. Guacamole is alive and well on Eglinton Avenue. Deanna wouldn't let our waiter take the plate away, even during dinner, just in case we wanted to scrape up the last few nodules of that avocado goodness.  Our second app was slices of a spiced fried cheese (the name of which escapes my brain), it came on a plate with some home made tomatilla salsa and a plate of soft, warm, light flour tortillas.  It was absolutely delicious.    Mains included a Quail Mole Poblano served atop a bed of rice that had grilled plantains, spring onions, brussel sprouts and baby beets all adorning the plate. The mole sauce was perfection in motion and I've eaten my share of mole sauce over the years but what is on the plate at Frida's is blue ribbon. My SO ordered up the Lamb Barbacoa. Initially he wanted the Halibut but was informed a few minutes later by the wait staff that this fish wasn't available. They apologized profusely and then comp'd him one of his Heinken's to make up for the inconvenience. As it turns out the Lamb was incredible. Moist. Pull apart easy. It comes with a cup of broth beside it that you are supposed to slurp in between mouthfuls of meat. The lamb is braised in Morita Sauce and is served with Salsa Roja and grilled vegetables.   Deanna ordered up a couple of appies instead of a main. Tostadas de Scalpion Yucateco \"Dizk\" are mini tostados of shredded flank steak topped with Habanero sauce and some sort of Mexican cheese. Crunchy, delicious and a filling app. In addition to this Deanna ordered Enchiladas Lamb Barbacoa smothered in Borracha styled sauce, onions, coriander and cheese. We washed this down with some of their house margaritas (traditional, mango, pomegranate).   While we may be the girls who love to eat the meat we also like to eat the sweets. Our gluttony won us over and we ordered up a plate of Churros for dessert. Churros are Mexican donuts, the difference being they aren't round but rather usually long finger length pieces.  Please purge any Timmy's thoughts you may be having.  Typically Churros come with some sort of hot melted chocolate but these came with Dulce La Leche and the plate was beautifully decorated with venetian cream and hearts. We have a heart on for Frida!   Food presentation is ever present at Frida's.  You can see for yourself as I've pasted up a bunch of pics from our food adventures.    The room is comfy and decorated in deep blues with splashes of orange & red. I'm sure Frida herself would have approved. There is a real comfortable vibe in the restaurant and they were playing some great dinner tunes while we stuffed our gullets! Big props on the nice bathroom! For a small restaurant I was surprised at the lovely amenities. The service was excellent and the young man who served us was helpful and patient while we routed the menu.    If you are in to really authentic, delicious, well prepared Mexican food then Frida needs to be put on your \"must go to\" list.  Finally, one small tidbit of trivia about Frida herself.  Did you know that Frida had a love affair with jazz icon, Josephine Baker.  Yup, my daughter text'd me that little nugget of information that she learned in one of her art classes at university.  Glad to know that she is learning something at school."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! Don't come here looking for the stereotypical foods, go through the menu and appreciate it. I love spice but I  took my boyfriend who isn't great with spicy food, so he is naturally wary of Mexican cuisine, and he now dreams of it! Nice space, awesome food, staff is super friendly, and don't forget to get the churros!"}
{"text":"Sad Frida's closed, but you can get the same \"Frida's\" margaritas across the street at Moe's. That's really the only reason my friends and I went here."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've ever had in Madison.  A hostess once tried to take away the table we'd just been seated at because some friend of hers wandered by and wanted to be seated immediately.  I've often had to wait quite awhile for waitstaff.  The food is nothing special--not BAD, but definitely overpriced.  The half-price margaritas, the only reason I ever go there, are pretty good, but they recently instituted a requirement that you purchase like $10 worth of their overpriced food in order to get a table rather than being confined to the bar.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"So nice and homey. A bit hidden a block UPHILL from Lionel-Groulx metro. Worthy of Frida Kahlo! Sorry no soup, taco (killer chorizo tacos!) rice and beans photo because we just weren't going to interrupt eating to waste time staging pics. We picked up a bottle of Habanero sauce to take home too. If you love incredible Mexican delicacies don't miss Frida's. When we ordered the owner  Yadina (pronounce Jadira) brought us out some mole she was working on and fresh to test out as we waited. Fantastic. They serve beer, wine, a selection of cocktails but sorry, this isn't a bar or pub. No outside seating. Maybe 8 tables. Three house-made heat levels of hot sauce."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tacos, steak tacos and chicken quesadilla. Had a odd taste i think it was the Mexican style tortilla which i was not use to, my was just ok with it as well it, a so-so experience for me, so i am giving 3 stars because the food was just bland for me and a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Quick tips:  --Guacamole is truly outstanding but the portions could be larger.  --Tortilla soup is OUT OF THIS WORLD  --The \"mini bites\" are good way to sample a bunch of things, but they're pretty tiny so hubby and I ordered two of everything...we got the mushroom empanada, chicken tostada and flank steak thingy...all were delicious  --We both didn't care for the sirloin taco with oaxaca cheese  --Churros for dessert are yummy and bursting with caramel  --If you're not a drinker, the homemade lemonade is deliciously sweet"}
{"text":"I initially went because they served under-agers, the margaritas were good.  The food was decent nothing outstanding.  The reason it is given a bad rating though is because of its reputation of the management towards the employees.  The first time I heard it I thought someone was bitter at the management.  Within my 5 years at Frida's I heard many times at how the owner didn't treat his waitresses with respect or dignity.  This is why I don't go to this place or recommend it."}
{"text":"Frida's is mediocre, at best.  The tacos are generally dry as the desert and the beans are like eating sand; and I've had their steak tacos twice (I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was a fluke--not the case.) Their cheese quesadillas are just as lifeless and lacking in flavor.  I've never had bad service here, but I can safely say that there's only two reasons to come to Frida's:  one, their margaritas are excellent--especially if you're stupid like me and don't mind trying to down a 28 oz. one (they have larger ones as well) in about an hour and a half time frame or more. Two, their desserts. The Tres Leches is to die for: it is rich and decadent with sweetness that makes you sit back in your chair and get a food coma.  If there is one reason I will return to Frida's, it's for the margarita and Tres Leches."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious, didn't have high expectation but was pleasantly surprised. We had the ceviche and bean soup for starters, carnita and snapper for entrée and milk cake and churros for dessert. Ceviche was OK, didn't really the tuna in it, but the soup was good. My boyfriend got the pork which wasn't bad but the snapper was really nice. It could've been a bit spicier and more seasoned. You can ask the server to bring homemade hot sauce which we did. Desserts were my favorite. Both the milk cake and churros were delicious. The atmosphere was great and the servers were attentive. All in all, we had a good experience and will go back."}
{"text":"I was wandering around downtown Madison today and ended up here for lunch.  Typical Mexican food outside of LA .... sorry I have been come biased since I have moved to LA years ago.  It gets a star for a lunch menu with most items $6.99.  The food was better than expected for that price.  I was disappointed with the sangria, but I think that might be I am a wine snob and don't like drinks made out of wine - so no deduction for that."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and I love the layout of the large space Frida inhabits. Watched most of the World Cup games there this summer, and was pleased enough with the quality and speed of the bar service I recommended the place to fellow World Cup spectators, which increased my posse threefold by the finals. When we showed up for the France/Italy championship match, we were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess who was instantly interrupted by a man who reminded her loudly that all customers that day were required to order food. Between the time we walked in the door and our butts hit the barstools we heard this same man make the very same announcement to different staff members at least four times. Now, there are several problems I have with this: 1) you set up a temporary yet strict policy and want it enforced, you train your employees beforehand --not belligerently, and certainly not in front of customers. 2) Our group would have ended up spending twice as much money than we did if we hadn't been required to order food, since most of us had eaten already and were too full afterward to order the original barrage of margaritas we had hoped for. 3) The restaurant clearly wasn't prepared for the large task of making food for EVERYONE in there, as the service was excruciatingly slow, wrong meals were delivered, and the sound of falling trays and dishes was only barely punctuated by the bossman shouting insults to his staff. The experience was horrible. And the owner was the person responsible! Amazing. Go there for the food, go there for the friendly service and tip your servers well. But I personally avoid the place like the plague if the bossman is around."}
{"text":"1st- I'd give 3.5 stars.  2nd _ I love their Happy hour deals. Always worth another visit due to that but the food isn't the greatest TEX-MEX or Mexican. And I'm from the Tex-Mex (TX/LA border) and appreciate a good salsa. At least the salsa is better than La Hacienda on Park but it's no El Chico's (google 'em).  Mon/Wed/Thur HH specials."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend. I wasn't sure what to expect by the mixed reviews. We went anyways. I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the duck tacos to start. Very small portions but delicious! I had the chicken mole for my entree it was amazing! My fiancée had the braised lamb, he too was very happy with his meal. I will defiantly return."}
{"text":"Among all the Mexican places popping up around town, Frida stands out.   Went here with some friends because they were walking by and being huge Frida Khalo fans, loved the name. Inside, there are tons of pictures of Khalo. But the decor is mostly clean and simple, with deep blues creating a relaxing vibe. The atmosphere is definitely more upscale than the usual Mexican restaurants (e.g. Las Margaritas).   The food is fantastic. Excellent quality for very reasonable prices. You feel like you are at a fancy restaurant, but most entrees are between $10-20 for dinner. Our server brought tortilla chips and 2 kinds of salsa to our table. We ordered guacamole as an appetizer and it was divine! Smooth, fresh, with just the right amount of spices. Tortilla chips too were fresh and crisp, never stale/soggy as they can be in some places.   I had the mushroom and bean quesedilla which was hearty and filling. My friends had the tostadas de pollo (amazing! a cold dish, but very refreshing!) and tacos con carne. We shared a piece of cheesecake which was rich and creamy, but I'm not a huge cheesecake fan so I can't really comment.   Good wine/cocktail selection. Attentive and knowledgable staff (good at giving suggestions. I hate it when you ask a server for suggestions and they just say everything is good! our server was very helpful).   Frida takes classic Mexican dishes and steps it up a notch with interesting combinations and quality ingredients. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My friends were roped into having their rehearsal dinner at Frida's when their original venue closed unexpectedly. It was unfortunate.   We pre-ordered, but it took an hour and a half from the time we arrived to the time we got our inauthentic Mexican food. I got the carne asada, and the steak was tough and overcooked. The refried beans had that been-sitting-under-a-lamp crust to them. One of the servers started yelling out the names of the plates across the whole room, even though we had little stickers marking what we ordered. It was a hot mess.  Dinner was still fun (of course---it was a pre-hitchin' dinner!), but the margaritas and the sangria were the only high points for which Frida's can actually claim credit. Still, I'd never come here again."}
{"text":"Food was average. Being on Joanne Kates top 100, I was expecting more."}
{"text":"Frida is practically orgasmic, if you can afford the hefty price tag!  Two words: Oaxaca cheese."}
{"text":"such a bittersweet review.  the first time i went, the main server/hostess/family member of owner (?) was delightful.  offered me an Advil when i mentioned i had a headache.  it's the little things, you know?  because this set the tone for the rest of the meal and experience, it was more enjoyable.  the food was mediocre.  the menu sounds delish, but it seems everything is pre-prepared.  all restos do this to some degree, but i don't want to be able to tell.  if i'm paying a premium, i want fresh and not prepared at noon.  my biggest complaint was that the food was never hot (temperature, not spice).    on my second visit, the same main server/hostess/family member of the owner (?) was rude, hurried, pushy and seldom around.  the food was disappointing.  i ordered a bottle of wine based on the vintage on the wine list.  she brought a different vintage but didn't say anything.  when i pointed out, she said this was all she had.  she did apply a 10% discount in the end.    we were enjoying the bottle of wine when she offered dessert.  my partner said thank you, but not just yet.  still not done with the wine, she asked about dessert again.  he chose one but asked not to bring it until we were done with the wine.  dessert came out by a food runner 5 minutes later while we still had a third of the bottle left.  we sent it back and said we'd let them know when we were ready for it.  a couple minutes later, it came out again, by her.  my partner and i laughed at the absurdity and said, we just sent this back.  and she said, you ordered this, didn't you?  my partner, who NEVER gets upset, said, you know what, cancel it, we don't want it.  we left without even finishing the bottle of wine.  oh yeah, the \"sweet\" part of the bittersweet:  the resto itself is adorably quaint.  covered with images of ms. kahlo, perfect lighting for ideal ambiance, and lovely art abounds.  but alas, the digs don't make up for the rest."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on Sunday.  The verdict. don't come here for Brunch. It is over priced.  Their refried beans are such a fail. So dry!!  The plates are lack of decoration of greens. The waitress was not very knowledgeable. I asked her 'What' the house special? any specialty we should try?\". And she responded 'Brunch'.   What a failed answer, and later I asked for a side of salsa ($2 extra). I told the waitress I want it 'mild'.  I am not sure if she understand the word 'mild'. I thought the salsa would be 'mild' and put a spoonful of it on my food. And it literally burned me inside out. It was wayyyy too spicy! I have been to Mexico myself, and I can tell what's mild and what's HOT. The salsa they give was out of the chart.  We ordered Huevos Rancheros, Tacos de Pollo Pibil, Enchiladas de Barbacao, and a chorizo sausage omelet.   i would say the taste are fairly blend. And it's over 11 dollar per dish with the portion provided. Not so bang for the buck.  Not much greens on the plate as well.   The only good thing is their coffee. (We should have come here just for coffee!!). Their coffee has grinded with cinnamon. I love it.  We end up ordering two more dessert. And each person paid $33 after tax and tips for brunch. Probably the most expensive brunch I ever had."}
{"text":"Is the food good? No. Is the service good? Actually, yes. On Monday night my 3 friends and I had several margaritas (because they're 1/2 off!!) and dinner there. The bartender was very nice and the drink was appropriately strong, and the table waiter was also very pleasant to 4 of us. The place was not that happening on this particular night  - I think it's partly because of the holiday emptiness the college town experiences + ultra cold night - so no body was kicking us out of the door in hurry. We stayed and chatted long after taking care of the bills, and they didn't seem to care.   Has the food been authentic or anything close to that, the dining experience would have been a bit more pleasurable on palate, but over all, not too much to complain about."}
{"text":"Went for lunch during summerlicous.   Food was great tasting and so were the drinks. The service was not. To get to the patio you literally have to go through the kitchen which wasn't pleasant. The value was ok considering it was summerlicous but I wouldn't come back. You can get much better food and service else where."}
{"text":"Really like it here. The staff is so friendly and welcoming, it really makes the experience that much better.  The food was great! We ordered pretty much every taco on the menu and they were all excellent!  We sat on the patio which is surprisingly quaint for the area.  Overall great great experience."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious. The ceviche was the best I had (better than El passo in distillery district). The bean soup was good too. I had the roast chicken and my girlfriend had the red snapper. The mains could have been a bit more spicier. The fish felt a bit bland even with the tomato broth. chicken was better. (May be I'm too used to tikka masala or Chinese hot pot! ) But still good entrees. The desserts were great! Wish they had served bigger portions! Altogether I give 4 disregarding my affinity towards spicy dinners.I'll sure go back."}
{"text":"Frida's is over priced, under inspired \"Mexican\" food.  The cuisine is neither authentic or unique. (or even tasty)  While I love salsa night as much as the next girl, I really would never go here to eat again. (Not when Casa de Lara is within walking distance, and El Pastor is within driving distance.  Seriously no matter what interpretation of Mexican food you prefer you can always do better than Frida's.)   As for those seeking employment, I urge you to avoid this place. (I've never worked here, but I've had close friends who have. Check out Shawn S.'s review for a brief illustration of what I mean.)"}
{"text":"Average place for a campus restaurant.  We just had maragaritas and chips and guac/salsa.  The margaritas were tasty, not the best, but tasty.  The salsa tasted like pizza sauce with tabasco and the guac was pretty boring.  But drinks outside on State St. made it worth it."}
{"text":"Who's thrilled there are more authentic Mexican options than in decades past. I am, I am. Now the problem is how to find the time to try them all. Kind of a famine to feast situation - enough of the preamble let's get to it.  Restaurant Frida, has the right motif to pay tribute to their namesake. It's colourful, and has her portait up, and on display along with several shelves of Mexican products to take to with you after your meal, or to add to it.   The likes of corn tortillas, flour tortillas, pork cracklins (chicaharrones), clay pottery and dulce de leche (eat the pottery at your own risk) et mas.  On the menu and menu boards are items like Nopal (cactus), Tinga (chicken), Pazole (or another Mexican soup), and what I ended up getting to take out and eat on a set of steps nearby; a Cochinitas (shredded marinated pork) burrito $8 + tax.   Now for the good and the sort of bad...  It was flavourful, and came with two dipping sauces (one was an excellent tomatillo, the other hot salsa). The cabbage was fresh and crunchy, there were onions and spices on a soft tasty tortilla shell.  It was long and thin, but not nearly a 5 lb burrito = was not huge, but again flavourful. Was a little drippy, but then again some of the tastiest meals are messy.   Unfortunately, there was a green tie of some sort that I found near the end of my chews. When I went back to ask about it another day, and one of the staff (actually from Chihuahua) was nice enough to take the time to figure out that it was a plantain leaf used in the cooking process.   Glad to know it wasn't something inorganic. Her care saved the review from ending in a lower rating, as another staff member did not seem to care as much to figure out what it was.   With that, my little note to restaurants - when/if someone/a customer finds something green in a burrito that isn't guacamole...you should care...mucho.  Gracias for caring."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant and felt that it fell a bit  short. Besides the couple of prints of Frida, it did not remind me of Mexico at all. The service was quite slow, which was likely partially due to the large party there. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, it only had a couple of blueberries in it..we ordered the salsa and guacamole which was good as well as the duck confit tacos. I ordered the beef tacos with the street corn, could have done without the sauce and cheese on the corn. I did not  enjoy the churros, they were a bit undercooked and the filling was not appetizing at all.  The food was overall good, the service unfortunately was not and the ambiance did not remind me of Mexico."}
{"text":"I went to Frida's for the first time this past week.  We sat on the patio in the back.  We had the Duck Carnitas (mini tacos), Lamb Barbacoa and a couple of orders of the fish tacos.  We had a picture of margaritas to start, a couple of bottles of Lurton Les Fumees Blanches Sauv Blanc with dinner and finished off with shots of Clase Azul Tequila as a digestif.  The food, service and atmosphere were all exceptional.  This is NOT a TexMex restaurant.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Eating at Frida has inspired me to stop lurking around on yelp and to hurry up and create an account and review already!  I was there with a group of 10 adults and 2 babies (both very well behaved) and we were treated to a food experience we are still salivating over. We started with an amuse-bouche - compliments of the kitchen - of a shrimp \"cappuccino\".  While the name turned us off, the taste was a real turn-on: it did what exactly an amuse-bouche should do - priming us for the culinary treats that were to come. Next we shared guacamole (very smooth), the ceviche (me: \"omg what IS that!!\"), the melted cheese thing (very poor description for that unctuous goodness), and the duck tacos (5 to a plate - good thing the babies weren't equiped to eat those they would have had rank totally pulled on them).   While I enjoyed the chicken main I really should have gone with my first instinct and ordered the lamb that my husband had. Accompanied by a side of lamb consommé, the meat was tender, very well seasoned and put over the top with the crumbled fresh cheese topping.   The serving size was generous.  We had the dessert sampler and true to the previous reviews, the churros are definitely a high-light.  It was my birthday so I was treated to a cocktail from the bar. Now I only wish I thought to remember the name of that deliciousness.  (Something like \"Mexican Rose\"?)  Service was fabulous.  Our server's descriptions of the food was right-on.   Convenient Green P lot right beside Frida.  Now looking for another special occasion as an excuse to go back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food.  Delicious.  Big on the presentation - Frida Kahlo would not frown (not that you'd know because of the the uni-brow....).  Churros with dipping sauce are dangerously tasty.  My only complaint is that you don't get a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"I was a bit dubious of this choice when I saw it but what the hell, outdoor patio, right? This was arguably the worst Mexican food that I've ever tasted. My enchiladas were lousy (I felt like the sauce was made with tomato paste) and even the high end margaritas tasted like a sweet mix. The waitstaff also seemed to be a bit out of it.   I think the lesson learned is don't eat Mexican in Madison, WI."}
{"text":"$40 Groupon + Hunger = a magnificent meal at Frida right? Well not so much. I called the restaurant that same night to make a reservation. The woman on the phone seemed nice and everything was set for 7:30pm. I was coming straight from school and meeting up with a friend at Spadina station. We hit some TTC delayed going up to North York and arrived at the restaurant about 20 minutes late.  We walked in and the place was relatively dead, one table of 8 and another couple next to us. We received a rather weird and cold greeting when we walked in. I was asked if I had a reservation and I awkwardly explained yes but we were late due to transit. I can only assume Jonathan K. and I encountered the same odd hostess. From the moment we stepped foot in the door she gave us a really uneasy and cold vibe; I almost seemed like she expected us to rob the restaurant at any moment!  We were seated and took a look at the menu... ladies and gentlemen this place isn't cheap. We both ordered a $15 burrito appetizers and a half bottle of wine to share with the grand total coming to more than $60.  The food was good but our service was so odd and everything was so expensive that I probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the burrito and guacamole combo... OMG. I chose the steak option, the burrito was absolutely perfect. The cheese, the meat, the beans - everything. Portion was great - I swear I could've split the burrito in half with someone and still have been full. It also came with salsa and potato chips on the side.  In the delivery they gave me a generous portion of fresh, spicy guacamole and a bag of tortilla chips which I shared with my coworkers. We were all going crazy over how good it was!   My experience was so good I definitely would order again, price was a fair $21 for food + delivery."}
{"text":"Within a stones throw of the beautiful WI capitol building this place is where I had my first margarita ever.  I really hope there is more to them than salt and tequila taste....  The food was average mexican fare, drinks were ok, staff was really cool and the pictures of Frida Kahlo made me go into the bathroom every 5 minutes to make sure I didn't have a uni brow also...  If you are in town and want to pick up some college girls go here because unless it was some anomaly it seemed like every table was filled with young ladies.  And either I am getting really old or young girls are looking much younger than when I was that age.  Nice place, I'd go again."}
{"text":"This tapas style place is quite good! In the end we spent about $25 each for food, We shared the guac to start. Then we ordered a few different tacos, the empanadas and the flautas. Everyone thought the amount of food was just fine. The food tastes great, nothing too greasy and you can appreciate the fresh ingredients with bold flavors. The salsa has a hint of spice but the taste is more complex than just heat. We shared an order of the churros, very tasty deep fried rolls of crispy dough, but I think one churro bite per person is just perfect as they are accompanied by a rich caramel sauce and a fruit based sauce. They have a selection of Mexican beers (bottles) and the margarita was yummy. The prices are reasonable for the tapas experience, we didn't really go for the mains but they had some specials in the menu for 18-25 bucks. The service was swift and efficient and the server was very nice in accommodating individual levels of heat using a 1-10 scale and we felt well taken care of the whole time. I docked one star because I wish there was a greater selection of tapas to choose from, beside the tacos. The place is clean and welcoming.  I would go back any time; in fact, regret not trying the ceviche so I must go back.   There's a green P right next door, which is convenient."}
{"text":"The hostess/waitress was stained with food from head to toe.  The food was not appealing looking and the taste was comparable to the fast food chains.  The aftereffect is what pushed me to write this review as I am now very sick."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: This is going to be my longest review ever. I may hit the character limit (5000, FWIW). There is just so much to say...  I don't even know where to begin. What DIDN'T I eat at Frida's tonight!? I was lured here by the promise of \"the best guacamole in Toronto\" and as an avocado enthusiast, how could I decline?   You're going to hear the words \"worth the trek to Bathurst & Eglinton\" a couple of times in this review, so just accept it: Frida's is worth the trek to Bathurst & Eglinton. In fact, it's right by Eglinton West station and the #63 Ossington bus took me right to it from all the way down on King Street in less than 40 minutes. During rush hour, no less. So just get over to Frida's, like, now.  From the moment we sat down there was food on offer - complimentary housemade tortilla chips with salsa verde and another, hotter dipping sauce were brought out. Next came another surprise, a complimentary offering of a special mini tortilla with fried onion, cheese and salsa on top.   I ordered a glass of white wine raspberry sangria ($9) and it was outstanding. I shan't order sangria again unless it's at Frida's - it was just really, really good and perfectly flavoured.   Next came the famed guacamole ($8), which several people have claimed is \"the best in the city.\" IT'S THE BEST IN THE CITY. It's made fresh to order with avocados, red onions (omitted by request), tomatillos, cilantro and fresh lemon juice and served with arugula and more of those tasty, salty chips on the side. I found myself eating the arugula even though I had no idea I liked arugula in the first place. I just wanted to inhale everything that was presented to me!  Then came the Papadzules Yucatecos ($13) - crumbled poached eggs (possibly quail? A small bird, to be sure), wrapped in corn tortillas with yucatecan tomato sauce, pumpkin seed pipian and green pumpkin seed oil. A mouthful, both in description, size and flavour. These corn tortillas were almost dosa-inspired and quite tasty. Loved the egg and pumpkin flavourings.   As an entree I ordered vegetarianized Tostadas ($18), served with cotija cheese (!!), refrito beans, pico de gallo, housemade sour cream (Dave O: \"they sour their own cream, for god's sake!\") and sliced avocado.  What was most startling was the service. Our server, Derek, was among the most professional, courteous and knowledgeable servers I've ever encountered. He had the enthusiasm of a novice paired with the demeanour and professionalism of a veteran, yet looked quite young, so being the impulsive person that I am, I asked him his age - we had pegged him as being between 24 and 28. Imagine my shock (I gasped) when he told us he was only 20 years old.  TWENTY! And waiting tables like a fucking champ, after only two weeks in the official position, no less. Derek knew the menu inside and out, was very descriptive and forthcoming with details about the menu items. He was attentive even when Frida's got busy with a few large groups, refilling waters, taking plates away, checking in on us, etc. The manager, Brenda, was also very kind and attentive and made sure everything was \"just right.\" It was so nice to hear about the care and detail that goes into the preparation of the food here - I mean quite frankly I can't remember the last time I was able to truly enjoy onion-less guacamole in a restaurant. Usually it's been sitting around for hours to the point that it's taken on a grey-ish hue. I could eat a vat of the guac at Frida's and the only thing (mercifully) stopping me from doing so is the short commute.  We also learned that they serve brunch on Sundays from 10:30-2pm. Took a glance (OK, an ogle) at the menu and saw more huevos, omelette and taco options than I could ever imagine possible.  After all that food, dessert was an impossibility. Whoever said Toronto has no good Mexican food clearly hasn't been to Frida's.  Reservations are recommended. Will be back, pronto."}

{"text":"Despite being able to speak Spanish, I can't really remember the names of anything that I ate. I was too busy swooning to be able to function properly.  Upon arrival, the menu seems a bit sparse and not so vegetarian friendly, but we went down the \"Let's just order a bunch of appetizers\" route and split about four or five. This was a good idea except that all of the appetizers come with the same leafy salad. I personally was into that (the salad dressing has a nice kick!) but my companion was expecting some variety in that department. I ate all the salad.  Before even getting our apps, we got complimentary tortilla strips with two types of mild salsa and some some sort tortilla chip with smokey onions and cilantro (?) on top. As I said, I was too overwhelmed to take note of the names but it was great. And who doesn't like complimentary (free) food?  Our appetizers came out at almost all the same time which is a bit difficult to deal with but, oh, we dealt with it. First up was the guacamole (we got a small) which was bar none. Get the guacamole.  Then came this platter of pan-fried cheese, served with that aforementioned salad, pico de gallo, and soft, small tortillas. This was my favourite but there were only three pieces and I managed to snag just one. It was a daily special and no, I have no idea what type of cheese it was, but it was extremely delicious. It should be on the regular menu.  Both of us got that same leafy salad, but I got tuna and my (com)padre got the cheese. I give the cheese a thumbs down. The tuna was OK, but it did come with minced avocado.  Finally, we ordered this dish that consisted of hardboiled eggs wrapped in tortillas and smothered with pumpkin seed sauce. It looked and sounds not so saboroso but it was. My eyes deceived me so I only got one bite, but that's OK. But as my partner devoured the rest of it, making me say it was probably really good.  After eating all of that (it was a hearty meal but not overwhelming, which was nice) and downing a glass of sangria, I figured the evening was over. Which it was, until someone (not I) asked for the dessert menu.  The churros. Oh, the churros. Get the churros. I rarely ever eat churro-like foods but being that I was already living it up with my second sangria and knew that I wasn't paying for dinner, we went for the dessert platter, which included our choice of churros and a meringue. The meringue came with berries, which was a nice surprise in autumn, but the churros were just unbelievable. And a good tip - the dessert platter is a wise choice because it lets you pick two items and saves $4.  During this whole meal, there was an amazing musical act. Beautiful. Spanish guitar and a jazz singer covering all the well-known South American songs (\"Girl From Ipanema\" and \"Quizás, Quizás, Quizás\") that often were so charming that it got us to stop eating and induge our ears. All five senses were satisfied with the time spent at Frida.   After reading the Yelp reviews, I was determined to make it to Frida and I am so glad I did. Seriously, how could you not want to go here? Did you SEE Kat's review? Anyway, the only way I managed to score a meal here was to take my dad, who was visiting from out of town. He told me to do better in school if I want to afford this lifestyle - our bill came out to over $100. Good thing I had downed two drinks to stay composed, ouch!"}
{"text":"I made reservations here for Mother's Day expecting the restaurant to be busy due to the occasion however, to my surprise it was empty. This made me question wether to eat here yet, we decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did! They had a special menu for Mother's Day which included appetizers , entree and desert for 36.00 dollars. This was a bargain if you ask me. I ordered sopa de frijoles (bean soup) as an appetizer, pollo con mole ( chicken with mole) and churros as a desert. The food was amazing and I'm shocked that this place wasn't busy considering how good the food was and how great and attentive all the staff is . We also ordered a sangria which I've tried in other restaurants and they are usually watered down but this one tasted great! Overall, it was a great experience. Its an upscale version of Mexican food and I love the flavours the chef uses. I will be back ..."}
{"text":"Oui ca fait la job des tacos comme entree avant le souper, local coloré, petit local, limonade servi dans mini verre ..."}
{"text":"Overrated in our opinion.  The bean soup was great but everything else was not good.  The taco meat tasted like propane and was oily.  Mexican lemonade was awesome! Our waiter was great though however will not be back due to taste and quality of food but happy we tried it finally."}
{"text":"Apparently, for want of serious competition in the taco game, the family that runs Cafe Frida on Notre Dame has decided that they are the only people in the city capable of meaningfully competing with themselves.   With the city's best tacos closer to downtown and closer to the metro, everyone wins.   Long live Frida Restaurante!"}
{"text":"Es un buen lugar, muy limpio, excelente comida Deliciosa y una buena música. Excelente lo recomiendo 100%"}
{"text":"We went for late lunch on a Saturday.  Service wasn't bad, but food was underwhelming."}
