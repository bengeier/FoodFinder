{"text":"Decoration: pretty mordern, I actually liked it

Food: not so impressive

Price: $23 for one order of Grilled Chicken Mung and one order of Grilled Chicken Rice Platter, so a little bit above average price

Service: TERRIBLE! The waitresses simply don't know what they were doing. Following are some examples:
1.no greeting what so ever when me and my husband walked in around 3pm (which is not busy time at all) about 7 waitresses are literally lining up behind the bar chatting
2.we wanted to seat ourselves in a booth but realized there were some soup spilled on  the seat, so I asked one of the waitresses over to clean it, her first response was \"why don't you take that seat?\" Pointing at a narrow corner seat
3. Had my order wrong-I ordered rice platter and had grilled chicken mung. (Again, it's not busy hour that we visited.....) although changed after short wait, no apology what so ever.......

Over all, if they don't change the service, I won't step in again. There are so many better choices of Viennese restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Service was very bad and the 1 star is for one of the better waiters 
3 of us went but they gave us 2 pairs of chopsticks and napkins.  Had to ask for spoons in a pho restaurant! 
Every of our dishes were below average ...tasteless, bad presentation and just plain bad! No fresh chiles either.  
Prices are higher than other pho restaurants in the area which makes no sense! Decor is modern but the restaurant looks and feel sparse and lack warmth.
Won't be going back !!!"}
{"text":"To all ppl reading: DONT LISTEN, TRY THIS PLACE!! I really have absolutely no idea why anyone would say anything bad about this place. To all the reviewers below: 

1) it was probably when they were first starting out. Teams are not always perfect. Minor blips occur before everything gets better. 

My experience was absolutely amazing here!  The food = excellent. I've tried pho here, Markham, the esteemed pho mi 99 and this place was definitely comparable if not better! 

The place = extremely clean 
Service = fast 
Presentation = beautiful 

And one of the friends I was with was new to pho. The owner pulled up a chair and literally explained the entire menu, then came over and helped us with our sprouts and other garnishes we could add to the soup and stuff around for any other questions that she had. 

They were utterly amazing and the food was great!!!"}
{"text":"Had the special pho and shrimp fresh spring rolls.  Compared to the big franchise places, this place tasted better for about the same price.  The noodles were not clumped together like the franchised locations, sprouts were steamed which I liked.

I went when it wasn't busy later at night, so service was quick but can't really judge based on being the only customer in there.  I was in and out in under 20 mins (dinning in)."}
{"text":"went with my daughters ask for 1 mi nam vang , 1 pho with no onion , 1 com ga nuong . after waiting 10minutes , bring out with onion in pho ( very bad !! ) , Mi nam vang with no meat at all ...!! unbelievable !!!! chopsticks and spoons are dirty , let one girl knows ,she just changes did not say nothing (very bad services with price higher than the others !! )"}
{"text":"My first time going to Pho Ginger and I was worried that I might be disappointed,  but decided to try it out anyways bc every new joint needs a chance.  I ordered takeout & I got one lg \"Pho Ginger\"special (#101) & Steamed rice with 6 combination (#522) and it came up to $20 which is pretty average now a days.  The man that greeted me once I came in & said please take a seat anywhere.  Then came to offer me a pot of tea, not a glass a pot while I ordered. I handed in my order and paid and not longer than 5mins did my food come to my table all packed and ready to go. I thought, oh boy that was fast and was worried and proceeded home. Got home and opened the takeout right away only to be very surprised that everything looked nice and fresh. My husband was very surprised and happy with his rice dish. He loved the bean curd wrapped shrimp and the steamed egg. It's actually really hard to find a place that makes this anymore, and they made it with everything that's suppose to be in it. My Pho was a little on the salty side, but not bad & portion was huge. Great value for what you paid for! I will definitely come back.  Thanks Pho Ginher for the tasty food and friendly service, which now a days is hard to find. Give this place a try you won't be disappointed.  Oh its very clean!! I thought that was very important to add too, bc i can't stand dirty Pho places"}
{"text":"It's day 2 and we are back. 
They are running around like chickens with no heads .
The wait staff is a bit lost . Restaurant is about 25% full.
We order soft spring rolls and never got them.
The food tasted good .
There's a lot of PHO Places in Mississauga so this doesn't look good for them .
Others where complaining.
Won't go back for a while"}
{"text":"I am very surprised at the low rating Pho Ginger has. There was nothing I wasn't satisfied with.

When we entered, the place was less than a quarter full, which was a shame because it should be full given the quality of food great service they provide.

We were seated with a warm smile and asked immediately what we want to drink. The tea and ice water were served quickly. We all ordered our food and they came to take our orders shortly after closing our menus.

My pho was delicious as always, and the noodles and beef were great. My favourite part is because they dont put MSG, so I never get thirsty! I've been to many pho restaurants, and this is definitely top 3 and its so convenient because its close by to busy areas like square one and heartland. 

If you had a bad time here, please go back and try again! It's soooo good now. Plus the manager is super friendly and provides great and friendly service."}
{"text":"Beware, the bun bo hue is so spicy it will melt your insides and give you the juiciest lips like you just got lip injections. I've forewarned the chef to simmer the spice a bit, but heck it was still good. I saw a gentleman having a coughing fit after his first bite yesturday and ofcourse had to try today to see what the fuss was about. Mi nam vang was also very good, broth was perfectly seasoned and the free spring rolls I got were even better. I rarely order spring rolls anywhere, because I prefer my vietnamese spring rolls made with meat and noodles as opposed to the traditional vegetable ones. They we're made perfectly crispy, not oily at all, hot meaty goodness dipped with the sweet chilli sauce Mmmmm orgasm in mouth. As expected there was an overwhelming amount of people coming in and out, so the service could have been better. They we're very apologetic about it though so I didn't mind. Also, they don't give you enough paper, but that was also a minor detail they quickly fixed."}
{"text":"They upped their game.  Much better than when they first started.   I mean they did have a rough start as any small resto would.  People should give them a try again.  My beef noodle soup was legit!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because of all the negative reviews, however fellow Elite Yelper Kimberley N convinced me to give this place a try.  I was not disappointed.  

DÃ©cor: Very modern.  It felt more like a well designed Thai restaurant than a cheap pho place.  Definitely a plus.  

Service:  The male server was very friendly.  If you go to 88, 89 or 99, the friendliness is limited.  They will point you to a table and then just take your order from the piece of paper, serve your food and not even a word.  Here, the server actually smiled and talked.  I know, this sounds like a bare minimum for a restaurant, but many pho places don't even do that, so I give them points for that.  

Food: I ordered beef stew with egg noodle soup and vegetarian spring rolls.  The spring rolls were piping hot, crispy and fresh.  Probably one of the best spring rolls I've had from a pho place.  In terms of the beef stew, the taste was great.  It had a good amount of noodles, beef and lemongrass flavour with limited MSG.  

Overall, this place seems like a good place to take friends who have a pho craving, but with a bit of extra service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Check out their fantastic mango salad. We stopped in for some Pho. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Came here on a double date.  This is my second time here.

The service was extremely friendly and quick.  Everyone was super polite and came by several times to ask if everything was okay.

The interior is very modern and looks very clean compared to some of the other pho restaurants I've been to.

The prices went down from the first time we went, which is always a plus.  
The food tastes great and has a nice presentation.  I ordered a rice dish with chicken and steamed egg.  The chicken was pretty lean which is a plus for me.  I hate when I order and most of the meat is fatty or inedible.  My husband ordered the pho and the portions were pretty big!

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"With a Pho opening in our local mall, this is an opportunity we couldn't miss (but would not mind if we did). 

Went with two friends - Even with open tables, they made us wait 15 minutes while they were being \"cleaned\". We ordered two bowls of their signature Pho and another of rare beef Pho. Prices are inflated here compared to places like Pho 99, but we let it slide. 

A large is definitely enough, so portion sizes were great. Noodles are not chewy unlike other Pho shops, but no problem with that. Beef balls, rare beef, and tripe were all great, and plenty of garnish. Service was poor - Echoing past comments, it takes a while to be served, and did not give us tea until we asked. 

Overall it's a decent local Pho option, but there are definitely better alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"I think my frequent visits has made me their regular/loyal customer. Today I had the chance to speak to the owner and he told me how they're trying to win back customers and improve their overall rating. He even recognized my review and thanked me for it. He said prices will be reduced by up to 20% which will be a permanent change to compete with other competitors.

Service is still fast and my pho has always been consistent the many times I've visited. One of my #1 faves about Pho Ginger is that they don't use MSG which is more healthy for you. Additionally, you won't get thirsty after leaving.

I really think that the 1 star reviews don't justify this place at all and you should really try them out.

PS: I gave them 5 to average out all the 1 star reviews."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pho Ginger.

I ordered a vermicelli dish with shrimp on a sugarcane, meatballs and grilled pork.  My husband ordered a rice dish with steamed egg, fried egg, pork chop, shredded pork skin and beancurd wrapped shrimp.

We were both very happy with our food. The food arrived hot and was all very tasty. 

The servers were friendly and service was quick. Our empty dishes were removed promptly, which is unusual for Vietnamese restaurants in this area. 

The restaurant was clean, bright and modern. The washrooms were also nicely decorated and clean.

We will definitely return to this restaurant soon."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to try the food this being a new restaurant.

Sadly the restaurant needs to train their staff more in terms of what to do.
There was no cutlery and what we asked for 3X finally came in...

The food came out every 5 -10 mins and the first couple of dishes were not ours!
The server actually asked us to try one of the dishes which we didn't order....no siree!

My house special pho dish finally came out when all my dining mates finished their meals...
I found the soup pretty bland sad to say.
I had to kick it up a couple of notches with the Siracha.

Unfortunately I doubt I will be back..."}
