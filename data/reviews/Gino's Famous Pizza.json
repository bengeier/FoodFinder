{"text":"Good service and a very average slice of pizza. Grabbed two slices to go, pepperoni and a meat lovers. Lots of toppings especially on the meat lovers but flavor was nothing special. Very light on the sauce which didn't have a whole lot of zip to it either. The price was right, the two large slices came to about $6.50 but that doesn't make much difference if the pizza is nothing special. All in all a very generic slice that won't be eaten by me again"}
{"text":"The unfortunate truth of suburban Toronto is that it's dominated by pizza pizza. An establishment which has more flavour in the cardboard of it's box than in it's pizza. However, hidden in places are gems like Ginos. Places where the crust is edeible and the pizza tastes good.  The pizza manages to be both affordable and delicious, the store is take out, but the people are nice enough. Its defintely a good place to get pizza in pickering, and I recommend getting pizza here if you are in the area. Though I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"They have been there since I moved to this town twenty years ago and their quality has always been bang on. The pizza is fabulous but their salads are what makes them better than  other like minded pizza places. A must if you are in the vicinity."}
{"text":"The pizza here is beyond salty. You'll need to take care not to wear nice clothing when entering this establishment due to the grease from the pizzas. It's counter service, a couple of tall stools to sit on if you wish, but clearly designed for take-out. The service is good, but the pizza is too expensive for the quality. I was disappointed. I've tried it a few times because my grandchildren live around the corner. I think I'm finished giving Gino's extra chances."}
{"text":"This place has, hands down, some of the best pizza in town. It's a small take-out place with minimal seating, but that's overlooked by the quality of the pizza."}
{"text":"pizza is average and decent but the service is terrible. Very rude and inconsiderate staff."}
{"text":"I can't give their pizza any more stars than 2. I ordered half cheese and half cheese & pepperoni. It wasn't good. It was coated in grease and very salty. Pizza Nova or Domino's beat this place in flavor and I'm not even a huge fan of those."}
