{"text":"After scouting yelp reviews looking for a good burger place within the single \"$\" criteria in my area, I came upon Michael's Frozen Custard stand. Arguably the name could go either way as a custard/milkshake place, or a burger place---regardless it fails at both. Save yourself, your money, and your time from going here. You don't even get what you pay for.  The reviews said it was good, but I have to argue with a place that sells $6-8 dollar burger combos that seems like they're using patties from a box from walmart (or any standard grocery store). The menu for burgers has a few different choices, basically cheeses, but all are sold with different choices for fries (the one benefit, the cost does include a drink---which makes up maybe 4% for the fact they only give you like 15 fries, shoestring, not steak fries).  The burger itself was overcooked, pretty crispy in parts and was pretty pathetic. The condiments on the burger were very bland and it looked like a very sad burger. I should have known then, but I kept wanting to see something good from this visit.  I ordered a deluxe custard concoction---one of the chocolate/fudge cake ones---and a small, which is probably about 8-10oz is $5.00. REALLY?! FIVE BUCKS FOR SOFT-SERVE AND TOPPINGS? (edit: flavor seems like soft-serve, but I'm told the price is because \"frozen custard\" is more expensive) Guess I feel like one of these I'll use that $5 to buy nearly all the ingredients myself and MAKE 10 of them for the price of 1 here. Mid-sizes are $6 I think and larges are $7---those numbers could be off, by $.50 though. I will say it was good, not great or fantastic, but good. Worth $5 however? NO WAY IN HELL---as again, the ingredients were pretty much from boxes or syrups found at any store.  Also, there are probably 5-8 tables outside, (and they only take orders from outside), and about 3-4 inside. The inside looks like it hasn't been re-viewed since the 60s (or 50s), but is in decent condition. Just looks way too old and is more \"divey\" than \"classy\" or \"old-timey\"  also, they apparently either charge cards (debit/credit) 3% more or you get a 3% discount if you pay cash. I'm never a fan of variable pricing and that is just not classy.  Burger 1.5/5 Ice cream 2.5/5 atmosphere 2/5 card absurdity 1/5 speed of service (after waiting a while to order) 4/5 --- really quick--why? everything's boxed probably so easy preparation. total 2/5 (I'm being generous)  If you want a burger, STAY AWAY If you want a shake/malt/ice cream, use if desperate...dairy queen would be a better choice, and I'm no fan of them either!"}
{"text":"I was there on a hot Sat in June.  They had one clerk and some other guy learning over try to hear the order.  Shouldn't the outside order window be opened.  I order the basket and the clerk specifically asked me for fries, onion rings, and cheez curds.  What I ended up in my basket were onion petals.  These aren't rings( they used to serve rings)but that's not what I got. I got about 10 and they used to serve big portions.  This location didn't have fountain drinks and had the choice of soda in a can. They used to have fountain drinks.Finally, the last thing that made mad as a wet wasp is the prices listed are cash prices. If use a credit card you pay 3% more. A flavor OF THE DAY(fod) is about 3.70 while a whole pint is about 4.99.  You can always get the FOD in a pint so I would go with a whole pint.  Basket are about 5.99 to 6.70 but bring your cash or add 3% to the already absorbent prices."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review with the disclaimer that Michael's is a fast food restaurant that serves fast-food quality food.  So, that being said, I am not really writing this review as if the food here stacks up to a local sit-down place.  The hamburgers, cheese curds, fries and onion rings that I have had here are pretty good on a fast food scale.  The reason that I am giving them 3 stars (which I think is generous for a fast food place) is because they have this promotion where you can get their burger of the month (this is a selection from their regular menu) and fries for $5.  $5 for an ok burger and fries is a pretty good deal.  In addition, service has always been fast and they give my dog treats when we go through the drive through."}
{"text":"Just had the worst tasting greasy cheesburger I have ever had.  Served with about 5 french fries."}
{"text":"Came here because of a tip from gf's cousin. While the custard is pretty good, I've had better at a lot of other places. Will have to take the cousin to some of the other places...  Did like how you can walk through a gate and access the beautiful park behind the shop."}
{"text":"wow, i'm surprised no one's written on michael's yet! this is the place for frozen custard. i can say this because i'll eat there anytime regardless of the fact that i'm lactose intolerant. it's THAT good. especially the turtle sundae. i always ask for extra peanut butter sauce, because O. MY. GOSH. it's delicious.   best in the summer when you can sit outside.   AND it's in an especially safe neighborhood, what with all the street-crossing flags now."}
{"text":"I am reviewing Michael's Frozen Custard, Culver's, Chocolate Shoppe, and Babcock Ice Cream at the Memorial Union. I was a graduate student at UW from 87-89. This is the first time I have been back to Madison since 1989. I actually tried to purchase Michael's in the early 1990's when one of the partners passed away. I did not have the capital required at the time, but would have bought it if I had the money. 25 years after grad school, I came back to visit and do a taste test on the local ice cream places in Madison. My choice was a chocolate malt. Here were the results:  1st Place: Michael's. By far the best, but also the most expensive. Over $6 for an average size malt. They can get away with it based on the local competition. 2nd Place: Chocolate Shoppe (However, I did not have a chocolate malt there, but turtle sundae ice cream. It was delicious). 3rd Place: Memorial Union. Do not get a chocolate malt there. They don't know how to make one. However, tons of people were eating ice cream cones. 4th Place: Culver's. I don't know what this was, but it was not a chocolate malt. Don't go there for chocolate malts. It may have other good items, but I only got the malt.  Note: I did not try Dairy Queen. However, they typically make very good malts.  Happy Eating!!!"}
{"text":"A lactose intolerant person's worst nightmare. My best friend, especially during a breakup.   This custard joint is truly delightful. They have it all: custard, burgers, hot dogs, and cheese curds.   After revisiting that list of food, I'll probably go kayaking on Wingra before indulging as to avoid food guilt. :)   But really, this place is the place to be if you want a good burger or an icy treat. It has a drive-in vibe, with outdoor seating, only basic utensils to gorge on their food, and neon signage. It's great during the warmer months, but you can always use the drive-thru if you're craving comfort food during the colder seasons."}
{"text":"I will go out on a limb in this review, but only later, after some setup.  About all I get here is the chocolate shake and/or the turkey burger.  I prefer their shakes to Culver's slightly, because they are a tad bit less-thick.  I know that contradicts what everyone always wants in a shake, but if your tongue and neck muscles go sore and numb from trying to suck Culver's concrete shake through a straw, it kinda takes the fun out of it.  Maybe I should do tongue exercises?  I won't even try to follow that one up!  Plus, when Culver's shakes melt, they start to get a little foamy, which makes me suspicious.  Michael's shakes are just the right consistency to drink while driving around town.  Their turkey burger is usually decent, and is a good-sized patty.  When properly cooked and put together, it is a tasty alternative to the usual beef patty.  I get the onion petals, which are a cross between fries and onion rings.  Vegetables!  Balanced diet!  Now, for that limb...  I've had really good turkey burgers from Michael's, and I've had turkey burgers that were undercooked and scary and that I ended up throwing out after a couple of gross, slimy bites, fearing for my health.  In both cases, I have observed, without any judgement, that different staff could be associated with different burger outcomes.    In all cases where I was served a well-cooked and well-assembled burger, the staff appeared to be from south-of-the border.  I am given to understand by those in the know that a large percentage of restaurant staff is of Mexican or Central American origin.  I made the assumption, from their distinct Latin appearance and relatively thick accents, that this was the case at Michael's.  Also, in those cases, I observed that the service was quick, efficient, and courteous.  On the other hand, in all cases where I was server a horrible, inedible burger, the associated staff was comprised of teenaged white kids.  In those cases, the service was slow and inattentive, and the kids could barely put down their iPhones to help me as I stood at the order window.  The burgers were haphazardly assembled, and usually of lesser quality generally.  I offer these observations without agenda, and I leave any conclusions for you, Dear Reader, to draw for yourself."}
{"text":"Good, wisconsin-esque experience.  The flavors of the day, mint oreo, then cookie dough, were just ok.  Would go back, unless I found someplace better."}
{"text":"I was looking for frozen yogurt, but tired of driving so my husband and I stopped here for something sweet.  What we ordered turned out to be REALLY sweet!  I'm not sure what my husband ordered, but it was blue.  It tasted good, but he had a hard time finishing the whole thing.  I had a regular ole sundae with hot fudge and frozen custard.  Again, really sweet!  I think next time I will stick to a regular cone and keep it simple...or actually find a froyo place :)"}
{"text":"In Madison I took up running.  Mainly because if I didn't, I would weigh at least double my current weight.  I ate too much cheese (fried cheese curds I miss you, and fresh cheese curds too), too many butter burgers (I love you Culvers), brats, and of course TOO MUCH FROZEN CUSTARD.  For those of you who have somehow missed the amazing delight that is frozen custard, I feel so sorry for you.  Your life is not complete.      On my way home from work, I passed Michael's each day, and always looked with affection.  Most days I checked the website to see what the flavors were, so I knew if I would be pulling in or driving past.  Flavors of the day ranged from Doubleberry, Elephant Trax, Bavarian Thin Mint, Death by Chocolate, Peppermint, Pumpkin, Chocolate & Peanut Butter...the list goes on and on.  Regular flavors are great too.  Frozen Custard is just plain better than any ice cream I have ever had.  It's creamier, thicker, smoother.    At first I thought Michael's was really only about the custard, but then I tried a burger.  It was greasy, juicy, yummy, just how I like them.  And of course, you MUST get the Cherry Soda.  It's SO good.  Go here.  It's so worth a long run or many hours at the gym."}
{"text":"The custard is average, the food is greasy, the place looks like a herd of elephants ran through it.... oh, and the customer service is BAD.  Gets a major \"skip it\" rating from me."}
{"text":"I don't know why I came back to try it again, but I was extremely disappointed with Michael's custard. The flavor wasn't as good as Culver's or even your basic Ben and Jerry's, and they don't even have real cookie dough. The prices are also incredibly expensive for the quality/quantity. I didn't enjoy it, and would recommend you go elsewhere for frozen custard."}
{"text":"Just happened to be walking down the street and stopped for a frozen custard. It was okay, portion size was good, just nothing amazing about it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  I love the interior decoration of this place.  Clean.  Had a really yummy sundae.  A bit pricey though."}
{"text":"Great custard, fresh toppings, overall its amazing. $$$ though. I paid $4 for a chocolate shake and it was not even that big. A cheaper alternative, obviously Culvers. I would still recommend Michaels though."}
{"text":"I've only gotten the custard here, which I found mediocre. Surprisingly, I prefer custard from Culver's! It tastes fine, but is nothing too special."}
{"text":"Amaaaazing! The turtle sundae is my favorite. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Madison WI (currently live in CA) and most of the bad reviews ive read on here about Michaels are from out of towners.  Any true Madisonian knows that Michaels Frozen Custard is the tits.  Its blocks from Camp Randall and downtown Madison, theres tons of shops in the immediate vicinity and Vilas Park is literally right behind the store so its almost impossible to be in the area and NOT enjoy the custard or the food on any given day.  Its custard people, lighten up and as far as im concerned its equal to if not better than Culvers.  Plenty of options and toppings to satisfy whatever taste you may have and the sundaes are awesome as well.  And dont complain about the food, they specialize in ice cream and still the burgers are pretty damn good, a little greasy (and i do mean a little) but thats what makes them so delicious especially with fries/onion rings and a chocolate malt on the side.  Ive been looking in CA for a good burger/shake joint and so far Michaels blows them all out of the water.  Not to mention the cheese curds are great too. They arent claiming to be a gormet custard joint by any means...it is what it is (ice cream, burgers and hot dogs...cant get any better in my opinion) and its still excellent, simple and delicious.  Michaels is a Madison staple that hasnt changed for as long as i can remember (im 22) and thats what makes it great, they still have the trademark red and white umbrellas out front and the inside was remodeled while the exterior has kept its nostalgia.  Take Michaels for what it is, a local staple that has good custard and good food in a nice area...thats really all that needs to be said."}
{"text":"Just not that impressed with the quality, value, or service.  We asked what would be a great option for something with Oreo.  Upon which the woman at the counter reminded us we weren't at Culver's.  Umm yeah...We know.  But now that you reminded us the service and the value and choices are better there, we'll go there instead next time, rather than spending $27 on four  small items at Michael's.  Seriously...It is not worth the hype it gets."}
{"text":"Prices are a little steep but the custard & sundaes are divine! My friend & I both got small speciality sundaes for $6 each. She got the Mississippi Mud, which has coffee grounds in it. The coffee taste isn't overbearing. It also contained Oreos, pecans, and hot fudge with vanilla custard. She really enjoyed it. I had the peanut butter fudge cake. The large chocolate cake pieces really made it for me! The peanut butter sauce was divine along with the hot fudge. Glad I finally got to try Michael's!"}
{"text":"Stick with Culvers!  My family and I stopped by on our way biking around the lake. What a rude and disappointing experience. First of all the staff who waited on us, Andrea was short tempered and not into customer service. We tried to order swirl, but they don't have it, we had to come up with a solution, Andrea just said no. We ordered a cone, small sundae and a can of coke. About $10.00 later, I was grudging given a glass filled about 1/3 full of ice for my not very chilled coke. The custard is ok, but nothing special. Another option would to be to continue on the bike path. In Monona there is an ice cream stop by a park on the lake. We will try that next time."}
{"text":"I struggle with assigning a star rating to Michael's because each piece of the experience was so different, but Yelp says 3-stars is A-OK which seems about right. That could mean \"I guess it was okay,\" which would describe the prices. While portions were large they weren't enormous, and the prices seemed a touch high for outdoor seating and standard food. It could me *shrug* \"okay,\" which might reflect our burgers. Our group tried the California burger, standard cheeseburger, and the turkey burger and while each was perfectly adequate, none were spectacularly flavorful or hearty. It could also mean \"A-OK!\" with a thumbs up and cheese 1960s ad jingle, which would describe our custard. Each of us had a delicious sundae, with true Midwestern custard (not ice cream), which was the purpose of our visit.   The custard was delicious enough that I hesitate over my rating, but in the end Michael's seems like a great pit stop in the middle of your Saturday adventures, but not a prime destination, at least not for a full meal."}
{"text":"The best frozen custard!  It's very smooth and creamy though a bit sweet. Every time I go to Madison, I need to stop here for some creamy frozen treat. The chocolate pecan is my favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped by with the kids one Friday night. Loved the ambiance, custard was just average."}
{"text":"I've been to Verona a few times now and always sing the praises of Michaels.  The burgers and hot dogs are just what you'd expect from a place like this and the custard is outstanding and there are plenty of flavors to choose from. My favorite is the caramel and cashew.  It is a nice place to stop by and just a short walk from my hotel."}
{"text":"I'm feeling sad to write this. This used to be a wonderful spot to grab a hamburger, fries, and ice cream (custard). Today we stopped for hamburgers and fries -- sweet potato fries. Very few customers and a long wait at ca 6:30 and the fries tasted rancid. They were willing to refund us. We did not go for any custard and people still seemed to be enjoying the custard. I hope owners and managers see this and turn this place back to the way it used to be."}
{"text":"A Madison favorite, Michael's serves quality custard with a nice outdoor dining atmosphere. However, their prices are much too expensive for regular visits, especially on a college student's budget. I enjoy using a stop at Michael's as a splurge during a summer afternoon or evening bike around Lake Wingra."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was really looking forward to living near this place.  We came here and got a small chocolate scoop in a cone and a order of 'large family\" fries.  The total was 8.50. When the food came the fries were barely a small, obviously frozen and not tasty.  the cone was small and not worth almost 4 dollars.  The AC was not working on the inside and it was too hot to sit outside.  It was the opposite of a good ice cream night with the family experience.  I will not be coming back.  Java Cat is just a few blocks away and much tastier."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've only been here twice (once at the Monroe location and the second time at the Atwood location) and OMG I'm totally in LOVE with their specialty sundae: Michael's Signature TURTLE with rich, thick, creamy vanilla custard ice cream (I don't think I've ever had custard ice cream before and now no other ice cream can compare well, except for Mitchell's Mango ice cream in SF - sorry I'm digressing here, let me finish with the rest of the TURTLE ingredients..), fresh roasted SALTED pecans, hot fudge and caramel!!!!!!  Sweet, salty, crunchy, creamy, chocolatey, caramely (is that a word?) all create the perfect combination of a sundae, for me at least.  It's absolutely fabulous!  Each time I've had this masterpiece, I've totally zoned out and gone to another world - I'm serious.  I have to say I haven't had any of their burgers, etc.  I may have to give it a try next time and make it a gluttenous affair..  http://www.ilovemichaels.com/speciality_sundaes_2.asp"}
{"text":"I paid $5.58 for a shake--too much.  It tasted good, but next time I'll drive another two minutes to Culvers and save $1.50.  Culvers tastes good too and is also a Wisconsin company."}
{"text":"Good food. Prices for the burgers were excellent! I enjoyed the mushroom and provolone, while my husband had a cheeseburger deal. The burgers were pretty big! The custard was delicious! The inside of the restaurant was clean. Staff was friendly. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Michael's has good custard however the customer service is extremely lacking (at the Whitney Way store anyway). I had such a bad experience that I will never go back.  And, since this is Madison with other great custard choices (like Culver's), I know I won't be missing anything."}
{"text":"The custard is really fantastic - creamy - the best.  The other food, though, is notably disappointing.  I've had a couple of burgers there and they were greasy and half-hearted concoctions.  I also think that the counter staff could be a lot better.  They always seem sullen and taciturn.  In the winter you get the impression that they aren't really even supposed to be open.  That is all a shame, though, because the interior is decent - 50's diner style - and they could surely draw in a very decent off-season crowd if they chose to work on the food and the staff's comportment."}
{"text":"Real good custard, but ULTRA-EXPENSIVE for the servings. An orange float cost 6.29. 6.29! and it isn't that big or tasty. Like I said, though, the custard cannot be beat. Indoor seating is great, and the fries are really good. Good from time to time."}
{"text":"Wow...that's all I can say. I'm from LA so frozen custard is not a food I ever eat. My friends who live in Madison took me here and said I had to try it. I wasn't sure which flavor to try so I just went with their flavor of the day: Strawberries and Creme. It was sooo delicious. The consistency is very very smooth and rich. Almost buttery creamy. I wish I could eat Michael's custard all the time."}
{"text":"Michael's Frozen Custard is ok for custard, although the prices are substantially higher than Culver's and the quality is almost exactly the same.  I do like the concept of doggie ice cream, and Ms. Pooch adores it, but at $3+ for a cup of no-sugar ice cream, it's not exactly going to make its way onto our 'regular treat' listing.  Food's OK, not spectacular, and again, their pricing structure is wacky."}
{"text":"Real Wisconsin Frozen Custard is an excellent treat and this is pretty good as far as WI custard is concerned.  (Not the best in the state, mind you, but good.)   The prices have gone up a little faster than the quality or quantity over the past few years though so, while it is good custard, I don't feel that it is justified UNLESS the flavor of the day is something you just cannot pass-up.   The nearly ubiquitous Culver's also have good frozen custard and flavors of the day... and the prices at Culver's are more reasonable.  (Sorry Michael's, but you charge WAY too much for a simple hot fudge custard sundae!)"}
{"text":"Frozen custard is just another reason why I don't think I can spend the rest of my life in CA - there isn't any here.  I miss it!  Michael's or Culver's, it's just so delicious."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's just that we only went there for the custard, and it was raining.  That's the only way I can understand the multiple 5-star ratings here after our experience. There was standing water in the back half of the rather cramped dining area. I was appalled by the prices, which I had to contort myself to read from the board above the cash register. You can only order huge cones at a very premium price. The cones were total mess - they looked sloppy, and they lived up to their looks. We had custard everywhere. It tasted very good, but the food looked horrible, the prices were pretty high, and the place was kind of gross."}
{"text":"Expensive but Delicious! I like the cherry torte sundae it is my fav :)  Also, it is across the street from the park so you can enjoy some sweet views of the Madison Skyline on a summer day/night!"}
{"text":"If you've never been in a Michael's, the interior is a throwback to nostalgia, with shiny vinyl booths, neon signs, and old coke machine. Retro poster boards adorn throughout reminiscent of good ole times, think Grease era, sharing a fountain soda pop with your sweetheart.  The facade of the happiness projected on the menu boards are lost in the employees. One, which was working frantically to fill the drive-thru order, and the younger, front register employee, who did not seem at all thrilled about being there.  The flavors are listed on a magic eraser board, today was vanilla, chocolate, and flavor of the day, chocolate cherry torte. We ordered two single scoop waffle cones ($4.21 each) of the chocolate and flavor of the day.    I was expecting chocolate custard with cherry pieces for the FOD, but instead it was vanilla custard, with chocolate cake  and maraschino cherry mixed in. It was delightful! Really rich and creamy, and I loved getting chunks of the cake with almost each bite. The chocolate custard was also velvety smooth.  We liked the FOD so much we wanted to take one home. I asked if I could have another single waffle cone of the FOD, but placed in a dish so I could carry it. Instead, they just gave me a plastic cup filled with the custard, no waffle cone. *waaa*"}
{"text":"Okay. Okay. Madison has a lot of ice cream options. But (and I will defend this opinion) Michael's Frozen Custard is the best ice cream you can buy in Madison.   Don't bother ordering anything else off the menu. It's all overpriced and done better in other joints. But if I were queen, I would knight this custard. If I'm ever on death row and they ask me what I wanted for my last meal, it will be this custard. If aliens landed on earth and told me they needed a reason not to incinerate the human race, I would give them this custard.   Yes, it's too expensive, but I had traveled the world and sampled many a frozen treat. This is the best one."}
{"text":"What can I say, I am a huge fan- the consistency, the taste, the fun. My entire family has moved up to Madison in the past several years and Michael's is really a simple pleasure that I look forward to enjoying. They have a nice outdoor area and parking and they are open reasonably late (for Madison, 10pm is crazy!). The best part is that they are now open year 'round and sell pints. I mean, the pint list is insane. Recently, my dad had a stroke and was very depressed. I picked up a few pints of raspberry and he just couldn't get enough. It really cheered him up. My personal favorite is peppermint, which only comes out at holiday time. Michael's saved my Christmas last year when I couldn't find any peppermint ice cream in Chicago. And if you're in the mood for a late night snack, they also have burgers, even turkey burgers. And...even your dog can enjoy Michael's frozen custard...just ask for a \"K9 cup\"--your dog will thank you. =)  The only small complaint I might have is that sometimes the employees are very slow or don't make everything at once so you might have a lot of melting."}
{"text":"We asked for a hot chocolate fudge brownie ice cream and we got a regular chocolate sundae. There was nothing about brownie in there not even chunks and is over priced 5.56 usd when you can get the same at mc donalds for a dollar"}
{"text":"I'm a frozen custard novice, so maybe i'll revise this after I've tried some other places.   We came here at about 9:30 on a Thursday night and it was pretty dead. I think we were expecting a normal ice cream shop kind of atmosphere, with a big case of flavors to look at, so we had a bit of a deer-in-headlights moment when we first walked in, trying to figure out what we were supposed to order. It turns out they only have 3 flavors (vanilla, chocolate, and one other) per day, and most of your choices come from what sort of sundae you get. Once we figured that out, a number of the sundae choices seemed pretty solid. I ended up going with Turtle, and my husband got the Peanut Butter Cup. Both were excellent. The chocolate shell on the PBC was nicely chocolaty, especially for that kind of a product, and I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the pecans for the Turtle. We both had smalls, which were QUITE ample. We also got a K9 custard for our dog, which she appeared to enjoy.   I guess I just have a couple of objections that keep this from being a 4-star place. First, I wish they had more flavors, since I don't always want a sundae (but maybe this is characteristic of frozen custard joints and is not a fair criticism). Second, I think it should be served slightly colder so that it doesn't melt as fast when the hot fudge hits it. Third, I felt that it was a bit overpriced for a fast food-style place. This is especially true of the K9 custard, since we're used to getting something more along the lines of a 79-cent kiddie cone for the dog. We'll probably be back, since its in the neighborhood, but this will not be the last frozen dessert purveyor I visit in Madison."}
{"text":"If you stop eating frozen custard for a while and then go back to it, you  wish you never tried it again.  After a few years frequenting this place, the Oreo malt is the only thing I consider ordering. And that is only if someone I'm with really wants to go and is paying for it. Prices are obscene. All of the food is greasy, bland, and expensive."}
{"text":"Is it worth going to Michael's?  It depends on what you're going for.  The frozen custard is pretty good, at least to my not-originally-from-Wisconsin palate.  Make it into one of the many shakes, and it's hard not to be satisfied.  The only downside is the shakes are somewhat expensive, which means it's more of an occasional treat than a go-to for custard.  But the main food isn't so good.  It's probably why they decided to put frozen custard in the name.  The burgers are rather wimpy, and no better than what you'd get at Wendy's.  The hot dogs aren't bad, but like most hot dogs at restaurants, are expensive for a hot dog.  The cheese curds are comparable to Culver's, which is to say not very good in Madison.  The sweet potato fries are the bright spot on the food side of the menu.  I still get the food occasionally for a quick burger, as I might as well support a local place occasionally, and I prefer it to Culver's and McDonald's.  And if you get the daily $5 special, it's actually a pretty good price, too, especially since that includes the bottled sodas and not just a fountain one.  But the food was tempting me to give it a 2-star review, and it was only the frozen custard and local aspect that earned it three."}
{"text":"W O W !!!!!!!!!!  Everything about this resturant is great. The custard is the best ever, food terrific and the resturant and bathrooms are spotless.  I hear that they pay well above industry average so their employees are happy and do a good job.  It shows."}
{"text":"This place is extremely expensive. I wouldn't recommend the shakes, but the custard is alright. I got the Mississippi mudslide and it was good but not great.   For the price, there really should be more custard/ingredients. It's $6.50+ for a small size of nearly anything. A rootbeer float itself is that price.   I would say that if you're dying for something cool on a hot day, then you can try it. But if there are other options, then try finding something cheaper!"}
{"text":"While Michael's isn't the best custard I've ever had (sorry - my fav isn't in Wisconsin)... it is quite good!  I visited twice in one weekend and had a sundae and also a twister. Both were delicious though I think I might pick a sundae vs the twisters as it was a bit easier to eat...my twister had lots of marshmallow flavor which was nice but the sundae had an entire come covered in m&ms on it!  Service is a bit slow, but friendly and the treats were tasty.   Worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good, but WAY to expensive to justify.  I have to remove one star for that weirdo that dances in their commercials.  Disturbing to say the least."}
{"text":"Go here if you want to deal with rude servers and pay exorbitant prices for food that might be found in the dumpster of the local Juvenile detention center.  The saving grace is that the place has a 50s diner charm and the custard is good.  Seriously tho the burgers are so thin you can see through them, and you need to refinance your mortgage to afford them and the portions are so small its downright comical.  The employees have the charisma of a tree stump. Obviously they don't want to be there and I cant really blame them, but sometimes you need to fake it for the sake of customers.  I blows my mind that anyone could write a favorable review on the food. Seriously? What are you comparing it to? The gas station?"}
{"text":"We're to start...I don't go here for the Custard I go for the burgers....if you wanna take out the family for an amazing meal get the burgers....buy a double with cheese your way and you can split 3 ways ...burger to bun ratio is phenomenal! Hand cut fries and the most amazing onion rings!;) If you like hand formed baked in butter patties ...then this place is for you....and the turkey burgers are life!the best I have ever had... Like ...ever. I get it California style. PS the banana split is enough for four!"}
{"text":"The custard is nice, but little flavor variety. Only 3 flavors. The people working at this place have little patience for the indecisive."}
{"text":"Great for a hot spring/summer day with its outside ( and if you wanted, inside) seating! This was my first time to this establishment and the staff was courteous and helpful - with a relatively simple start with a choice of vanilla or chocolate frozen custard they have many many toppings to lead to many many possibilities and the desire to come back and try another.  Would highly recommend and look forward to coming here again and again."}
{"text":"way over priced for what you get... prices keep creeping up and neighborhood families can't afford the prices ."}
{"text":"After a night eating at the Great Dane Pub and restaurant, I wanted to enrich my sweet tooth by going to Cold Stone Creamery. Being that they had closed at 9pm on a Monday night, I was hard pressed to find a comparable place until my Wisconsin Fitchburg friend recommended Michael's Frozen Yogurt versus Culver's since it was further away on the Beltway. The prices here were kind of high, but I rolled with the punches, as I was on vacation and made the most of it. Michael's Frozen Yogurt is located within a shopping mall, that's pretty much anchored by Great Dane Pub. I believe this shopping mall is called Hatchery Hill, since the main thoroughfare was  Fish Hatchery Road in Verona.  We were here at about 9:30pm and it was relatively empty. There was 2 high school dudes working the counter that night. They looked professional as they waited for us to order. My friend ordered a sundae, whereas her husband had ordered a chocolate malt. I looked at the board and compared a waffle cone versus a take home pint, where you can get more ice cream for the price. And so,  I did just that. I ended up eating the entire carton of chocolate ice cream about an hour later. It was pretty darn good, considering I was carb reloading from my marathon in Kentucky just days ago.  I thought this place was as decent as Cold Stone Creamery, but its not real ice cream, just frozen yogurt posing as ice cream. Still just as good though. The store itself was small, like Baskin Robbins or a TCBY's, with 3 tables for customer seating. They accept cash and credit cards, so I ended up treating my friend and her husband since they got dinner for me at the Great Dane, so it all events out. :-) I would recommend this place to ice cream lovers and those who fantasize about it almost constantly. It's really good, but I wouldn't give up Cold Stone Creamery just yet. Still this place is a top 5 favorite. Plenty of parking here, as we arrived and left close to 10pm. Pretty cool that these shops close at 10pm, so we can have a quick bite before returning home. Overall, it was a good choice to spend my $$, since I was on vacation and needed something sweet. If I was local, I probably wouldn't come here for my ice cream needs.  Support local!  B"}
{"text":"If I lived near here, I would weigh 300 pounds.  My husband wants to bring Michael's to California.  We stop here on our way from the airport.  We spent a significant part of Sunday evening looking for a place to buy Michael's custard (they sell it a Cub's - who knew?).   Anyway,  this location is terrific because in addition to CHERRY SODA (God's gift to Wisconsin, made with \"real Door County cherry juice\"), you can sneak through the parking lot of the bar next door to a great little playground.  Ok, it's not like you're climbing over dumpsters, it's just through the parking lot.  And from there it's a straight shot to the Knickerbocker park (don't know the official name) on Lake Wingra with boat rentals and fishing docks. But back to Michael's.  Brat basket - yum.  Chicago dog - YUM!  Milk shakes - Yum!  Cherry Soda - OMG YUM!  Wait, no sundaes?  Crap, we'll have to stop on our way to the airport.  That will make 3 stops in one week - not counting the time they were closed."}
{"text":"i cannot believe that no one had yelped this place- thank you jaymi and michelle, you are geniuses.   my friends from madison visiting a couple weeks ago told me that michaels is  just as it was when i was there maybe 8 years ago so this review should be accurate. one word sums it up. PERFECTION. they also told me they dont go often, or at least every day, which i would. you would be beyond obese but it would be worth it. i have only had the frozen custard here and being lactose intolerant but in denial makes it a rough experience. there is nothing like this in the world- italian gelati, nopee, argentine ice cream del dios, cant touch this shit.   michaels frozen custard is literally the best taste sensation i have experienced in my life. that is a big statement and im owning it.  it doesnt even matter what flavor you get, its that good. you dont even have to get toppings on it- though i would toss some peanut butter cup chunks on. could be worth the drive to madison alone."}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting something else, so I was some what disappointed. I thought custard was something different then soft serve ice cream. It was good that's why it still got a four star but nothing I couldn't get anywhere."}
{"text":"Michael's is OK.  I'm not a huge fan.  Honestly, I think Culver's is a bit smoother and creamier (yikes!  I said it!).  And Michael's doesn't have whipped cream because they told me \"it makes the custard taste sour\".  Um, let me be the judge of that.  So, to them a sundae means ice cream and hot fudge (or whatever topping) and a cherry.  No whipped cream, nuts are extra.  Sorry, that isn't a sundae."}
{"text":"A freezer full of titles that need to be decoded!  I asked the counter guy the tough questions:   \"What's the difference between bear claw, elephant trax, and badger trax?\"  I can't remember what the difference was other than that elephant trax sounded the best.  I didn't want to risk ending my day with artificial caramel, so chose the chocolate custard with peanut butter cups.  Perhaps a little steep at upwards of $5 per pint, but hey, it's not much more expensive than regular-price Haagen-Dazs or Ben&Jerry's is getting these days, and I think it's at least on par, plus it's freshly made!"}
{"text":"I've probably been here more than I should.  I like greasy, juicy burgers and fries.  I always get the California burger.  And their custard...it's rich and smooth and each spoonful is a little bite of heaven.  To each his own, and you'll just have to see what's on the menu that appeals to you, but I'd guarantee your satisfaction.  If I grew up in Madison, this would be a great high school date...wait, do kids still do that?  I was kind of a dork and it's not likely I'd be with a boy in the backseat of his car.  Still, I do see a lot of couples stop by and grab a seat in the lot on the table under the umbrella--obviously a great place to stop for ice cream coming home from a movie."}
{"text":"Had the small turtle sundae. It is to die for. Everyone in Madison, WI should try the sundaes here at least once. The person helping me was incredibly helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Micheal's for lunch. I grew up in Milwaukee so I'm very used to these types of custard stands (the ones in Milwaukee are far superior, however). I got a Chicago dog and a small order of cheese curds - a meal l expected would be right around $5 - ended up costing me $8.50. I was pretty shocked.  I thought at least the portions would be decent for that price - but no. I was given a little over a dozen cheese curds which were just kind of thrown into the small box. The chicago dog was decent but had way too many ingredients for the bun size and was far from \"authentic.\"   They should really consider lowering their prices or increasing their portions.   Having said that - the service was fast and friendly so no complaints on that end.   I can't speak for the ice cream, but if it's anything like the food, I bet it's pretty expensive too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a couple times a year during the summer for the past twenty years.   The custard is good and nostalgic and the place itself is so cute. It's nice to walk along Monroe then get ice cream and hang out at the park.  The price for a sundae can be steep but the servings are large. Try to finish a small sundae by yourself and you may feel sick so I recommend sharing unless you're really having a craving.  The price for a pint is the same as a small, which is also pretty large, so sometimes I just get a pint and share that.   The custards themselves without any toppings are delicious too which says something.   It seems many people don't like the food but why would you get food at a custard shop?"}
{"text":"Wow - I haven't been to Michael's in awhile. Couldn't believe their prices!  $6.49 for a SMALL malt? Add to that 2 staff, neither of whom were particularly welcoming. Culver's, here I come!"}
{"text":"Thank god Michelle reviewed this place. She's taken me here before and IT RULED but I coudn't remember the name. I wish we had a place like Michael's even half as good in Minneapolis.  Every single time I have frozen custard it tastes like butter and, while some may find that awesome, it happens to make my gag reflex go crazy. The custard at Michael's is pretty much perfect and the root beer is SO good. I don't even like root beer that much but I would drink this stuff every day if I could.  I'm sure I'd love the K-9 custard, too. Who cares, I'm sure it's ten times better than the solid half and half a lot of places are trying to pass off as custard around here."}
{"text":"Amazing custard. Do yourself a favor and try one of their signature sundaes- and trust that a 'small' will be plenty!  I had the turtle Sundae, and it was LOADED with pecans, fudge, and caramel. They do not skimp on the toppings!  Sure, it costs a bit more at $5 for a sundae, but it's worth it as an awesome treat every time I visit Madison."}
{"text":"Michael's has been around forever...I've eaten more sundaes here than I care to admit.  And, without fail, they are good. Every. Single. Time. Yes, they are a bit pricey.  Yes, they may be small for what you get. Yes they are all pretty similar. But darn it. They are so stinkin' good.  Just eat them before they melt, because gosh does custard melt faster than ice cream!!  I have never eaten the \"real\" food at this location - so I can't comment on that. But the sundaes are worth it every time."}
{"text":"Michael's is my favorite dessert-type stop in Madison. You see ice cream, gelato, sorbet, and frozen yogurt all over the place. But frozen custard is a superior breed of dairy goodness.  I never get tired of Michael's custard. They offer many mixes and flavors, and each one can quench your cravings. It's pricier than ice cream, but that's because, again, frozen custard is superior."}
{"text":"The best !  I've been coming here for 25+ years and the quality and service has not changed.  In fact it's gotten better.  Michael's is great on a hot summer day or cold winter night.  The custard is amazing and the perfect layering of toppings make for a yummy treat.  You can go 10 days straight and never have the same dish of custard.  Definitely a must visit when in the Madison area."}
{"text":"This is as good as frozen custard gets, and I've travelled a lot.  I grew up going to school at Edgewood, just up the hill from here.  I have fond memories of frozen custard after playing in the park along the lakeside.  A nice stop to add to this is Pasquel's, right across the street.  Let the frozen custard temper the hot sauce of the it's tex-mex."}
{"text":"Please do not ever go here.  This is a public service announcement.  I do not even know you and I like you too much to suggest this place.  1- Prices?!  Are you kidding me?  $6 for a milkshake?  It was tiny.  Not to mention it was not much of a milkshake.  It was a peanut butter cup shake.  They took some peanut butter cups, crushed them and stirred them into custard with some milk.  I saw the whole process.  It was not very impressive whatsoever.  The flavor was ok.    2 - The food.  I had a chili cheese dog.  This is my standard order when it is available on the menu.  The chili tasted like Hormel.  The hot dog was hot and the chili was warm.  I like that they have shredded cheese on it, rather than liquid cheese.  3 - My dining companion got a burger.  It tasted ok, but it was a very thing patty. He also ordered cheese curds with it.  They were so greasy and lacked any good flavor in the breading.    Overall, we spent nearly $20 there and I was not satisfied with my meal.  Every talks so much about how great the custard is.  Nope.  Not good.  Go to Culver's!  Seriously, for $6 you can get something TWICE the size with more mix-ins.  Better yet?  Get a cone for you AND a friend."}
{"text":"Ahhh, Wisconsin.  The home of cheese, beer, and brats.    If you can't have a good time in a state that specializes in those three things, you need to move to whatever communist country you came from.  Sorry about the communist blast but I am currently in a land where every car is made in the USA, where farms grow corn for fuel rather than food (sorry Africa), and patriotic country music reigns supreme.    I am also in a land where everyone can be seen wearing flip flops, Abercrombie cargo shorts (some muted earth tone color no less), a Hollister tshirt with a USA or AMERICA or HOLLISTER logo (uniquely American apparel proudly brought courtesy of China), and an American Eagle torn hat.  Nothing against it, it just gets a little repetitive.    So after having my fill of brats and PBR tallboys, I decided to round up the troops, and get some of this frozen custard they talk about.    Apparently it's made like ice cream but with eggs and a slightly different process.    However it's made, it's damn good.   On a texture scale, I would put it in between ice cream and gelato.    Poultry."}
{"text":"This review is limited to our experience getting custard here as we got no other food.  The place is a good, typical old frozen custard shack as seen in this region, the custard we had was certainly good but, aside from being limited in flavours it lacked in character and especially texture when compared to all other custard places I've been to like Leon's in Milwaukee, Ted Drewes in St. Louis, or Culver's.  I  particularly put strong emphasis on texture when judging my ice cream or frozen custard and this custard seemed to have a weaker, less creamy texture that was less like what I expect frozen custard to be like.  That said, it was still enjoyable, perhaps because I inherently love frozen custard.  Service also seemed a bit cold and unhelpful, but not actually bad."}
{"text":"The juciest of burgers. A perfect lunch spot after hitting up olbrich garden. Service is quick and delightful. Every item is about 4ish dollars. A single come is 4.73 but was decent size. Burgers are huge and well seasoned. Fries are double battered and perfect. Cheese curds are meh."}
{"text":"I just paid $6.18 for one small scoop of vanilla ice cream with the equivalent of one or two oreos crumbled on it. I really like the food here, but unfortunately it has now priced me out. Fancy gelato shops don't even charge that much. I'm super bummed because I really do like their burgers a lot.  EDIT: It was $5.18. For one small scoop of custard and a crumpled up cookie. Almost the same price as a fully loaded cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Micheals is good stuff. This is excellent custard. Flavorful, smooth, rich. When I judge custard I try to look past the flavors of the day, the novelty sundaes, the toppings, and zero in on the taste and flavor of plain ol' vanilla. If the vanilla is good, then the custard is good. Micheals' has excellent vanilla. Micheals is, therefore, excellent custard."}
{"text":"Not sure about the food but the Frozem Custard is great!!! Good Old Fashion atmosphere. I would like to see them chanfe the music from country to more ole time rock . They have a wide variety of sundaes to choose from . We went with  the strawberry  cheese cake and the banna split. Both were excellent. Also got a strawberry shake which i realy liked. You can sure tell the difference in taste from your normal ice cream shops. This custurd has a much more richer taste."}
{"text":"Despite the quality of their custard, Michael's is the worst place in the neighborhood for an after-diner treat. It's like all the polite kids went to work at Culver's and Michael's landed their surly peers. Beyond the poor quality of service, there are only three flavors at any given time, they don't have whipped cream for sundaes (whaaaa?), and the prices are preposterous. More than $6 for a root beer float? Forget about it!"}
{"text":"Delicious frozen custard and great outdoor atmosphere! Two spoons up!"}
{"text":"First of all, how has no one reviewed Michael's yet?  They have the best everything!  The best frozen yogurt, certainly the best fried cheese curds EVER, and the best root beer.  Michael's is open kind of later than you might expect, and has a nice patio to sit outside in the summer.  They now offer K-9 custard, so you can bring your dog too!    My cat likes ice cream, I wonder if K-9 custard could be good for felines?"}
{"text":"Being from out of state, I'm not a custard expert.  However, even an idiot knows that this place is good after just one taste.  I enjoyed the black forest flavor of the day.  Creamy chocolate and cherries.  Make sure to walk through the back parking lot, through the grassy area and down to the lake to enjoy your treat."}
{"text":"Michael's is a little on the pricey side for ice cream, but their stuff is so. good! Shakes, sundaes, etc.- it's all great. They even have cheese curds. My dog likes the doggie ice cream, which is peanut butter flavored and comes in a little plastic cup with a lid."}
{"text":"Love this place.  He has multiple locations around madison and Monona.... give him your business.  You will be coming back for more!  Pumpkin shakes for fall are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is sort of a cute wayside ice cream stand but the food is less than average and the ice cream is ok.  I haven't been there in over 10 years.  what does that say?"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good, local to the Grandview area, take out burger. We heard a rumor that Michaels had some good stuff, so we hopped in the drive thru and spun the wheel of chance.  Winner winner chicken dinner(or burger dinner)!  Excellent, tasty burger and bun. We ordered a bacon cheese burger and the mushroom/Swiss burger. Both burgers were juicy. The bacon was not crispy enough for me but my friend was good with it. The mushrooms and fried onions were excellent and plentiful.  The burger buns were very good, better than most. Not the least expensive burgers but well worth the price. Oh and they have great onion rings... very thin and the batter does not fall off when you take a bite.  Recommendation: go often!!!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I am a native of Madison and have been a lifelong lover of Michael's since it opened in 1986.  Let me also state that my rating is partly a protest vote against the asinine dance music that is incessantly  blared at the Monroe St. location.  The music has become so annoying I am struggling to bring myself to enjoy stopping by any longer.  I've asked the employees why it's played and I'm told \"it's the owner's iPod\" and that the employees basically can't do anything about it.    That said, let's get to business: Michael's is Madison's local independent custard joint.  It's been around since the 1980s and has a solid history in the Monroe Street neighborhood where this location is located.  As far as frozen custard goes, Michael's is pretty good but it's just not what it once was.  Even I have to admit that rapidly expanding, yet Wisconsin based Culver's offers better custard today.  I've returned to Madison from Los Angeles for a couple weeks every summer for about 10 years and Michael's has gradually lost a lot of its appeal.  The Custard:  It's not as creamy as it once was but the real problem is that the flavors are losing creativity and failing to come together as they once did.  Case in point: my wife's Mint Chip had no chips tonight while another patron's was overflowing with chocolate chips.  The quality control is not there.  The texture is lacking the creaminess so important in good custard.  And the flavors rarely have fresh berries - a sign that the custard is just not made fresh like it once was.    The employees were once local teenagers, usually West High Students or Edgewood High students that looked like they were having fun and engaging the customers.  Today, employees are disengaged and give you the impression they're just going through the motions.  They do the job...but that's it.    The store itself is reasonably clean but it's the details that count.  The fluorescent lights are covered in bugs and spider webs, the parking lot is deteriorating, and the store basically needs some investment (bathrooms, lighting, landscaping etc...)  This takes me to my final point: the Music.  It drives my totally crazy.  Why is a Frozen Custard stand in Madison Wisconsin that is covered in kitschy 1950'sesque décor blaring club music every time I go there (this has been a constant for several years now)?  If the custard was perfect and the customer service impeccable, fine, I'll live with it.  But Michael's is a restaurant that has disengaged ownership and functions as a conveyor belt of cash to the owner's pocket.  It's the worst kind of independent retail: retail that doesn't care about customers because they'll keep coming back.  In the end it's sad to admit as a proud Madisonian that my Milwaukee friends are correct:  Kopp's is better.  Oh how I miss what you once were Michael's Frozen Custard."}
{"text":"I had Death By Chocolate.  Now I am dead and loving it."}
{"text":"First of all, this is not the original location... that's why you see so few reviews here on the Atwood store. However, they still have the cute umbrellas and the luscious custard we all love. Stopped in to get a fix and killed two birds with one stone -- delicious frozen custard sundaes and hot fried cheese curds. Could it get any better? Only if you made the entry way and the outdoor tables more accessible for friends and family in wheelchairs, and your servers a little friendlier and better. We sat outside in the sunshine and watched everybody drive by and stare back at us jealously."}
{"text":"I still contend that Michael's is a tad overpriced but on a warm summer night, this spot can't be beat.  Order at the window and eat at one of the tables or walk to nearby Lake Wingra to take in the scenery."}
{"text":"I could give them a five star for taste, but the price is just terrible. Their frozen yogurt is just so good. Sometimes their burgers are on the dry side. They definitely have the best fried cheese curds around. Any time I have a craving this is the place I go to."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago but it dawned on me the other day that after almost ten years in Wisconsin I am getting a bit too comfortable in these frozen climes.  I'm practically married to a local girl, I have a ton of favorite Wisconsin institutions, and I'm pretty well established at a job for a Milwaukee company.  None of these things concerned me though.  What really left me wondering if I need to make a run for the border was when I was sitting eating custard at Michael's in Madison and thinking that I could easily make a list of five places off the top of my head with better custard.  How scary is that?  A custard connoisseur.  I disgust myself.  BUT I DIGRESS.  Michael's is not very good.  The burgers, while being billed as \"BIG\", are hardly that.  The buns are certainly huge.  The burgers are standard size.  The fries are weak and not very good.  The service, as someone else said, are bored and apathetic high-school kids.  And it isn't cheap.  I've had a ton of good casual dining experiences in Madison but we won't be back to Michaels."}
{"text":"I was so sad when my kid's size vanilla frozen custard was gone. I scraped the bowl to get every drop of tasty the nectar. It was absolutely amazing. It was unlike anything I've ever had. It tasted something like soft serve ice cream, but richer with more of an 'egg'/'custard' taste (go figure! ha!).   If only I had bought a larger cup... But with the prices, I don't know if I could have afforded anything bigger!"}
{"text":"a little pricey but its delicious.  i really like their coffee oreo shake."}
{"text":"A nice location down the road from Olbrich with a convenient drive-thru, but so pricy. I had a custard craving after visiting Olbrich's GLEAM show and got a scoop of chocolate malt custard via the drive-thru. It was tasty and the scoop was a good size, but it was over $4 for one scoop in a dish. Yikes. If the price came down a bit I'd be more likely to frequent it, but there are plenty of ice cream choices in this town and if I'm not right there I'm going to head for something with a better value."}
{"text":"I think they might have run out of salt while I was there. Both the burger and the fries were terribly under seasoned and bland. Certainly not worth the $6 that I paid. Also my malt didn't have nearly enough malt powder in it, but that may just be a matter of personal preference.  Other than that, the burger had a really great sear, with lots of crispy bits, and the old-timey theme was cute.  I think my boyfriend and I might return just to try the custard, but doubt we will be getting any more food."}
{"text":"Tried to get into Culver's but the dining room, drive-through and parking lot were jammed.  2 people in Michael's, no cars in drive-through.  Ice cream was hard, sundae otherwise great.  Hot food is of very low quality, and ridiculously expensive.  Service prompt, impersonal."}
{"text":"This is the most unprofessional business I have ever encountered. My daughter worked there for 2 weeks, was given 2 immediate pay raises, and a week later was threatened with termination by her manager Sergio because she made a mistake. Not only did he threaten her, he told her that Michael supported his treatment of her. The training she received lasted an hour and this was her first job, so mistakes were bound to happen and then learned from.   Sergio texted my daughter after he threatened her, a picture of the weekly schedule showing that she had 0 hours scheduled for the week. My daughter then called him to confirm that it was not a mistake and he yelled at her and subsequently hung up the phone. He yelled and hung up the phone on a teenage employee. She has never been officially fired from Michael's. No one ever contacted her. She has gone in to pick up her paycheck and no one addressed it.  I am utterly shocked that this type of behavior and unprofessionalism is allowed. Teenagers who work at this type of establishment should not endure harassment and mistreatment at the hands of their bosses. This is outrageous."}
{"text":"Each trip home I need, need to stop by here  for the requisite small turtle sundae: its melty eggshell-white frozen custard, hot fudge, caramel, a pile of pecans and cherry on top makes my day. Or my year.   Take a pint to-go, too. I'm currently dreaming about their pumpkin custard. Mmm."}
{"text":"This might be the best use of fat since the invention of bacon."}
{"text":"Cheddar burger, check. Vanilla shake, check. Food coma, double check!!! This place is old school burgers, fries and shakes; and they are good at what they do!"}
{"text":"It's a fun little place to be on a sunny day. The custard is good and you can take it over to WIngra park and doubly enjoy it. Ate a hot dog there once, ONCE, and it was pretty bad.  All in all, not such a bad place to be on a summer's day..."}
{"text":"What the &$@?? $6 for con??? And extra $1 fro \"sprinkles\"?? And the machine show $8.75 when the total bill is over $16???? ( so the kid explain me: \"it was without tax\"..... Oh my god - lucky you I visit with my grandson so I couldn't just slam the door in your face"}
{"text":"After a good workout, a friend and I had the \"hangries\".  We wanted something quick but good....and being almost 9p on a Friday, there weren't a lot of options outside of fast food or pizza.  I have some odd dietary restrictions so I wasn't expecting much from Michael's.  I ordered the California burger (without cheese, mayo and a bun) and sweet potato fries (I was ecstatic about that option).  Not only did the young guy at the counter hardly flinch when I ordered, but he humored me when he called out my ridiculous order in front of everyone waiting. I'm sure, like most people, he wasn't excited about working a Friday night but he didn't lose his sense of humor.   Taking food to-go is always a gamble as well.  Michael's did a great job packing the food so it wasn't spilling everywhere or soggy by the time I made it home.  My burger and fries were fantastic, good portions.  My friend had the bacon cheeseburger, fries and chili dog and loved it as well.    Thank you Michael's!"}
{"text":"Blech! Stick with the custard. The chicken sandwich I had and the bacon cheeseburger my husband had were very expensive and so bland. The burger was probably frozen from Woodmans and was $6! I won't go into detail about my grilled chicken so as not to lose it."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. I paid just about $21 for a burger basket, an order of cheese curds, bottled water, and two custard cones. Not even worth the price!!!!Culvers would have been a better option. the food was ok, but I suppose the custard was good."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight 5/18/2017 at 6:45pm to get some dinner for my daughter and I.  Bacon cheeseburger $7.50 three-piece chicken tenders $3.89.  I ask for fries with both.  Pull up to pay and the bill is $18.79!  What.  I asked for receipt but conveniently, I wasn't given in itemized receipt.  There were 19 fires with the burger and 24 with the tenders.  $7.40 for 43 French fires?  That's $0.17 a fry.  What a rip off.  I will never eat here again.  Either they are charging almost 20 cents a fry or the staff at the Atwood store is ripping of customers.  NEVER EAT HERE."}
{"text":"My newest obsession.  The custard here is amazing.  It's smooth and creamy and full of flavor.  Despite the fact that you are eating custard, it doesn't taste of cream or is buttery like some other custards I've had.  It tastes of the flavor that you're eating--whether it be chocolate, coffee, or peanut butter.  Check out the flavor of the day, or grab a sundae or float.  I've only had the root beer float with vanilla custard, but I've heard great things about the cherry float.  Another thing that I like about Michael's is that they have pints of some of their past flavors of the day in the store, unlike some other custard places.  So if you couldn't make it to the restaurant when Red Raspberry was the flavor of the day, you could come back a few days later and pick up a pint.  Very nice.  The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 are the non-custard items on the menu--the burgers and hot dogs.  They aren't the best in quality.  Yes, they're probably made from fresh ingredients, but it seemed like my mushroom swiss burger wasn't made on the spot--it was probably warmed up.  Plus they're overpriced for what you get.  So I recommend that you grab something to eat at Crema Cafe or Monty's, both on Atwood/Monona, and then finish your meal with some sumpremo custard at Michael's."}
{"text":"Try to get the custard right as it's coming out of the machines. Get the vanilla. Plain. With maybe a few pecans or cashews. I worked there in high school and gained 10 pounds per month drinking sprinkles on rainy days with my buddy Jessie in the walk in cooler. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Cute little diner with vintage feel and charming outdoor seating. Delicious custard and a decent burger and onion rings. Nothing fancy.  Wonderful after a nice day hiking around."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for custard after dinner.  I was looking for something a little lighter so got the paradise sundae with pineapple bananas and coconut. Fresh and tasty, custard was thick and creamy.  Service was fast and polite. Will be back!"}
{"text":"In Madison to watch some club soccer at the park down the road. Skipped breakfast and needed to fill my belly with some lip lickin food that comes fast.   Michael's looked like a gimmick, but was the closest place I could find. They're going for a 50s nostalgia drive-thru and for the most part it works! I recommend going inside to also taste the retro ambiance.   Food? Happy to report significantly better than your average fast food joint. My bacon cheeseburger was dripping with just off the grill grease. It's a quality burger with fresh veggies to boot. And you won't find fries like this even at a sitdown restaurant. Holy delicious.  Next time I'll try the shake."}
{"text":"The custards and shakes are mediocre and have nothing that sets it apart from other dessert places. The custard tastes like soft serve ice creams in fast food chain, as it is missing the eggy taste. This really affects the taste and experience in their sundaes. The shakes are good and better than the custards in my opinion. Despite all this, I can see this place as a nice hangout place during summer time. They have a nice patio with chairs for people to enjoy the nice weather with some frozen desserts."}
{"text":"Very pricey, but good.  Not worth the price, unless for a special occasion.  I like that they are local, but have not had the greatest service.  Also, the K9 Custard should be on the menu and not just on the sliding glass door when you already order.  Good to check out once, but not often."}
{"text":"Yes, we Wisconsinites love ice cream! Even when it's 4° out! They have a lot of choices for take home pints. Just ask for their list before ordering. I didn't count the number of choices, but the list seemed to have about 50 choices on it. They will describe the ingredients for some of their creations, if needed. You can tell them what kinds of things that you normally like and they will help you select a flavor also. They sell their pints as 'Buy 2 get 1 free'. Got to love that deal! It was $10.95 for three pints. It's super affordable to get adventurous with your flavors. They have a lot of burger deals for $6 too! We didn't get one, but we saw a few of them come out of the kitchen and they looked delish! They have a walk up counter for summer time and some nice seating outside when the weather is nice. Some tables inside are great when the weather is raining, too hot or too cold. It's located in a nice walkable area of Monroe Street. A great excuse to run an errand and treat yourself to a dessert afterwards."}
{"text":"For all the hype, Michael's is quite a disappointment.   Maybe it's because I didn't try the custard. But seriously, I didn't need more weighing down in this weather...so I ordered an orange crush float instead. For something that would have cost me MAYBE 50cents to make at home, I paid close to $5 for a 12oz cup. That is ridiculous. In general, I think their prices are pretty steep for what you get....you'd probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck...  Like RB, I also had an issue with the service. It was slow, disorganized, and not very friendly. The line was almost out the door, but the employees behind the counter didn't even ATTEMPT to speed up the service. One of them just disappeared into a back room. tsktsk. I also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed, and then had to UNcrumple the paper so she could re-read the order to her coworker.   Anyway, I will probably give the Monroe St. Michael's - and their custards/burgers - a shot, but I'm not going to get my hopes up."}
{"text":"Go for the custard, and if you are doing drive through and want the flavor of the day, be sure to ask for it fresh. I was sure Culver's just down the way would drive a stake through Michael's when it opened a few years back, but it hasn't happened. For those of us who like the real thing, that's something to be happy about.  I've been happy with their veggie burgers and can't complain about the food over all. Drive in kinda food..."}
{"text":"Scratch-made food you order at the counter in a kitchy, retro venue that is great for families and couples alike. The burgers and malts are filling and delicious so if that's all you're looking for, then you're good to go. It's a cute place for lunch or dessert but don't expect old school, smiley service or other \"classic\" dining experiences that might make it feel more memorable."}
{"text":"These places are scattered across the city. I've driven by them for years. Much to my regret now.   This place is is top quality. I had the vanilla with marshmallow cream. Sound bland? Well you would be wrong. It was extremely rich and flavorful. Top quality. Stop.by and get some soon regardless of the weather."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the sundaes here.  The custard is tasty and the toppings are plentiful.  My favorite sundae is the Muddy Banana.  Vanilla Custard, Hot Fudge, chocolate cookie crumbles, and banana slices.  Yummy.  The staff is usually friendly and quick.   I tend to park and walk in versus drive thru so I can watch it get made.  Plus driving with a drippy cone or dish is never fun so I just eat it there whenever possible.  This location has a good parking lot and a fun interior.  It also is a bit bigger than the other Michael's locations around town.  The prices are a bit high but it should be an occasional treat."}
{"text":"Culver's is better than Michael's.  I know that Michael's is local, which is nice, but it's just the truth that both the food and the custard is better at Culver's.  As other reviewers have noticed, prices are absurd.  $3.69 for a small custard in a dish.  I also wish that they had more toppings available than three.  As for the frozen custard, it is good, but not as good as the custard I've had at other places.  It really tastes more like ice cream than creamy frozen custard.  The food (basically cheeseburger, hot dog, onion rings, fries, cheesecurds) is also kind of meh.  I'll choose Culver's over Michael's nearly any time--the only advantage Michael's has is that it's nice to sit outside at the Monroe location."}
{"text":"This was our first visit.  It was overpriced,  understaffed and the tables outside were sticky."}
{"text":"Ordered burgers and fries for me and spouse, sundaes for the kids.  They provided the sundaes right away.  15 minutes pass, no sign of our burgers and fries.  I ask at the window: no one has started the order, no one knows who plans to cook the order, no one appears to care about filling the order.  Everyone shrugs, seems confused and disinterested in selling us food.  So, I ask for a refund, which was provided.  I suggested to the teen worker that, \"This is typically the point in the transaction where you apologize for having ruined my experience/botched my order/ and at least apologize.\"  I got another shrug.  Very bizarre - they lost about $20 due to not feeling like turning on the grill.  The one plus was that the hyper-sexual disco lyrics were quiet this day, so I didn't have to explain any of the double-entendres to my kids.  So, there's that."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided it was such a nice day that we would enjoy some time outside the house. We stopped by here just on a whim to get some burgers and ice cream. I would say the burgers were good, not great but definitely a little pricey for what you get. During the week they have a special where your fries are included with your burger. My husband just had the regular cheeseburger and I had the Hawaiian one (I can't remember the name). Mine was definitely good, I had never had a burger like that before. We got just a strawberry shake because we seriously couldn't justify spending more money in ice cream than burger and fries. The shake was good and had decent sized chunks of strawberries in it."}
{"text":"Couple of weeks ago I was in for a custard with my family. It was a busy night. We saw the manager speaking very harshly to one of the teen employees right by the counter. I felt it was VERY inappropriate for a family style diner to be disciplining the kids right in front of the crowd of people. I think I'll hit up Culver's from here on out not the fun family night I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Over priced. Take a drive to Betty's in mineral point. Shakes for under 2 bucks...like you're in the 60's."}
{"text":"Didn't Michael's used to be good?  I remember going to the Michael's in Verona, years ago when I was still in high school.  There was nothing better than gorging on malts and burgers on Friday nights in the summer.  I remember them being glorious, greasy shrines to all that is good and pure in the world.  I hadn't been to a Michael's in years--partially because I had moved out of the area for some time, and partially because there are none in close proximity to my home.  However, the other day I happened to be near the Atwood Ave. one at lunch time and figured I'd go for the nostalgia and try to relive my youth for a few paltry seconds.  To say I'm disappointed is an understatement.    First, the place was nearly empty at 11:30am.  There was one other couple eating when I went in, but even the drive-thru was quiet.  That should have been my first warning.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  It took a reasonable amount of time for the burger to get to me, but it was seriously lackluster.  It was a cheap, thin, frozen patty and some wilted lettuce and a bland tomato.  The bacon was okay, but there wasn't enough of it.  The cheese was some processed crap.  The fries were equally frozen pieces of bland, tasteless crap.  After my first bite, I wondered if I could ask for my money back.  It was so far from what I remembered from my teenage years that it continuing to eat the burger was essentially throwing my happy memories into the toilet.  I hate to make a fuss, so I didn't.  I powered through and finished.    I know why Culver's is the tried-and-true home for decent burgers and malts.  Unless something changes, I think I'm done with Michael's."}
{"text":"We came here to eat late at night when all the power in the neighborhood went out because of a storm and somehow this part of town didnt get effected. As a reminder, this is my first time at a Michael's Frozen Custard. I was not at all impressed by the food or the dessert. The burger was greasy and much smaller and wimpier compared to the pictures. The custard was nothing out of the ordinary. The one star here is for the shake that my boyfriend got. I took a sip of it and it was delicious. I would not come to this place again simply because for the price I paid for it, it was not worth it. If i want to pay this high price, i expect better burgers and ice cream, especially if this is their specialty."}
{"text":"I love Michael's; their food makes me nostalgic and gives me memories of small town diners, but it is definitely overpriced. I think something like Culver's is probably equally good but the personality inside Michael's is vintage and cool. However, be prepared to spend a pretty penny on ice cream (usually over 6 dollars). I would definitely go more often if the prices were more realistic. The hamburgers are also pretty good and not as crazy in price, but the average person would probably be just as happy at Culver's. I do love their decor and all their options for ice cream, so for me once in awhile it's  worth the cost."}
{"text":"Excellent turtle sundae. A favorite place to go with kids. You can get the ice cream and walk to the Wingra small park for kids behind it."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. This Michael's location is great because in addition to its great flavors (be sure to check the flavor of the day ahead of time) and wonderful sundaes (a little pricey, but they're large and have a variety of seriously good toppings), you can wander around with your custard at the lake front at Lake Wingra. Outdoor seating near the store is great, but if the bees find you, I recommend taking your delicious goodies to sit at the picnic benches in Wingra Park ;)"}
{"text":"I am not a local resident, but I've heard of frozen custard from Wisconsin. As soon as I landed at the Dane County Airport, I was in search for this. To my surprise, I couldn't find many places, I was mainly finding regular ice cream shops and not FROZEN CUSTARD. I was finally recommended by a local to try this place. I had their chocolate frozen custard...amazing! I've been to a few ice cream shops and this was probably the best one. The flavors are basic (vanilla and chocolate) compared to Babcock Hall Dairy (University of WI) and Chocolate Shoppe (Downtown Madison), but Michael's frozen custards are much more creamy, thick, and rich in flavor."}
