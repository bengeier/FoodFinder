{"text":"Came here because I wanted a space to work and I was not willing to wait or work in the din of the Chatime on St Catherines. This place is just a block or so away and it has more seating, and a much more relaxed environment. 

I got fresh black tea with grass jelly. The flavours were strong but they are more similar to a Hong Kong black tea. I feel like the grass jelly isn't as sweet as chatime but still had great texture. The staff were nice and there were enough people to serve the number of people in the cafe. There is also wifi and it's quiet enough to do some work on a weekend afternoon. I would definitely come back to sample a few more of their bubble teas (I didn't get bubbles so I can't comment on those yet). 

tip - they have a buy 5 get one free card you can get. it's a pretty decent loyalty program considering other places are buy 10 get 1."}
{"text":"Not enough tables but the drinks were good. My friends and I went on a Wednesday night. We ordered the bubble tea with grass jelly (8/10), the mango yogurt drink (7.4/10) the red bean pudding milk tea (9/10). It was (quote from Amy) - \"a perfect blend of honey and milkyness\". You know how sometimes you just crave some bubble tea to satisfy the Asian girl inside you? ABS does just this. The orange and white interior is soothing yet stimulating like  watching the lion king while juggling chainsaws. You just feel so relaxed by the warm ambiance yet strangely excited."}
{"text":"I've tried the chrysanthemum tea with cranberry and was surprised to find that it makes for a good combination. The chrysanthemum wasn't overpowered by the cranberry although it is the more dominant flavor. For $4.4 (reg size) I thought it was pretty good. I also tried the siji tea with blueberry and black current. It includes bubbles already and has some blueberries and a slice of orange in it. I enjoyed this one too but it's overpriced and I couldn't really taste the tea although I could tell it wasn't 100% juice either. They have some other creative tea flavor combinations that I'm curious to try.

It's a small place with only a couple of tables. They appear to sweeten their teas with honey and you can choose your level of ice and sweetness but I think you have to tell them the level explicitly as the person serving may not ask and assume regular for both. If you don't have one be sure to ask for a free loyalty card (they don't always ask you if you have one). Buy 5 drinks and get 1 free. In spite of their less than creative name and that ABS makes me think of car brakes instead of drinks, I will return here when I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"We came on January 1st at around 4pm

The drinks were really diluted.
Asked them to redo it and they just added some sugar and tea in it. They didn't even replace the plastic film
The employees seemed like they didn't care about being there. 
They shorted us on tapioca pearls because they didn't feel like doing more of them
It wasn't my first visit but it will be my last
Threw away my free drink that I got for buying 5 bbtea"}
{"text":"Went in here to grab a drink and have some sit down time. The bubble tea isn't all that great. I've had much better ones. The staff is really nice though. And the every time someone walks in and out the door, there'll be this pretty annoying voice that says something lol."}
{"text":"I heard they use actual tea instead of powder(which is what chatime does), but the flavor is a bit too less. Also heard the fruit tea are good. Will try that next time"}
{"text":"I really like their home specialty fruit tea!!!! Imbibing a lot of different tropical fruits inside of good tea, the recipe to make this fruit tea is simply heavenly! Just don't put any ice so that they can give you the maximum of fruit and tea. It is very refreshing and savoury! The shop itself is a bit hidden despite being in downtown on he busiest street (St-Catherine). It is much less known than Nos Th√©s or Chatime that are located quite close to A Breuvage Shop. There are only three tables and the decor is very simple. I find that it lacks good vibes, but the drinks are really nice."}
