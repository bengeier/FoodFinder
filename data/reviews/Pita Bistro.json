{"text":"This establishment was a real find on a Saturday afternoon looking for something new. The staff was very courteous, the selection varied, and the food was great.  The \"raw juices\" was a nice add to menu. Hummus was particularly good. You can build your own gyro with a lot of choices to make it to your particular taste.
Try this place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation. ..was really disappointed.  The pita was thin and cold. The portion discrepancy others have mentioned is very real. Mine was easily half the size of the woman in front me . Same dish. The hummus bowl. 

There are too many excellent fresh Mediterranean places in the metro area to have such terrible pita and inconsistencies. 

Definitely won't go again"}
{"text":"Up until today, I would have recommended anyone to Pita Bistro. I use to come at least once a week. But, I paid 10.81 for a bowl that has significantly less food than the food I paid for last week. This establishment cited a decision to use more economically friendly products. Even if this is true, it is entirely unacceptable to cut portions by ¾ in a matter of 6 weeks while charging the same prices. That's right! This establishment used the ole supply vs. demand switch-a-roo coupled with a marketing technique to create a larger profit. So my decision is clear. I will limit my visits as in a direct result of the company limiting its portions. See ya next quarter! ***BIG SIGHS***!

~~~~~Update~~~~~~~~~~
Believe it or not the bowl was with a request for extra chicken shawerma. And I believe I should update this review further because I don't believe that business decision was right.This response was provided to the business owner.

Thank you for your response Nas G. Unfortunately, my views are the same. Also, I am pretty sure the bowls are not the same size. Today, one of the crew workers had to smash the veggies just to add the protein for a person that was ahead of me. That did not include the pita bread which had to be added to the side. In the older bowls it was added in without an issue.  I can go to chipotle and get the same amount of food for $6.95, not $10.81. I am not impressed with the changes, rather disappointed."}
{"text":"TLDR Pita Bistro Catering is GREAT

Pita Bistro rules in general, but I also wanted to add that their catering performed absolutely perfectly at our wedding. The contact at PB was very responsive and helpful, the food arrived on-time with excellent quality, and we received nothing but compliments from our guests."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and I must say, I'm definitely coming back. I had their Chicken Shawerma Wrap, the chicken was very fresh and so were the veggies. I mostly loved that I can see and choose what I wanted on my wrap from the salad bar. The staff was very friendly and with a positive attitude . It's a very clean place to sit and have lunch with friends. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Where could I start ! This place is amazing! The food and customer service is excellent. I love going here, everything is always fresh ! The kicking kabob is my favorite. I will definitely recommend this to friends, co-workers and family members."}
{"text":"a great concept, fresh tasting, and one of the healthier options if you pick your entrée right."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED my experience here. I ordered the fattoush salad and the falafal bowl so I could try both. I appreciated the layout here because you can customize your food as much as you want. After I stopped eating meat, I realized how difficult it is to find good meals that you don't cook yourself. Well, now I've found my mediterranean fix!
Not only was the hommus amazing (they had 4 different flavors), but they also have fried pita chips! I thought every aspect was on point, from entering the restaurant (super nice decor and clean) to presentation and taste. 
They also serve fresh juices which I also love because they are a magnitude more healthy and nutritious than store bought juices and of course, sodas. 
Please don't change, Pita Bistro! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, wonderful customer service, and a great atmosphere. Try the hummus bowl with chicken."}
{"text":"So, let me start by saying that the food was actually pretty good. If not for the terrible customer service and complete lack of interest on the part of the staff in finding a solution, I'd gladly return. It really is a shame. I came in with my young children, who love Mediterranean food, just not all mixed up together. I personally don't think it's unreasonable to ask for food that tends to run into each other to be on the side, or at least separated. However, if you want anything on the side, they quickly inform you \"that will be an additional $2.99.\"  I'm sorry, but that's just ridiculous. My kids won't eat it if it's all mixed together and the staff just piles everything in a bowl. They don't even have plates to space things out. Very disappointing, because the food itself was actually good and I'd otherwise want to return."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences in take out! Both employees had wonderful demeanors and were helpful in getting us exactly what we wanted, allowed us to sample things, etc. And the food was without question an amazing Pita wrap! 10/10 would recommend to anyone. Restrooms were clean, and restaurant was clean. Got greeted with a smile immediately upon entering. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a great Chipotle-Style GREEK FOOD. I love this place. Very very good food. Delicious. Great Service!!!"}
{"text":"Love dining here! Great food, atmosphere and staff! I love creating my own salad bowl and it's definitely a great portion! Their chicken schwarma pitas are awesome! Don't forget the pita bistro dip it's a must!! Can't wait for my husband to bring me in again!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last week.  Happy that a healthier place is now an option for me! I thought the food was great and my meal kept me full all afternoon.  I had the Mediterranean Chopped Salad with chicken.  The only tiny complaint I would have would be the music.  It's way too loud and not a genre that would appeal to everyone.  So, lunch meetings or relaxing lunches might be a little difficult here.  But, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place really surprised me. I was looking on Yelp for something different around my work that I could run and grab. There was also a check in off Yelp for a free side hummus with order. Looked at the menu, called it in. Ordered a chicken shawarma. Got back to work. The free hummus was probably about 3-4 ounces but the bad of pita chips to go with it was like a small brown lunch bag size. I thought to myself, hope that's the size only for the free size and they don't actually charge for that. Way too much chip for the hummus amount. The shawarma was great. I would order this again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I'm in Phoenix,  itsy to eat here. Food always fresh and staff is so nice!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place a few days ago, since I love Mediterranean food and I saw this place got good reviews. I definitely wasn't impressed. 
Their menu is very vague and since I had never been here before I found it difficult to place my order since it didn't really describe what I was ordering that well. Regardless, I ordered one of the hummus bowls. The workers seemed unorganized and kind of impatient. I ended up feeling like I was ordering at a Chipotle, even though I ordered a pre-made hummus bowl (In other words, I expected them to know what I wanted in it because it was a pre-made option..). Just found it strange.
The food was not great. I LOVE hummus but the Jalepeno-cilantro hummus that came with my order was almost tasteless. The chicken was extremely tough. The pita bread was cold and very chewy. It was also an odd mixture if you ask me... A bed of hummus with some rice and veggies and chicken thrown on top. Wasn't really what I was expecting and it didn't fill me up. 
Also, when it came time for me to pay I tried to pay with my debit card and the lady at the register said it didn't accept my card because it only had $15 left on it (my total order came out to more than that). So I handed her my credit card instead. Came home to realize that they had charged both my debit AND credit cards. Not too happy about that. 
Needless to say, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved the food, I am vegan, tried veggie combo bowl, added extra veggies liked it..filling too..Wil go again.."}
{"text":"I love this place. Think Chipolte but Mediterranean. Very healthy, Enormous portions (Usually I make a Hummus bowl last for 2 meals), fresh, appealing presentation, charming staff. At abt $9 what a deal!!!I wish there were more of these in PHX, now that I don't work near their airport/Cotton Center location I miss it terribly"}
{"text":"Clean,. Very friendly staff and professional service, willing to please the customer, Food was fresh and delicious. Went with 6 of my friends. We all loved it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Nice variety that you could definitely make a more healthier choice for food to eat out. Tasty too! Quite packed at noon."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food! The Tabbouleh is legit. Decently priced and friendly staff. I will be back to try their fresh fruit smoothies."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try place after seeing the recent one star review but so glad we tried it. There was nothing lacking in flavor with the Chicken Shawerma Wrap. The bread is in fact fresh and authentic. So glad a co-worker recommended this place and it's right across the street from our building. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"AMAZING food! I loved that I got to customize my bowl exactly how I wanted it. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Everything tastes fresh and delicious. The PB sauce is a must! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix area on vacation and stumbled across this cool venue. Best falafel and delicious chicken as well! Cool concept and very clean. Will definitely come back every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"By far the best Mediterranean food in the area. Serving size is enough for two meals. Price is great. Fast food pricing for healthy delicious food. Meat is fresh and cooked daily. Hummus is incredible. Chicken is spiced to perfection. Gyro is the freshest in town. The serving set up is identical to chipotle. Atmosphere is very comfortable and clean. There will be a full service bar very soon. If you need a quick meal and don't want fattening fried food this is the place for you. Most fast food pita joints are dingy and smell. This place is most certainly deserving of a five star review."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I'm SO glad I saw the sign on the road a few weeks after they opened as I \"quit\" chipotle and hadn't been in this parking lot for a while....I'm glad I tried it out as I tell everyone about this place! Food is always DELISH and employees are always super nice! I love stopping in here as its healthy and great flavors! Best spot around the area as quality of food by far superior."}
{"text":"Food: the pita is bland and halfway stale.  It is much chewier and tougher than a pita should be.  The tomato, pickle, sauce is fine.  The gyro meat is okay, although they really push the chicken schwarma, so maybe it's better

Service:   Slow, disorganized. There are 6-7 people working at once, but only one register.  So, while you have all sorts of people wandering around back there, there's only one very slow guy working the register.  I was asked three times \"chicken schwarma?\" and three times replied \"no, gyro pita please\".   Watching your sandwich sit there as employees ask each other \"who made this one?\"  just write on the wrapper what it is, so they're not always asking each other or assuming everything is a chicken schwarma.  

If you want a better gyro pita (that comes with fries) go to Cranberry Hills.  It's cheaper, faster and better



The food is decent, the service is slow.  You have to tell them repeatedly what you ordered, which is annoying.  They have about 7 people working at once, but only one register so you get to watch your pita sitting there getting cold and soggy while the guy tries to figure out how to ring people up.   It's basically like Subway.  Bring back Qdoba!"}
{"text":"This place is like a Mediterranean Chipotle. The food was just not good. The cucumber/tomato mixture for the salad was mushy, like it was made too far in advance and with mealy tomatoes. The pita chips were greasy. The chicken was bland. I watched them pour this faux nacho cheese (the kind you get at sporting events concession stands) over an order of \"nachos.\" Despite being asked repeatedly for \"just a little\" tahini, the worker poured on so much that it was dripping out of the paper the wrap was wrapped in. Nothing tasted fresh. 

Go to Pita Jungle instead. You'll pay about the same, but you'll enjoy much better food and you won't have to bus your own table."}
{"text":"Love love love this new addition by our office, everything tastes so fresh and yummy. They can get pretty busy at lunch with long lines but they're pretty quick. I create my own bowl with roasted red pepper hummus, veggies and either falafel or chicken depending on my mood. And they have a rewards program for free soda or food."}
{"text":"I keep trying this place, as it's one of the few places near my office to grab a quick veggie/vegan lunch. The complete chaos was an initial turn off (employees always seem totally confused and disorganized), and on another occasion I had asked for an extra salad option with the falafel bowl and was informed the kid making the food was in training and needed to learn the correct way to make the food... I did get the ingredients I requested in the end, but that was a really strange interaction. The final straw was today, when I came in and ordered a build your own wrap and whatever ingredient (likely the mixed greens or tabbouleh, though it could have been the lentils) was filled with sand. The grit was in every bite, it was disgusting, and I ended up throwing the food away. The produce is obviously not being properly washed. I tried to like this place no less than 6 times, and every time I have been disappointed. Come on guys!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp while traveling from Tucson to Phoenix.  It was a line concept for Mediterranean style food, and it worked smoothly.  I liked both the regular and jalapeno hummus.  I ordered a chicken kebab bowl, and I built it on rice with almost everything they offered...beets, kalamata olives, tabouli, pickles, cucumbers, tomatoes and taziki sauce.  The team was pleasant, and I would go back in if in the area."}
{"text":"After a long day of work I was starving. Pita Bistro was on the way & decided to give it a try. I ordered a hummus bowl and a steak wrap. 
As I was ready to pay- I didn't have my wallet!
I freaked out and walked outside to look at my car... I was deeply embarrassed and worried...
As I was walking back to apologize and let them know I did not have my wallet Diane & Steph said that it was ok  this time it was on them!

Not only did the food smell & tasted good, The staff is kind & generous!

I'll definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"The long line was totally worth the wait. The service was great, the place was brightly lit and clean and the food is good!  The only thing I would change or request would be a half sizable. This is too much food for lunch for me. Other than that I have zero complaints!"}
{"text":"This place is just bland.  I work next door and have tried it a few times.  There is just zero flavor in the food.  I also like how it suggest fresh baked pita on the website then they basically pull out a 'wrap' out of a plastic bag, pretty much a tortilla.  Also why do they have a create your own, and then a few 'pre-built wraps' at the same price, however if you try to make it easy and get a 'pre-built wrap' then ask for one extra ingredient they try to charge you for it.  The place sucks really, probably will not try them again.  My coworkers agree.  I don't see the place lasting long.  They keep giving me free hummus w/ chips.  Tried all flavors, ended up throwing it away every single time.

This is for the central ave location.  If you read the other location reviews, many people mention it being bland also.  I was excited for this place to open, but it really sucks.  Also why is the sign hanging out front upside down for the past month?"}
{"text":"Food was just okay.  Not a lot of flavor, have had better chicken schawarma pitas elsewhere. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I work in a business complex nearby and come here for lunch from time to time. To keep it short and sweet, the food is pretty tasty (and plentiful. They definitely aren't stingy with their servings). The salad is my favorite thing there; that sucker is beastly. You can stretch that thing out to cover two meals. And I'm a pretty beefy fella so that says a lot.

I only wish their hummus was a little more flavorful. But besides that, the place is legit."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Everything on the menu is amazing and very fresh, awesome atmosphere as well. It's basically like a Greek version of chipotle, I wish there was a location in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"the raw juice isn't raw juice. they use orange juice concentrate out the jug. that's not raw juicing. if you can't use fresh oranges,stop advertising raw juicing. it's misleading. you lost a customer."}
{"text":"Mediterranean version of Chipotle. Hummus bowls and gyros are amazing. Be prepared to wait about 10-15 minutes in line during lunch hour. The one drawback: this is the only location. Hopefully they franchise elsewhere in phoenix!"}
{"text":"Love the food- chicken schwarma wrap and side of hummus did the trick for me. The hummus is fresh and delicious, chicken grilled to perfection. Seriously only knocked off a star because the hours confuse me. There's a big \"BAR\" neon in the window but you close at 8p during the week and 7p on Saturday? Odd. But again, food is really good if you can get there when they're open!"}
{"text":"I've only been a few times but will be coming back a lot! Great menu variety and food is well priced for how much you get. It's kinda slow being new which is awesome because chipotle next door takes forever and rips you off for more meat or guac. Theres a good rewards program too. Pita Bistro is my new pit stop meal"}
{"text":"Best lunch place ever!  The food is fresh, service is fast.  Reasonably priced, my favorite lunch spot.  I wish they deliver!  It's too hot in the summer to drive out and pick up lunch especially the parking lot is always busy."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here I ordered the chicken shawarma bowl... all I can say is WOW, you have to give it a try.. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre for a Mediterranean place, but the customer service is absolutely horrible.

I came during dinner and they barely had anything prepared which was frustrating since I brought a big party with me. A similar situation occurred during a previous visit, but not to this extent.

Imagine going to chipotle and having to wait 25 minutes during dinner time to make chicken. In addition the employees didn't offer any pita bread with our bowls which added to the frustration. And when we did get the pita it was very stale. 

I was very surprised and disappointed by my last and final experience because they weren't even busy! I live very close but wouldn't ever come back."}
{"text":"Fresh. Delicious. The grilled chicken is on point! Lentils cooked perfectly and the tabouli is good!"}
{"text":"After 6 months of not visiting here, I went back 2 weeks ago and again last week. It seems to have improved. They rearranged their food preparation area so that they can speed through the lines faster. The food is very tasty. The staff has been nice and friendly. Prices are a tad high, but overall the place is good."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck in a cool vibe. Excellent bowls, create your own. Tabouli was gr8! Loved the Sriracha hummus & fresh healthy juices with ginger and cucumber. Happy hour a plus. Everyone who works there was very nice, polite and accommodating. I spoke with owner and made sure to tell him. Here on business but will be back when in town. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Saw this place from the outside on my way to a training for work and knew immediately I would have to try the food and raw juice bar!! Went with the girls for lunch that day and we absolutely fell in love!! The food was amazingly delicious and we couldn't stop raving about every bite we took! On top of that we were able to customize a raw juice which I loved the idea of and the taste even more! Let's just say we were hooked from the beginning and went back for lunch everyday and for juices on breaks from the training.
It wasn't only the food and juice that brought us back..we were drawn instantly to the charisma of Nas and Sam and the attention they had to the atmosphere and attention to detail for their customers! I love the feeling of the place and you can tell that they live to a philosophy and not only to making money! I will be visiting as often as possible, even after the end of my training..they have made me a loyal customer"}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. Falafel was delish and I like that they had some good vegetarian options. 

I had a few little snafus with my order but the staff were apologetic and super attentive to help correct the problem. Inside its clean and cute - I'll come back next time I'm around."}
{"text":"Pita Bistro is, if nothing else, a great deal for the dollar.  This is a fast-food Mediterranean joint with a full bar, serving customizable salads, wraps, and bowls.  The quality of ingredients is mediocre but the portions are hearty and the taste is not bad.  There are plenty of people working behind the counter so expect to be served quickly."}
{"text":"Greek salad with gyro meat was delicious! Would definitely return. Great choices all around."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quick Mediterranean restaurant. Every thing is made daily in house made with fresh ingredients! Pita chips are to die for. Staff is so friendly, fast, and informative of variations in menu. Very reasonably priced with ongoing specials! Love this place."}
{"text":"The food is so fantastic and the customer service is phenomenal. The staff was even kind enough to let us try all of the hummus' for free while we waited on our food. If you love falafel too, theirs is the best I've had in years. 

Having dietary needs can be extremely difficult as well, but every question I had was answered fully and the kitchen is open to view. I am vegan and deathly allergic to fish, but have never come across any issues eating here and all vegan items are clearly marked on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious ! They will let you sample anything as well. I loved that! Clean fresh tasting food that taste great. Prices are very reasonable for the amount you get. My picky kids loved it too."}
{"text":"Love this casual pita place! Fresh food, good portions, and great customer service! Awesome addition to Midtown area! Ive already been twice and I know it's going to be my new go to lunch/dinner place."}
{"text":"Great spot. Whenever I don't bring my lunch to work, I usually come here. The rice and lentils are cooked well, the meat is great and the salads are delicious. 

My only reasons for giving 4 stars instead of 5-- feels like every employee gives drastically different portions when I get a bowl. Some people give two full scoops of hummus, others don't. So it's hard to gauge how much I'm getting, proportions, etc. 

Also... I hate to be that guy but I'd love some nutrition facts. I can kind of gauge it but as someone who is somewhat health conscious I'd like to know just how many calories I'm consuming when I feast on a big hummus bowl."}
{"text":"I love the hummus bowls at Pita Bistro. I do the build your own with chicken and load it up with veggies. They always put a ton of hummus in the bowl and plenty of the veggies I pick. They have regular or whole wheat pita bread to top it off with.
I usually can't eat the entire thing in one serving and end up saving some for later. It's a great value for your money.

This place has a huge lunch rush so get there early if you can. The line does move quickly though. If you come in the evening it's very rarely busy.

I love having a healthy and yummy lunch option near my office!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here today. I didn't know what to have for lunch and decided to give this a try with a co-worker and let me just tell you that if you love hummus and all the mediterranean options this is the place to be. At first it was a little confusing to order but the girls were really helpful and I was able to get everything I wanted in my bowl. The set up is like a chipotle and you basically ask for all the add ons you want on your dish. I would definitely recommend it and would say that the flavors of everything I ordered were on point. I can't wait to be around the area again and have some delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, good price, great staff. The consistency of the quality of the food is very good, which is one of the most important aspects for a restaurant."}
{"text":"For a fast food joint this place is pretty awesome. The attitude of the service was very indifferent and not very friendly, hence the lack of a star, otherwise the food is great.
 I made a chicken bowl and added the hummus, crisps, and garlic sauce... Portion was very good, I ended up with a second meal.
Loved the crisps, and the hummus was amazingly fresh with great flavor"}
{"text":"I tried this place because I wanted something different and healthier than the usual options. Needless to say my tastebuds thanked my \"self\" for making that decision and taking the plunge. The wait in line was longer than what it took for me to devour that chicken shawarma wrap! The chicken was juicy and well done, the hummus had an extraordinary taste, and the pita chips where crispy and golden! I added feta cheese to my wrap and then dipped it in hummus. I'm sure that made the experience more memorable. I'll definitely be back. I work right down the street."}
{"text":"Such fresh ingredients for such a bargain, you can build your own bowl with as many ingredients as you want. The hummus and chicken kabob are amazing."}
{"text":"They recently catered a wedding that I helped coordinate. The food was delicious and plentiful. It was delivered on time and set up beautifully. The guests loved every bite! Can't wait to work with them again!"}
{"text":"So I went in there today looking for something light. I opted for just hummus and chips. I chose the $3.99 size of Cilantro and Jalapeno Hummus. Was I in for a shock. GROSS!!! I could have used this stuff to lube a car. It was oozing with what tasted like cooking oil, and not fresh cooking oil. The worst thing is that the label did not even indicate that oil was an ingredient."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was so glad I did!  It was really busy, but I had no problem finding a seat.  I hate the comparison to Chipotle because I really can't stand Chipotle, but it is that kind of assembly line that enables you to get exactly what you want.

I had the hummus bowl with the siracha and jalapeno ciliantro hummus, salad, tablouleh, cucumber tomato salad, olives, feta, and more.  For $7.95, it was more than enough and was fresh and delicious!  I didn't try any PB sauce, or any other sauce.  

The pita is thin, but I didn't mind that and thought it was really good.  As far as portion discrepancy, I saw that it does depend on the person making the bowl, but I am not afraid to ask for more if I feel I'm not getting what I want.  They didn't give me any grief about it and gave me more.  No problem.

I definitely recommend this place and will come back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food and ambience is really good here. This was my first stop to eat here in Arizona and it was a wise choice and only a 3 minute walk from my hotel."}
{"text":"Overdue, Cold, Tasteless and DISSAPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!  This is a joke for a delivery.  Greek Fries were in a covered container that steamed them to death then they cooled down to be delivered at room temp and soggy.  My Gyro Pita Wrap was awful as well - ice cold, pita wrap had never  been heated up and had pickles on it?????????????????

Take this one off my list"}
{"text":"First time here and I will be coming in regularly now! Had the Chicken Shawerma and it was amazing. Wrap was fantastic. Chicken expertly seasoned.  Fresh ingredients!! \"Fast\" food that's yummy and good for you. The portions are huge. I could enjoy 2 meals for one low price."}
{"text":"Very good. First time here. I got a gyro. I like the concept. Kind of like chipotle for Mediterranean food. The gyro I got was huge as well. Lots of meat and toppings. Well worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great place! The food was fresh and very tasty. I got the chicken bowl, and it was a great mix of flavor. One unexpected thing was that they have a layer of hummus on the bottom that complimented the overall flavor very well. I would gladly eat here any day of the week."}
{"text":"Wow! Food was great and customer service was even better. Definitely somewhere I will be coming back to and recommending to anyone who enjoys fantastic Mediterranean food and even better service. Not one employee didn't have a smile on their face. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Changing back to A-OK.  In my opinion, three stars is really not a BAD review, so no need for the owner to respond.  I understand how busy they get, but I just am really over the rushed feeling I get.  99% of the time, I don't get everything I want.  Either the person making my food is 20 feet ahead of me waiting for me to yell over people in line, or there's some jerk behind me in line pushing forward because his server is skipping past my server!  Even when I get there as early as 10:30am like I did last week, I still felt rushed by the server with NO LINE!  Today, I was literally asked what toppings I wanted when I was still 10 feet away from the toppings!  I've been there before, but I'd love to look at them all and pick them, not just guess the ones I do remember!  Slow down!  I don't care about the line.  By the time I got to the register there was a giant stack of bowls and wraps and people waiting to pay in a big clump, it amazed me that the cashier was able to keep it all organized.  Kudos to her.

The food is good, if you're not easily frustrated like I am, you'll really enjoy yourself.  I just wish they'd be sure each customer is happy, instead of just getting through as fast as possible."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Being from Detroit I have yet to find a place in AZ that truly has Mediterranean cuisine that I am accustom to! Many have tried and failed but pita Bistro has come and conquered! In the 3 weeks it's been open I've been here twice and tried something different, I was impressed each time! As a vegetarian I have options and combinations for days, and I plan on trying them all! Amazing! I am a Pita Bistro Fan! See you guys next week!"}
{"text":"I work in Park Central so I was very happy to see a new place opening up in the old Qdoba space. This is my second visit and I'm pleasantly surprised. My favorite thing so far has been the Greek Fries. Today I asked for meat and lettuce on top of the fries and although the staff was hesitant on how to do this and told me I couldn't do it again without an okay from the owner, they did it and it was delicious with gyro meat and tzazitiki sauce. Please find a way for me to order this again without causing any issues. Well worth the money and I'm happy to have you. 
 

Any hopes of adding baklava to the menu?"}
{"text":"Friend introduced me to pita bistro.  Really good!  Yelp, I love the deal you have for free chips and hummus with purchase of a wrap.  I had the chicken shawarma with pickles, toms, lentils, and lettuce.  I loved it!  This would be a regular spot for me if I still lived in Phx.  It's bomb!  Liked the TVs too- oh and there is even a small bar here....price is really great too.  Fresh brewed tea, pita wrap, chips and hummus for 9 bucks.  Beat dhat."}
{"text":"Busy lunch time place. They take the orders quickly, and are friendly even if they are busy. Fun, modern upbeat décor.  The bathroom area is fun with the communal sink. Got food to go, and was very pleased with the tabouli salad w/ chicken, and my guy had the Greek salad w/gyro meat... I was told it was a big hit. Nice healthy food options if you want. Would come back if in the area no question. Also very impressed with the staff that wore \"in training \" badges. ...they didn't buckle under the crowd and we're super friendly. Well, run place it seems."}
{"text":"Super super tasty. Went there and Juan helped with my order. He was very nice and decent. The food looked great and tasted even better. I got a gyros salad and my free hummus as well. The place was very clean and has a cool interior design.i will be back."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot! Everything they have is delicious, but my favorites are the Mediterranean Chop salad, gyro, and Greek fries. The staff is always super friendly too! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for months now and feel the same way today as I felt when they first opened... I STILL LOVE IT! 

Food: I've read a complaint about the bowl size change, have to DISAGREE. The amount of food today is the same as before, just changed the bowl type and I actually like the new ones more. And UNLIKE chipotle you can add anything that can fit onto your bowl without the up charge, at chipotle there's a fee for the extras and a bowl ends up costing $10-$11! Food tastes fresh and the flavor is on point! 

Service: the staff here gets a 5 star rating from me. Very kind and friendly, and no matter how long th line is they always seem to maintain a quick flow and get you your food fast. 

Environment:  really nice, modern & cozy feel. Good music playing. And really clean. 

I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"This place was ok not crazy in love with it...when i got there is was pretty dead empty, i got the kickin' k bob bowl, when it got to the chicken part i can tell the chicken has been sitting in the warmer for a little while so i was not surprised that the chicken had gotten dry.. the cilantro jalapeño hummus was really good...the flavors were overall ok i would honestly have to try it again kinda like a second chance... but overall the workers were nice and friendly did a good job... will be back for a second try.."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for making the chicken kabobs juicy and delicious! Your cilantro jalapeño hummus has a good flavor, not too spicy, and I love that your portions are well worth the price. Thank you for a clean and cheerful environment as well!"}
{"text":"We tried this new place last Friday since it had pretty good reviews and we were happy we did! Great service, lots of GF and vegetarian choices, it was clean and bright, had awesome patio space, and the food was not only outstanding, but the portions were huge for the price. Will go back for sure! Great find!"}
{"text":"Fast, tasty, healthy, real food. Wish there were more places like this. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I grabbed lunch to go here today and I can't think of anything negative to say. The staff were friendly, the food was fresh, portions were generous and price was reasonable. The only reason I may not go here again is because Hummus Xpress is just down the street and seems to have a wider variety of authentic Mediterranean options."}
{"text":"Good choice Mediterranean food, I like their  chicken kebob it is grilled to perfection. If you want a Chipotle styled Mediterranean food, this is the place"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is out of this world and the quality is consistently perfect. The employees are extremely nice and cheerful. This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix. They are really fast even during lunch hour."}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty except for one guest.  All the tables and floors were filthy. With three employees that were visible from the counter you'd think one could sweep or wipe a table or two. 
The food was tasty but employees unsure of the ingredients. The hummus and pita dip seemed likely added with fat -- perhaps heavy vegetable oil. My husband and I both had stomach aches shortly after our meal. We asked for nutritional breakdown which they do not have.  We won't return."}
{"text":"Food was okay but the staff was not customer friendly or helpful.  Had to repeatedly ask for items clearly listed on the menu included in meals. Also, zero options for kids. I don't think a single worker flashed a smile either... strange vibe in this joint -  It's a meh for food and thumbs down for customer experience so not going back."}
{"text":"Originally, I was going to Chipotle, but saw this place and thought I'd try it. Great fresh food and a friendly staff. I will definately come again. I got the Chicken Schewarma Wrap."}
{"text":"Incredible! Huge value for what you pay and flavors are amazing.  Will go here as much as other places that become routine and more healthy eating.  Staff was very attentive and listened to what customers were asking for.  Go here!"}
{"text":"Nice little surprise. Found this place while shopping at REI.  Healthy alternative to pizza, sandwiches and tacos.  Had the kickin kabob bowl. Very flavorful.  Got to customize my bowl with everything I wanted.  Good sized portion at a great price.  You won't walk out hungry.  Great place!  I recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered one of the pita bowls.  The veggies and lentils are quite flavorful.  The chicken kabob is a tad dry, but the cubed chicken had enough moisture.  Great pickled flavor in the beets.  Overall,  great fresh and healthy taste."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, and while it's a decent atmosphere and pretty good food (can you screw up hummus and veggies?), the service is meh. Typically 17 year old types. The kid who made my hummus bowl today was fine, but was suuuuper slow placing 4 slices of tomato and 7 cubes of beets on... Come on dude, speed it up and load it up!"}
{"text":"So good!!! I order on UberEATS and am never disappointed. The ingredients taste fresh and yummy. Great healthy take out option."}
{"text":"A tasty alternative. Wish they did sides, would have been nice. The Kickin-K-Bob was really good. The pricing was average."}
{"text":"The chicken is excellent and the rice is well made. Nice modern ambiance. Appreciate the healthy juices available too. Excellent place for any one looking for a healthy option near the airport."}
{"text":"Omg really good food but what takes the cake is the softcore porn music that plays unbearably loud during your lunch"}
{"text":"Quick and easy lunch spot to get what you need and get out. The Jalapeño hummus was my favorite and definitely not too spicy!"}
{"text":"They have yummy food and let you customize your meal with whatever you like. The hummus was very smooth and the vegetables and salads were nice and fresh. I added brown rice and lentils to my bowl which were both quite tasty.

The one negative I can think of is the ordering process. It seemed a bit more cluttered and confusing than it needed to be, but in the end the quality of the food left me feeling positive about this restaurant.

Overall I'd say that Pita Bistro is worth a try!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was very happy I stopped.  Its kind of like Chipotle in that you order while you go down the line adding the items you want. You can add anything for the same price.  I tried a wrap with rice and lentils, hummus, chickpeas, tabouli, cucumbers and chicken, it was huge and I could only eat half but it was very good. They have fresh juices as well.  Ill be back for sure"}
{"text":"I would give them 6 more stars if yelp would allow it! Pita Bistro catered a wedding rehearsal dinner for my family last week! The restaurant staff was very very attentive, and went out of their way to add extra decorations and garnish! Pricing by far beat any local restaurant in the valley!! We ordered gyro, chicken kabobs, salads, and hummus the potions sizes were filling for all of the guests and the staff even packaged it up nicely so that we were able to warm it in the oven the next day!! THANK YOU PITA BISTRO!"}
{"text":"Once again never disappointed by the food or service!! The staff is friendly and energetic!!! It's been a while since I have had the PB dip it is super addicting!! The food is always delicious and fresh!! You can never go wrong when eating Pita Bistro!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a decent Gyro and/or other Mediterranean fare - this is the place! Everything was clean, comfortable and open. The staff was friendly and the food was tasty. I would recommend this establishment to those who want a quick bite or take lunch to go."}
{"text":"Small but nice. The workers are super friendly and want to make sure you get exactly what you want even if it's different from what's on the menu.
I went right at what I thought would be peak dinner time and there was no wait at all. There were a few people eating but the food is made right in front of you and there was plenty of places to sit. 
They were more then happy to give me the free check in pita chips and hummus
The Greek fries were delicious and I highly recommend adding them to your order! 
I went with 5 people and everyone left full and happy. Including a vegan, who was very happy with the variety of vegan options. 
This is like a Chipotle but for Greek food.
Great place to stop by for a quick lunch or dinner when you're not sure where to go!"}
{"text":"It was soo good and healthy! I like ordering the chicken shawarma, and my husband likes the gyro. We also like the ambiance."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! This is the second time I have Pita Bistro for lunch and I can't get enough! I wish I had multiple stomachs (like our friends the cows) so I could eat 45lbs of falafel wraps from here. I don't even care that the falafel were not whole when I got my wrap, it added character to the meal. As a vegetarian Mediterranean food is always a good choice but never before have I had dreams about a darn wrap. Like who does that? Please check them out, they are incredible! I just wish they had a closer place near my house."}
{"text":"The Mediterranean version of chipotle. Amazing food. HUGE salad and hummus taste great! 10/10 recommend. The best service too!"}
{"text":"Good taste, fresh pita. I like their different favor mustard dipping sauces. Like the freshly fried tortillas. 
I used the order from yelp and pick up option, but still need to wait 6 min for them to bring me the Togo. I think there is room to improve on the speed :)"}
{"text":"The guy making our food seemed more confused than a first time costumer. He put a small handful of lettuce in my \"salad\". It was a pretty sad experience."}
{"text":"This is on my top restaurant list. I've  eaten here three times on a Sunday and I am never disappointed! The food is very fresh and just tastes so good. The staff is super friendly and helpful, and the manager is super nice too and he cares about your dining experience . This restaurant is very clean with a comfortable nice atmosphere and it's  not too noisy to talk. Love It! 
Both of us had variations on the Greek salad. Wraps are available, but I haven't had one yet. I never leave hungry! I like the many choices of vegetables, humus, dressings, taboulli, spices, and meats. Management doesn't mind us sitting for a couple hours, and I have never felt rushed. This a place where people enjoy good food. Don't miss out! Eat here and support small business!"}
{"text":"So, not a fan of hummus at all!  Just so you know.  With that being said, I have never been to a fast food Mediterranean/gyro place until now for that reason.  Reminded me of a very popular burrito fast food restaurant that gets your order done right as you get to checkout with all the fixings you want along the way.

I ordered the gyro, with all the veggies and extra tzakziki sauce to wash it down.  The burrito, I mean gyro/pita, was rather good despite my lack of enthusiasm for knowing there were so many other good places to eat for lunch near by.  

I am giving this 3 stars, not just because I hate hummus, but also because I am not a fan of fast food of any kind, especially chipotle style fast food.  The food was healthy and fresh which is why this is not a 2 or 1 star.  

As far as price goes, this restaurant gets 4 stars in my book.  Cheap and quick!  An upgrade from my original 2 star review before the owner contacted me personally through yelp."}
{"text":"I'm here at least twice a week. Think of a chipotle style Mediterranean place...but a lot more fresh and actually has taste. The manager and staff are friendly and are on top of everything."}
{"text":"Meh. Liked the gyro meat (although I ordered chicken shawarma) and the falafel. It would be great to substitute the PB sauce with tsaziki to give the wrap more flavor...pretty bland for my tastes. The hummus was bland but fresh and creamy. The manager was very nice and the line crew were polite."}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel nearby for the week and have already eaten here twice. The food is fresh and flavorful. I got the tabouli salad with falafel the first time and the veggie hummus bowl the second. The hummus is out of this world tasty! Great falafel, too. Meals are well-priced for the portion size and quality of ingredients. Probably will be back again before I leave town!"}
{"text":"Not exactly authentic Mediterranean food but great build your own hummus bowl with chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, great selection and everything had good flavor.  Love the concept of healthy and tasty.  Pricing seemed reasonable for fresh natural ingredients."}
{"text":"Horrible food hands down the worst. I had higher expectations based on many recommendations but was highly disappointed. My wrap was messy and the fries were so bad I only ate one. Would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"Just saw this place opened. I thought I would give it a shot. Food is average but that only saying I've tried the chicken Wrap. As soon as i went to eat it all the wax paper they use was stuck to the pita and wouldn't come off. Wrap immediately fell apart and was like eating an open stir fry. Chicken was very good which makes me give them a 4. You can definitely tell the staff is still training as the guy that made my wrap had some difficulties. Going to come back one more time to try something else and will update my rating after that visit."}
{"text":"this place is crazy good awesome food great atmosphere. 10\"s across the board!"}
{"text":"The spot is a bit overpriced in my opinion, but if you sign up for their rewards program they send you buy one get one free every now and then. 

Being less than a mile from my house and Mediterranean one of my favorite types of places to dine, I wanted to check it out. IMO, you get just about average Mediterranean food for higher than average price, expect about $10+ per meal. The cost to quality ratio here seems eschew. I've paid full price here once only, that was on my first visit. I've visited twice more, both times using a BOGO reward for being a member of their program, the $5 per meal (with their BOGO marketing) turns the average quality above average cost to an average quality amazing cost.

They're setup the way you'll find at a chipotle, subway, etc. Go to the counter, pick whether you'll have a pita or a bowl, select your protein, choose your toppings, pay the cashier and dine in or take out, no table service. I've had their chicken and beef options. Their hummus is good, I'd almost say this spots hummus is actually their redeeming quality. I'd probably come back just for the hummus if it were packed in a resealable container. They'll also give you samples to help you decide if you're on the fence about anything.

Phoenix, the choice is yours. Come for lunch or dinner, or don't. Its about as average as average can be in the sea of options you have around the greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I saw a coupon for this place in the local paper so I decided to check it out. On arrival I noticed how small the place is. But don't let the sterile atmosphere dissuade you. The menu is easy to follow and the folks behind the counter are happy to help you work through your first experience. I had the falafel wrap and it was delicious. My wife had the gyro wrap which was equally tasty. Fresh ingredients and great service make this a go to for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice, the server on the first visit seemed to be more knowledgeable. The food was good both times! The garluc hummus needed more garlic but the cilantro/jallepeno remains the best!"}
{"text":"That was the worst $9 I have ever spent. I actually really liked this place previously, but for a consistent good lunch - never will I waste my money here again. Salad was below par, just lettuce and their measly toppings. All crammed into their chipotle-wannabe bowl. I will forever regret choosing my lunch here. I would have rather gone to the gas station and bought the Sabra hummus & pretzels - I would have been more satisfied. The hummus was bland and watery, pita chips - there was like two on the salad. Ugh. I ate enough to stop my stomach from growling and threw it away. Bleh."}
{"text":"This place is great.

Kind of like a middle eastern chipotle. Bowls and the fresh juices are my go-to's.

My ONLY complaint is that they recently changed the size of the bowl(smaller) and you're still paying the same price..And trust me.. they are NOT the same size lol."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Pita Bistro. I read a few reviews on bad customer service, but decided to give it a try anyhow. I have to say I completely disagree with the reviews...from my phone call to calling my order in, to my amazingly quick and super friendly service to get me checked out and back on the road, I am beyond impressed with their customer service. As I have recently become a vegetarian, this is a delicious and convenient source for some flavor packed protein options. I ordered the veggie combo hummus bowl with lentils, and am beyond satiated with enough food left for dinner tonight.  I will definitely be ordering from here on days I don't bring lunch to work...so glad I decided to give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is the Chipotle of pita places, and I wouldn't call that an endorsement.  I've been there twice and Pita Bistro will not be on the top of my list for lunch spots.

My first experience was okayish, I had a gyro wrap with pretty standard gyro ingredients.  The veggies were crisp and the meat was fairly flavorful.  They asked if I would like rice or lentils, I chose lentils...and they put them ON my gyro.  I was expecting a side (the menu wasn't super clear, it just said that the wraps came with lentils or rice) and suddenly my perfectly adequate gyro was covered in lentils.  This wouldn't have been too terrible, except that the lentils were HARD and flavorless and there were a lot of them.  Skip the lentils or rice and it probably would have been alright.

Today I tried a hummus bowl...it was bad.  They take your choice of hummus and spread it all over the bottom of the bowl and load everything on top of it.  In theory this would be fine, but by the time I got to the end of the line my bowl looked like a runny mash up of hummus and vegetables, topped with some lukewarm shwarma.  I was still hopeful until they wedged my tiny slivers of pita bread mostly under the hummus.  I made the 3 minute trip back to my office and everything in the bowl was already soggy and had mixed itself into an unappealing paste.  Some of the individual components of the meal could have been good, but mashed together into a soggy lump I could only made it halfway through my bowl before I gave up.  It's currently sitting like a rock in my stomach and I'm a little nauseated.

The components:
Original hummus - a little runny but okay flavor
Veggies (tomatoes, red onions, cucumber) - seemed fresh enough, the cucumbers and onion were crisp
Mediterranean salad stuff - watery and flavorless except for some parsley
Tzaziki - I don't think the liquid they sloshed over my bowl deserved to be called tzaziki.  It was thin, translucent, and just waterlogged the bowl without adding any flavor
chicken shwarma - okay flavor, but a little tough
pita bread - probably would have been fine if it hadn't been shoved into the hummus soup, but it ended up soggy

The service is standard for any of these production line quick-serve restaurants.  There are a half dozen people behind the counter, straining to hear over the din of the dining room.  They kind of hear your instructions, but they're super busy and a little impatient if you hesitate or ask a question.  I don't actually mind that- I know they're busy and the pay probably sucks- so I'm not going to expect 5 star service.  But the food wasn't good, so I'm not going back either."}
{"text":"This time of year many of us may be craving something fresh, delish and not boring... Some places may be too indulgent, some too boring or too stiff. Well, if you want a quick healthy, fresh and delicious bite, you should come here! 

First of all, before I go any further, if you're in the mood for a wrap, check-in here and get free chips and hummus. They have a Siracha hummus that made my mouth very happy (I love spicy food). It was spicy yet flavorful, so you got lots of taste with the heat. The texture was very appealing, smooth and you could taste the tahini and olive oil. I really enjoyed this. 

There are lots of other businesses at this location, so while it might be busy around the lunch hour, there is plenty of parking. 

It is counter service and resembles Chipotle in set-up, ordering and seating. I felt that in the world or counter service this location deserved 4.5 stars given speed (despite how full it was), service and taste of food. You can order an existing combo or
Salad, rice, hummus bowls or wraps. I got a salad with a bunch of veggies and shawarma. The veggies were fresh, crisp and portions were generous. The chicken was well marinated and tasted of garlic and yogurt marinade, so it was savory with a little tanginess. It was well cook as it was succulent and not dry. 

I want to go back and try their other options. They also have a juice bar and make smoothies. 

It's like an oasis in the desert you can feel good about given all the healthy choices. Thanks the the freshness of ingredients and top notch  seasoning, it's delightful minus any guilt! 

Come check them out..."}
{"text":"The food here tastes very fresh.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are reasonable.  The portions are excellent - particularly if you make your own bowl, then it's huge and delicious!  The atmosphere is light and casual.  Not sure what else to say except I eat here regularly because it is always an excellent experience."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and tasty.  I agree that the staff can be very uninterested and uncaring.  More times than not they have been out of wheat pitas and they just shrug and wait for you to decide if you want white pita or to just hit the road (which I have done on more than one occasion).  Also, they charge significantly for you to customize your wrap or bowl.  One minor change from any of their preset options and you are kicked into the higher price \"build your own\" option.  Also, be very watchful when they are putting your toppings on.  One time you will get half a cup of something and the next time barely any.  I don't think consistency is a major goal for the staff here.

Otherwise, the food is tasty and healthy.  I continue to go back but keep my eyes open."}
{"text":"Lots of choices for fresh food very tasty! You choose your kind of hummus from Hot & Spicy to plain. then you choose all kinds of rice, veggies, and salads to put on top of it .  add feta cheese, olives, and toppings of olive oil, taziki.  and then you choose your protein chickenm, steak, kabobs, or gyro.  they also have falafels.  Staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Amazing!

Love-Love-Love!

So glad to have found this place.  Tried a make your own hummus bowl with all four types of hummus (cilantro, red pepper, sriracha and original).  Also got both rice and lentils.  Then added cucumber salad, beets, olives, chickpeas and chips and topped with gyros meat.  Mmmmmm...

My daughter got the chicken on hers and was thrilled with it.

We also tried two smoothies with whip cream.  (Energizer ones)  They were just okay.  I would skip the smoothie next time and just stick with the bowl."}
{"text":"Chicken shawerma  pita was amazing!!! I would like to try others before j start recommending them"}
{"text":"Quality food at an affordable price and friendly staff. I think this has got to be the most underrated place in my area. I'm shocked that it is never busy when I go in. The food is fresh and delicious and the staff is always nice.

Tip: check in on Yelp and get free hummus and chips!"}
{"text":"I eat here on occasion because I work within walking distance. Nothing special. Hummus needs salt, pita is store bought out of a bag, staff is friendly enough. Avoid their 'PB' dip which I suspect is just mayonnaise. I'll eat here again but it's because of work."}
{"text":"Very happy to see this location since it's closer to home and is open on Sunday. Food is great, staff is very nice and always ready to help if you have questions about the menu or flavors of hummus etc. 

Will definitely be back and try other options."}
{"text":"Stopped by again today. Ordered the Chicken Shawarma wrap. Added the Sriracha humus (by the way, the Sriracha humus is Amazing, just enough kick). Overall it was amazing. Great portion size of chicken. I went in hungry and came out Fully Satisfied. I would recommend it. Was very busy for lunch time. Staff seemed to be handling the crowd well. Nice to see a local eatery doing well. Eat here guys!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the food, I usually go to Mikas Greek and it's a whole different story much better and fresher food, had the gyro pita and I wasn't impressed, no side just a wrap and a small drink was 10 dollars when at the other place has much better food and a side for about the same price. Reminded me of extreme pita chain"}
{"text":"Food is great ! Staff is always just sweet as can be !!!  Love the menu and variety. Love the new med nachos ... yum"}
{"text":"This was my second time at this place, and I was certainly impressed with the choices that were offered. I got the chicken kabob bowl, which I customized based on my preferences. The cashier was even kind enough to offer me free hummus and chips based on a previous text message offer that had expired at the time. The portions are generous, and the food tastes good. Certainly a great value for the price you pay!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always fresh and good, staff is friendly and they have a great loyalty program! Love the hummus bowls!"}
{"text":"A lot of options to make a unique, personalized Pita directly in front of you or make it into a bowl. The number of options for meat, veggies, sides, and condiments puts this place well in from of other Pita restaurants. Priced a little on the higher side for Pita's the options available to choose from easily out weight the extra buck."}
{"text":"We just left this location and both my husband and myself are dissatisfied with the service we received. I'm typically a pretty laid back person and it often takes quite a bit for me to make a complaint. We came in to grab a quick bite about 30 mins prior to closing time. I fully understand            the desire to close up and call it a night; however, that doesn't warrant the rudeness we received from a particular staff member.  We've been in a few times before and have had this same staff member assist. He's never been particularly pleasant but this evening he was outright rude and disgruntled. He seemed incredibly bothered to answer any questions we had and plopped our food on the plates with obvious annoyance. I'm adding an extra star for the only other employee there at the time whom was pleasant enough and looked to almost be embarrassed of his counterpart. Now I understand that we all have off days and I mean no harm to this employee. However, that  said there's certainly a coaching opportunity on service and how you treat your customers - particularly ones that didn't have any outlandish requests."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but just thought the food was \"ok\". I'm a rather simple girl, so just ordered the Taboule Pita Wrap with Jalapeno/Cilantro Hummus. It was very bland tasting!

The place is cute and the staff was excellent..maybe I'll try one more time just to make sure, but hoping for better flavor next time."}
{"text":"We just found this place and don't have a shortage of Mediterranean food places around us but this will be by far our favorite. Everything was so so tasty. We had chicken schwarma, a gyro, falafel, hummus, tabouli and all of it was wonderful! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I work down the street and wanted to try something new for lunch. Wasn't too sure if I was going to actually stay because nothing got my attention on the menu. However, thankfully a young man that was behind the counter (forgot to get his name) got my attention and began recommending food. I was short on time so I decided to try it out. Kickin' K Bob hummus bowl is what I went with and no regrets there! (I just regret not taking a picture to post it here... oh and getting the name of this young man) He suggested items to go along with it and everything tasted great! Pita chips by the way are yummy too! I came back a 2nd time within a week to eat the same bowl! I was so excited to eat it I forgot to take a picture again! Was very glad with the customer service and the food as well. 

Only reason I don't give it a 5-star (honestly it's me, not you) is that I feel like there's not much that I would eat from here. Maybe I just have to try other new items, but they just don't seem appealing to me."}
{"text":"My wife and I needed a quick meal, and the line was too long at chipotle so we decided to give this place a try as there was no line. Maybe that should have been the first indicator.

There was a staff of just 2 so, just ordering took time. I recognized the pita from BAIZ used for my falafel wrap, however where BAIZ charges $4 Pita Bistro charges over $7.

The falfel it self was unique, large racquetball sized balls in a much lighter color and bland flavor than most falafel, they also did not have any tahini or spicy s'cug like most would expect with falafel.

Aprently I was not the only one who is not a huge fan, as two employees returned from chipotle next door."}
{"text":"There are so many secrets to Mediterranean flavor. Mediterranean cuisine uses bright herbs, citrus and other acidic ingredients to balance grilled. Not just anyone can get it right but Pita Bistro's modern Mediterranean flare brings a new spin to fast food. Today was my first visit at their newest location. I frequently dined at their 48th street location now excited for a more centralized restaurant. It's the same great food just in another home nestled at Park Central Mall in downtown Phoenix. 

My first experience was quite the same as the one I had in the past. Colorful restaurant with welcoming tones. Unlike other fast food restaurants they are always fully staffed. The staff is always patient, willing to help and super friendly. You're welcomed when you walk in the door and thanked on your way out.  Even though the setup is very easy to order it is refreshing to have service with a smile. 

For anyone who has not tried Pita Bistro my favorite is the build your own bowl. There are creative menu items they suggest on the menu or you can create what you like the best. For me creating my own bowl allows me to choose all my favorite items. One item I highly recommend is the Mediterranean chop. I could eat that alone it is so good. All meats are seasoned to perfection. Add pita bread or chips to dip into you hummus.  Self-serve drink station with a variety of soft drink options with free refills. 

The price point is reasonable for a healthier option. You get higher end restaurant quality food for half the price. This place is amazing I seriously see them taking off like Chipotle.  

Pros:
Free parking 
Squeaky clean
Indoor and outdoor seating
They do catering"}
{"text":"This is my second time dining in since the establishment first opened it's doors. I was excited to see something different in the area. Something unlike the traditional fast food restaurants. As a fan favorite of Mediterranean food  the concept of this restaurant is the way we want to see our food establishments move to. Similar concept to Chipolte though much more options to choose from. 

The venue is very trendy with a healthy atmosphere type of flare. You walk in and there are virtual menus on large digitals screens making it easy to view the menu options. What is nice is there are suggestions to choose from our you can create your own. I have not been daring and ordered the same thing I had the first time which was the Chicken Shawerma Pita. I got it as is minus the PB Dip. I added the mediterranean chop along with a vinaigrette. The portion was perfect. Matter of fact it was not to heavy it was just right. Next time around I plan to be more creative as the restaurant has kabobs, salads, tasty sides and an affordable juice bar. 

I did go at lunch time both times. The line was super long but went fast. There are plenty of staff on hand to make the process smooth. 

Pros:

It's clean. I repeat it is clean
To Go Cooler with pre made salads and other food options
Plenty of seating inside though the outside seating is not setup yet
Mini bar with happy hour coming soon
Beer, Wine and Spirits coming soon

I hope to see more of these pop up in the valley. I see great things for this mediterranean style of restaurant."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but only 3 due to the portion size of the wraps as well the French Fries being tasteless as well soggy full of grease. We experienced the three main wraps made as presented on the menu and loved the taste but wonder why so little meat/food. After spending close to $30 for 3 wraps and a very small bag of fries that I even had to as the worker to add more to the bag - we will go elsewhere for it's too expensive for such little food."}
{"text":"Good food, clean  place.The hummus salad bowl I ordered they only put very few little lettuce greens and alot of hummus,if you want extra lettuce they double charge you for a second bowl and they say there not able to give out anymore.
I been to this place a few times and it's the same story.if I'm gonna spend $18 on a salad I rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Think Chipotle but a Mediterranean menu. You choose your hummus, then your salad greens and toppings. My salad came with a side of pita bread. The serving was generous. I had a hard time finishing mine!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, friendly service, what else can you ask for?  This is my to go place for Mediterranean food, the gyro wrap is awesome, the hummus is fantastic, I recommend the cilantro jalapeño and the Siracha.  Also, try the Greek fries, great deal and you get a huge serving."}
{"text":"Made a late decision yesterday to hold a lunch meeting a needed catering. Called at 5:15 yesterday afternoon and they were more than accommodating for lunch at noon today. Excellent spread - much better than the usual sandwich platter.  Food was excellent and everyone appreciated the change of pace."}
{"text":"Our favorite new spot.  It's like a Mediterranean chipotle.  They are always so nice and friendly, the food is delicious and they have a great rewards program.  You can get bowls, wraps or salads. Everything comes with your choice of lentils or beans and then the usual add ins, cucumber salad, lettuce, hummus and a protein.  You must try their garlic spread... It is amazing!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I learned about this place through a co-worker while we were in the area for training for 8 days and fell in love with it the very first visit. I've visited everyday of training and will be taking my husband this weekend. There's a variety of options with the option to create your own meaI, it's open kitchen style is awesome ( you choose what and how much you want) also I love  the fact that there's a raw juice bar with a full bar coming soon . Our training class noticed we were visiting daily and they too decided to visit and they loved it also. With that being said this is a very nice and clean establishment with excellent customer service and great food. Go give it a try"}
{"text":"I love this place the falafel is delicious and the chicken. I make huge salads and I am able to make 2meals out of it"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but i feel the need to on this one. I love the food, the atmosphere and the overall feel of the restaurant.  But the customer service was horrible. The two girls serving the food on the line seemed like zombies, very unhappy and didn't even say hi, just asked what i wanted. They just kind of slinged everything i wanted in my bowl and that was it. My wife is a very picky eater, she originally wanted a chicken schwarma and the person started throwing stuff in it, not even asking if she wanted any of it. When i asked her to remake it, she kind of gave an attitude, quickly wrapped up and threw away the food.  She remade it but did not seem happy about it.  The girl at the register was very nice, i left a tip for her. The sad part is, this was my first time here. My wife and i have been talking about checking this place out for a while and we were very disappointed with our experience. I guess the take away from this is that the food and atmosphere are great, not going to take that away from them, but the customer service is very lacking and downright depressing. If the service had been different, i would have given a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The food at pita bistro was good, nothing to go crazy about. For the $11 I paid for my meal it was worth it. 

I got a pita bowl with hummus, a lot of veggies, and gyro meat. The meat was delicious, but they loaded it up with hummus. I recommend the sriracha hummus!!

The only major negative I had was the pita bread pieces. They seemed to firm and stale. It could have very well of been a bad batch of pita bread, but overall I would recommend this place to someone who is in for a tasty and healthy meal for anywhere from $8-$12."}
{"text":"Went twice since last review, still delicious BUT - the pita is a little lacking I've found. This would be like a million star review if the pita was a little better. Its a little cold and tough, almost leathery. I just wanted to put this so Nas could see, maybe heat the pitas up a bit? Or keep them in a warmer area so they aren't as cold/hard? It's a minuscule change, but would make the sandwiches Top tier. Consider it please! From a life time customer!"}
{"text":"A nice clean up-beat place. I was disappointed in the Gyro. It was more like a pita burrito. The bread tasted more like a thick tortilla , and was not rolled and wrapped like a Gyro. So the filling was coming out both ends. Also, there were no sides on the menu."}
{"text":"I have given this place multiple chances before I decided to write this review- I have gone there about 8 times in the last 6 weeks, and each time I have had the exact same problem. 
First let me start with the quality food- being from the Middle East, I know what the food should taste like, it is at best average. The chicken fattoush is probably the best, the rest of the \"protein\" they offer is tasteless and dry. The gyros though, are the absolute worst. The look, taste and texture is like rubber. The hummus is good. The tabouli is also good.
The problem I have had here every single time is with the staff- they are uninterested and obviously hate their jobs, so they take it out on your food. They can't hear,despite repeating the same request 50 times. Partly, because they aren't looking at you, and mostly because they just don't give a shit. The cashier I had last time had a resting bitch face- maybe it was the mass acne all over her face, but I think it was simply the fact that I'm a girl because I watched her erupt in giggles with every male customer. I had asked the girl at the end for pita bread which comes with bowls, and after asking 10 times, she still didn't hear me, so when I got to the cashier (located about 5 inches to her right), I asked for the pita break. She started pointing and waving her finger at me instructing me that \"you tell her if you want pita bread and then you come to me.\" The only saving grace of this place is their manager who I spoke to and complained to- she handled it very gracefully and politely and offered me a free bowl with my rewards. This was the first time I ever heard of their rewards program because the cashiers never mentioned in before. 
The portions this place serves are unbalanced- this is again due to the lack of shits given by the employees- every time I go in, they dish out the food like there's a famine. They literally pick 1-3 of everything and place it on the bowl. 1-3 chickpeas, 1-3 olives, 1-3 cucumbers, 1-3 beets. If they dare use the tiny spoon, it's still the same amount. If I ask for more than 3 chickpeas, they'll give me 2 more-man that could last me an extra 2 days !! The worst part, is that they just stand there, and after slapping the humus and few grains of rice, they shove the bowl at the end of the food assembly line skipping all toppings. They don't ask if you want anything, they don't give you what you ask for, and when they do, the quantity is not worth the $11. I already complained about this to the manager, but nothing changed. 
The pita bread should not be stuffed into the bowl because it makes it soggy and wet. The bread is left out exposed to air, so it's pretty stiff and hard (maybe that's why they do this ?)
The previous 7 times I went in, they never ever offered me pita bread- so I found out about it much later. Which brings me to my last point- the menu is dumb. It is not clear, with charges being added to weird things like \"make your own bowl\"- when there is nothing additional given in that bowl compared to other bowls on the menu. On top of that, because of their terrible staff, you're never told when there's an extra charge (they probably don't know themselves). Every time I order the same thing, I get charged different amounts.
I come here only because it is close to work, and most other options are not that healthy. At this point though, I'm going to go to panda express, jimmy johns, or quizznos. 
They seriously need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Not going back... my chicken was so wet that the pita was very very soggy and leaked a huge puddle... It was nice that you can pick all of the toppings that you would like and customize."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I wasn't the biggest fan of Pita Bistro. Everything I ate was a little bland and really not that satisfying. Sad, I know. 

This is a conveyor belt style, fast casual spot. You choose your main vehicle - wrap, salad, bowl type deal, choose your protein, toppings and sauces and boom. 

I went with a create your own chicken shawarma salad and I've had a lot better. The chicken itself was flavorless. Not dry, not especially juicy, but zero spice. The salad wasn't fresh and juicy, but seemed rather like it was straight from a ginormous bag. This isn't boding well.

The toppings were fresh, but nothing added any flavor to this dish that desperately needed it. I opted for some hot sauce, hummus and tzatziki and the desired income of flavor was missed, instead making a pile of flavorless mush. It was a whole lot of meh, not gonna lie. A bite of my friend's falafel sealed the deal. Far from the real thing and really dry. 

I however will still give this spot three stars. Why? Because I know really good Mediterranean and maybe others don't. Also, this place has a ton of seating and is quite nice for a rather casual lunch. And, I can't hat that they are offering up healthy eats from the salads and bowls to the fresh juices. 

Not the worst $11 lunch, but I can tell ya, I've definitely had way better shawarma, hummus and all that jazz."}
{"text":"Oh so good

Today a co-worker and I headed to Pita Bistro for lunch. The line was out the door, but we decided to stay and I'm so glad we did.  

I can see why the line was out the door.  The staff  were very friendly, and everything was fresh and oh so good.  Pita Bistro offers many options and you can even build your own pita/schwarma.  On this visit I had the steak wrap and my co-worker decided to go with the chicken wrap, and we shared the  roasted red pepper hummus with pita chips. 

The steak wrap was very flavorful and large enough for two and the roasted red pepper hummus was awesome, just the right flavor. The food overall is wonderful, service is good, and the prices are wallet friendly. The restaurant is on the smaller side so the seating could be limited but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with our visit.  The food was fresh and quite tasty.  Wish there was one of these in my hometown.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered online and picked up on the way home from work.  It was meatless Monday for us and we ordered 2 falafel hummus bowls with all the goodies. The food was fresh and plentiful.  Will order again for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow. I don't even know where to begin. I'll start with my warm and welcoming introduction to the restaurant - smiling faces and hellos from each and every staff member. The feel is casual yet exclusive. - Modern yet warm. The best part is - YOU decide every detail of what goes into your food. I ordered a bowl (generous portion) and specified how I wanted it - the options are really endless and taste fresh. Only negative comment was their light fixtures by the bar (yeah, they have a full service alcohol bar opening soon) were blocking the TVs somewhat. Anyway, I will be back soon! New favorite joint!"}
{"text":"Love going here for a quick and nutritious meal. The staff is always very friendly and quick to help you out. Even during the lunch rush, the lines moves pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from my house, and just about the only place to eat that is, besides some fast food joints. I come here pretty frequently. The food is very tasty and the ingredients are always fresh. I almost always get the veggie bowl combo. Some days they load it up to where I can eat half of it and save the rest for another meal altogether, but other days it's much lighter, just enough for the one meal (guess it depends on who is working that day?) 

I have only had one really bad experience, and that was a few days ago. In the middle of my meal one of the workers came around to clean some tables. She was using a really strong cleanser - like Mistolin or the neon-colored Mr. Clean used to mop floors. Suddenly the entire restaurant reeked of cleanser. I don't usually mind that smell so much, but I don't enjoy it while I am eating. I understand they need to keep the place clean, but I spent 15 years working in restaurants and there are other ways to do it without giving the patrons a headache. I had actually brought a book with me and intended to hang out and eat for a little while but instead took my food to go. But like I said, I've been here many times and that was the only time I experienced anything like that so I won't judge them too harshly off of the one incident. If I come back and it happens again I might just always eat their food at home."}
{"text":"Update:

2nd visit and hate to say it but the honeymoon must be over.  Ordered the exact same thing again and it was half the portion they served from opening week.  It was still delicious, they just set the expectation too high from the first time."}
{"text":"Anazing steak gyro wow..foods fresh environment clean and chill..def love it and recommend it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the veggies and hummus.  Next time I'm going to order their raw juice or smoothies.

This would be a great place for a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time trying Pita Bistro, and I am a fan. I just had the Greek salad with vinaigrette dressing, and topped with half chicken and half lamb. Both meats were delicious. The chicken is roasted and diced and very juicy, and the lamb is sliced thin, with some crispy edges, like it was cut from the spit."}
{"text":"Yummy Mediterranean food! The price is pretty good and the quantity is huge! I got a hummus bowl and it lasted 2 full meals!"}
{"text":"So Fresh and Delicious! I was not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised by the extensive menu and fresh food. I had a hummus bowl with falafel and it was fantastic. My friend had a great big Mediterranean burrito-thing that looked great if you're not thinking about calories. Place was packed but they move the line along swiftly. I wish there were more of these as I probably won't find myself in the neighborhood again soon."}
{"text":"Good food and stellar customer service. Especially Leanthony! They walked me through how to order patiently. So friendly."}
{"text":"My hubby & I were looking for a place for lunch and this sounded good.  We agree.  Very busy at lunch time but the food was good.  We'd go back."}
{"text":"I am typically not a fan of the Chipotle / Fired Pie style point and select type of food ordering; but, Pita Bistro does it right!  All of their options are high quality well prepared Middle Eastern offerings.  In fact, their tabouli is some of the best around!  The humus is equally impressive (I have only tried the standard version, but they have several varieties available).  I have never had a bad meal here because the quality is a constant!  If you like Middle Eastern food like I do, you should really give these guys a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place . Recently took my sister  to try out  the bowls and she loved it . Everyone is always so kind and helpful ."}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom.  I could eat here very day.  The flavors are so wonderful, everything tastes fresh and authentic, the prices are really fair, and the staff is friendly.  I just wish there was one closer to my house!  (Or maybe not, since I probably would eat here daily if it were that close!).  But seriously this place is so good for that build-your-own bowl type of dining or just go with their recommendations.  I've tried their schwarma, falafel, fresh juices, hummus, etc.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here before and it was glorious! !!!
Got the same thing to go and it was no where near what it was the first time!!! Ugggh!!! It sucks because I live in N Scottsdale and it takes me a minute to get there!!! Meh."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Great lunch place.  I had them make me a bowl with hummus and taboule and lots of fresh veggies.  Others had shwarma and wraps and everyone was very happy.  Nice and fresh with friendly staff and the order-at-the-counter situation makes it easy to get in and out during a standard lunch hour."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time about a week ago.  I had the kick n bob bowl.  The chicken was very dry.  The only thing saving it was the garlic sauce but there wasn't enough of that.  For a $9 lunch I was disappointed.  I also had to take it to go, the place is extremely loud to the point where the staff has to yell for you to be able to hear what they say. Not a relaxing place to stay and eat in my opinion."}
{"text":"Just popped in here for lunch and the food is fantastic! Very healthy lots of different options and ways to customize your meal. I had great little bowls for the kids for less than $4 or they got to choose rice and meat. Very reasonably priced, very fast and very healthy!"}
{"text":"Oh no, as much as it hurts I had to drop them to 3 stars today.  

1, seriously no roasted red pepper hummus?  

2. Place was dirty.  A lot of the tables were dirty, behind the counter seemed disorganized and dirty.  Just didn't seem tight.  They have like food on display, it looks like it's been out all day.  Just doesn't male the good look appetizing.

3. Where is my pita bread?  I got 3 little triangles of bread, but it is no PITA.  It was bland and cold.  Looked and tasted like pita I can get at my local grocery store.  For shame.

I hope they make a comeback, I was disappointed overall.  They went from great to average."}
{"text":"They are friendly and fast I had my food in minutes. They have quite a selection and I picked \"create your own bowl\". They had a few different toppings to pick from and my favorite for sure was cilantro jalapeño hummus. They had a few choices for protein and I picked the chicken which had a perfect taste for my bowl. I did ask to try their tofu, but it did not have a taste that I really liked. However a few other people were ordering and saying it was their favorite. 
The restaurant itself was a bit loud so that made it a little difficult to ask questions (my first time) and to be able to hear them. 

This spot was great for my lunch and whenever I'm in the area I will try them out again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best falafel I have ever had. Food is delicious and fresh. Customer service is wonderful. I can't wait to go back. This is also a vegan friendly place."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in here on the way home from work. Much better than I was expecting, and even my husband found something he'd eat (we don't eat meat and he's fussy on top of it).
Very friendly staff talked us through our options and made recommendations. Hummus bowl is where it's at! Will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! Wow. I haven't tried a new restaurant in a long time where I was 100% satisfied until today. Bravo! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, but another store I can no longer patronize. I am on a special medical diet and I used to be able to come here and purchase chicken and veggies ala carte. However I went today and was informed that if I wanted to have cucumbers and tomatoes that I would have to purchase a full salad; which for medical reasons I can not eat a full sized salad. I asked could I purchase the veggies ala cart separately again I was told no, because \"he\" doesn't like to do it that way. I just really didn't understand why I could not purchase the veggies as I normally do. The reason given was beyond lame & after being a long time customer of pita I'm extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"Every time I go, I'm delighted! Great portions, fresh ingredients, very nice employees; all this for under 10$!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great place! Not only is the food top notch, but the folks working there are so friendly a nice. I enjoy every trip I make to Pita Bistro."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place the staff is amazing the food is so so yummy and the music and bar are popping. Their Manager Daniel is super friendly and has great customer service."}
{"text":"What a delightful find, close to the airport!  We had such a patient employee helping us figure out what to order and how to create our perfect bowl with many ingredients that were fairly new to us.  Soooo good.  Soooo fresh.  Just what we needed - now to convince someone to open one in our home town!"}
{"text":"Good fresh food. Mediterranean Chop is a favorite. Yummy hummus and pita chips. There was a long line at lunch but it moved quickly. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"It is kind of like the Mediterranean version of Chipotle. 

It was ok, not great. The meat had a lot of flavor, but they used just plain store bought hard pita bread. 

Probably would not come back here."}
{"text":"Really flavorful, decently priced for a healthy meal, and super filling so I had lots of leftovers!"}
{"text":"Really good chicken and humas."}
{"text":"The Chipotle of Middle Eastern food, if you like hummus and garlic this is the place for you - YUM YUM - the PB Dip is delicious. Great atmosphere and delicious fresh RAW juices."}
{"text":"I was downtown today and looking for a place to eat and saw this and thought I'd give it a shot for lunch.  I had the chicken schwarma and it was so delicious.    Wish there was one close to my work or home so I could go again!  Maybe venture there at dinner time some day.  The staff was all very nice and although it was extremely busy they kept a good rhythm and stayed happy and courteous.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but it just doesn't stand out amongst Mediterranean places.  I love the digital menus, it makes it so easy to see the offerings.  Food looks fresh and the staff is down to earth.  I ordered the gyro bowl.  It would have been great but the gyro meat was barely warm--yuck.  Gyro meat needs to be hot!  I ordered their special fries with feta and vinegar.  

The fried aren't the crispy kind, so they get soggy with the vinegar and almost look like faux poutine.

I guess I might give this place another try during lunch.   Oh last thing also, the pita bread is not  served warm either.  I'm not sure if they don't understand Mediterranean food or if it just sat in lukewarm warmers since I went in at 7 pm ish.  It wouldn't be so dissatisfying if it didn't have so much potential."}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful folks.  More food than we could finish!  Really good salad bowl - and the jalapeño hummus was terrific!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch here with some co-workers to try it out. It was a very pleasant surprise great food! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the reply. I went by your place last night and my experience was much better. Food was great, service and music equally great. That same young lady was engaged and accommodating. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was packed at lunchtime during the week, which is always a good sign. The food was good and the Restaurant was clean. Lots of noise from all the customer's, but they were happy customer's. Good food, great location, great atmosphere, happy staff, and happy customer's. I think they've nailed it. Would have been a 5 star if the meat wasn't so dry, other than that I have no complaints. I would for sure go again if/when I'm in that area for another meeting. Keep up the great service!!"}
{"text":"Our boss brought a group of about 11-12 people for lunch here and the staff working was extremely fast, and to top it off friendly! There was some of us that had never been here before but they took the time to explain everything and managed to moved the line quick. Loved my bowl with tofu and falafels, one of the girls working suggested half and half and was very pleased with that decision :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for something healthy ish and fast. That is what I got. I did a create your own bowl with basically everything except rice and added gyro. I'm not sure if it's because I was starving but my bowl is super delicious and the beets are super yummy. Will return and try other options soon."}
{"text":"First time I have seen a Chipotle style Mediterranean place.  The food is a bit bland though fresh.  It is certainly worth a try if you have not been before."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean place to eat. You get full fast and don't have a guilt after eating everything on that bowl. Fills u up for the rest of the day. Very delicious and fresh. Friendly staff. Long lines at lunch time and small place , wish it was a bigger dine in place"}
{"text":"The hummus was awesome and the rice cooked perfectly the chicken was good too.  I just didn't care for the pita.   I would come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I got a chicken shawarma wrap with rice, hummus, tabouli tomatoes, and PB sauce. It was really tasty.  

Service was quick the food seems very fresh.  I had an issue with the food being too garlicky the second time but the owner immediately rectified the situation and when I went a third time I found the food to be just as wonderful as the first time.

I would highly recommend this as a healthy option, especially considering what else is in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! It's like a Mediterranean or middle Eastern style chipotle. You can create your own hummus bowl with whatever toppings you want. It's very vegan friendly and the kids working there are super nice and everything is fresh. I hope they open more locations!"}
{"text":"If I could give  -  10 stars I would. Ate there last Friday and brought home food poisoning with me. The only thing I had eaten that day and 30 minutes later I was in the bathroom for 4 hours!!  So so sick and I believe it was the white goo they put on The Mediterranean Chop salad. I am so disappointed as I have eaten there before with no problem. Will never take the chance again though. Beware of the white goo...If it was warm like the stuff on my salad... throw it out!!!"}
{"text":"By far the absolute best pita bowl I have ever had. The flavors were amazing and the whipped garlic sauce was da bomb!  I am traveling from out of town but I will definitely be back next time I come"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch  with a friend expecting good gyro. What I got was pre cut cold gyro from a stuffed full box of meat. The tsasiski sauce was watery bland and flavorless. The chicken schwarma was also bland. I will not be returning. You get one chance and you blew it."}
{"text":"Hit this place for lunch. Was fast, and once I got my Gyro Southstreet, it was delicious. The PB was good, they say is their creation but I've had very similar \"spread\" in other places. Was a nice experience. The ONLY thing that would need improvement is that the personell should try and be a little more friendly. Only the guy in training was smiling and very cheerful."}
{"text":"I always do the chicken schwarma and I customize it. I either get it in hummus bowl form or wrapped in a pita. The chicken is so good! Lots of Kalmata olives too!"}
{"text":"Thank you to Pita Bistro for dropping off a lunchtime platter to Architectural
Impressions !  It was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Helpful staff and great mediterranean food with a build your own bowl twist."}
{"text":"The best arabic food i've had in AZ. It's authentic arabic too, which is extremely rare to come by nowadays. The garlic sauce taste just like my mothers,  which is the best compliment I could ever give. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here the other day ordered food. Employees talking about forgetting toppings on menu items.  I didn't realize until I left but they didn't ask what hummus I wanted on the salad and I asked for dressing but I didn't see any on the salad. Then at checkout I had a pending reward \"buy one get one free\". I asked if I could order a second item to take advantage of it before it expires. The response first was to tell me I had x number of hours still to use it. Finally she let me order a second item. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"Refreshing option for healthy dining, packed with lots of flavor and won't break your budget. I have enjoyed eating their create-your-own bowls on three occasions and I have not been disappointed yet. Be sure to try the chicken shawarma and kabobs, and the Mediterranean chop is delish! Very generous amount - enough for two to share. Love this place and will be visiting frequently."}
{"text":"The fresh squeezed juices are very good and same with the hummus and perfectly crispy pita chips!"}
{"text":"Yum! Love that they have a vegan option! Everyone there is so awesome!!!!!!!!


Vegan options"}
{"text":"Amazing service & delicious food! Great place for when you're ready to try something new or a new combo of ingredients with their customized bowls. Looking forward to trying many of their other plates. The manager, Joel is a star and made me feel so welcome. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food and customer service at this place. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they could be less stingy on the bowls. Geesh, they're $9.00 and they put just a spoonful of everything, including the rice. I'm still hungry after I eat one."}
{"text":"Worst place to order from ever. Hadn't even started my order when I got there 10 min after it said my order would be ready. And when I got there they were out of steak. Awesome"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with this place! I met my husband for lunch during the week and I didn't really know what to expect. But it was so good. It reminds me of a Chipotle for Mediterranean food. I got the veggie combo hummus bowl and added a chicken skewer. You basically can tell them what you'd like in it as it goes down the line, with hummus as the base. They also do wraps, salads, and even juice and smoothies. 

Their system is better than the assembly line they do at Chipotle (where one person does meats, one person does salsa, etc.)... here you have one person and they go down and finish preparing your entire meal and hand it off to the cashier, then they return back to the front of the line and take the next person. So during the lunch rush, it was very busy and they were well staffed and it moved very nicely. I appreciated that. 

The veggie combo was so good. The fallafel was crispy and flavorful, the red pepper hummus was really good, and whatever they marinade the chicken in is amazing! My husband usually isn't a big fan of just grilled chicken but he loved it. I was so full and still have half of my bowl left. 

The atmosphere is clean, modern, and simple. They also have 3 different options for brewed iced tea which I love! It was a little pricey but for the quality and taste I'd say it's worth it. I saw a sign that said they are opening a full bar soon and adding a happy hour menu. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, good value: Recommended!

Food:
Pita Bistro is a fast-food Mediterranean restaurant with a twist. Think gyros, falafels, and salads, and like Chipotle next door, you can customize your order. I ordered the Greek Salad, and spruced it up with extra feta, beets, peppers, and the all important PB Sauce. (If you don't like heavy garlic, you might want to skip the PB Sauce!) My salad was very good, with fresh, flavorful ingredients. As I was eating, an employee brought a complimentary falafel on a bed of cilantro jalapeño hummus. The falafel was done to perfection, crunchy outside, and warm and soft inside. It was a bit sweet, and very tasty. The hummus was also quite flavorful, with a bit of heat.

Cost: 
My meal was a very reasonable $10.75, including tax, for the salad and iced tea.

Service: 
The staff were very friendly and helpful. Service was fast, and they even offered a free sample of hummus (cilantro jalapeño is their most popular).

Atmosphere:
Nothing remarkable, typical fast food place. The chairs are unpadded metal, but there are also a couple of soft benches against the wall. The tables and floor were very clean, as was the Men's Room, although it had no mirror, if that matters.

Overall:
I really like the range of choices here for healthy, flavorful dining. I'll definitely be back!"}

{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place originally on uber eats. Uber eats didn't deliver my whole order and I showed the manager at register and she was the best. Without a hesitation she took care of me. Besides the amazing food this place has amazing customer service and Management."}
{"text":"The menu here is super simple, the counter service is really fast and it's a great walk in place to grab lunch when you're in a rush. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wish I had noticed this place sooner. I had the intention to go to one of the restaurants next door and now I'm so glad I didn't. The guy that helped me was really nice and explained what every thing was and made some great suggestions. I got the Greek salad with the chicken shawarma on top and it's so good! It's a lot of food for the price and so worth it, plus staff was great. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this new lunch spot! My go-to is a hummus bowl with chicken. It's great to have healthy options close  to the office. I've never had any issues with the quality of food, although (like someone else mentioned) it seems like they're being a little more stingy with portion sizes, particularly the hummus. In spite of that, I would give 5 stars if I didn't think my order was a giant inconvenience to many of the staff. I know the lunch rush can be stressful but I just get the feeling some of the employees could use a little more patience. Great overall!"}
{"text":"This place is good. I have been waiting for it to open. Great Gyros, you can build your own. Different types of hummus as well as wheat pitas. The only thing missing is stuffed grape leaves - that would make it perfect. Even my 5 year old liked it and she is very picky."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. Food is bland. Side of hummus was $4.45 for greasy, fried, tasteless pita chips and dip that tasted like wallpaper paste.  The Gyro was OK, bland, but a big portion. The Kale Kense was reasonably good, but the guy who made it was not wearing gloves."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I was craving hummus like no other when I found pita bistro. My family is Mediterranean so you could say I'm pretty picky about my hummus. Although the hummus may not level up to the Middle East, the concept + the unlimited toppings make up for it. 

I've been here twice now and I love the different salad options plus the white lemony sauce there is a MUST get. I got chicken kabobs both times as my protein, which were grilled really nicely. 

Always generous portions and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. Nothing I'm amazed about, but it's quite what I expected from a conveyor belt Mediterranean place. It was also very clean and organized in the building.

I mainly docked it down because the staff seemed super bland and robotic. I asked a few questions and got blank stares back. They never were very friendly and I'm wondering if they even have personalities at all....?

I was very disappointed because my boyfriend and I were hoping to get a glass of wine from the bar while we ate, but no one was behind there. When we asked an employee, their response was that the bartender was on break and they didn't know how to do the bar stuff. When we told her we just wanted a glass of wine, she shrugged and walked away. I'll give them the benefit of doubt: maybe they were all underage and not allowed to pour alcohol. But there should be someone of age in the building if you have a bar... 

Anyways. I'll probably be back to give it another shot. I hope I have a better experience."}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty ingredients. I love all the different hummus be it siracha or jalapeño varieties. Chicken kebabs skewers are delicious. I always get the kickin kabab. This is served with rice and lentils. Yelp checkers receive 10% off their total order."}
{"text":"Try the energizer so refreshing and tasty and it's not overly sweet like most juices."}
{"text":"I attended here with my daughter, no kids menu and the staff seemed annoyed when I asked. I should have checked out on yelp before we went in. It was lunch so they were really busy. We ordered the hummus and pita chips which my daughter gobbled up immediately. We also had a chicken shwarma salad and a gyro wrap. The salad had way too much oregano on it and the chicken was totally dried out and the wrap had a really weird dressing on it but the gyro meat was great. My daughter loved the strawberry smoothie. Decent for lunch but doubt we will come back just because of costumer service. The only person that even looked like they wanted to be working their was the smoothie operator!"}
{"text":"business trip and looking for something to take out that was not the same old thing.  Enjoyed a chicken schwarma warp.  Really tasty.  Fast service and good prices.  Menu has enough variety to satisfy most people."}
{"text":"In town for work, great spot to pick up a healthy delicious meal.  I had the create your own bowl.  I would have posted a pic but I ate it all before I thought to add a review."}
{"text":"Super great food, fast service, friendly staff !!! This is definitely added to my favorite spots to eat good quality food for a lower price."}
{"text":"I went in today for lunch. I'm dairy free currently due to breastfeeding my newborn who is dairy intolerant. I have to be very careful when I eat out! I'm also pretty shy and hate asking about Allergens in foods but I have to now! The owner was super nice and pointed out the items I couldn't order. There was plenty of items that are dairy free!! Loved my lunch and will be back!! Can't beat their customer service and upbeat attitude!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick lunch before driving up to Sedona. I would have liked it more if the line didn't take so long and they had more seating. If it's your first time the menu and the way they operate can be a little confusing. They lost a star for these.

I ordered the create your own wrap. Because of the convoluted way they do it and the lines I don't really remember what I got in the wrap, but whatever it was I thoroughly enjoyed my wrap."}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! I loved the food selection.  I ordered a create your own bowel with chicken. All the food looked and tasted fresh. The smoothies are made on the spot with fresh whole ingredients.  I had the strawberry. It's set up like a Subway or Chipotle where you stand in line and they make your meal as you walk along. Be warned, the line around lunch can be very long. Staff was friendly and helpful for a first timer as well."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today...OMGOSH!!! They are amazing!!  I got the Chicken Shwarma.  I explained to the girl who was putting it together it was my first time there, and she walked me thru the process and had suggestions when I was not sure.   You get a TON of food for the price.   I will be going back and soon.  Lent is just around the corner, this will be a great alternative to Fish.
Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Upscale, hip, trendy with Aaaahmazing, healthy Food.  It's like a Chipotle w/ Mediterranean food!  Put one of these up in Scottsdale/PV, please."}
{"text":"I decided to tag along with the bf in AZ while he was doing his monthly national guard drill. Pita Bistro was within walking distance from my hotel, right between a sprint store and chipotle. When you walk in it has a very similar set up to a chipotle style of ordering. I loved all the low carb options they had and also lots of vegetarian friendly choices. Great for any of those trying to be healthy without skimping on flavor. 

I decided on the create your own bowl option with jalapeño cilantro hummus, mediterranean chop salad, cucumbers, olives, pb dip and chicken kebab. I loved everything about the bowl expect for the chicken. The seasoning on the chicken was tasty, but the texture was very dry. I think if I came back I'd opt for a different choice meat choice. 

Overall I thought this place was great though. The options were bountiful and fresh, service was quick and friendly and the pricing was reasonable."}
{"text":"Falafel was dry and greasy tasting. Asked for tabouleh on my bowl and the girl put about 6 scoops so that's all I ate because she also hardly put any hummus in the bowl. The cucumber salsa made my whole bowl into a puddle because the girl didn't drain it, just plopped it right on. It was $10 for a bowl I couldn't eat and the staff were really rude."}
{"text":"I've visited Pita Bistro quite a few times as as it's conveniently close to work. My visits have always been good, today was exceptional.  The service was fast and super friendly.  Food was delicious,  I was also offered some of the new menu items which I did try the new spicy falafel.  I had a \"create your own bowl\" with lentils, hummus, mediterannean chop, tabouli, pb garlic dip, feta, olives and some seasoning with the spicy falafel as my protein. I had the option of pita bread or chips,  I opted for the chips which I'm glad I tried as they were very good. The flavors in the bowl all worked amazingly well together. I'm full,  satisfied, and happy after my meal ;-) I'm so glad I came in since its been a minute since I've been to Pita Bistro. Glad to see some new offerings on the menu, especially excited to try their take on Greek fries which they now offer. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"So flavorful and fresh plus great service!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for lunch and got a to go order. The interior is bright and contemporary with digital menu signs and a good amount of seating. I decided on the veggie combo hummus bowl and redeemed a Yelp check in offer for free hummus and pita chips ($1.99 value). 

The bowl comes with your choice of hummus, rice or lentils, salad, dressing, pita with falafel on top. I chose the original hummus, lentils, soft pita, vinaigrette and tabouli salad. As a whole I liked the bowl, with the combinations of textures and flavors that meshed well together. The falafel was a sizable portion with a rock hard outer layer but was soft on the inside. I could only finish about half of the bowl for lunch. My total for the bowl with tax was around $8, not bad for the amount of food I got.

The hummus I chose for the check in offer was the jalapeno cilantro hummus. While I liked the spiciness and flavor from the jalapeno overall I wasn't a big fan of the flavor which seemed a bit one dimensional for me. The texture of the hummus was a bit grainy to me as well. I did enjoy the pita chips which were light and crispy though.

Service was very friendly.

Overall, if you're in the area this is a pretty good choice for Mediterranean fast food."}
{"text":"Edit: Looks like they took my feedback seriously and the last time I went in service was very fast and professional. The worker also made my create your own bowl very well. I've had times where the worker doesn't put enough food in the bowl but this worker was great! 5 stars!

Old review...
Decent food, however they are understaffed a lot. Came in toward the end of the lunch rush on a Sunday and there was only one worker. There were 3 people in front of me and it took 20 minutes to get my food. There was also a lady worker but she seemed to not do anything and was walking around even though there was a big line behind me. They need a lesson in customer service and urgency."}
{"text":"Was a regular customer, but after trying to portion control my meal for dietary reasons, I was disappointed in their lack of flexibility. Was told I had to pay extra ($1.99) for them to put the hummus I was already getting in my bowl, on the side. What!?...I'm asking for customer service, not something for free! A little extra effort goes a long way. 

Lack of common sense, inflexibility, and terrible customer service. It's unfortunate that lack of empowerment caused them to lose a regular customer, I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot. Always consistently good salads and wraps. Greek salad with chicken wrap is to die for. Jalapeño hummus and pita chips are fresh and delicious. Sign up for points with your phone number and you constantly get coupons and free sides or drinks."}
{"text":"Good clean restaurant! Recommend the jalapeño  hummus bowl! Chicken Kabob was subpar, but the rest of the bowl was on point!"}
{"text":"The hummus bowl is the bomb!!!  I got the roasted red pepper one (create your own), lentils, a little but of rice, fattoush salad, and red onions!  Yum!  Everything on the menu is quick, delicious and affordable.  I cannot go without the garlic dip served on the side"}
{"text":"This is about a five minute walk from my office, so I have had a few opportunities to go here. Both times I have ordered the Gyro. I like these and they are a safe bet when having Mediterranean style food. Their Gyro's are pretty awesome! Lots of flavor and stuffed. You also get to build your own, so adding rice and other items such as cucumber and beans. Great casual atmosphere with an outside patio. Very clean and pretty fast service. It does get busy at lunch time, so there can be a ten minute wait or longer to place your order."}
{"text":"Good value for money. Even though I asked for a gyros wrap they acted as though they never made one and even said \"what protein would you like?\" \"Uh, how bout the .....GYROS? PS: About a third of patio chairs covered in bird shit. Details people..."}
{"text":"The paper they use for the wraps gets stuck to the pita bread and you have to try to peel it off and then the wrap falls apart and it's really hard to eat. Get better paper. I like the food and the hummus is delicious."}
{"text":"Great food! Been coming here since they opened and always on point, the chicken schwarma or however it's spelt lol is delicious, kinda stuck on that but I've eaten their salads aswell and they are great. Avoid lunch times though."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice... Hoping it would be good. Food is so dry its not even worth another shot."}
{"text":"While waiting for a friend to arrive these kind folks asked if they could give me some pita chips and hummus to snack on while I waited. Um....heck yeah! They were delightful. 
After that, I had a hummus bowl, which was HUGE, but not very good, unfortunately. I don't recommend the beets, garlic sauce, falafel or taziki. 
If you come, play it simple--hummus (roasted red pepper is good), rice, tabouli, olives, fresh veggies, and the steak or chicken. I had the gyro meat and it was ok, but quite greasy. I do recommend the pita chips. They were yummy."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we came on an off day or what was up but our experience sucked. This was our first time going here. The place is a Mediterranean version of Chipotle. 

The woman taking our order had a sticker indicating she was in training. She spoke very softly and we had to ask her to repeat things several times before her trainer finally had to step in and ask us the questions in an audible voice. I also felt like the menu wasn't very clear. The kebobs come with tomato, cucumber, and onion. They have a mix of those veggies diced up so I assumed that was what went into my hummus bowl but it turns out it is actual slices of veg which doesn't make much sense for a bowl. They upcharged me for adding the diced and mixed version of the exact same veggies with a bit of parsley mixed in. They also lost points because the drink lids for the regular size drink didn't fit and both our drinks leaked on the way back to the office. And thank goodness we had utensils already at the office because the utensil holder at the restaurant was disgusting dirty. 

As for the food, it wasn't anything special. The chicken was overcooked and rubbery. The hummus was bland. Overall, I don't think I'd give this place a second shot, there just wasn't anything motivating me to return."}
{"text":"I took my 3 kids to dinner here and we each got different things and everyone really enjoyed their food. I got the kabob with a build your own bowl. The food was fresh and very good. We tried the jalapeño hummus and sriracha hummus. It was fresh and very flavorful. We also tried the original and it was fair, not enough flavor. My son enjoyed his falafel and daughters both enjoyed their steak wrap and steak build your own bowl. I wish I had tried the PB sauce. My kids really liked it. The baklava was fair. My kids liked it but I didn't think it tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome. Kinda pricey. Got the gyro wrap. So far I have been here twice. Even if it looks busy the line still moves fast. Warning, if you take this back to the office other will want some. :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place. So many things to choose from. Big portions for the money. I am frequent customer. Everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My go to spot for lunch when I'm in the area, and even when I'm not..  sure the lines are always long, but a well trained staff keeps that crowd moving at a fast pace. 

I usually opt for the build your own bowl, i choose any of the 3-4 flavors of hummus offered and start with some lentils, from there I add pickles, beets (their beets are amazing), cucumber, olives, tomato, some feta, and THE BEST GARLIC PASTE EVER.. and another scoop and another scoop.. finally choosing my meat .. usually gyro or chicken. 

Don't forget to enter your number at the register for great rewards too!"}
{"text":"Place was BOMB! Got to create my own delicious  concoction of my favorite middle eastern freshness. It's definitely a Chipotle for Middle Eastern food. This place is on my list of go to's from here on in. Absolutely yummy!"}
{"text":"Pita Bistro is the perfect place to get my falafel fix. I love the wrap, which is customizable with plenty of topping options. Their falafel comes fresh from the fryer and the cilantro jalapeno hummus is the bomb. They also offer bowls and salads, all for under $10. They also offer hummus + pita chips, baklava, and juices and smoothies, though I haven't tried these yet. It's a cute fast food joint with plenty of options that can accommodate for dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Amazing food and smoothies. Healthy choses too. Friendly staff. They take care of you. I had a big order and she was so patient with me. Love their earn rewards program. Definitely this is my go to place. 5 stars"}
{"text":"It's affordable, build-your-own Mediterranean that'll get you full quick!

The good: Portions are like gigantic, and you will struggle to finish it. Everything can be customized to a great extent. The hummus bowls are so dense you'll need a whole day to finish them, and the falafel you can top them with is great. Their gyros are a vastly different style than what I'm used to, and are surprisingly more reminiscent of doner kebab, which I miss greatly. And did I mention it's inexpensive? This stuff is like 7-8 bucks. I love it. 

The bad: dude, IDK why anyone would opt to have everything thrown in their gyro. Rice is cool, but rice AND lentils...and pickles? This just doesn't belong! They will always ask you if you want ALL the things since it saves them time, as opposed to you choosing step by step. 

The ugly: why is the food so lukewarm? I'm not asking for it to be boiling hot, but heavens...at this time of year the outdoor temperature is significantly warmer than what I've been served. 

Overall, I do like this spot for lunch, and everyone I've sent their way liked it even more. Give it a try, you may love it yourself!"}
{"text":"They have some good deals. The food was amazing too. I'll be coming back. It would nice to know the calories on each meal."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh modern Mediterranean cuisine.
Thanks for the healthy hummus bowl!  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a quick lunch.  Plus the staff is great."}
{"text":"Quality and cleanliness has improved. Glad to see. Updating my review. Falafel is still amazing."}
{"text":"I'm \"the duke\" of the original location haha, so definitely a fan. The hummus seems to be made differently at this location. It's good, but thinner, and flavored differently. More tahini I think"}
{"text":"Chipotle for Greek food! What?!?! It's very well kept inside, spunky environment with a bar and tvs! So happy I stopped here, the pita chips are superb. Staff was extremely friendly and was not pricey at all. I will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Good value for what you pay for. It's not top of the line Mediterranean...meaning it's not authentic. Definitely americanized but it's super good. Best fast food-type Mediterranean. I like it a lot more than garbanzos. The cilantro jalapeño hummus was flavorful and so was the chicken kebab. I love that they have fresh juices as well (and affordable compared to Nektar or Whole Foods). We had the Beach Bum which was kind of weird because of the cucumber but really good. Staff is super friendly and nice. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of Pita Bistro! It is always fresh and incredibly savory! The establishment is clean and friendly. They have a full bar and happy hr as well! It is a fav in our house. 

I always get the bowl with brown rice and lettuce with orig hummus and extra jalapeños and cucumbers! Extra PB sauce is a must and both proteins gyro and chicken. Btw the chicken is amazing! I also get a falafel order of 3 - Best falafel in town!!!! They also have a great juice bar - the kale cleanse is a not miss! 

Overall it's a not miss here in town 100%"}
{"text":"I got the falafel bowl here and its delicious! It really fill you up. Pro tip: Get the tzatziki in the bowl!"}
{"text":"One word, incredible! Not just the food but the staff working there too! This place is fresh, healthy, clean and fast. Vegans options on point and the employee was really cool about the request to change his gloves. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new fav spots! The food is so tasty and healthy! Customer service is always amazing. The staff there are all super sweet! Love this place! Yum!"}
{"text":"Catered company function that Pita Bistro was supposed to bring food.  Our start time was 5:30.  We requested they be there at 5:20.  Pita Bistro didn't show up until 5:40.  By the time they brought everything in and set up it was 5:50.  They didn't provide enough plates, or plastic ware.  We had two large salads and 8oz. Of dressing.  Not impressed with service.  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  I would never use this company again to cater a company event."}
{"text":"my regular lunch stop.  Build your own Humus bowl...  i recommend the Siracha humus... chopped Mediterranean, load it with everything and their chicken is delicious.  Only think I don't like, if you choose chips they put it in the bowl... if you want them on the side instead, you have to buy a side hummus for $1.99.  i just want a few chips like you would put in the bowl for free... just don't want them to get soggy and put on the side.. but they wont do that."}
{"text":"They call themselves the Chipotle of Mediterranean food but this place is 100000x better than any Chipotle! We ended up getting the kebab bowl and a gyro. Came back again so we could have that all over again!! Staff is friendly and chill. Music was chill with a mix of upbeat also. They also have a bar and they do cater!"}
{"text":"We were in the area so the family and I stopped in to grab dinner on the way home. We each ordered something different as we tend to sample each others food. This turned out to be a problem as now none of us know what we want to order most when we go back.
Jessica, the young lady who helped us, was patient and answered all of our questions while keeping the experience fun and making us feel welcomed! This spot will be a regular in our dining routine."}
{"text":"Completely mediocre.  The original hummus has no flavor, what they call tzaiziki is fatty and bland.  With so many better options within a 10 minute drive, I am amazed they're still open.  First timer, last timer."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to the airport to grab a bite. We were pleasantly surprised that they had a full bar and TV's. Both of us had a create-your-own salad, which was cool because you can choose whatever you want, and the servings are very generous. They spread a full layer of hummus on the bottom of the container, which serves as a great base and pretty much eliminates the need for dressing. 

The reason for the 3-star rating is the simple fact that their pita bread was sub-par. I've had better from the grocery store. If you're going to call yourself a \"Pita Bistro\", you better be darn sure that your pita bread is great."}
{"text":"think chipotle style for healthy fresh Mediterranean  cuisine my husband And i both enjoyed our bowls and so did my children accommodating for kids since no kid menu all fresh ingredients place super clean"}
{"text":"This place is pretty sweet. The ambience of it is pretty awesome and the modern look of the plAce from the seating to even the bathrooms is very nice. The food is pretty good. The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because they don't have tzatziki sauce."}
{"text":"This place was a great find! It's like the Chipotle of Greek food. And they really piled on the meat. I had it for lunch and dinner. Got the salad this time. I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I am extremely disappointed.  I wanted to order a gyro and apparently they didn't have any pita bread ?? Pita bistro didn't have pita bread?! Wth?   So I decided on a bowl well they were out of all rice choices?! Seriously ?!"}
{"text":"Very tasty bowls. Chicken was pretty dry. Vegetables were fresh. Red pepper hummus was a little bland. Overall a good portion for the money. Music was way too loud. Hard to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"I think I'm addicted to their homemade pita chips and hummus!  I'm from Detroit, the Mecca of middle eastern food and the chicken shawarma and garlic dip is as close as I can get to the real thing. Greek fries are good too but they have a creamy dressing instead of the traditional oily type but they're good! The sriacha hummus is soooo good! I eat here at least once a week! Go early tho bc the line goes out the door and can be intimidating the first time you're there. Huge falafel too!!"}
{"text":"A-MOH-ZING!

So, Im on this healthy kick. Trying to not sacrifice taste but not feel like I go into a coma after I eat. And this... just hits the spot.

I got a make your own salad. It was great, tastey. The spice on the falafels were on point. 
The hummus was average, but since I got a salad bowl I wont doc points for that. The price was great. Yes yes yes....  go here!!! Great Lunch Spot!"}
{"text":"One of the best modern Mediterranean kitchens in the locality! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite addiction! The wraps are the best. Definitely recommend the steak wrap with extra pb dip. Prices are reasonable and if I'm not feeling like a wrap they have other option like hummus bowls and salads. The jalapeno hummus tastes like guacamole it's great!"}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good - similar to a chipotle in style. The food however is overpriced and the store is understaffed. Cool in concept and not in reality."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place but today I don't know if the girl was new but for a $20 lunch I am less then pleased. She did not understand anything I said. I had to repeat every item at least 2 times so she kept putting stuff on wrong item screwing up both lunches. Putting on onions on one That I? didn't ask for it on the one I did ask for it on only got a couple this went on from start to finish with my order."}
{"text":"This food is so delicious! The gyro wraps are perfectly sized and fill you up. Not only is that good, but their Pb Style fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"Three of us went there for the first time after hearing about it from a friend and looking up the menu online.  I ordered the gyro wrap and WOW, it was great.  You can select all the fresh vegie items, flavored hummus, and a variety of other things to put inside at no additional charge (like the PB dip - Awesome!).  Then they pile on a boatload of meat!  I could barely finish it.  Oh, the prices are extremely reasonable.  We'll be back next week for the chicken!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever I'm leaving Sky Harbor Airport or whenever I'm in the neighborhood! A friend first introduced me to it after he went there three times while in town for training, since then my fiance and I do in at least twice a month! My favorite thing to order is the Build A Bowl with the Gyro meat and you must try the PB dip! On one visit I ordered a build your own salad, which didn't seem any different on what you can add and the price is the same as build a bowl. I prefer eating the food there because it is so fresh and I usually can't wait to eat it. Besides the bowls, they also have wraps and fresh smoothies made to order. They have added an alcohol bar since our first visits, which confused me a little since it seemed like a healthy option rather then a hangout spot. But over all the establishment is clean and the food is good!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I chose Pita Bistro for my only meal in Phoenix. Being unfamiliar with some of the choices , two employees walked  me through, taking plenty of time to explain each choice. The result was a DELICIOUS combination  of flavors and textures. Yum!! Wish we had one of these in Tucson!"}
{"text":"Outstanding for the price!!!

This is basically Chipotle but Mediterranean food. It's good, it's fresh, the PB sauce is basically the same Garlic Mayo type sauce that they have over at Haji Baba (the best in the state). 

For $7.95 you build your own bowl and its enough to keep you full for a day. Great food. I hope they open one of these in Chandler."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Delicious food! Clean bathroom, free wifi. What more could you want. Highly recommend getting chips and hummus. Going to recommend this place to all my friends. Keep up the good work, Pita Bistro."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to come for falafel and GREEK FRIES (mmmmmmm), it is always empty when I come here which makes me wonder what could possibly be wrong with it? I have always had a great experience! The food is moderately priced and they offer many options, it is like a Chipotle for mediterranean food which is funny considering Chipotle is right next door. Keep up the tasty work guys!"}
{"text":"1 star solely due to the service. Walked in around 4 PM on a Thursday and it was completely empty. There was only one worker and she was sitting at a table on her phone (that's fine!) but as me and my boyfriend went to look at the menu she got up and starting cussing/yelling on the phone. Immediately walked out as I did not want to deal with an angry person. 

Note she clearly saw us walk in and knew we were in there. 

UPDATE: Tried Pita Bistro again and it was a great experience! The employees were very welcoming and the food was great! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I tried one of the steak wraps and it looked nothing like the picture on their menu.  This is basically an attempt to create a Chipolte type casual dining experience for Greek food.  The meat in the wrap was chopped in little squares and sitting in it's own juices before being added to the wrap.  Not quite the Greek concept of grilling the meat fresh or slicing it as the gyro is made.  I love steak but I had to throw half of it away."}
{"text":"Completely addicted to their chicken swarma! SOOOO good. Best place for lunch on a busy business day!"}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy lunch or dinner for the family that is reasonably priced? This is the place! The staff is extremely nice and the dining area is spacious, inviting and bright. Don't delay on trying this restaurant out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this little joint doesn't get busier. The gentlemen behind the line tonight was extremely friendly and helped me pick what toppings I wanted on my pita wrap by letting me try samples. Highly suggest this place for a quick bite to eat:)"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! I think it was a bit intimidating since I had never eaten Mediterranean food before. Limited info I the menu and the line was forever long - so not optimal for asking questions. 

The food was really tasty! It wasn't to heavy. 
They have a small bar area too!"}
{"text":"Thank you to Nas G. of Pita Bistro for making things right! After my 1st visit I was a bit disappointed in the angus beef wrap I ordered. Disappointed because I love Mediterranean and this was a new place fairly close to the office. I went back to give it another shot, sort of a 2nd date and I was more than satisfied! I even took a co-worker with me that loved the Chicken Shawarma wrap! I would definitely recommend Pita Bistro.

Thanks again Nas! I am definitely a fan now!!"}
{"text":"It was SO YUMMY! I've been searching for Mediterranean food close by and finally found something worth it! I had the Falafel wrap and it was too good! Can't wait to return for more! Btw, SUPER CLEAN and super nice"}
{"text":"AWESOME! Everything about this place is awesome! I got referred here by a friend and decided to bring my wife. She got the chicken sandwich and I made a create your own bowl. Chicken is marinated perfectly and the ADD-ONs! Where do I start, from the different choices of hummus to the PB dip. There are so many choices! 

Ambience is cool with a nice bar for cocktails and some tv's, very modern. 

Next time I'm gonna have to try one of there raw juices, they looked great."}
{"text":"This is genius!  Like Chipotle but Greek food ....I created my own hummus bowl.  Big portions and tons of fresh options"}
{"text":"Another great meal here. I've had the chicken shawarma and a couple different hummus choices. Great food so far. Last time I had gyro and it was great too. The only disappointment is the jalapeño cilantro hummus was not flavorful enough for me. They even have fresh juices if you're in the mood to be super healthy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! And it was right down the street from where my boyfriend and I used to live. What a gem. As the name gives away, Pita Bistro is where you can get a pita from. I always got the chicken shawarma (chicken, lettuce, tomato, pickle, hummus, tzaziki sauce) with extra tzaziki sauce! Delicious! One of the better shwarmas I've had in my life. This place also has smoothies and a little bar. It is very mod and such a gem in the middle of a slightly sketchy area. I highly recommend. Remember to ask for extra tzaziki."}
{"text":"More of a fast food joint than a traditional bistro.  Staff wasn't overly enthusiastic. I did the take out and while at my hotel I found a hair in my pita.  Very dissatisfied and wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"The food here is just average. it is a typical Mediterranean fast food joint where it's like as assembly line kind of setting. The seasoning on the chicken kabob was only so-so. They have 4 types of hummus, of which I only liked the sriracha flavored hummus. You can order either the wraps or make it a bowl.The salad ingredients are all fresh and good.. However, I would not recommend this place if you are looking for good Mediterranean flavors."}
{"text":"Pita Bistro is a good place to build your own Mediterranean bowl. I love that I can choose all my own topping including the protien...which my favorite is the Chicken Shaworma. The smoothies are good as well. This visit was a little sad because the gyro was way too dry and had to replace it with chicken kabob."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place and we were pleasantly surprised at the high quality and freshness of the ingredients. Fast sit down similar to chipotle but much more variety and options- what a great concept. Superior customer service from the employees and will definitely be back, very reasonably priced as well. Great job Pita Bistro!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this cute Mediterranean spot- walk through the line and make your choices. They line the bottom of your bowl with your choice of hummus and then you choose lentils, rice, tabbouleh etc. All the meat choices look delectable. The food was super flavorful. My only complaint is that the chicken was not hot. Unfortunate as I was there when the doors opened so you would expect hot off the grill."}
{"text":"Tried to go here for lunch with my coworker.  The parking lot was nuts and there was a line almost out the door.  We had to pass that day, but came back once it slowed down on another day.  I had the Mediterranean Nachos, which were okay, but not something I'd stand in line a half hour for.  My coworker thought is was only okay too.  He had a bowl of theirs that had gyro meat, rice, etc.  Overall I won't be back when I'm back in Tempe."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hummus bowl and it looked absolutely amazing. I had a little mixup on my order (completely my fault) and the owner Nas took such good care of me. Its really rare that you find a business that takes such great care and pride in customer satisfaction. I will definitely return. Great food and Great service at this place"}
{"text":"My company caters from this business numerous times per month in addition to weekly take out lunches.  I read the other reviews and have to believe that the negatives were somewhat exaggerated or Pita Bistro were having a really off day which we have never experienced.  Part of the reason we eat here so often is the customer service.  They are always accommodating.  The food is consistent and delicious.  The business is well kept and open for viewing.  We always treat new employees to their food!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! All the food tastes so healthy and well cooked! The pink punch is a delicious juice!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome!! What a great find. I used Uber Eats to order a falafel wrap and a Mediterranean chopped salad with tofu. 

Falafel wrap
Delicious! The falafel weren't greasy or overly salty and had the perfect amount of seasoning. I chose to get it with lentils and sriacha hummus, both which complimented this very well. The pita was also really really good. Blows Pita Jungle outta the water!

Mediterranean Chopped Salad
So fresh and so flavorful! It doesn't even need dressing! I had mine with tofu thinking it would just be boring tofu seasoned with salt & pepper. Nope! It's seasoned to perfection and has a wonderful flavor. 

Definitely give this place a try! I have an order being prepared as I'm writing this and can't wait to get it!"}
{"text":"So good.   Great food for a good value.  We were skeptical because this location has had several restaurants in it over the past year.   But this blew us away.   I had the hummus bowl and customized it, but i can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.  Get the PB dip, it is heavenly!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot. Their pita bowl is to die for! Get it with the jalapeño cilantro hummus and the saffron nice. Also, their garlic sauce is what dreams are made of. It's a little on the pricey side for an every day visit, but the flavors are amazing."}
{"text":"This place was actually really good. Even the hummus was okay, ( I'm middle eastern, nothing compares to the real thing). Their gyro is amazing, and so is their falafel."}
{"text":"I have passed this place many times on my way to and from work, and recently decided to stop in to pick up dinner.  I tried a salad and I got a hummus bowl for my boyfriend.  We both agreed the portions were pretty big.  However, next time I will probably just get a hummus bowl, bc the hummus bowl comes with salad in it, it just has extra stuff too!

I forgot all of what the choices of extras you could add to your bowl, but I remember there were lots of veggies, which I liked.

For all of the other reviews who said service wasn't that great, I would disagree.  The girl serving me my food was really friendly and took her time explaining things to me.  She also had me try their PB sauce, which was interesting bc it was vegan but it tasted really creamy.  I liked it!  Especially since I can't eat dairy.

I wouldn't say the flavors were out of this world, but I like that it's a healthy quick option for food, that is really convenient to where I live.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely give this place a try if you like shawarma, hummus, tabouli, and other Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean fare... I had a make-your-own hummus bowl w/ red pepper hummus, brown rice, lentils(!), a Mediterranean chopped salad (cucumbers, onions, tomatoes), beets, Kalamata olives, chickpeas, chicken shawarma(!), and this incredible Pb dip(!), which consists of lemon, olive oil, and garlic - mixing it in to the bowl made my tastebuds very happy! This was some of the best tasting food of this type, or any type, for that matter, that I've tasted in a long time. I'm looking forward to my next meal here already."}
{"text":"Pita Bistro has fresh-tasting delicious food, super friendly staff, clean environment, and is very affordable! They have a great selection of salads, wraps, hummus bowls, juices, and smoothies. Vegan and gluten-free options are available too! My favorite wrap here is the Hummus & Tabooli wrap, which I got again today as I was craving it since my last visit. You can also purchase deserts, salads, and hummus in their prepared foods cooler by the registers. They have a great deal on their delicious hummus so I had to buy some!

Upon walking inside Pita Bistro, you are greeted by friendly staff members and can select your meal from the menus on the wall before you get to the counter, which I think is a very casual and comfortable design that allows you to take some time before approaching the counter. Then it is a very straight forward order and your food is made pronto! Pita Bistro also uses the FiveStars rewards program (optional) and you simply enter your phone number and points are added to your account and you will eventually earn great discounts.

The indoor dining area is very relaxed and you can enjoy the upbeat music played at a subtle enjoyable volume where you can also engage in conversation.
It is amazing how clean and inviting Pita Bistro is. They really take pride in superior service and cleanliness!

Pita Bistro's location just southeast of Ray Rd and I-10 is perfect for nourishment before and/or after a day of hiking and biking the nearby South Mountain park. You can also shop at the local stores such as Home Depot, Toys \"R\" Us, Golfsmith, Lamps Plus, and Bed Bath and Beyond (in the Chandler Pavilions shopping area). 

To sum it up, great food, welcoming environment, fast service, and a fun relaxing environment all made for a very enjoyable time and is why I am a regular here and suggest you dine here!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome I love the staff very friendly and the food is amazing.. Love the create your own gyro the hummus is on point..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Pita Bistro. However, this location only gets negative marks for the location itself. The parking is near impossible, the capacity is nowhere near sufficient for the traffic. Again, this is not on the business itself, just the location. I highly recommend the Chandler location!"}
{"text":"Ok so this place is consistently good and deserves an update to 4 stars. It's also pretty much the only healthy food option in this immediate area. Love all the bowl toppings and their food is fresh. Service is always great. 

If I'm in the mood for Mediterranean food and I'm in the area, it's definitely my go-to! They also have fresh pressed juices and smoothies. Parking is also easy (except during the lunch time rush)."}
{"text":"If you like options and you like gyros, schwarma, falafel, or all of the above, this is the place to go. It's like chipotle because you get to choose what you want going down the line but it's way healthier! This is a sweet place! Friendly staff - they gave us free falafel balls, and two bags of pita chips with hummus. The jalapeño cilantro hummus is really good. Only thing I would change is the pita bread could be a bit softer and the pita chips less salty, but it's a swell place. Go here! Also, smoothies!"}
