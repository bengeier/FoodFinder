{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday night, had the tasting menu.. Lovely ambiance and decor. Our first good experience - we needed a late reservation which they more than happily accommodated! Most places won't take late reservations for tasting menus.

For the reasonable price ($50 for 6 courses), we were expecting 6 fairly small courses, but were pleasantly surprised to realize they were close to full size courses!  

The 6 courses this night were:

- 2 oysters 
- Kohlrabi salad (spicy, but to die for)
- Tuna Tartare
- Pig cheek with homemade perogies
- Grilled shrimp and crab chowder tortellini
- Dessert

Favourites were the pig cheek - because of the homemade perogies - and the kohlrabi salad, so simple yet so tasty.

We did the wine pairings too, which were all well selected to match the food.

Kitchen typically closes at 11, but we started at 10 and took our time for 6 courses, so weren't done till 12.30! No complaints from the staff, they stayed open and were wonderful. I usually rate only for food, but in this case service deserves a special mention. Had a great night!"}
{"text":"Brunch at L'Ouvrier

A nice surprise in a quiet and beautiful location. Ordered the  \"potato rosti, smoked salmon, crème fraîche, fried shallots & capers\" -$13, was presented very nicely, which was pleasant  in the morning. 

Unfortunately the salmon had a little bit of a tangy taste, but the potato rosti was excellent. Not very filling, but was able to finish my plate. I enjoyed the venue more than anything else, loved the design details. Lots of square tables but the odd large round tables, where we sat, made it great  to converse.

Others complained that the traditional brunch choices were a little greasy."}
{"text":"PROs:
- The décor is super cute! Love the pink and white theme! Definitely can see why it would be considered a perfect place for brunch
- Very friendly server and hostess
- Wait was less than 10 minutes at around 12:30 on a Saturday
- Food was good. Not great. But good.

CONs:
- There was nothing on the menu that really makes you say, \"Ooh, I want to try that!\" =( There are so many awesome brunch places in Toronto that throw you into a dilemma because there are a myriad of amazing choices. At L'Ouvrier, I was also in a dilemma - but only because I had a hard time deciding what would be worth trying. 
- Just as another reviewer mentioned, the potato rosti is too small! GAHHH! WHY DIDN'T I TRUST MY FELLOW YELP REVIEWER?! For $14, it just wasn't enough. (I saw another review from March stating it was $11. Hmm.) Presentation of the dish also wasn't practical for eating. I can see now why the server suggested adding eggs to the dish for a surcharge. Sigh.

Meh. There is too much brunch awesomeness in Toronto to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"As someone who has been working in hospitality for years, I feel it is my moral obligation to recount the nightmarish particulars of my last visit to L'Ouvrier. 
 
Off the top, I must say that this was not my first visit. I have been brunching here for a while now, maybe my fifth visit overall. It is a nice bright spot, however decor slightly pretentious and overdone. The service staff are almost always sauntering and their lack of enthusiasm is reminiscent of the 90's apathy trend.
 
Food is good, however almost always contains hair. I guess you can say the food is great - if you consider the fact that someone could literally keep coming back overlooking the excess of free floating coiffure in their cuisine. 
 
Now, to the events which that brought me to Yelp...
 
We arrive, no one in line. It took a while for the any one to even acknowledge us. We kindly ask if we can eat at the bar. The hostess says there is no room at the bar, and then in a sitcom-like fashion we all turn our heads to the bar to see a near bevy of seats. As a joke alternative, I ask if we can sit there to wait for a table. She says yes. 
 
A bit of a HEALTH & SAFETY note here - craving a Caesar, I immediately noticed the glasses on the bar which were drying on rags. This is not safe, as all glassware should be dried on mesh mat liners, where the glass is able to breath. Drying glassware on rags is not only disgusting because rags are gross and are used for so many different purposes but also because the glass cannot let in oxygen therefore creating a surface inside for bacteria to grow and manifest. Please L'Ouvrier, if you hate everything about this review please listen to this at the very least. You need to change this about your bar.
 
So I'll just break it down now to the main points of the brunch:
 
- We were ignored at our table for 20 minutes
- Hair in my tuna tartare, food came back literally seconds after it be taken off the table. Aka the hair was just picked out
- Server spilled a cup of coffee all over the table and my brand new iphone
- Server was very unapologetic 
- Nothing was done to make us feel better about our experience, at all. Nothing. Not even a simple smile or sorry.
 
As a server, I believe you should not let anyone walk out of your restaurant unhappy about their experience. People come to restaurants not just for the food, but to have a good time and be taken care of by friendly and competent staff. We were finally greeted at the end by the OWNER of the restaurant (per request). At this point I thought this would be our saving grace, finally someone who cares. Maybe to see if my phone is ok or if it's completely damaged or to apologize for the frenzy of fringe I had been reduced to. \"Spilling coffee is a human error and as for the hair, that shouldn't happen. Desert is on us if you guys like\"... Not even an apology? This is your business, take pride in what you have put into this restaurant. For this, I say for shame. I will be re-telling this story to those asking about L'Ouvrier, or even those who don't."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an early start to the day, you won't be starting it at L'ouvrier since they don't open until 11am for brunch. But what do I care, I'm not an early riser anyway.

So, onto the food...

I have a weak spot for fresh scones and donuts so whenever I see them on the menu, it's almost a guarantee I'll get them.  My brunch at here was no different and we started with the Daily Homemade Scones - with preserves and crème fraiche ($6). The order came with two large, hot scones. While they were moist and tasted delicious with the preserves and crème fraiche, they were on the dense side. Since the scones were so large and heavy, the two of us shared one scone and packed the second to go.

Grilled Cheese - with aged cheddar and raisin-walnut bread ($10). My mom ordered this and I don't think I'd ever order this on my own since the raisin-walnut bread didn't sound too appealing to me. But boy was I wrong. The grilled cheese sandwich was delicious and the stand-out was really the bread! 

Fried Egg Sandwich - aged cheddar, house smoked bacon and fries ($13): The sandwich was served on plain, white, buttery bread. The egg was nicely fried with a runny yolk that coated the sandwich. Although the sandwich was tasty, I wouldn't say it was anything special. However, I will say one thing. The sandwich was served with their house smoked bacon which blew my mind. I couldn't finish the sandwich, but I made sure I got my hands on every last bit of bacon in it. The sandwich also came with a mountain of fries... which weren't as crisp as I would have preferred.

Overall, a decent brunch. Nothing really blew my mind, but if you live in the area, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Pleasant spot. Slightly above average brunch but a good atmosphere. The service was very slow. It took about 15 minutes to get our coffees which were cold and the food about 40 minutes. We came at 1:00 PM on a Saturday so busy... but not too bustling. 

I don't think I will come back. There are definitely more interesting and good service brunch spots that Toronto has to offer."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a bit biased because I went there for my birthday and my date opened his big mouth and announced it was my birthday.

Anyway ... let's start with the overall vibe and feel of the resto when you walk in.  Very very minimalist.  And whimsically quirky.  Plastic chairs with purposely made to be rustic tables.  Teeny vases with teeny sprigs of a bouquet in them.  Nails were hammered into the walls and yarn was strewn about them.  I didn't get it but I liked it.  That being said, all of this was housed in a room that seemed a little too big.  So conversations bounced off the floor and walls.  But ironically st ill felt absolutely intimate.  Also, pay attention when finding this place at night.  There is a pink light in the window.  Otherwise, you'll miss it.  I thought I was going to some weird underground sex party held in an abandoned store.  Part of the charm

The crowd was of the Dundas West variety.  The first wave of hipsters who are at the crossroads of American Apparel and Harry Rosen.  So not as annoying, but still rocking those terrible oversized glasses.  Despite that, it was a good vibe.

Service:  We had this wonderful, delightful and adorable server named Antoinette.  Off the bat, she was upbeat and passionate about the restaurant.  When my date told her it was my bday, she got so excited that you would have thought it was her birthday.  She was absolutely attentive and one of the best servers I've ever had.  The service she gave to us, I could she she was just as great with her other tables.

Food:  Where do I even start?  On Antoinette's advice, we had the lamb shank ravioli and arugula salad to start with.  Salad was typical of any other resto ... not much you can do with an arugula salad.  So thumbs up.  But the ravioli.  They sat on a bed of pureed cauliflower (I think) and ... it was just delicious.  Period.  I highly recommend it.  So does Antoinette.

I then had a butternut squash ravioli (called \"love letters\").  It was sweet and flavourful.  The wine we had went wonderfully with it.  Which I can't remember right now.  It was a chardonnay of some sort.

My date's salmon was moist and flavourful as well.

Portions all around were good ...

We were surprised with a dessert plate.  The flourless chocolate cake was to die for.  The Eton mush (not what it's officially called) was a strawberry and crunchy sweet thing mushed with a cream.  AMAZING.  And then there was a raisin thing.  I hate raisins.

My date and I decided to join the bar after dinner.  We didn't order anything too special ... just vodka sodas.  But once again, the staff was incredible.  I felt like the most special person in the room and it's mostly because of the level of service, followed very closely by the delicious meal, that I will be dragging everyone I know back."}
{"text":"Very good food and decently priced. Dinner was a hit with service, Antoinette was a peach! Lunch/Brunch needs a serious revamp in service. Servers were inattentive, plates not were not cleared, and drinks were not offered in a restaurant with three filled tables and three servers. A simple over sight that can be easily fixed in time. 

Quality checks and some more attention and this place is gold."}
{"text":"I've been coming here consistently with all my friends for over a year now but I just had a terrible experience that will put an end to this run...

Service was slow from the start.  My brunching partner, who is a server, noted that we should have been acknowledged by now (the clock had been ticking). Once our server came around, we were greeted with the sullen attitude of a 90's Korn fan. Nay, Limp Bizkit fan.

I was fine with her new-goth attitude in the beginning, because being a Limp Bizkit fan is more of a lifestyle, and hey, who am I to judge. The problems really started after she spilled what felt like a years worth of coffee all over our table and my friend's cell phone while she was putting the food down. Her response was \"I do that once a brunch.  Imagine how good your food will taste after this is over\". \"Sorry, not sorry\" I'm sure she was wittily repeating in her mind. lol.

As our poorly wiped table dripped coffee onto our knees, creating a puddle around our shoes, my friend looked down at her tuna tartar and saw a beautiful blonde wavy hair in it.  The hair was long, golden, and seemed to have some Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray coating it.  Disgusting.  We called Limp Bizkit over to take the plate back and bring a new one.

After our meal, I went to the Manager (or owner) to express our bad experience. The way she handled it was completely wrong and I actually began to feel bad for the servers.  

In grand conclusion, food is good, but often has hair in it (this wasn't the first time).  I recommend that all staff wear beard guards.  Service is good 60% of the time, but the one bad time will always ruin your day.  Owner/Manager needs some customer service training.  Will I go back? probz not.  Will I keep recommending this place to all my friends? Maybe as an April Fools joke and the joke will be hair in your food."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. It has an open, bright interior and the place is so big that the tables are spaced out really well.

Their coffee is excellent: nothing beats french press! Why don't more brunch places do this? Their tea cups remind me of my tea sets from when I was five. Adorable.

The food was also excellent. I ordered a potato rosti and it came with arugula on top as well as creme fresh and smoked salmon. So good!

Eat here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"L'Ouvrier is French for worker and is an homage to Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, where the following passage can be found: \"The cook does not look upon himself as a servant, but as a skilled workman; he is generally called 'UN OUVRIER'

This new resto on the Dundas west strip, in a former dingy after-hours space is simply transformed into a minimalist large open white room with a mishmash of tables of different shapes and sizes.  We are seated in a circular table meant for a large party but we are just a party of 2 however there were no tables that were size appropriate for us as the resto was completely full and bustling with activity. 

The menu has hints of different worldy dishes and we settle for a smattering of items like a platter of P.E.I oysters, roasted beet and maple glaze salad and a tuna tartare appetizer (which was their seafood du jour).   They come and go and to be honest, while the dishes were good, there was nothing too memorable about them.
We order duck as one of our entrees which has crispy skin but is a little on the dry side which was a bit disappointing.  The portion size was big and the compliments of kale and potatoes tossed in duck fat (mmm) on the plate were nice.  Our other entree was seared scallops which are tender and flavourful on a bed of coucous
Again with all new restaurants, I always come back to try them again a few months down the road when more of their growing pains have been sorted.  I was also distracted by good company so unfortunately my memory of the food is distant and not very specific.
Definitely one of the new hotspots, lots of people, busy and noisy but a fun place for a cocktail and catch up!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here on Sunday and I thought it was excellent. Mind you, we arrived right at 11 so there wasn't a problem finding seating. Service was fast and food was delicious. Every order came out perfect. The only issue was substituting breads for toast which cost an additional $1. This appeared on the bill but we weren't told when ordering. No biggy! The coffee bodum idea is great even though it seem to be a $$ grab since 1 bodum on the table served 3 ppl. and all three persons were charged $3 each. A $9 coffee bodum is a bit much.  All in all I would give the place a big thumbs up and would recommend and would definitely return. It was also nice to see a baby in the resto too. I feel happy now bcs I can bring along my little ones next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The ambiance of the restaurant is so cool and their food is always so inventive and imaginative! Always a hit every time I go! The staff is always really nice. Really one of my favourite restaurants!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a Saturday just by walking the hood. What a great discovery. 
Happy service. Mellow doo wap music.
Reasonable prices.
Oh yeah!  The food.
Amazing home  fries like a ton of them.
The grilled cheese and brisket sand which - par excellence. 
Gotta rush back for more. Au  revoir ."}
{"text":"Really tired of people giving Restos bad reviews because of \"small portions\". If you want a bowl fit for a pig, go to chipotle or McDonalds. We were a group of 8 for my bachelorette night, overall, great experience!

Yes portions are smaller than the previously mentioned chipotle but that is because this is not mass produced. Had the oysters (wasn't my choice, I'd rather go to Rodney's) beef tartar - perfect. Had the tuna tataki, prepared very well and the baked Alaska which was sweet and lovely as a dessert should be.

The service was great, we had a great server, he was attentive, very sweet and quite hipster which fits the neighbourhood of course. 

Ambience was awesome, quiet, not like everything else, dinner service was not quick which is perfect for those nights when you're out to enjoy the night and not just shove down food. There were a few large groups like us and a few couples as well.

In addition, I told the restaurant it was a special event and asked nicely for drinks upon arrival and they provided us with frozen drinks made out of wine which were delicious and were on the house.

Loved this place, would come back for sure, great ambience, food and service. Oh and the value is by far better than most Restos in the area."}
{"text":"With so many restaurants in the city offering up a brunch menu these days, the choices can be overwhelming, and more often than not you just end up sticking to what you know in fear of trying something new only to find it to be sub-par.  So when I recently ventured to L'Ouvrier for a Sunday brunch, I was overjoyed to have found a place where this was definitely not the case, and was already excited about returning to my new found brunch spot.  

Although the restaurant itself is quite small and really nothing extravagent to look at - it has basic white walls, tables and chairs - it is the menu and the friendly service which really make the place!

The brunch menu offers a classic style breakfast (which includes 2 eggs, bacon, buttered toast, fries, and a grilled tomato) of substantive size, but also offers a b.l.t, burger, salad, french toast, yoghurt, and even some more elaborate options including a tuna tartare and an oyster dish.

I tried the classic style breakfast and found it to be both delicious and filling.  Trust me, you will not leave hungry!  But my absolute favourite part of the meal was the French Press Coffee.  The coffee is brought directly to the table in the press, and you can fill your cup as needed so that the coffee stays warm.  Now if only other brunch spots in the city would adopt this same idea, as coffee in a French Press is sooo much better than the bottomless cups of drip coffee offered at the majority of brunch spots in the city.  Good quality coffee is truly hard to find, but at L'Ouvrier they have truly done something right, and at the price of $3 per person it's really hard to pass up!

Keep up the good work L'Ouvrier - I will definitely be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful spot and so spacious!! The place was pretty hoppin on a saturday afternoon, but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Our server was very friendly and service was efficient ( i.e i dropped my knife on the ground and a server immediately picked it up and replaced it with a new one, james bond stylez). 

I ordered the smoke salmon on a potato rosti and it was pretty good. Everything on the dish complemented each other very well and the potato rosti was really crispy and flavourful ( i just wish there was more of it!). I really liked how the capers were crushed/mashed as I typically find solid capers too salty on their own."}
{"text":"Ive had 3 great meals here in he past 12 months. The staff is always very friendly, prices reasonable, and the food is great. I recommend the tartar, either steak or tuna depending on the menu, along with the duck confit."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly came to L'Ouvrier for brunch with the family visiting on Sunday morning. This place gets busy, fast but the 5 of us were sat at the corner of the bar (so we could all chat and see eachother) and enjoyed our coffee. We decided to forgo the table as we were cozy at our post at the bar.

Our party had the burger with a fried egg on top (amazing!) x 2, eggs with fries, roasted tomato and toast (typical breakfast fare, but great), french toast (my sister said it tasted exactly like that childhood cereal - cinnamon toast crunch, but way better) and the blt (huge and yum!)

Though we didn't have any cocktails, I noticed they were serving champagne by the glass (always a plus)!

Nice work L'ouvrier, you've knocked dinner and brunch out of the park!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here!!! Everything on this menu is amazing! The only reason this review is one star short of 5 is because just over a month ago I made plans with my friends to go for some delicious bunch before I moved to NYC. We made the 40 minute drive all the way to Dundas and Bathurst, paid for parking, went to open the door, only to notice a sign stating 'closed for private event'. 
This was on a Saturday, they only serve brunch on Saturday and Sunday. I had made it all that way for nothing. There was no notification of a private event on their Instagram account or on their website. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I had no trouble getting a table here in the city of \"brunch is a contact sport\" when arriving early. if you want to eat brunch after 1200 you're going to be standing in line. PRO TIP: sit farther back in the dining room and try and face away from the street especially in winter(ie from sep to may, jk). The door opening will give you a chill and the queue of surly late risers staring at you can be annoying. L'ouvrier is very charming and the FoH staff are trying. The food tastes good. The coffee and tea are good. One day I'll have dinner here."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the new beet salad. It wasn't awful it's just that the predecessor was delicious."}
{"text":"Loved the interior, service,  ambience and size of lattes.  Came here for weekend brunch not really worth it.  Food wasn't great and took longer than necessary."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and got the tasting menu, while the decor is nice, the dining room is very roomy, it ended up being a very disappointing experience. 

Be warned, the pacing of the meal is very slow. We were sitting a good 30-40mins between courses. This is the reason why I'm leaving such a bad review. Not sure if it was an off night for them. 

Another word of warning, portions are quite small.  

First course was two oysters with different sauces. The oysters came out on a bed of rocks, not sure if the rocks or plate was chilled, but the oysters were about room temperature. Not used to having warm raw oysters...

Second course was three sticks of asparagus with fried shallots, pickled onions, tarragon aioli sauce. Not bad, but nothing amazing either. 

Third was ravioli. It was very light on filling, so you're really eating thick pieces of pasta. These were topped with seeds and heavy cream. Sauce was decent but I feel the flavours were very bland. Seeds were a good idea but could be improved if they were toasted or fried. 

Fourth is steak tartar with a smoked aioli and chips. Tartar was ok, a little strong on the horseradish. Chips were soggy with oil. Smoked aioli was good, flavourful! 

Fifth was tuna and steak. You get about a couple of slices of tuna and a slice of steak. I would approximate about 1oz serving of tuna and 1oz of steak. Tuna was good, the red pepper purée it came with was decent. Steak was flavourful but a little tough. But this is so far the best dish of the night. At this point we are now 2.5hrs into a 6 course tasting meal.

Final was a \"baked Alaska\". Ice cream with a brownie on top with a merengue on top. Dish wasn't chilled so some of the ice cream came melted. Over all it was all super sweet. If I wasn't so hungry I would not have risked diabetes by finishing it. 

Service is meh, there were two servers for the restaurant. And because the kitchen is so far away, they spend a lot of time walking instead of attending to people's needs. They are super friendly and helpful when you do get their attention though. 

If you do come here, maybe order off the menu and hopefully you will not have a 3hr dining experience where you are contemplating the etiquette of leaving half way though a tasting menu."}
{"text":"Quite impressed. Had the fixed price menu - 5 pretty amazing courses. And they even adjusted for food aversions in our group. Loved 4 out of the 5 dishes and the portions were generous. Desserts in particular we're exceptional - as was the tuna tartar and the amuse bouche. I would highly recommend L'ouvrier."}
{"text":"I went here for Brunch on Sunday last weekend. The service and food were amazing! Was busy, but we didn't have to wait in line. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Took my Cousins from New York here for brunch this morning. We're no longer the age where we always crave greasy bacon, eggs,and plain pancakes on a Sunday morning after a late night out (only sometimes) 
So L'ouvrier was first choice! First, the staff was super friendly and upbeat. The decor is minimal but with unique features. I loved getting my coffee in pretty china. It was so girly! Loved it! 

The food...
we got house made scones to share. Yum. Not too sweet and it came with a cranberry jelly which was nice and tart. 
I got the Rosti with smoked salmon. Really great change from my typical eggs Benedict go to.. 
My cousin got the walnut raisin grilled cheese. Nicely toasted and extra buttery, can't go wrong. 
My other cousin got the French toast with a side of eggs. She also enjoyed her dish. 
The total bill including coffee, latte and hot chocolate $65. 

I would recommend this place and would definitely go back again! 
Ps- my cousins really loved this place and it was a great way to end their trip here."}
{"text":"a worker's love letter

Another restaurant opened up in hipsterville.  It's unassuming, so unassuming that Aerie and I walked right by it.  We almost got to Clinton when we realized we had gone too far.

Quality Aerie-GG time is not frequent enough so we always make sure to pick a place that will make our taste buds happy.  The last time we got any one-on-one action was Bannock, and that was questionable happiness.

L'Ouvrier means worker, and the restaurant's philosophy has something to do with believing that food is less art and more hard work.  The space used to be an afterhours club, and well, you can tell.  It looks a bit like a pop-up restaurant.  The restaurant stripped everything down and kept the space raw and white except for some noticeable flashes of hot pink - one hot pink table and the aprons the servers wore.  I didn't like the decor, but after some digging, at least now I understand it: A friend, Courtney Wotherspoon, designed the installations for them:  The materials in the baggies hanging on the wall are evidently from the reno. 

Now to the food, Aerie and I had some quality time laughing over scones:
They were okay.  A little dense and dry.  The preserve was mango; I would have preferred something else. 


Both of our choices were served with really well-seasoned, well-cooked french fries):
 
Aerie's burger ($16) - She liked everything but the crumbling meat. 
Fried egg sandwich with house smoked bacon ($13) - I really, really liked this.  The bacon was so good.  Word of warning the bread was really, really buttery.  My hands were soaking in grease post-sandwich. 
  
It was a lovely brunch.  And we worked off some of the delicious calories by taking a nice stroll through the city.  Quality time is so very precious."}
{"text":"I went here for a casual birthday dinner with my family. The physical space was fantastic - spacious, airy, industrial but warmed by the perfect lighting and wood accents. Service was great. 

Had the tuna tartare to start - was almost like a deconstructed sushi with the seaweed wrap and sesame sheets placed to the side alongside ginger and some celery for some crunch.

Had the beef burger for the main - cooked to perfection and balanced nicely with the brioche bun. Many many fries --- shared it with the rest of the table. 

Tried both the lemon tart and the baked Alaska for the dessert and was partial to the latter although both were good. 

Definitely will come back to try their brunch menu and to have dinner again."}
{"text":"Walking just East of Bent on Dundas (Bent, by the way, was quite busy) you could easily walk right past this place - only one other table was there when we arrived at 7:00 pm on a Tuesday.

Service was friendly and laid-back.  Good cocktail list with a mix of choices; we settled on wine.  They give you a jug of water for the table, something I always appreciate.  The room was really warm so wear a sweater you can remove!

The menu has a good variety of choices as well, a lot of things that caught my eye, and helpful, detailed descriptions of each choice (am I the only one who hates this fad in menus that just says 'tartar' and doesn't list what else is on the plate?).  We shared a tuna tartar to start and it was SO good - highly recommend ($14).

For the mains, my dining companion had the duck confit/gnocchi - I had a bite and didn't like it but he finished it all.  I had the burger which came with one gazillion delicious fries ($16)!  I just really don't like when they ask how I want my burger, and then overcook it despite.

Overall I thought everything was well priced and the room was quiet and romantic."}
{"text":"Walking down Dundas it seemed like we were never going to get a table, and then we passed L'Ouvrier - with the exception of one table it was totally empty. We took a chance and went in .. Wow, we were not disappointed. That's one of the best decisions I've made this year. Service was better than any I've had in recent memory (thanks to Mookie), food came out fast and was incredible, and they gave us a number of free appetizers just because. 

I will be going back here a lot. Bravo."}
{"text":"A large and open room, with tables well spaced; A diversity of tastes  occurred throughout the meal. Attentive wait staff; an unusual combination.
More specifically, the oysters were good but not quite cold enough. The production of Amuse Bouche was a nice touch. The roasted beets were well done. The Charcuterie had Bologna with American mustard, which took us by surprise. The albacore tuna, although expensive was lovely and we didn't believe that the mushroom carbonara would top it, but it did. We also liked our side order of fries.
Food total was around $50 per head including tax."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my new favourite brunch spots. 

They smoke in-house some of the best and most unique bacon I have had. 

While it was traditional, I very much enjoyed the eggs, bacon and toast - they did it right.

My sister is obsessed with their French Toast. They don't serve you large portions but she swears it is that good. I will need to try it the next time I go there.

This place is also unusual in that it is quite large, it does not get overly loud and you really feel like you have your own space to eat in peace, unlike most places in the city. 

Our server was also quirky and very kind. 

I have heard they serve dinner but have yet to try this out."}
{"text":"What a cutie! I love the way this fair size restaurant doesn't squeeze you in between two parties. You have the luxury or plenty of space and don't feel your conversation is joining someone else's. 

Our group was all over the place in terms of food, I think with the 5 of us, we essentially were able to try everything off of the menu and it was really tasty. Also, apparently (despite me venturing towards something else) the chocolate cake for dessert is worth a trip alone. 

Little tip: while you're searching for the restaurant, whip your binoculars out - the sign is on the bottom of the building and you may not spot instantly."}
{"text":"Went for a Saturday brunch around 12 and got a table right away which is a great start. The atmosphere is really minimal European feeling. I ordered the potato rosti with trout and arugula, then added 2 eggs. Very good and not too heavy but not too light either. The wifey had the grilled cheese brisket. It was also good but too heavy for our brunch preferences, seems more like a proper lunch dish."}
{"text":"Cute place, reminds me of some cafes I went in Montreal. On a nice sunday morning, we went and ordered: potato rosti, french toast, scones, and french pressed coffee. 

The portions are small...

so my potato rosti was about a 4x4 square, with heaping arugula salad and a circle around of smoked salmon. it was delicious but at sunday noon and trying to cure a hangover... not enough food. hubby's french toast was good, it had 3 pieces of thick bacon... all SOAKED in maple syrup.. . i mean it's good if you like that kinda thing. i didn't so I didn't even touch that. 

In the end I was hungry... So i got scones in the end to dip in my coffee. they were nice, served with butter and orange marmalade. 

in the end, the waitress said i did a good job and ate a lot of food.... :( im sorry i eat a lot of food. I was still hungry but was too ashamed to order anything else....Self-esteem gone. 

p.s. please never tell your female customers they ate a lot of food...... this is the second place it happened to me."}
{"text":"Amazing food! That was the best bacon I have ever had. A little slow and drinks were not cheap, so that's why they got a 4. The food was definitely a 5, and so was the ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is Hip - loving the Dundas additions lately.  Cool spacious lay out - they could easily have more tables, but I like that they didn't cram everyone in.  If you can get the hot pink table...made everyone glow!  Space is industrial, unfinished, whimsical and interesting.  Love the string art on the wall...saw that recently in NYC.  Our server was great - very chill...loved the plaid.  I would say they have exactly the menu I now expect from any new spot on the Dundas / Ossington strip...all were well executed except for my ravioli with brown butter and bacon, which was really just lathered in bacon grease.

Fun cocktails and nice wine choices...great crowd

I will go back, maybe to try the brunch, and maybe to see how are in a few more months once the kitchen is in full swing..."}
{"text":"A lovely meal here on an uncrowded Friday night. Great ice-cold oysters to begin, and a superb (if slightly scanty) agnolotti. A nouvelle Baked Alaska to finish. Well done all round."}
{"text":"What a great unassuming place this is.  To be honest, I could have walked by 100 times and not looked in.  I'm so glad we stopped in on Friday and decided to try it.  We toughly enjoyed our meal and the service was so very pleasant we came back on Sunday for brunch.

To start we had steak tartar, oysters and beet salad.  The tartar was very flavourful, the beet salad just so beautiful to look at and it tasted even better.  If there was one criticism it would be that we prefer our oysters at a colder temperature.

Our mains were the agnalotti and the tuna tataki. This pasta was one of my favourites, better than most Italian restaurants we've been too.   The tuna stole the show this evening.  It was a playful recreation of a traditional pub style fish n' chips.  

You'd think we'd have no room for dessert but couldn't pass up the baked Alaska.  Very decadent and was perfect to share and end the evening with."}
{"text":"Solid food and fantastic service. They also have a ton of space so you don't usually have to wait. I've tried the Potato Rosti and the French toast with bacon- both were delicious. Reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because the portions are a bit small."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I do not recall exactly what I ordered here but I do remember it was good, and it was all-in-all a very pleasant experience. It was a perfect Sunday, not too hot and not too cold, and my companion and I were seated next to the open windows with the sparse white minimalist decor as our backdrop. The food was almost an afterthought to the idyllic atmosphere. The French Press coffee was plentiful and the food comforting.

I will definitely be returning once the weather turns warm again!"}
{"text":"My friends arrived at 11:20am for a Table of 5 on Saturday and were able to get a table, no problem. 10 minutes later, and the place was packed! There was one large group at the front (probably around 15 people?) that slowed down the service of this place significantly. 

It took us 20 minutes to order our food, another 45 minutes to have our food served to us... brunch ended up taking 2 hours due to slow service. I don't mind not rushing a brunch of course, if you have good company... but we were starving and one of my friends is pregnant too so you can imagine how we were dying not being able to eat for that long. OY!  I think they need to up their service team during peak periods or figure out something else to manage all the tables.

Here comes the food review:

~ POTATO ROSTI, SMOKED SALMON, CREME FRAICHE, ARUGULA, FRIED SHALLOTS, CAPERS
This was the dish I ordered and I really enjoyed it. The potato rosti was crispy and complemented the smoked salmon roses well. Everything worked well on this dish. I'm normally a small eater, but I was left feeling super hungry still. Of course I couldn't order anything else because it would take another hour. :o(

~ SMOKED BRISKET, MONTREAL SPICE, FRENCH'S MUSTARD, STRUBB'S PICKLE, FRIES
My boyfriend ordered this and liked it. I had a few pieces of the brisket and mustard and it tasted exactly like it should. However it was a bit more dry and lean compared to Montreal Smoked Meat from Schwartz. Then again, they weren't calling it Montreal Smoked Meat haha. The fries were crispy, thin and perfectly seasoned.

~ FRENCH TOAST, HOUSE SMOKED BACON, ONTARIO MAPLE SYRUP
My friend ordered this so I can't comment too much about it. While eating it, she did say that the dish was worth the long wait. Thumbs up!

~ BLT, HOUSE SMOKED BACON, ARUGULA, AIOLI, FRIES
My pregnant friend ordered this so I can't comment too much about it either. But the minute she picked up that sandwich, the bread was super soggy at the bottom and her sandwich collapsed in a few seconds. She had to eat it in parts and was disappointed. :o( The baby was also disappointed. :o(

I should also note that I wanted to get the Lemon Scones that everyone was raving about on Yelp, but when I asked the waitress, she said they weren't serving any that day. Another sad face moment. :o(

~ SERVICE: As I said above, the service was terribly slow and the waitress kept telling us to wait a minute and would disappear again. After 15-20 minutes of taking our order, our waitress did come back to double check she put our orders in correctly... I don't understand why they don't just write the orders down if they're not certain they'll remember! She had it right though, so that was good. But then came the 45 minute wait. *arms folded*

~ AMBIENCE: We sat by the window and the place had really great natural lighting coming in. Simple white decor as the photos of the place show. This place looks pretty hidden though (despite being on Dundas St W), so I think they're missing out on some key foot traffic. If you're walking by, you will do just that... walk by. 

~ OVERALL: I would definitely want to come back here again, considering we were able to get a table unlike other brunch places in the downtown core / Leslieville. I appreciate that it's not a greasy diner brunch and they do put effort into the presentation and taste of the dish. They just lost a star in my review because of the slow service. Keep it up though! This place has a lot of potential!"}
{"text":"Previously had brunch on my first visit. Finally back for dinner. 

Thank you for a delicious dinner! 

I ordered cauliflower puree soup. It was good. Small morsels of croutons in there soaked it up and gave it texture. By the end of it, it did get a bit filling.

My friend and I both had the artic char. We both enjoyed it thoroughly. The potato puree, lemon relish, green beans. It was a delight. 

My friend had the flourless chocolate cake and I devoured the peanut butter panna cotta. The waitress was right, it tastes a bit like a skor bar. I was in love. I had a berry panna cotta at ortolan the other night. This one blew it out of the water. Sure they taste differently, but this consistency was more silky and rich. I think I wish the banana were served warm or slightly caramelized. That would be killer. 

The server was lovely, enjoyed her service thoroughly. 

Oh those tables beside the door were horribly cold. Becareful of those tables on frigid nights!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Always amazing staff, delicious food, great coffee. Hidden gem on Dundas for brunch, can't wait to go back (every Saturday)"}
{"text":"L.O.V.E.

Came here for a cute date night and LOVED it. The space is beautiful - has a great french country home feel. The service was attentive (although it took a little while to get our bill).

The FOOD. So much deliciousness. The tartare was spectacular. The Tuna Tataki was fresh, the agnalotti was perfection with the dill, and the dessert was NOMZ.

Go here. You will love it!"}
{"text":"What do you do when your 30th birthday is coming up, and you have a potential party of 20+ for dinner?  I was in this precise predicament a little over a month ago, and was quite stumped.  Thank heavens for daily walks by and L'Ouvrier.  

I remember when they opened, perhaps a little over a year ago.  I was in want of a reason to go to the wildly cool looking restaurant with the massive white space and random hot pink table for ages.  And then I learned they did brunch!  The desire increased exponentially.  Wonderfully, about 3 weeks prior to my birthday, I walked in on a whim to see if the large dinner party possibility was valid, and, quite magically, it was.  Hooray!

The reservation process was relaxed and simple; they held the number at 20, and said they would be able to go up or down as needed.  The full menu was \"for grabs\" for us (ie, no need to have a paired-down or set menu), the service that night was some of the most un-pretentious and friendly I have ever experienced, and they were even happy to organize separate bills!  

I love the space: stark white with \"interesting\" decor including old photographs, string art, nail art, and a piece of sorts of hanging clear plastic dime bags of things found in the renovation.   And one incredible chandelier.  The cocktails were excellent, both tasty and original.  Some dishes were incredible: the tuna tartare knocked my socks off, and the kale salad was delightful.  Nothing was not tasty, though some things were \"pretty good\" rather than \"taste-budgasmic\".  That said, I would stand in line for a meal of the tartare and french fries, and a long line at that. 

Next up: brunch!!"}
{"text":"Met up with a big group for some friend of a friend's birthday here. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it would just be another one of those douchy \"no sign outside\" hipster type places on dundas, which ok, it probably is - but, the food was excellent. 

We started with some cocktails. One was a play on gin and tonic (can't remember the exact twist now but it was pretty good). We also had some tequila-based concoction with some fruity twist which was just ok. Spaced on the names now. We ordered the beet salad appetizer. Was excellent. Had a mix of varieties including some really tender yellow ones. Came with arugula, candied pecans and some goat cheese. Probably the best thing I had. I had the scallops for my main. Very tender with a nice mix of sautéed vegetables laying the bed for 3 pieces (portion size was fair). Very good.

Atmosphere-wise, its blah. bare white walls and ceilings with a clear intent to be spartan. Drafty nearly the door - so try to get a table towards the rear. There is a nifty little bar in the middle. Might be a cool place to get a cocktail.

I would go back."}
{"text":"Totally solid brunch spot. I am always on the lookout for great weekend brunch places (that either take resos or do not have crazy line ups) and will now add L'Ouvrier to the list. Came here on a saturday at 11:30 and it was busy but we were able to get a table for 4 no problem. 

The menu is not your typical standard eggs benny etc., although they do have a classic breakfast with eggs/sausage if that's what you want. But there are some interesting options like half a dozen New Brunswick oysters, tuna tartare (I believe this doubles as an appetizer on their dinner menu), or my choice - potato rosti covered in a large arugula salad with smoked salmon. Portions are on the smaller side, and prices are on the higher side, so I would delegate this place to a place to treat yourself or take out of town guests rather than a regular hangout. Food itself was very fresh and presented nicely. The oysters came with 3 different sauces made in house that looked delicious! Since portions were small, we also shared their fresh baked lemon citrus scones with creme fraiche and homemade peach jam. Total comfort food and the jam had big chunks of real peaches. One DC also had the cookies and cream panna cotta - quite tasty too!! (The other dessert options were a flourless chocolate cake or key lime pie, in case you were wondering). For drinks, they have french press coffee, nice espresso drinks, and Mighty Leaf teas. 

Aside from the good food, the reason I give this place 4 stars in because of the lovely ambiance and excellent service. L'Ouvrnier means the workman (taken from a line in George Orwell's \"Down and Out in Paris and London\") and the large black and white photo of chefs at the back dominates the minimalist white room - it's cool yet unpretentious. It's bright and sunny for brunch and I'd imagine it'd also be a cool spot for drinks at night with the big square bar at the back of the room. The decor looks like something out of a design magazine and is complemented by mismatched china coffee cups and saucers, with hot pink accents here and there. The space is spacious enough so you aren't inadvertently eavesdropping on your neighbours (compared to nearby Bent or spots like Terroni). Our server was exceptionally thoughtful and sincere - something truly refreshing in the Toronto dining scene. We never felt rushed and were able to linger as long as we wanted. 

I am interested in seeing what it's like for dinner. According to the website, they have a 6 course tasting menu for $50 per person."}
{"text":"This has got to be my best Summerlicious meal ever! Service was great and inviting as soon as we walked in, and the food- they tasted as good as they looked, and they looked like works of art.

We were a party of 4 and went on a Thursday night, they were at half capacity. The decor was classy and clean. Unlike many other restaurants, we appreciated the fact that their tables were spaced out so we could not touch the patrons next to us.

We ordered a picture-perfect white gazpacho, beef tartare, and a tasty summer salad. For mains I had the tuna and my friends had the pork shoulder. Both were amazing. Dessert were so pretty, and so thoughtfully put together. We had the flourless chocolate cake with burnt meringue, cheese plate, and and exquisite bowl of strawberries and cream with mini meringues and a light sorbet. We can't wait to go back ans check out their regular brunch menu!!"}
{"text":"Just finished an Ah-ma-Zing brunch here with a friend.   The place is beautiful!   It's  a great place to converse for a couple of hours over some delicious food.   I like that the restaurant is super spacious.   The decor is really eclectic - doesn't seem like they fall together, but they do - in some quirky odd way.   Whoever designed this place did a wonderful job!   

Food was delish.  We wanted to have an \"unconventional\" brunch and that was exactly what we got.   If you wanted eggs or bacon, you can order those on the side.   I like that they give you an option.   I ordered the Beets Salad with Chevre, but had the eggs and bacon to go with it as well on the side - because frankly Brunch just doesn't feel like Brunch, without the bacon n' eggs.   Also ordered the Blueberry yogurt with honey.   Can I say YUM?!  I never knew honey can taste so good with yogurt.   

I would come back here again x10!   For one, I like that this place is not overly advertised.   It seems like a hidden gem for now.  I don't even believe they have a prominent storefront sign on the outside.   Which is weird.   It's like they don't want to be notice.  And had it not been for Instagram where I found out about this place, I would have never knew it existed at all. 

Well, now that I've advertised how great this place is.   I guess it isn't a secret so much anymore.   But still, it wasn't super packed, and I like that.   I can eat my delicious brunch in peace, in a gorgeous space!  Oh, can I add, we had an awesome waiter also.   Service was not the pretentious type.  They were actually just being themselves.   I really like that.   This place really knows how to \"keep it real.\""}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant with questionable interior designs. I came here with a friend for brunch on a Sunday morning.

The first thing we ordered was French press coffee ($3 per person). It was my first time trying French press and it tastes like normal, good coffee to me.

Next, we ordered scones ($3 per scone) and it came with creme fraiche and strawberry jam. It was delicious! I highly recommend getting the scones. A little tip is to keep the creme fraiche and jam after finishing the scone so that you can use it for your French toast.

We both wanted to try their bacon so we had to order a dish with bacon in it and we settled for the French toast ($11). The other dish we shared was the grilled cheese sandwich. The grilled cheese sandwich  ($11) was amazing. They used a raisin-walnut bread so that the sweetness of the bread complements the savory of the cheese. The French toast was average but it tasted above average with the creme fraiche.

I can't wait to come back to this restaurant to try their salads because they look refreshing."}
{"text":"I'd read about aloof service and the drafty tables up front, but frankly this wasn't my experience of this place.  The service was excellent; the round table by the window was fine on a chilly february evening; and the food was amazing all around the 7 person table i was at.  I had the soup of the day and the braised beef, which was cooked to perfection and in a very tasty sauce; the fish looked and tasted excellent; the burger looked well executed and substantial. Great room too."}
{"text":"*The restaurant itself was bright and sunny on a Sunday afternoon. The decor was minimalistic and is complemented by mismatched china cups, a few local artwork with hot pink accents here and there. 

*The menu isn't your typical standard eggs benny that you would find in other restaurants, however there was nothing on the menu that made me say \"Ohh I can't wait to try that!\".

*The service was great at the beginning but toward the rush brunch hour our server was nowhere to be seen.

*the portion does not reflect said price, it is really small and most likely will not fill you up if you are hungry. 

-Potato Rosti (smoked lovell spring trout, sour cream, arugula, fried shallots, capers) - $14
Seriously though, this dish should have been renamed as Arugula Salad garnished with potato and trout. I felt like a rabbit that day and was still quite hungry after the brunch.

The potato pancake was crispy on the bottom and soft within, lightly salted which complimented the soft trout perfectly. Whole capers tend to be salty so I appreciated that they crushed the capers instead, which didn't make the dish overly-salted. The sour cream was a nice touch to balance out the dish, but the arugula salad was drenched in balsamic vinegar dressing so toward the end, I felt the whole dish was a bit too.. vinegar-ish.

-Tuna tartare (nori chips, soy glaze, picked ginger, spicy aioli, sesame cucumber) - $14
the lightly salted nori chips were the perfect vessel for the fresh tuna, except that they were easy to break. The pickled ginger and spicy aioli were not too overwhelming and overall it is a must order dish.

-Fresh baked scones, preserves, alliston creamery butter - $5.5
The scones lean toward the sweeter side with a hint of lemon citrus, and I thought it would have been nice if they were still warm, nonetheless the scone was still moist inside. Instead of preserves or jam, I got maple (?) syrup instead which was a bit strange. However the butter was unsalted and melted quickly on the tongue and I found it had a slight cheese-like, almost sour aroma that dissipated into a fairly standard cream flavor."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times as I live close by, and I have to admit this is a great place for brunch! The atmosphere is nice and the owners are always there making sure that everything is running fine. Also, their prices are fair for what you get (you can get a full breakfast for 9 bucks), specially now that there is \"brunch\" trend in Toronto and places are expecting you to pay steep prices for regular food. Give it a try and you'll see it by yourself."}
{"text":"Had a very lovely early eve dinner on Saturday night at L'Ouvrier. I liked the dim lights and open space and the way the amazing music playlist (one of the servers' we discovered later) contrasted with the modern, streamlined atmosphere. A place of culture clashes from my experience but a fun clash nonetheless. 

Our \"amuse bouche\" was basically a high class potato skin w. bacon, creme fraiche and scallion. Something you'd order in a sports bar (and satisfies a certain craving to be sure) but here it is tiny and simple and two to a little silver plate. 

For our mains my friend ordered a very standard looking \"wellington county beef burger, house bacon, 3 year heritage cheddar, brioche bun\" and fries  ($18). She enjoyed it but when it arrived I thought the presentation looked very lackluster. I ordered the miso glazed mackerel, oysters, daikon, ginger dashi broth, radish, sesame, oyster mushrooms ($21) - this was absolutely delicious. Nearly licked the plate clean!

Post dinner we had digestifs in pretty little glasses but there was no room for dessert. Perhaps another time. 

I couldn't help thinking though...that space would be well served as a dance floor after dining hours (or even during on Fri/Sat nights only perhaps). I put it in the suggestion box ear of our server who was in agreement - there being a perfect space behind the island near the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've wanted to do brunch at this place for a very long time and we finally went in last weekend. We arrived shortly after 11 on a Sunday and the place had actually filled up quite a bit. Since there were 5 of us, the big table was still fortunately available.The atmosphere is what I would call rustic, wood everywhere. Nice touches with the vintage style table and chairs. We did a sort of brunch dish sharing thing this time so I got to try the French Toast, Grilled Cheese and the more standard egg+ breakfast. They put their own special twist on the french toast and grilled cheese which is enough reason to order and try them out. All well enjoyed. Attention parents: They had a high chair for my little one which was great. Service was excellent. 
If you haven't tried it out. Go for it."}
{"text":"They only have white bread, they don't do poached eggs and they sugared my latte without asking. Salads and service were ok though."}
{"text":"Saturday brunch in up-and-comingsville!  

The decor and atmosphere was definitively hipster--Bon Iver in the background, packages of strings and other bird's-nest-bits on the wall etc., etc.  

The French press coffee was solid, and we ordered lemon scones with house-made mango-jalapeno jam to start.  The jam was good, and so were the scones--but the jalapeno really masked the lemon; perhaps a plainer scone would have been better suited to the preserve.  

I ordered the eggs, toast, bacon and fries.  Everything was very good: nice salty shoestring fries, perfect overeasy eggs, but the house-smoked bacon was the star player at breakfast.  It's really exceptional.

The beeeeeef ordered the French Toast, which comes with the bacon but is almost completely saturated with maple syrup.  It was divine for a bite or two, but I think you might need a dedicated sweet tooth to be able to get the whole serving down the gullet.  

I'd absolutely return to try some of their other more adventurous brunch offerings--and dinner looks pretty interesting too.  It started to get pretty busy around 12, so I'd recommend a sweet-spot arrival of 11:30 if you don't want to wait (they open at 11)."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch with kids. Not exactly a typical brunch place for families, but they were quite welcoming - service was friendly and efficient. The space is quite nice - has a lot of character. Food was quite tasty, though they had run out of a few things when we got there. Perhaps the only caveat is that they have I think a somewhat limited selection."}
{"text":"Good spot for brunch. The interior decor is quite nice and there is a lot of space. The selection in terms of food is great and it's definitely yummy. A bit overpriced and portions are small."}
{"text":"My friends and i came here for dinner and we had a wonderful night. 

We started off with a free starter of a mini 2 bite BLT that was great. Always a very appreciated touch, especially with our starting cocktails. For our apps, we got the steak tartar and the tuna tartar. both were absolutely delicious. i loved the tuna tartar served with pickled radish, and taro chips. the mix of flavours and textures complemented each other perfectly.  
Entrees - my friends got the burger with smoked bacon and they LOVED it. they raved about it all night. the portion size was great as it came with a huge handfuls of crispy fries, spicy mayo, mustard and ketchup. I got the ravioli which was a very green and summary pasta - no heavy cream sauce here. it's hard to imagine a lighter, more season appropriate pasta. For dessert we got the cardamom (my fave) panna cotta which was smooth, creamy and beautifully silky. We also got the flourless chocolate cake which was equally as good. 

The place was packed by the end of our dinner. We made reservations and were seated immediately. Our waitress was so sweet and very attentive, great personality and very hospitable. Overall experience was excellent! Will recommend and return."}
{"text":"Ordered potato rosti. It was amazing.
Basically it's smoked salmon chunks, hash brown, creme fraiche, capers and with a heap of arugula.
It's more like a salad than your regular dish. But great for $11!

And for $3 you get a medium sized French press full of coffee. Quite bold and aromatic blend too. You can definitely share that with at least 2-3 people

Could've used better decor for their place. Felt like I was eating in an abandoned, creepy Forever 21 with their mannequins and opaque white tables/chairs. But maybe it's their style."}
{"text":"One of my friends raved about brunch at L'ouvrier, so I had to try it out for myself. 

The decor was minimalist with predominantly white furniture and white walls. 

We started with French pressed coffee ($3 per person). The coffee was good, and even better when served in a dainty pretty teacup.

Freshly baked scones ($6 for 2)- Nothing warms my heart more than freshly baked scones! At $3 apiece, these were a tad pricey, but highly enjoyable nonetheless. 

Grilled cheese, aged cheddar, raisin-walnut bread ($11)- This was, hands down, one of the most delicious grilled cheese that I've ever had. The best part was indisputably the walnut-raisin bread. Slightly sweet, slightly crunchy, altogether a wonderful combination with the gooey, tangy cheese. I will be coming back for this one. 

French toast, house smoked bacon, ontario maple syrup ($11)- I'm a huge fan of sweet and savoury, so the French toast with house smoked bacon seemed like the perfect choice. The toasts were thin-cut and superbly crispy, topped with slabs of thick-cut bacon. It was a good dish, though not as memorable as the grilled cheese. 

All in all, brunch was fabulous at L'ouvrier. The food was delicious and the portions were just right, and I didn't fall into a post-brunch coma after the meal."}
{"text":"The space is open, bright and very white.  There is a lot of space and a lot of privacy between tables.   It makes for a great setting for brunch and very different from the trend of very small, more intimate spots.  

I would give them 4 stars for the scones alone; I could live on those scones.  Reluctantly moving on, the menu is unique with a lot of options not typically found on a brunch menu in the city.  I had the smoked guanciale, with a board of other options that was exceptional.  I also loved the french pressed coffee.  I look forward to trying more of the menu"}
{"text":"No longer just a brunch place, but still features the minimalist decor and seems to attract the 20 and 30 somethings.  (I was definitely the oldest person there on a Friday evening).  Nice atmosphere, nice vibe.  Quiet enough to carry on a normal conversation even when all the tables were taken.  Pleasant and efficient wait staff.  Good wine list.  Now for the food.  The menu is better than what is posted on their web site.

My wife had a roasted beet salad; our daughter had the arugula, apple and radish salad.  Both got a thumbs up.  I had a chicken soup - a clear broth flavoured in an oriental style with ginger and green onions, shredded carrots and mushrooms.  OK but not excellent.  For mains, the two ladies had duck confit with gnocchi in a cream sauce.  The duck was  good, the gnocchi were a bit too much like fried mashed potato balls and the sauce was delicious.  I had the seared scallops with corn kernels and bacon on a bed of puréed fennel.  The scallops were overcooked, almost crunchy on the outside and the corn was overpowered by the bacon and its grease.  Too bad - it sounded good on the menu.  Our daughter finished with the flour less chocolate cake with creme fraiche and we all shared a bite or two.  Very good.  I finished with an espresso and my wife with a cappuccino.  Both were a bit watery, but the hottest such coffees we have had.  I'd much rather too hot than the tepid espressos many restaurants serve.  Oh, and I also had a 14 year old Oban which was very nice.

I think my choice of dishes brought down my overall rating as the others were more enthusiastic about their choices.  The food bill came to $114 for the three of us."}
