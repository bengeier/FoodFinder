{"text":"This place is disgusting. It's been going downhill for months now. It's obvious the owner is a cheap bastard and does not care about their workers or keeping customers. Every time I visit they only have one worker doing the cashiering then making the food. Your order if it is correct the first time takes at least 20 minutes. I'm not a big smoothie fan but I enjoy the sandwiches. Well they used to have a drink station which has been removed and now only serve bottled water. This particular visit they were out of bottled water so the only drink option besides a smoothie was tap water. And their sides the only option is plain chips. Everything else was out of stock according to the cashier. And the place is a mess. Not only do they not clean the place by the sitting area, but the food prep area was a complete mess. I can't believe the health department has not shut it down. See the attached picture...All the booth seating are broken and they don't even hand out napkins with the order because they're so cheap. It is completely obvious the owner is cutting costs and running that place as thin as possible. I even mentioned something to the poor girl that was working there for probably minimum wage and she agreed. She said she wishes the customers would complain to corporate and the owner. I feel so bad for those young workers. Anyway stay away from this location...."}
{"text":"Tried to pay with a 50, But they will not accept anything over a 20 dollar bill. Now I can understand not taking a big bill in the morning due to not enough change in the drawer, but to not accept anything over 20 is a little ridiculous. So I left. And judging by the other reviews it looks like I didn't miss much."}
{"text":"Placed my order at 12:12...didn't walk out the door for 20 minutes. The wrap was sloppily put together and the person behind the counter forgot what chips I had ordered....not a big deal but if it hadn't have taken 20 minutes to make my food maybe we could of remembered. And it was obvious I wasn't the only one receiving poor service. I won't be returning. Maybe having more then 2 employees for lunch \"rush\" would help too."}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service experience i had. I would rather drive miles next time i crave for a smoothie than being served by unhappy employee. I really regret coming to this place."}
{"text":"Just went to this location and ordered a Peanut Paradise.. tasted like ice with a hint of peanut butter.. pretty gross"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. When it gets busy with about 5 people the estimated wait time is like 45 minutes. This is the slowest one out of all of them. Very friendly people though. Luckily it's 24 hours so I can come here late when there's no one around and at least have my drink done in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Only reason i stop here is because its on the way.  Used to be 24 hours but now on my way to work for an early shift i have to go to blue diamond.  Then today sunday i stop by at noon and they are closed.  Lights off open sign off.  
Place is super slow during the day.  At least when it was 24 hours i could stop in at 0500 and get a smoothie in like 5 minutes.  
May just stop going here because i cant trust them to be open and go to the blue diamond location from here on out."}
{"text":"I really don't want to give this place any stars... This is the slowest and rudest place in town. I was so disgusted by the rude service that I asked to speak to the manager and sadly enough she responded that she was the manager..  I will never never go to this location again.."}
{"text":"Stopped by after volleyball practice on a 95 degree evening to find one employee working. While it wasn't super busy, the poor lady was working her tail off to finish making orders so she could ring in new orders.. Poor thing was alone to run the show and she said she would be for the next hour n half. She was kind and friendly and still managed to do it all. Yeah, service was slow but I couldn't complain because she was working hard. She deserves a 5 star but this review will reflect that no smoothie place should have one employee like that and let alone not on a 95 degree May evening."}
{"text":"After 20 minutes waiting for one smoothie, people behind me in line get their food and smoothies before me. When I let the cashier know that, he said \"really?\" No apology, no attempt to recover my experience. Extremely slow service and poor guest service skills. This place needs a better training program and higher standards. My fiancé hates that I insist on returning but I do love the product (when they get my order right)."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Poor service and the unsanitary conditions. I will never come to this establishment again!"}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible, the wait is long and I go here all the time, every time I order a smoothie, it always tastes watered down."}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing, Great value and size for your money."}
{"text":"I've been  a customer of tropical smoothie for quite sometime now but this branch was  the worse. 1st time i went the credit card machine was down so pretty much wasted my time. 2nd time around still the same. one of the worse experience was when i was trying to get my free smoothie when the manager was giving me a round around and he keep on saying each Branch is different so bottom line they don't have the same core even they are a franchised cafe. In my honest opinion they should have one same core treat your customer right and we will comeback.  I will skip this branch now ."}
{"text":"Rude rude rude staff. The smoothies taste like its water down. The employees are miserable and don't wanna be there. At least try being fake. Good heavens, I drive all the way to Jamba Juice 10 miles from home cuz tropical smoothie sucks in southern highlands!!!"}
{"text":"Why do they only have one person working on a Saturday at prime hours. And not the friendliest staff. But I sort of understand because I'd be a little upset too if I was the only one working and was backed up 15 smoothies and guests were getting upset . Someone hire more people and get the wait times down its unreal!"}
{"text":"Went in, ordered a wrap. Stood at the counter 15 minutes, all other customers served. Asked \"is the BBQ wrap coming out soon?\" Response: \"I hope so.\" I asked if she could please check, the guy in back says \"I already made it\". She looks bewildered, finally I say \"did you give it to someone else?\" Yep, she did. 

Still standing there, no one doing anything. I say \"can you make another one?\" guy in back - \"already made it.\" Me: \"just give me my money back.

Gives me my money back without tax OR apology.

Too fed up to argue, I just left. So I paid them for bad service and no food. Advice to management, train staff on customer service.

I am sure the food is good, train your staff to be the same."}
{"text":"Wanted the half salad smoothie combo for $7.99 charged me $12 because they didn't have half size salad bowls.. also my almost $6 smoothie tastes like water."}
{"text":"This place sucks! First time here and definitely won't be back. How does a chain like Tropical smoothie can't afford to have more than one employee working? The same person taking the food orders is making smoothies and sandwiches with an attitude on top of that! 25 minutes for a smoothie and a dry sandwich... Sweet!"}
{"text":"Worst trop smoothie I have been to. Garbage was overflowing onto the floor, no one knew how to make the food or smoothies and complete chaos in the kitchen. I'll go to the drive thru location on Blue Diamond next time."}
{"text":"Like everyone else that had posted their review before me, there is always one person working when I walk in there and it happens to be really busy so for 1 smoothie I'm waiting 20 mins. It makes no sense to just have one person working when there is a ton of people coming in. Ridiculous

It's been a month after my last review and still no changes to this location. Seems like this place got worse and no one ever cleans this place. Definitely will be my last time at this location."}
{"text":"I go to trop smoothie weekly, this one is close to my house, last time I came in my sandwich had mold all over it, also they never ever answer their phone. You have to come in and wait 20 min to get a smoothie. Very annoying, when they could answer the phone and possibly have it ready."}
{"text":"Since they moved locations... they used to be by Chase/McDonalds. Now they are by \"Fizz\"... they went downhill. Drive thru girls are not the friendliest people. I've been to this new location via drive thru 3 times and every single time I am told \"I'll be right with you\" ... nobody in front of me or in line. I'm waiting 10 mins to place an order for a freakin smoothie. Maybe hire more or NEW PEOPLE!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! One kid working who doesn't even know how to use the cash register. Waiting 30 mins for two wraps is kind of ridiculous."}
{"text":"Slowest trop smoothie ever. Been here twice, first time I went in and they forgot about me. Took about 30 minutes for a smoothie! Figured I'd try the drive through this time so they couldn't forget about you. It was just as long with just two cars ahead. Don't go here if your in a hurry!!!"}
{"text":"Not closed as reported. Sitting in here as I write this. Out of strawberries and mangos which basically rules out every smoothie they make. Women's restroom out of soap and paper towels which forced me to use toilet paper to dry my hands! Definitely not on their \"A\" game today :("}
{"text":"They are very Unorganized. Plan on waiting 25+ min for a smoothie. And then they give you the wrong smoothie. Terrible customer service. They need to clean house and hire a better staff."}
{"text":"Great smoothies from totally healthy to deliciously and delightfully sinful. When you go between 5 & 7 p.m. And purchased two smoothies you receive a  third one free. ¡That is a fantastic deal!
    My favorite is the Bahama Mama I love that white chocolate.  Tonight for 3rd free one; we decided to try the peanut butter cup absolutely delicious. I highly recommend giving them a try if you haven't already you'll be hooked"}
{"text":"Got here at 11:00 and now it's 11:15. No other customers in here and I've said excuse me several times. I can hear employees talking in the back but can't see them. I would have left by now but I promised my daughter a smoothie. Rise and shine has smoothies too so next time I'll just call in a smoothie to go from there."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place 2 stars because tropical smoothie is somewhere I go all the time. The service is so unbelievably slow at this location. There is often only one employee. It's almost faster to drive to blue diamond for better service."}
{"text":"Seriously?! A 30 minute wait for a couple smoothies. There was no line but it was staffed by one person who had 6 people waiting for smoothies. Management needs to hire more people. There is no reason that at least 2 people aren't there. Nuts! I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I came in and had to wait for about 15 minutes just to place my order because these cheap bastards have one employee working both the register and making the food.

I was going to order a blueberry blast and a jetty punch, but I ended up just ordering 2 blueberry blasts, hoping it would save this poor girl some time.

It really pisses me off that a well known food place would skimp on employees, when they're already marking up the food so much the way they are.  I mean, come on. $5 for a smoothie?  If you have a family of 4, you're out $40 for a few smoothies and wraps."}
{"text":"I'm the first review? Neat.
This place is great! I have a weird order that soooooo many locations can not get right. The fabulous ladies here always take care of me to make sure I have a delicious allergen free experience - they're incredibly friendly too. Best Tropical Smoothie in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great smoothies, crappy service.  Miss Rosemarie, the heavyset brunette, should NOT be on the register.  Girlfriend is a little too gruff w/ customers & has attitude.  A little smile & a thank you would've been great.  Not a good representation of the store."}
{"text":"Usually this is the best location, but the customer service in the night is terrible. Tonight the employee back talked to me when I said oh you guys raised the prices and she was like I didn't. I come here often after the gym in the morning and never have an issue but I will not go back in the night. Also what's the deal of raising the prices too. I was just at one location last week and they didn't raise their prices. Seriously hire more employees that really enjoy working in customer service."}
{"text":"We frequent this location quite often, today when we came in we ordered two smoothies and a sandwich. We received our smoothies pretty quickly, but they completely forgot about the other half of the order. It wasn't until 20 minutes that we spoke up and the girl at the register just said, \"oh.\" And walked in the back. It took us about 25 minutes or so just to get a sandwich...she didn't offer any compensation of any sort, she just said it didn't show up in their system for some reason. Which doesn't make sense since we paid for it, but oh well...they're not very attentive."}
{"text":"I've been treated like crap at this location for the last time. I will drive to the next closest location so I don't give this store anymore of my money. I have yet to encounter an employee at this location with one ounce of customer service skills in their blood. I downloaded the TSC app and tried to use it to pay today but for some reason Shawnee the cashier did not know how to use the scanner she told me she doesn't know how this thing works and she doesn't use that app and if she was me she would delete my credit card from the app. You would think that a company that spent so much on advertising and has promotional brochures about downloading and using the rewards app would train their employees a little bit better on the app. So needless to say I did not get my rewards credit for this purchase and also she was very unfriendly and when she brought the smoothies out she made me feel like a total inconvenience. She just set them on the counter and turned around. Time and time again this has been the story at this location terrible customer service. You're business is only as good as your employees and unfortunately it seems that yours is dragging your reviews down."}
{"text":"Did mobile order, ran in and picked up and left. When i finally get to where im going and look in the bag, i find half a sandwhich. Who does that?!? They made a full, sandwhich and only gave me half."}
{"text":"Only reason I am giving it a bad review is they only have one person working there 
It takes forever to get your order they really need to hire more people
I always feel bad for the person working it is way to busy for just one person"}
{"text":"Mediocre restaurant. The staff seems unknowledgeable about what is offered in some purchases. For example, if you purchased food you were once able to get a smoothie for only $3-$4 more however the staff at this place seem to have forgotten their meal deals and attempt to charge you full price for both food. I don't usually complain about a couple dollars however this does add up on my following trips. Go to the Tropical Smoothie on Charleston. Better knowledge and service of food."}
{"text":"This store is always under staffed. Takes to long to get a smoothie. I gave them a chance. 3 x tooo many. I will not come to this location ever again even though it is my neighborhood. I rather drive all the way across town and take my business to Jamba juice. Ella"}
{"text":"The worst cafe in their chain. This is the second time I have been to this store and had to wait far too long. Waited 10 minutes with no greeting and left. I think there was only one person working too."}
{"text":"I have had just so-so experiences here but my last trip really annoyed me. I ordered the fish tacos last Friday. Here is the description for Cilantro Lime Fish from the website (limited time offer):

\"Grilled tilapia, spicy cilantro sauce, shredded cabbage and a roasted pineapple salsa with diced red onion and cilantro. Served in a flour tortilla.\" 

I actually laughed when I opened my tacos. Each taco had fish, some sauce, and maybe one pineapple chunk, no cabbage whatsoever. (See photo) Really pathetic. Clearly this specific location needs to figure a few things out from the other reviews. 2 stars because they get the job done, just not very well at all.

Also, don't ever call in. When I did during the week (I work nearby), the girl seemed unhappy to take my call, not very polished on the phone, had to repeat things multiple times, and we still didn't get everything correct. Sorry, but I don't think Tropical Smoothie has that complicated of a menu and we certainly weren't gussying-up our smoothie orders.

***Probably best to skip this place and find another Tropical Smoothie nearby."}
{"text":"I've been here before when I've been treated bad or with a bad attitude. But today there was a cashier and she was alone in the whole store but she really made it work! And she was so nice to the kid I had with me. She really made this place so much better then I've ever seen it be. She should be a role model for everyone else who is working at this place!"}
{"text":"Besides this place being dirty inside the management is no where to be seen. My wrap was about half the size it was supposed to be and missing at least 4 ingredients. This is what I was supposed to get and what I actually got. No kale, no romaine, no tomatoes, no asparagus. 
Basically cheese and shredded iceberg lettuce. 
Corporate needs to really look at this franchise."}
{"text":"Location is convenient. But as a suggestion, customer service needs improvement. If there's ppl that don't want to work there, please bring in people that have a more positive attitude. does make a huge different on how it affects customers."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this trop smoothie 5 times a week. After they hired new employees the smoothies became inconsistent, the wait times outrageous, and just wasn't worth the time. 
Perhaps they all have gotten into a groove finally and figured out how to manage the establishment but usually it seems understaffed or the staff that's on is just under trained."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place. Awesome smoothies, friendly staff, and clean, welcoming environment. Love the decor. Opens early enough for me to do a quick stop by b4 work. And the service is pretty fast so i won't be late. =]"}
{"text":"Convent because it's so close to home. 
That's about the only thing going for it. Never see more than 2 people (usually 1)
Last week I got the at 850 (they close at 9) and the girl told me they were closing!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd location of TSC I've walked into and the door is open but no one is working....I guess I'll go to Jamba Juice!"}
{"text":"This location is great, probably one of the fastest Tropical Smoothies have been through and everybody's very friendly and the the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I wish this wasn't the closest one to my house. They never answer the phone. It happens alot and one time I got there after calling repeatedly and the punk kid had his head phones on. As I'm writing this review my friend is calling and still no answer. Makes me not want a damn smoothie. I'm about to drive to the location on blue diamond.  This location sucks."}
{"text":"It's 110 degrees outside and 110 degrees in the restaurant.  This store is cleaner than the blue diamond location. Better customer service."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have NEVER been to a topical smoothie with quick service. Every single location I have been to has terrible long waits due to their shortness of staff. 

I went here the other day on a Saturday afternoon, only a couple other customers in the cafe waiting for their drinks. There was only one guy working at the time, and as I entered he let me know that it will be a bit of a wait. I said that was fine and I began to wait. 10 minutes later, I decided to leave. The sad thing... I knew it would be like this before I entered. Every single tropical smoothie I have been to have been CRAZY long waits. When they're not busy. I feel bad for the workers here, they are so under staffed and I know it's not their fault. 

Please hire more people because you're losing business!"}
{"text":"Last night I went there and got an immune blast and    For awhile it was fine but then I started to suck up pieces of plastic so I poured out my drink into a clear cup and started to find green pieces of plastic. Never will I be back here"}
{"text":"First time at this location and first impression was bad. I wasn't acknowledged when I walked in. A \"hi\" would have been cool. The 2 guys working just looked at me then back to whatever they were doing at their register. I was just looking at the menu for a couple minutes then I was ready, but still wasn't acknowledged,\". I almost left but the employee finally said hi so i ordered. Got 3 drinks. Employee asked me if I wanted a drink carrier and I said yes please. He just hands it to me. He didnt even put the drinks in the carrier. I work in the customer service in a hotel so I know how it is, sometimes it sucks but its your job. However, the drinks weren't bad."}
{"text":"Such great food great customer service I just wish they had a location off I-10 closer to Houston instead of only in Richmond and Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I've visited here quite often as it's along my route home. Most of the time the service is quick & friendly... sometimes it's kind of hectic and unorganized... but still friendly at least. 

If you've been to one Tropical Smoothie, you've been to them all (smoothie quality wise). At least, that's been my experience. Every visit the smoothie tastes fresh and flavorful... and every visit I discover a new mix. 

I've only ordered food once - a chicken sandwich. It wasn't bad, food quality wise. Something quick to eat that seems like it was cooked mostly fresh - as fresh as a fast food type place can. I'm a much bigger fan of their smoothies.

This location is pretty snazzy though with all the openness (f that's a word). My only wish is that they would have built the windows on the other side, facing the strip. If you choose to enjoy a food item and a smoothie, there will be plenty of natural light - with the view of a wall.

*2017 Yelp Review Challenge: 6/100*"}
{"text":"Comfy & Cozy place where employees are friendly and caring. Food is always fresh and smoothies are on point! Love this place, not just me, but my entire family."}
{"text":"I waited in the drive through for over 25 minutes but when I finally got to the window they took my payment and handed me my food, then they asked for the food back because it was someone else's food so they took it back then told me I had to wait for my food to be finished. I wouldn't want someone else's food that they had touched. When I asked to speak to the manager, they said the manager was too busy and to call later"}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie for their food and smoothies, as well as their customer service. However, having moved to the area I thought this location would be the same as others. Unfortunately, this time around I guess I was unlucky. I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Bowl thinking it would be as appetizing as the photo on the menu. Lo and behold I open my to-go container and while all the ingredients and dressing were still in place the salad was sad--looked absolutely like the picture. There were 3 pieces of chicken and everything else was thrown in there. Mediocre. Are the employees not trained on making their food? To top it off there was barely any flavor on the chicken and everything else. I would understand if I had come before closing, but mind you it was 730 pm--nowhere near closing. On top of it all, it wasn't busy, there were a few kids waiting for their food. No excuse to the poor quality in their food."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Tropical Smoothie. So I was excited to see there's one within walking distance of my boyfriend's house. But I've been SO disappointed with the level of customer service at this location!

There's a girl who works in the mornings who either didn't get trained well enough or is just clueless. She never knows how to do anything. I wanted to buy a gift card and get the free smoothie they advertise and she literally said \"wait, I don't think I know how to do that.\" What??

Then there's ROBERT. He works there some evenings. Same thing, went to buy a gift card,  noticed that none of its value went towards my points on the app, so I said he must be doing something different than the other employees I've dealt with. He rudely says \"if you don't like how I'm doing my job come back in the morning and speak to my manager\". 

I've never experienced such bad customer service at any other location. Shame..."}
{"text":"Never Answer the phone during the mid day ! Can't place an order and Customer service is Horrible ! Needs new Management"}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of people that are hating on this place but what really matters is good customer service and product quallity..I once heard a critique of a nurse at a vet's facility...She said quote I simply don't like it..She was refering to the place similar to this called Jumba Juice."}
{"text":"Excuse me? I have to eat my mediocre chicken Caesar salad with a spoon? Not one fork in the place. Definitely not returning here!"}
{"text":"Awesome service anytime I come by! The staff is always friendly and on point. Great place to take a work break If you're in the area"}
{"text":"We are forced to come to this place since the one down the street from us closed. This place is seriously in need of a complete overhaul of management and tactics. Only one person here and she is on her phone. Literally as I am typing this she is making our smoothies and talking in the phone. Definitely do not recommend anyone to come here. I am a fan of the smoothies but am contemplating going to another smoothie spot after the service I am getting here."}
{"text":"This location only gets my business because it is the closest location to me.  To the management of this location, there needs to be an overhaul.  It doesn't matter what time of day or night I go in this location, I know I have to twiddle my thumbs for 20-30 mins.  Tighten up your staff and make sure there's more than one person working during peak hours.  Or another idea, the owner should find new management."}
{"text":"I have been here before.  Never so dissatisfied.  My smoothie tastes like blended ice absolutely zero flavor. I was unable to order 3 different choices as they didn't have the ingredients.  I finally settled on my 4th choice and the chicken was all fat. Staff was friendly and apologetic , So not their fault"}
{"text":"Review for the service:

No way having one employee on the clock is going to get you repeat customers. Unacceptable to wait 10 plus minutes to order. Then, wait another 10 mins to get your ONE smoothie? 

Smoothies are ok, Jamba much better."}
{"text":"I always order the avocalada from tropical smoothie, but this location made this drink terribly. I ordered through drive through so it wasn't too convenient to turn back to get it remade. It doesn't taste like it contains lime or coconut, but just like kale and ice. I'm very disappointed in the drink."}
{"text":"You are always out of hummus. Fix that problem because your hummus veggie wrap is pretty good and you've lost our business on many occasions. It makes me not want to even try coming back. I tried calling ahead of time to make sure you have hummus and your phone number is wrong. Get it together."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a zero star rating. It is sad to like the food at the place but never recieve any customer service and even to the point of the staff being rude. I come here quite often and never write reviews, but it gets to the point that you hope someone in upper management reads it and takes the advice to improve.  This place is always horrible with customer service, the worse I've seen. Usually there is one person more worried about what is going on on their phone then helping the customers. This place needs some major staffing hell immediately!"}
{"text":"Good service. Same tasting smoothies as all the others. If you go after the gym at fitness 19 in the same plaza, you get 10 or 15% off.   I'm not a big fan of their food, but a majority of the time, stop by after the gym."}
{"text":"I usually go the the location next to lvac on flamingo. However, they are closed for a move right not. I eat the same breakfast here 4 days a week. The other location is always amazing. This location on the other hand... not so much. I've gone here 4 times.  3 out of the 4 the bananas on my flat bread were soggy & brown. I can't taste any protein in my shack & it's mostly blended ice. If I can taste the ice but not the protein, something is out of balance. So this time I ask the the girl to please use fresh bananas instead of precut. Instead of saying no problem or sorry about that. She decided to argue with me telling me she always does. Then I get my shake again it taste like ice with no protein. Plus, she mean mugged me, didn't bother giving me a straw or saying thanks you. I just looked at her and said your welcome! Wow, not I understand why I'm always the sole person in the cafe."}
{"text":"This tropical smoothie was pretty busy and they had a full staff.  I waited for 15 minutes for 3 smoothies and I think that is not too bad.  There we an employee who was new and we asking for help from \"josh\" and he was rude to the employee and told her to go to the back and make food. I think that is embarrassing to display this in front of customers."}
{"text":"This place is so disorganized!!!  Every time you come in here you have to wait a long time. Only one person is working. Today 2 people are working and they never filled our order!   I waited 30 min to get my order they totally forgot about it.   We then received it in small cups!"}
{"text":"From now on, if I only see the ONE girl working in there, I'm turning around and walking out! She busts her ass getting orders, and making everything by herself. It's terrible customer service"}
{"text":"I love tropical Smoothie and get it 2-3 times a week since it's by my work, but I always ask them to take the damn tomato's off and it never fails there's tomato's on it every time............"}
{"text":"You guys need more staff. Should never run this place having your cashier doing smoothies and leaving a line of 4 to 5 people! Your doing nothing but losing business!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this location a lot, however the last 3 times I've gone the quality of the smoothie is lacking. The way they make a chia banana is more ice than it is a smoothie & quite frankly seem stingy with their ingredients. If a customer is paying for a product don't skim on it! Definitely visiting this location a lot less because of the lack in flavor plus the mediocre service for the long wait times."}
{"text":"get your shit together its a smoothie and flatbead. how you gonna mess that order up. plus i spent 30 mins for it. worst experience ever"}
{"text":"Clearly I should have consulted Yelp before I stopped in this place.  

I was in the area and looking for something on the healthy side and as I drove through this parking lot, I stumbled upon this place. 

When I walked in, I was unable to order because the cashier was counting her till. No big deal. She had a new young lady take my order who admittedly started 5 minutes ago. Again, we all have had our first day on the job so no big deal. The one thing that I highlighted for the young lady as she wrote down my order was that it was to have no cheese because I am allergic to cheese. 

As I paid, the lady who was training the other young lady rehashed my order for a chicken wrap. I ordered a bowl not wrap, so this was the first point of my frustration. 

About three or four minutes later I got my food. When I walked in I was the only customer in the building and the time from walk in until I got the wrap was about 17 or 18 minutes. 

I was in somewhat of a hurry so I went to sit down and eat the wrap and the first thing I noticed when I opened it was that it had cheese on it. 

By this time, I literally had no time left so I gave the uneaten wrap back to the lady at the counter and left. 

This was without a doubt one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Not only would I never go back to this location, I don't think I'd ever go to another tropical smoothie anywhere. 

$8.65 for a bag of chips. 

Although the service was absolutely horrendous, the ladies nice I will say so this place would get a grand total of .5 star if that were an option."}
{"text":"The worst service after hours.  Ive been in the drive thru line for 10 minutes and it HAS NOT MOVED.  Its 1130pm and 3 cars in front of me.  I came here last nite and waited 6 minutes and no one else was ahead of me. And all i ordered was 1 chicken wrap.  Need faster and/or more employees that can multitask."}
{"text":"This location is so inconsistent.. Poor food quality, poor service, long wait times without any reason.  I've called 4 orders in advance and each of the 4 times the food was not ready approx 20 mins later when I went to pick up. The facilities are dirty.  The interior is cheap. Such a shame because the other ones I visited were quality."}
{"text":"So tell me why our total was $6.48 but they charged $7.78? If you check the time stamp it's the same transaction. It's only $1.30 but do they do that to everyone?  This is theft."}
{"text":"Every time I do the drive through at this location be prepared I warn you to wait at least 10 minutes!!!! I was almost late to work I arrived here at 10:10 and left until 10:30 I was so upset"}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas for a week on vacation. After a morning gym workout I was craving a smoothie. Tropical smoothie was closest to my hotel so tried it out. They have drive through which is a nice option. I went inside. Wasn't immediately greeted, they were busy helping the drive through customers. I ordered the Acai and peanut butter smoothies. Was hoping for a breakfast meal option, was disappointed not to see one on the menu. The smoothies are HUGE!unlike jamba, they only have one size!! Too big for me, but you get your money's worth. Drink was decent, not the best I've ever had but pretty good."}
{"text":"I have come here many times and at least 4 times my smoothie has tasted like water! No flavor! They are lazy and won't make it correctly. All I can say is taste your smoothie before you leave!"}
{"text":"The service is actually really decent. If you're lucky enough to catch it operating. I work late odd hours and there's not that many great things that are open late so I'm not expecting much. However whether I go during the nighttime or the day time either something is down or a machine can't be operated or they can't ring me up. What is the point of being open 24 hrs if your not operational at any given moment during odd hours. It's happened enough that I feel your paying labor for nothing maybe just change hours instead of being constantly disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss when I come to this location. Sometimes the person taking my order is nice and gets it done in under five minutes. Other times it's far worse and wait time is 30 mins TO ORDER! Go to the one on blue diamond, that one is a drive through and way nicer people."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Clean establishment and tasty goods."}
{"text":"This location is sooooooooooo inconsistent. From the staff to the execution of orders. Today was the best and worse. I tried this new (well new to me) Orange Ginger smoothie and needless to say, well it was not the same. I'm not going to point fingers here but Veronica looked lost back there, dropped all of the ingredients to my first smoothie looking for what I assumed would be carrots to add to the smoothie but that's just an assumption. I used to love Tropical Smoothie but the inconsistency and new faces all the time is a bit annoying. Veronica did have good customer service and maybe she was a bit tired I don't know. Probably will stop going to tropics smoothie for a while and hope that things change."}
{"text":"I received a smoothie and flatbread from this place about an hour ago. The flatbread was so burnt and hard that it was painful to even take a bite out of it. The smoothie just tasted awful. I couldn't consume either of the things I purchased here. Both items went into the trash. So a waste of my time and my money. This location always seems to give me problems like forgetting to give me my chips with my combo meal, or somehow messing up how my smoothie tastes. Too much of my money has been wasted at this location!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times and had average service, however.... tonight when I placed an online order to the WRONG restaurant and showed up here to pick up, they TOTALLY took care of me. I had already made the payment via the app and I thought I was completely stuck having to drive 25 minutes across town to pick it up. Instead, the manager took my order and I did not have to drive across town OR pay twice for my own mistake. Now that's some serious customer service you don't find every day. Thanks Tropical Smoothie of Southern Highlands!!"}
{"text":"I am truly disappointed with this place! I have lived in southern highlands for eight years now and it seems as if year by year tropical smoothie gets worse. Came here to get a smoothie as we are waiting on 3 people ahead of us to order, 8 mins later a girl comes out the back with food for a customer and I ask are you alone here? She replies yes. How do you run a business with only one person to cover the front and back. It's no wonder you find cups in the floor and boxes everywhere, one person can't do this all by them selves. This is definitely a representation of a slum owner."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night (5-30-17) with my girlfriend around 8:40pm. I know employees  hate when people come in at the last second before they close up but hey it is what is and it's your job just make the customer happy and be done with it. I ordered a Baja chicken flatbread and a peanut paradise. The flatbread was good but the smoothie was horrible. Smoothie was pretty much watered down and just not good at all. I didn't even taste the bananas that's suppose to be in there and it was just awful. I love tropical smoothie but this was the worse smoothie I've had by them. Note to self go in durning the day it's probably better cause they won't make it all shitty"}
{"text":"The smoothies are good but the customer service is terrible.. The past few times I have been there, the employee that has been working (I think her name is Lisa, that's what it said on her visor) is SOOOO rude! I've never felt so uncomfortable ordering food. Don't the customers bring your business money? Yet, the minute I walk in she gives soo much attitude. Anyway, if you're looking to get a decent smoothie come here but be prepared for extremely poor customer service."}
{"text":"Wow the service is bad, and the smoothies are even worse....this location is bad please avoid, the girls working today have zero personality and don't want to be at work...."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! And the might as well take the drive-thru out, literally one car in front of me in the driveway and took them 30 mins JUST TO TAKE MY ORDER?! I only order smoothies also because I found a hair in a wrap one time before. They need to do better"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I was the only person in the lobby and was completely ignored by the two women working. When I was finally assisted, the woman who rang up my order, who I believe was the manager on duty (Ayana), never said one word to me and practically shoved the change in my hand. No hello, no thank you, nothing. People like this need to understand their job is dependent upon their customers. This customer will be taking her business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the fact that I did get a smoothie and a sandwich that were slightly consumable... Tropical Smoothie is not a good franchise to me already (if I had a Jamba Juice right next door, I wouldn't be writing this). I've lived across the street for 4 years, I love smoothies, and this is the only the 3rd (and final) time I've been there. And here's why:

-Smoothies are strangely bland but sugary, and depending on what you get, poorly blended and/or watery
-Food is a step up from McDonald's 
-Service... always poor. The 2 girls today seemed to be very sweet and personable, however their non-stop conversation with each other was their top priority, with business and blending/preparing food coming in second. Not to go off on a rant, but it is called work... most of us also have jobs (one of mine happens to be in a restaurant), it's very hard not to be super annoyed with people who look at there job as some inconvenient interruption from what sounded like some of the more unimportant \"drama\" I've heard in my life. Tropical Smoothie must have an overworked or nonexistent management team... so I'll tell you on be half of them. Take your job seriously, have some integrity, or this job that you may think is beneath you, will turn out to be above you... and then you'll have all the time in the world to talk


Rant complete."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love tropical smoothie. But this location is getting 1 star for customer service. Wish it could be less. As a business owner myself, customers are the most important thing because without them you have no one to service and no business to run. 

I was having dinner next door at Off The Strip and needed some juice for my 1 year old daughter. I ran next door to tropical smoothie at 8:45pm. They close at 9:00pm. I was not greeted at all by the employer mopping the floor. No biggie as I figured the other employee at the back could be the register person. After 3 minutes another customer came in and the mopper came over to the register. Never acknowledged me. Looked right passed me to the other customer. He had money out and I realized he ha left to get money to pay for his order. Again not a big deal. After he was done, she again never said a word to me, just starred. I asked for juice by itself. 
Finally, she speaks!! \"the juice is all put away for the night, we close soon.\" 
I asked, \" you close at 9, right?\"
\"uh huh\"
I looked at my watch, looked at her.  Again. Just a blank stare. I left the store and went to the bar a few doors down and was given a glass of cranberry juice for free. 

What if I had wanted to order a smoothie? No sale at all in the last 15-20 minutes?

That is great customer service. Top notch."}
{"text":"Awesome location, right by the house. Very fast and clean. Cashier was very patient when I couldn't remember order!"}
{"text":"As I was waiting to be served at 12:15 today, I look up the reviews on Yelp. Not good, they only have two stars. We waited for 10 minutes without once being greeted or without anyone who was in the back to come out and take our order. Two more people were in line behind us. After 10 minutes all 4 of us walked out. If you own this business, it's probably not doing well. The reason being your customer service SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Great service and great music nice vibe.  My son and I loved our drinks after football practice"}
{"text":"This is the worst location in Vegas. They always screw up my order, the staff is rude, and the owner actually TRIES to get in arguments with you about his Multi-level marketing business. The owner is a douche and his staff is just as bad."}
{"text":"Love Tropical Smoothie especially their Peanut Paradise smoothie. You get to select what kind of protein you want in your smoothie but I go for the traditional whey protein. On average a smoothie would cost about ~$6 but they offer a half smoothie and half sandwich of your choice option for just about ~$4 more, which is a great deal considering the size of the sandwich and the size of the smoothie is rather large themselves and you also get to select chips of your choosing. The place was clean but the service was very slow. Took about 20 minutes for our two smoothies and sandwich when we were the only ones there. Every time I visit this location it's very inconsistent with the speed of my order or if they have the correct fruits in stock. If they can be more consistent with what smoothies they have in stock and provide faster service I could see this location getting more business. They also have an app where you can order ahead of time and pick up your order when it's ready to avoid the line. Have not tried that yet but will definitely give it a shot if service continues being slow."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since it's opened and I'm so dissatisfied. 

First experience: 
Went through the drive through and as I pulled up the employee says \"what do you want?\"
What do I want? I want to be greeted by a friendly voice to an establishment I'm giving my money to. As she repeats my order I only hear half of it before she cuts off the microphone. Next, as I drive up to pay she holds out her hand and gives me attitude when I asked the amount I owed. I'm sorry I didn't pull out my calculator to figure out the total.

Second experience: 
I decided to go inside this time to find an open empty space. I waited a good 4 minutes before an employee decided to stop talking to help me. Again, no \"hello\".... \"welcome\"...\"how are you\"...
As I'm waiting for my drinks my boyfriend tells the girl the restrooms are disgusting and needs attention. He got a condescending sorry and 2 other employees just stand there, one a male, and do nothing. 

I was excited to see a new tropical smoothie open up and I was hoping it was going to be better than the previous one across the street but to my surprise it's worse! So disappointing and disgusting."}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie is my FAVORITE smoothie place and I hate to say that this specific new location does not measure up to other locations, even the previous old location next door. The first time I came here my smoothie was so icy and watered down. Don't they have the same recipe at all the locations? I thought that it was just an off day but I see other reviews saying the same thing. I came back again a couple months later and my smoothie was a little better, but still too icey so not as good as the other locations still. I shouldn't have to ask for less ice. 

Also the service is sooooooo slow. And it's only because they're so understaffed. 2 employees trying to get through a packed drive through line and about 5 people inside during busy hours in the evening. Also, they ran out of the regular sized cups so they had to put the smoothie in 2 small cups. Not a big deal but come on that's super annoying. Where is the manager of this place??!! And his/her boss too! I hope this location can do better."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible took over 30 min to get 2 smoothies cause the kid at the counter moves as fast as a damn turtle"}
{"text":"This place always does such a crappy job with the food orders! The smoothies aren't any better. I once got a smoothie with PAPER in it! And it literally never fails, they always screw up on the food order somehow. Please figure it out! I love tropical smoothie.. just not this one!"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT! If sanitation matters to you, do not come here. We just went here and there was only person working. He came from the back, took our order and money, and proceeded to make our smoothie WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS. My mom had to ask him to wash them. His response was, \"I don't touch anything. I use scoops .\" Come on! Not to mention, the place was dirty, trash on the floor and trash can was overflowing. We will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Avoid and get a cold pressed juice at WF market for $5-$7 instead. This place basically sells blended ice that is lightly mixed with a tiny amount of fruit and vegetables. They also blend fake sugar when there is no reason to, every juice tastes fine with no sugar added.

The location by my house, perks and occasional freebies from using the app, and the drive-through are the only reason I've been to this location over a dozen times. 

Slow drive-through service and unfriendly employees. I have tipped one gal $10 but still can't get a smile or a sincere thank you.  

Hope this helps my fellow juicoholics."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Tropical Smoothie! I prefer it to Jamba Juice simply because it's a much smaller chain, so the ingredients are more focused and usually sit for less time because of the turn over. This location in particular had a nice outdoor patio, which is a huge plus in the summer!"}
{"text":"This Freaking place can't seem to get it together. The staff seems to have no Customer Service skills whatsoever. They can't seem to keep any Veggies in stock that go in the Wraps, which is in every wrap they serve! Just left here because they have no lettuce and no carrots. Yes I could of went without them in my wrap, but it's just the point of having them. This business is poorly ran, with poor training skills for employees and inventory is poorly managed as well from what it seems, because this isn't  the first time they ran out of Veggies.  And the smoothies are like water. WILL NOT BE BACK NOR WILL MY FAMILY."}
{"text":"After my prior experience,  a tropical smoothie representative contacted me and wanted to assure me almost of my concerns have been handled.   I appreciate his attentiveness to all  of the issues as well as his professionalism.   

Bravo!"}
{"text":"The smoothies are huge here. My favorite is Beach Bum. The price is not too bad for the size. I prefer to share them though. The only problem is they are not consistent. Today I had a good experience. The customer service was good and it was a quick wait. Sometimes, the people don't make the smoothies right though. They don't always taste the same."}
{"text":"If you want to wait 30-45 for a smoothie and a wrap, come here. Some brilliant manager/owner has decided to employ one kid at a time to run a cash register and make the food so it's a disaster and takes forever (I've seem 4 customers leave waiting in line to order because they just give up). And likewise the employee seems miserable. So much for \"fast\" healthy food."}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie but this has got to be one of the worst locations to go to. It took me 30 minutes to get a smoothie and a wrap. On the usual, I get it in less than 10 minutes. It wasn't even busy. There were 3 workers and 2 customers only. The other customer was getting impatient as well and she had only ordered one smoothie. 

Besides the service, my wrap looked like a mess. It wasn't fully stuffed and it wasn't easy to eat since it was all over the place. 


I'd love to go back here since it's near my job, but someone post a review when they're back on track."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews, but this is an exception due to my level of frustration.  This morning I had an appointment so ordered on-line (using their app) a full half hour ahead of the time I would pick up. I get there, I'm the only customer, and of course, he didn't see the order come in. Typical of this location.  He says he'll make it right away. Okay. Then in walk 4 people and instead of making my smoothie, he proceeds to take their order. I walked out...had to. The whole exercise was to ensure my being on time for my appointment. I don't know why I keep giving them my business.  Stops today. AND, I'm going to tell all my friends and neighbors. Sadly, they're probably going to say \"Yeah, I know, that's the worst location in the city.\""}
{"text":"Aside from being understaffed (2 teens on a Saturday), the entire place was dirty. Not like, \"Oh, there's a napkin on the floor\", but \"Maybe they should have someone clean up the spilled smoothie that's been coagulating on the floor for at least the past 15 minutes.\" It is definitely not the fault of the 2 employees we saw, who were scrambling to complete orders, but by the time we left there was a line 7 people deep and no end in sight."}
{"text":"Came one time and waited 25 minutes for a drink. Came back another day to give them another try. 2 guests in front of me ordering a drink each and I waited another 25 minutes??
It must be difficult for them so unless you have time to kill I wouldn't come here"}
{"text":"I arrived at this location a little after 7 on a Tuesday night.  When I walked in there was only one other customer who looked like she had been here waiting for awhile.  I stood at the register for about 3-4 minutes before one of the two employees who were \"working\" came out to take my order.  Prior to coming out they yelled that they weren't taking food orders, just smoothies.  A minute or two after finally taking my order, the other lady's order came out... With food... And was apparently wrong so they had to fix it. 
My smoothie itself was fine, but next I'll drive past this one and go to the one by Target."}
{"text":"Worst service for the last 3 years. It's the closest one to me so I don't have a choice. Customers get turned away at tge counter and drive thru always mix up there order."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Saturday afternoon because I really wanted an açaí smoothie. When I first got inside the store the employee told me the system was down. I told her I would pay cash and she said she couldn't help me until the system was back up.
I still feeling confused with it, how couldn't you make me smoothie only because your system is down? Maybe you should just close your doors"}
{"text":"This tropical smoothie does a great job! Eric was extremely nice and extremely helpful! My roomie and I came in a little late at night so it wasn't too busy but he was able to get our food to us pretty quick! Will definitely return! Thank you Eric!"}
{"text":"I think they raised their prices on most of the menu items. Anyways, I used to frequent here often, but have decided to cut back on it since 1 out of 5 times, they will get my order wrong. Yesterday, I ordered a flatbread without bacon (can't eat bacon due to health reasons, always causes stomach issues) and they left it in there.. I tried scraping them off until I realized that they were everywhere.. I just couldn't even eat it. It was disgusting.
Oh and they often forget to give you straws, so be careful."}
{"text":"The one star is for the employees if this franchise. This is the absolute WORST tropical smoothie franchise of all franchises. It is obvious that the owner gives zero f*cks about this business. They are always out of something from smoothies to food. Yesterday they ran out of egg. The other day they ran out of sauces. I'm even embarrassed for them. They have new employees working without training and they are left by themselves! I don't ever write reviews but I feel so strongly about how terrible this establishment is. The owner of tropical smoothie needs to pull this franchise because it's seriously giving you a bad name."}
{"text":"This place  sucks bad customer service no hi or can I help you i ask the girl name clowie what was the flatbread with bacon and she just looked at me crazy like really u asking this so I order a fb chicken apple  I ask for no cheese and she just rolls her eyes I get the order it was soaked with dressing so I returned it and ask if I can exchange it for a chipotle chicken flatbread well no I'll exchange it for u sorry about that but it's going to 5.40 like what so u mess up the order  ask if u can exchange it but charge me again for a new flatbread I pay for 2 and I only got 1 I just walked out I didn't want to deal with it guess she got a free cuz she kept the one I return bs..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this tropical smoothie, whenever you go in there the employees are working so hard to make the best product they can make! I almost missed it because its tucked into the corner of trop & Hualapai but I am happy I found it. GO TRY IT!"}
{"text":"This is probably my most favorite location here in Vegas because the one on Craig is a shame. But I love how friendly the staff is, how quickly I get my payment and food/drinks, and I love how clean the inside is. AND they're 24/7?! Y'all be saving some lives!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars but that's not an option. Incompetent employees that have no idea what they're doing and the food is beyond disgusting. Ordered a hummus wrap and it was missing half of what is supposed to come on it. It was one big pile of mush. Didn't even get my side of chips. Disgusting, don't waste your money here. You can find better food in the dumpster."}
{"text":"No wonder this place gets terrible reviews! I tried to call in an order for pick up and was placed on hold for about 5 minutes, when the lady finally got on the phone she said \"what do you want\"??! So rude. In the middle of my order she kept telling me to either hold on (while she took other customers orders) or that she couldn't hear what I was asking. I repeated my order several times (2 Lean Machines) and then she yelled at me! \"I can't hear you!!!!\" I finally hung up. Worst customer service ever. I used to come here once a week, I would rather drive the extra few miles to a different Tropical Smoothie (which I did) than go here."}
{"text":"The service is always terrible. They are always under staffed. I go here a lot because there aren't many healthy options on southern highlands, but after my last visit I will not be back. I stood at the register waiting to be acknowledged for almost 10 minutes. So I finally called out hello to the two people in the back. Then they finally told me \"they'd be with me in a minute, and they already saw me standing there.\" Well how was I supposed To know when no one even acknowledged me. And it wasn't busy. There were four people in the store, 3 already eating. But it's not just an isolated incident. I've never had a good experience there. I understand when you're busy, I don't mind waiting. What I do mind is rude people, that treat me like I'm bothering them. When I'm spending my money there. I will not be back again. This location makes the brand look terrible"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. My Smoothie Barista even brought my drinks out to me. Plenty of options. Between the Island Green and the Detox Island Green, the first was much sweeter although I did enjoy the Detox better. Maybe I'll add a bit if Splenda next time."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a good review, but its so tough when they are continually understaffed. I've never been here once when it took less than 3 minutes to get my order put in. It usually takes another 5-10 minutes to get a smoothie and half a sandwich too. If they could get this down to 3-4 minutes for a full order they would be 5-stars for sure."}
{"text":"2 people working and they are slower than molasses!! One person walked out when they ignored to take his order. One of the males that works here is rude and the look on his face clearly states he doesn't care or wants to be here . I got the rustic turkey apple  club and to my surprise they put blue cheese in it! .. and I usually I like blue cheese and wouldnt have cared but the taste seemed off.  tasted foul, the color seemed off and tasted old, not the normal taste. I threw my sandwich away!!! I won't go back!"}
{"text":"Food quality good 
Staff doesn't look like they enjoy their job and could smile a little more but I get it good staff who act like they care are hard to find these days. We repeated and verified the dressing on the side but it wasn't done. 

There are four of them here and no one wants to answer the phone. Most of our wait is because this is out or that is out.. probably just because they aren't stocking as they go. They need some management presence here and it could be a good little spot. 

Music is too loud for the staff to hear you they keep asking the same queries over."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the worst locations I've been to. The staff were friendly but they were out of a few ingredients which basically changed my entire smoothie and food order. They did attempt to make an alternative but it wasn't very good. I appreciate the effort but I wouldn't return to this location."}
{"text":"For being in Southern Highlands this place has no class! I went in today to utilize a gift card I received from 94.1 for 2 meal combos. The young lady working there rudely barked out instructions to all customers coming in that because of the local National Guard base coming in they were out of everything.  When I asked what she could offer meal wise after standing in line for 5min she rudely said nothing, \"I'm only doing drinks\"! Pretty pathetic to blame our local National Guard base for your managements poor planning ability at four casting supply on demand is a joke! It's no secret that the base comes to that shopping center to shop and for lunch outings.  Shame on Tropical Smoothie Cafe for employing and allowing their staff to disrespect not only the patronage of our service men and women but being a complete female dog to the all the customers that came in after! #ISupportOurLocalNationalGuard"}
{"text":"Ok so I had a bad experience with a pubic hair in one of my smoothies at another tropical smoothie location years ago and I vowed never to go back but had a hankering for a salad and smoothie. I walked into this location and no one was at the cash wrap. There was one customer waiting. Two employees were on the clock at this time. The other customer got his 6 smoothies and exited. Then another associate came strolling in and clocked in. They were joking and laughing in the back then this little kid emerges (probably like 16). I ordered a wrap and asked if it came with a side (which I knew it did bc the menu said so). He replied with an \"I'm not sure.\"  After pressing several buttons he said yes. So I order. My smoothie came pretty quickly and was fairly delicious. 
But overall the place wreaked of bleach and was pretty dirty upon first impression. They have an \"A\" rating from the Nevada health board though?  I just didn't feel a sense of urgency or customer care at this particular location. There was no system in place to handle the ratio of customers to associates working."}
{"text":"Wanna know what makes me sad? A place with food I love and super crappy service. 4 stars for food, negative stars for service = 2 stars. And I'm debating whether that rating is too high. 

I've been to this location twice and both times the employee acted like she hated me. It isn't just me ... she acted like she hated the other 2 customers I saw her serve today too. The first time, I wrote it off thinking she may be tired, hungry, having a bad day, just gotten bad news, whatever. But twice in 2 weeks makes me think that this is just the way it is going to be here.

There's a location by LVAC that's only a little further from my house and gives me a 10% discount because of my LVAC membership. I will go there instead and recommend that you do too. Get the Thai chicken salad, and add pineapple-mango salsa. Yum!"}
{"text":"I don't have a very high opinion of Tropical Smoothie's as I feel their brand has gone downhill for the last few years. But working at the Rio, my coworkers and I were craving healthy smoothies to keep us from getting sick. I found them on UberEats, and figured they'd be a quick option for us.

I got the Detox Island Green and was pretty disappointed with it. It tasted watered down, and I couldn't even taste the ginger. But what that smoothie lacked, they made up for in the taste of their breakfast wrap and their hummus veggie wrap. My coworker ordered the latter and was raving about it and I was like, come on, it can't be that good. She gave me half, and I had to say she was right. It was super tasty. Sad that I'd go back to a smoothie place for anything other than a smoothie.

Prices were pretty reasonable before the delivery fees. It was a bit slow, not sure if it was the restaurant or UberEats, but from the reviews here, I'd guess the restaurant. Luckily I wasn't sitting there waiting for it like everyone else and could go about my life while they prepared my order.

I'm not running back here, but if someone else placed an order, I'd probably get the hummus veggie wrap."}
{"text":"I keep coming here because I love the Wraps & Smoothies but goodness does the speed of service suck! It's a good thing the food is so yummy."}
{"text":"So sad. I was excited to grab a drink and it wasn't good at all. There was only one worker(who was very kind) however they're under staffed. I got 3 kids size smoothies and the total came up to $15. All three smoothies tasted very bland, it tasted like it was blended/crushed ice with ONE piece of fruit just to say they actually put fruit in it. :/ i wanna give them another shot but everyone else's bad review makes me not want to."}
{"text":"Terrible! Walked in and stood there for 10 minutes without being greeted. Worst customer service ever! Made eye contact with me multiple times. Couldn't even tell me to hang tight?! They should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I get the island detox smoothie daily! It's pretty tasty!  Can't beat the 180 calories!  I use the drive up, fast courteous service."}
{"text":"We came in today and there are 2 employees working at noon. They're both making food so many guests are walking out because of the wait.l to even order. The woman Rosemari is barking at guests that if they download the tropical smoothie app they can save $5. Not a hello or sorry about the wait. Then they made me a totally different wrap. Once we got the right wrap the cheese wasn't melted. Probably will stick with Jamba Juice on Blue Diamond."}
{"text":"Almost 10pm, no one in the place and the workers can't even manage to clean up! There is trash on the floor everywhere, chairs and booths pushed around and trash is overfilling. So nasty."}
{"text":"Please stop serving smoothies with Sugar when customers ask for no sugar. 

This place is right down the street from my work, and seems like each time I go I remember why I've progressively distanced how long it's been since going the previous time.  

The last 3 times I've went I've asked for No Sugar in my smoothie and definitely gotten added sugar.  Really in general Tropical Smoothie is kind of a \"Fake Health\" place. 

They load their smoothies with sugar when fruits are naturally loaded with sugar and sweet anyways, + all their wraps and sandwhiches - some bowls are loaded with carbs which are not good for you, particularly if your watching your weight - as many might think this is a healthy/low fat type place.

yes low fat, but loaded with sugar and carbs which is what's gaining you weight - not healthy fats - which if understood actually help you to lose weight. 

my bowl today was bland too, just feels like it was taken out of the freezer and thawed, and chicken taste very cheap and chewy/fatty."}
{"text":"What in the fuck is happening at this location ? I walk in and there's 3 people in front of me complaining that they've been waiting for 10 minutes and no ones helped them .. It looks like there's only one guy working so I understand that it might take awhile. So after I've been waiting for 5 minutes and the 2 people in front of me left which I don't blame them I realize that off to the side there's another employee on her phone then she walks up to the register and I think she's about to take my order but all she says is oh I'm shift leading today then walks away and continues with the conversation on her cell phone while there's now 6 people behind me. It takes another 5 minutes for the guy to take my order and he doesn't apologize for the wait or anything. Worst customer service ever"}
{"text":"Only 1 employee working on a Sunday morning. Still waiting for smoothie after 30+ minutes. Just moved to the area and was excited to have a Tropical Smoothie nearby but am now disappointed and probably will not return if this is an indication of how long it always takes here. At least I got here before the other 5 people who will probably be here for the next hour."}
{"text":"I tried their new tropical green smoothie with the turkey club half sandwich. Both were so delicious! Colton took my order and was very nice despite me not being able to tip because I paid with card (management can we change this, I wanted to tip their awesome service!) I got my order fast too, thanks to the whole team! 


Updated review:
Sunday Sept 24, 3:25 am

It would of been nice if my Cali Chicken Club had the smashed avocado it is suppose to have. I didn't even mind the bad attitude the girl had making my order, I get it- it's 3 am but would appreciate my order done correctly especially since there is definitely no rush of other guest at that time. I would recommend speaking to your employee about her efforts. Thank you."}
{"text":"Location is walking distance from the gym (Fitness 19) and yoga studio (Sweat), so after work out or yoga I come here to grab myself a superfood smoothie. 

Staff is friendly (most of the time), but I'm giving 3 stars just because there's only one person running the whole place usually, and it takes awhile for them to give me my smoothie, and there are other people waiting for theirs also."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes in line with one person in front of me who had already ordered. I then ordered a smoothie and a flatbread and then the madam take 1 more order and then a man who came into the establishment 40 minutes after I came into the store states he ordered a smoothie through \"the app\" and she proceeds to make all his items first. Spent and hour in this fucking place. The smoothie was good though."}
{"text":"I hate that I even have to give it one star! Love tropical smoothie and  get it all the time but this location particularly has a problem. Any unfortunate thing is I live in Southern Highlands so it's my closest location.   This is why I feel I have to give it a review now.
 Customer service is horrible!! 
 No one ever answers the phone for a mobile order. The place is filthy!  Tables or dirty windows are dirty cabinets or broken,  to mention they have one person working, who does customer service cashiering food prep, and has a bad attitude but no wonder it's just him doing it all. 
 This is a resolvable problem you just need better management, this location it's in a nice part of town were people enjoy being out and the business is there. 
 I hope this gets resolved I hate to think that I have to go to the blue diamond location every time  because I don't have 45 minutes to get a smoothie!"}
{"text":"There was a piece of glass on my sandwich. I didn't realize it and thankfully I didn't swallow it, but oh my god I was in shock. I can never go there again because I'm worried for my safety. Everyone please be careful and check your sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star because every time I come here we end up waiting 20-30 minutes. It doesn't matter if you are the first person in line or the 10th, you will wait FOREVER. They refuse to hire more staff so there is only ever 1 person working. Not worth going here unless you want to be late to your next stop."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful Sat morning 11am, thought we'd grab a few smoothies. ONE employee, really?!? One - taking orders, making drinks. 12 drinks had to be made in front of mine. Where's the manager? If you won't hire a second person, get your ass here and back this employee up. She's working her tail off to serve unhappy customers that will probably avoid the place next smoothie craving. I had to wait way too long, and to me it's also a security issue. C'mon Trop Smoothie, step it up or move aside and let a Jamba Juice take over."}
{"text":"It is around 230pm and it took 5-10 mins for each person that came in, including myself, to be acknowledged and then order. No one smiled. No one said thank you. No one really acknowledged anyones patronage to the store. Anyone who ordered food and smoothies received their smoothies after their food in 30mins I was stuck in the store. For the cost and service it's definitely not worth the stop in."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location they get my order wrong ! I do not eat meat and specifically told them I don't want chicken with my salad. They gave me a wrap with chicken instead. I rather drive another 3 miles up the street to the other one because this one sucks."}
{"text":"Came to this place Saturday the server was Marcus B. Place the order at 4:32, 40 minutes after I follow up on my order, what he was doing cause he was by himself, took all orders from customers in line and he prepares the orders altogether so it doesn't not matter if your ordered first or ordered last cause you will get your order all at the  time. When I asked to cancel my order he told me to come the next day for a refund cause he cannot do it for me, really??? I used to go there a lot , not any more . Talking about poor customer service, very unprofessional. I guess I'm just 1 single customer. I wish their management will look highly on this."}
{"text":"I ordered ahead of time was told my order would be ready 8:25am. I didn't show up until 8:29 and when I asked where the order was I was told it would be \"a few seconds\" and that she had to help other customers first. I ordered ahead of time because I needed my order ON TIME, so I could be on time for work. I wasn't aware those who walk in and don't order ahead take priority. The girl was rude, never apologized for the delay, and I ended up leaving without my breakfast sandwich so I wouldn't be late to work."}
{"text":"Hello.. I've waited at the drive thu.. I'm calling and have called four times and this location is empty. NOT 24/7 NOT open late.. false advertising! Waisted my time ( I used to love this place) sad moment.. tell your friends, we need a new locals 24 hour smoothie cafe! I wish I could give half a star but I don't have that option.. that's really not cool.. - stars below ZERO."}
{"text":"My whole family loves Tropical Smoothie, and there is one right by our house. 
The problem you ask? The african American girl who works there is RUDE! Not just once, but EVERY time we go!! 
Tonight I sent my son's there to get me a smoothie and when he walked in he heard, \"Sir, shut the F**ck up!!\", coming from the back. She said it repeatedly from somewhere in the back. 
My boys decided to leave and go to In N Out. As they were leaving they saw her peaking from the back watching them leave!! Really?!! We will never go to Trop again unless she is gone. 
On a good note..The African American guy that works there is AWESOME I must say, but it's like playing Russian roulette to go now! We refuse to go in because of this absolutely horrendous girl! 
This is the one on Tropicana and Hualapai in the Smiths shopping center."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed !! 

I waited at the counter for about 2 minutes before being helped mind you this place was completely empty . The employee walked out from the back office . This place was VERY dirty . Trash all over the ground even behind the counter and all around the floor by the prep area . My wrap was the smallest I've ever seen . Like it was for a children's meal . I only came here because of the size of the wrap . I am lost for words with this location !!"}
{"text":"If half star was possible, it would be more accurate. Ordered two smoothies and a wrap. 15 mins later I asked about it and they had totally forgot."}
{"text":"This location is too slow. Only 1 person working when there definitely should be more. Most of the time the staff is rude but tonight I ended up walking out because I was standing there for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to take my order when I was the only customer in the entire place. The girl working completely ignored me so I went to the tropical smoothie on blue diamond and Arville..staff was so much nicer and got my items out to me very quickly"}
{"text":"Location is poorly mananged, 1 person during their haply hour, apparently new to this store and all by herself, people are walking out almost as soon as they come in and I have been waiting for my order 30 minutes, I regret coming here to the point I am not coming back, will deter anyone from making this mistake of coming here"}
{"text":"I frequent Tropical Smoothie, around twice a month, sometimes more. Just not this Location.  I also get the same thing almost every time.  For starters, this location is rude, I walk up to order, and the lady can't bother to come over, she makes me talk to her across the room so she can just enter the order at the drive thru window.  

Ten Minutes Later Waiting for my Food..

I ordered the Orange GINGER Glow.  I get the smoothie, and there's no taste of ginger. I politely tell the lady that won't give the courtesy of leaving the drive thru, \"I don't think there is ginger in this\"  the lady who made the smoothie gives me attitude and is like, I put ginger in there. Then ignores me. 

Look, when there's ginger in these smoothies, YOU KNOW. Anyone who drinks smoothies or juices, knows ginger is a snack in the face.  There wasnt ginger in it, I get this smoothie all the time at a different location. 

After I say, great customer service.. she offers another one.. which, to no avail, has barely any ginger taste.

Also, I ordered the hummus veggie bowl.. and the pictures is what I got.  It was quite pathetic compared to the ones I get at another location. 

This location is rude, can't follow recipes, and makes poor food."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst location in Vegas. The wait to even order is 15 minutes, the gentleman in the back making smoothies don't even notice you're there. They don't great you or even say that it will be a minute. They're extremely backed up on orders and it's not even busy. People have been waiting here for 30 minutes and haven't received their 2 smoothies they ordered. I'm not sure what the deal is here but the workers seem to hate their job and definitely don't want to be here which is extremely obvious. This location needs new management."}
{"text":"I go to this location a lot and spend a lot of money at this one only due to the fact that it's on my way home from work. I usually get the same thing all the time. Last night I ordered the Island Green, but they gave me the wrong smoothie. It was green but it was the Detox one with Ginger in it, which I've tried and am not the biggest fan of. By the time I noticed I was already too far to drive back and get the correct one I ordered. I can see if it was super busy the mistake could of happened, but when I pulled up a guy was outside on the corner smoking and on his phone while another teen boy was inside. Mistakes like this shouldn't be being made for paying customers. I was disappointed and annoyed. Make sure you have your correct easy order before driving away"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for my smoothie. Then returned it for a new one. Not happy. 
- I came back two weeks later.. Service was great.. Smoothies tasted great"}
{"text":"Bad service. The quality is horrible. They made our drinks tasted so bad and we asked them to remake it and they gave us the same one with the straw still in it. When we asked them they acted like they didn't know what we were talking about. They said they were so confused! Really?"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service I'm ever seen out of any tropical smoothie. Management is awful, they have 1 person running the store and it's terrible ... don't ever go there ever"}
{"text":"The store is always dirty and short staffed. I recently waited 22min for a smoothie. While the smoothies are what you'd expect from this well known brand, I don't know if the long waits and unkempt store is worth it. The store on Blue Diamond is much more reliable, speedy, and consistent... I suggest the short drive to the other locations."}
{"text":"Food is good and smoothies are great but the reason why  it's 1 star it's because, I ordered at 8:07pm via the app, chose 8:40pm pick up as advertise \"Skip The Line\" but when I got there at 840pm, there was one woman working and had to wait an extra 15mins for my order. I ordered online for the convenience but never again with this location. DO NOT ADVERTISE SKIP THE LINE IF YOU CAN FULFILL AN ORDER WITH THE SAID REQUESTED PICK UP TIME. Customer service is awful, the lady that was working saw me standing in line waiting and she did not even say Hi or recognize that I was there and when she decided to talk to me she said \"what can I get you?\" rudely, might I add. Awful place!!! Ive been to a better Tropical Smoothie!"}
{"text":"No one at the register....Had to wait 20 minutes timed them on how long it would take to order my smoothie and the lady said she would discount the drink for waiting that long.. but she never gave me a discount.. and had to wait 15 minutes for them to make my smoothies when there was nobody in here ...also when another person walked in they took that long again and then forgot what the girl was waiting on!!! Definately don't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service!! I ordered 1 smoothie, took nearly 25 minutes! I've had full sit down meals come quicker than my 1 smoothie. I asked to speak to the manager, when I expressed my concern for such a long wait, she just rolled her eyes at me and walked away. I will not be a return customer, despite it being in my neighborhood.... I will drive out of my way to get better customer service! And to top it off my smoothie was less than smoothie....if I wanted a cup of ice chunks, that's what I would have ordered."}
{"text":"NO STARS!!! honestly, worst establishment i have ever been too and they don't seem to even care. One person working with a long line... no tortillas, she said they haven't prepped the chicken salad yet (it's noon) -- i didn't even bother to order anything else with the fear that they wouldn't have it. After stating there wasn't any tortillas she proceeds to put one of the orders in a tortillas which was supposed to be a bowl. I let her know that it was supposed to be a bowl and not a tortilla considering you just told me you didn't have any tortillas. She rolls her eyes and chucks the wrap into the trash. Spare yourself."}
{"text":"The wait is ALWAYS ridiculous! Even to take your order you wait a good 5-10 min. Went here on my way to work for something quick and there were about 3 cars ahead of me. So  I'mwaiting to place my order and 5 min later she asks me to wait.  So I'm sitting here waiting on her take care of the 3 cars ahead of me still waiting for my order to be taken. Now either the lady can't multi-task, isn't trained properly, or they are in need of more employees. I regret coming here everytime. I'm always late when I come here. ALL I WANTED WAS A SMOOTHIE!"}
{"text":"Update from the visit over a month ago. I had somebody call me a liar today here on yelp based on my previous review. Which has me asking how is this store still in business when you have employees like this"}
{"text":"Horrible service! They leave you waiting at the drive-through after you ordered a and then ask you for your order again. Of course that was after I kept saying hello. Never acknowledge that I was there"}
{"text":"The local tropical smoothie for southern highlands does a good job of being there when I need them.

Customer Service: 4/5 This place hires many high school aged employees and you can tell from walking in that they have to work on their meet and greet. Overall they are always nice and pleasant but sometimes they leaving craving a little bit more.

Da products: 4/5 I like the stuff they offer as far as shakes and food items. It's nothing too fancy as far food but the shakes are on point. Overall I will go for the shakes the food its alright.

Da price: 5/5 They give an excellent military discount specially when I'm in uniform. I'm very impressed wight he store owners that they do such a great discount, by far the best that I have ever received, thank you for your support of the armed forces as well as our boys in blue and red.

Da good: The coupons!!! at least once a week I'm receiving coupons from Tropical smoothie and they always have great sales going on. 
Also the wait times are great, i have gone in when I'm the only client and I have gone in when they are really busy, no matter what they have always been quick with the products and the quality has never suffered.

Da ugly: Customer service and the taste of the food can be thing they work on.

Overall: This place is great the kids have good spirits, and always competing to see who can make the fastest product or improving on their service time. The sales coupons always makes it a cheap fast food option that its the healthy side. And as for the military/police/firefighter discount, thank you management for being so great with it and giving back to those who sacrifice all!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in no one greeted, no one said hi. I waited about 4-5 minutes before I was even helped or welcomed not to mention this is my first time coming to this location so not a good start. Although after I was helped I got my food pretty quick. So I give them that as for customer service not so much of a fan."}
{"text":"I love this location it's never busy and my drinks are always really good. I've had problems at other one where my drinks were horrible. This place is always consistent it's my favorite one!"}
{"text":"Not a Vegas local. But this place is good! I got the Beach Bum which consists of strawberries, banana & chocolate (your choice of white/dark). Rashaé hooked it up, great customer service  if you download the app, you get $5 credit which is basically good enough for a free smoothie!"}
{"text":"The lady that works the counter was so rude and definitely didn't care about her job. The food was  was disgusting and the place was dirty and also I'm pretty sure this place needs a visit from public health. I feel bad for the owner of this place ..looks like the hired help is completely running this business to the ground. They are ignoring customer and busy blasting this music even though they have customers in the pla"}
{"text":"Great food and smoothies but horrible service. This place is always way understaffed. Young kids working here and always arguing in front of customers and the wait time is really long."}
{"text":"Every time we come here there is only one person working. Line is super long. They take forever to make the food and it is wrong EVERY time ?"}
{"text":"This is my first coming back here in a few years and now I remember why. Upon entering bit smells terrible, almost like a burned plastic smell. I order my smoothie and leave. I couldn't even drink my smoothie. It's pretty much all icy slush with barely any flavor at all. Very disappointing and I will not be coming back. Check out my picture."}
{"text":"I just got a Thai Chicken salad... without the chicken WTH. I was the only one in like at the drive though so I really don't know how they could have made this mistake."}
{"text":"Mid day and everyone taking orders has an attitude problem. Also, why are you gonna ask for someone's name on their order and then point and give the order to someone else? Why not call out their name? My order was still wrong after that and took about 40 minutes to even get it. Management should fire the whole day staff."}
{"text":"I really like Tropical Smoothies establishments. However, this store is inefficient and dirty. No sense ordering ahead as your order isn't prepared till you arrive. Owners need to hire at least two people and teach them how to keep the place clean."}
{"text":"A million stars to the young lady who helped us tonight around 10:15 pm...made a last minute change to our order...so friendly and accommodating and quick! Excellent service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I agree with all the other reviews. Horrible location! I love tropical smoothie cafe...but avoid this location!! Very bad customer service! I ordered a salad and once made it didn't have several items on it. When I brought the salad back to the counter the employee said that they were out of those items and would have to make more. Why wouldn't you just say that in the first place. So I requested a wrap instead to which the employees made it very obvious that I was putting them out. One employee took my salad out of my hands and literally tossed it into a trash can 4 feet away. Very rude and EVERY employee working obviously did not want to be there or happy to be serving the customers. There are plenty of other locations and food establishments to go to around this location. Go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Only 2 people working when I went and it took 20 minutes in the drive through to get our smoothie. Smoothie was fine and I'm just upset that I was stuck for so long."}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business?  The reviews do this place justice.  I was ordering and the cashier literally answers his cell phone, at the register, and says \"hey, I'm helping this white dude, what you want\"?  I have NEVER, in any place of business, had an employee answer his phone at the register while helping me let alone call me a \"white dude\".  I only came here because it was closer than the Blue Diamond location but moving forward I will never come to this place again.  Blue Diamond store will get all of my business.  Place is a joke - wouldn't be surprised if they fail health inspection."}
{"text":"So some guy I'm guessing an employee comes in from outside wearing an ATI uniform carrying textbooks and walk into the kitchen and starts making sandwiches without washing his hands just puts gloves on. Also answers his personal phone while working. Wtf"}
{"text":"It takes a very long time to get your order because they only have 1 person working. That employee also cannot give refunds if you decide to leave. 
Not a good place to go to on your lunch break 
Wasted a lot of time here waiting, and for that reason I won't return. The girl working was very nice. They should hire some help."}
{"text":"First time at this new location.  I had to cruise by and grab a Acai berry smoothie and a sandwich.  They were quick, friendly and very clean.  I've never had a bad experience at any of the Tropical locations."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie but this location has some of the most rude employees ever. I come in the mornings before work and every time I hit the drive thru the lady taking my order sounds like she hates her job and answers with attitude. Come on people I get it, it's early. But have some decent customer service. I mean shit it's already early in the morning, don't need attitude to go with my smoothie."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst tropical smoothies I have ever been to in my life. After waiting 22 minutes at the drive-through, they still gave me the wrong drink. Lastly, the drink tasted like shit after sitting at the counter for minutes, all melted."}
{"text":"Never been so uncomfortable in my life ordering food. Byosha didn't seem interested in taking our order.  No greeting or anything just a blank stare after we waited for her to take our order after replacing of the receipt tape. My wife asked what was on a turkey bacon ranch and we got attitude with the answer.  Will never return here."}
{"text":"this has to be the WORST trop location, i love trop,i have been to this location at least 5 times in hopes it would get better, because it is right by my work, but nope every time i got i get a sandwich and a smoothie and the smoothie is beyond watery and my sandwich has never had everything on it!!! they ALWAYS miss something and the veggies and fruits taste so old!!!!! one time the only thing on my sandwich was literally just sandwich meat and bread LOL WRONG!!!! and on top of it their customer service is beyond horrible i wish i could rate this 0 stars but NOPE I WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS TROPICAL SMOOTHIE LOCATION, I WILL TAKE EXTRA TIME AND DRIVE OUT OF MY WAY TO GO TO A DIFFERENT ONE!1"}
{"text":"Menu and food a both usually pretty good, but clearly the owner is CHEAP as hell. There is ALWAYS only ONE person working and they're ALWAYS BUSY. I know the importance of keeping your over head down but that's unacceptable. Even if you try to call ahead, they don't ever answer the phone and when they do they put you on hold just t eventually hang up on you themselves. I imagine the employee's  would be a lot friendlier if they weren't being treated terribly by customers who can't understand why they have to wait so damn long. Corporate ought to consider who they allow to open franchises  with their name on it."}
{"text":"I went 2 days in a row. Yesterday I got the peanut butter cup and today the Bahama Mama! 
Omg the Bahama Mama is the bomb!!! it taste like a pink starburst!! I want to go back and get another one but I need to calm down and wait till tomorrow lol. The staff have smiles on their face and are super friendly. The girl at the front counter complimented me yesterday and today went looking for me when I stepped outside because I thought it would take a while for the smoothie to be ready."}
{"text":"Wow, one person working on a Friday night. Drive thru is full so I went inside to order, still waiting. I mean, how horrible is management to not schedule enough people for a shift."}
{"text":"My favorite go to post gym smoothie fix, fills my gut and cools me down.  Same as valley wide chain company but the staff here is always very polite, nice and upbeat.  Iris always greets me with a smile and a positive attitude, even when slammed with a long line, kids, and phone orderes!   Staff and customer service always makes a difference!  Give them a raise!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Waited to order for a minute and no one spoke to me thru the speaker. Thinking that it was broken I proceeded to the line, I Waited 15 minutes in the line. I finally get to the window so I can order & the worker told me I couldn't order because he has everyone else order and I told him nobody spoke thru the speaker and he told me I need to be a little more patient & that I could go back around."}
{"text":"They have made my drink twice and still can't get the flavor right. Why is it that this is the only trop smoothie that I have been to that sucks worst than the suckyest suck that has ever sucked??"}
{"text":"We literally just came in here while waiting in line for Rise & Shine in 110 degree heat. We wanted to cool off and we knew we had about a 45 minute wait. They don't have a lot of variety of smoothies on their menu. Interestingly, I think their menu is more food-focused, rather than smoothie-focused, considering that the name is \"Tropical Smoothie Cafe.\" I ordered a mango smoothie, which wasn't terrible. I don't know if I'd come back unless I was waiting for Rise & Shine again lol"}
{"text":"Stood there for 10 minutes waiting for the girl to acknowledge is. When she did she elected to tell us she couldn't help us if we wanted peanut butter because sh was out and we couldn't order food because her oven is broken. And she still wouldn't take our order. We love Tropical Smoothie & we are regular customer, but we won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Can I leave like a quarter of a star? Seriously the lady that was there had a nasty attitude, the meal I ordered came with a side (which she didn't give me). Seriously the worst customer service ever. Go literally anywhere else"}
{"text":"An upgrade to their previous location in same plaza, Tropical Smoothie now sits in its own large building with a drive through window which makes it super convenient.  A very open and spacious layout compared to other Tropical Smoothie locations, this one features many bar style seats and just a few tables.  Decided to try the avocalada today which is very refreshing but can be a bit too sweet sometimes so I recommend the island green or detox island green which are similar but not as sweet.  Usually I will pair a smoothie with the chicken pesto flatbread which is a great combo for lunch or snack in general.  Love the special rollouts they bring out every so often, this month happens to be the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken flatbread that looks quite delicious.  Enjoying the upgraded location and convenient drive through window so I'll be sure to keep coming to this location."}
{"text":"Normally i like this place but today I ordered 3 bahama mama and I'm going to include a picture of the three and let you decided what wrong with the third drink the guy was kinda moody so maybe thats why it's different he was by himself"}
{"text":"Takes foreverrrrrrrrrr!  Not sure why it does, because there's like four people working back there... Actually, one of them is on their phone so it's more like three people working.

I live near this place and I always think twice about coming here.  My first thought being, \"Do I really want to wait?\"  Today, I wanted a smoothie so I decided to time my wait, starting it after placing my smoothie & half sandwich order.  Nearly 12 minutes.  (-_-)

Hope they can get it together."}
{"text":"My favorite location in the city. 

I always order my avocolada on the app and I never have a problem pulling up to the drive through window and grabbing my drink waiting for me. Taste is consistent which is a problem I have at other locations. 

I haven't been in it ordered through the drive through. If you drink here often like me, weekly... I suggest getting the app. 

I'm a forever fan of avocolada."}
{"text":"Smoothie was good but double check your food order..gave me the wrong salad. Showed my receipt then they still seemed confused, and weren't very friendly about fixing it."}
{"text":"Do they not read their reviews? How many people have to comment about the lack of staff on a weekend. It's Sunday, I have just watched three groups of people leave rather than wait. I did the same thing yesterday. I feel for the employees. Pretty sure there are franchise standards with respect to speed. I love tropical smoothie but I will have to get my fix at the Blue Diamond store- it's a training store so they always have plenty of people working."}
{"text":"I visit this place often mainly because of the location. It's down the street from where I live and next to the gym I go to. So it's very convenient.

If you've been to one tropical smoothie you've been to them all (smoothie quality wise) and for the food, it just depends on what you order. Most of their flat breads are pretty good but sometimes they run out of (most) ingredients so I just stick to their smoothies, especially after the gym which is right next door.

Im glad they updated their location to a bigger building with a drive thru window. Inside you'll see bar style seats and a few tables. Service is a hit or miss at this location. I think it depends on the time of day, not all employees seem happy. Sometimes they seem to be understaffed (1 employee) for hoe busy it gets, so I mainly blame management for their employees unhappiness.

If you drink often get the app and order ahead if you're in a rush. 

Happy Drinking!"}
{"text":"Only one here took 3 minutes for employee to even look at me much less speak and did Ordered ahead but they did. It even start until I told them so much for technology. The place was clean and smoothie tasted ok"}
{"text":"Oh, I should have looked at the ratings before I ordered from this location. Shocker that it's so low. Not! Ordered a chicken salad sandwich toasted, baked lays chips and a smoothie. Got a salad and a smoothie. This was ordered on UberEATS as I'm working from home today, so paid 4.99 for delivery. Horrible! They don't answer their phone, so I can't even let them know."}
{"text":"Since they've opened I've been here twice and they've been on point each time. I've had the island green, lean machine, and acai berry boost. I've had the club sandwich and ceasar salad. Both times I've had great customer service and the inside is extremely clean thanks to a new building. Hopefully they keep it up because the last tropical smoothie in this plaza was pretty bad. Yay for smoothies!"}
{"text":"If you are in any kind of hurry I would avoid this place. They are extremely slow and under staffed. No since of urgency at all and a wait time could be up to 30-45 minutes easily for a smoothie??"}
