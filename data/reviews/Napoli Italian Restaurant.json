Friday Night

Food: We have been to Napoli's several times now. At times, we have ordered pizza and have never been disappointed. Freshly made to order and tasty. Other times we have ordered a shrimp and pasta dish and other pasta dishes, and they have all been good with nice, sizable portions. We would stick with the pizza first, pasta dishes second, anything else is a crap shoot. 

Huge plus- you get free, hot Italian bread that is already buttered on the inside along with an oil dipping sauce. Most pasta dishes also come with a garden salad.

We must make a short comment about the cheese steak sandwich. We're big fans of cheese steaks and when we a sign posted outside saying they have \"the best cheese steak in town\" we had to try. Good-  yes, the best - nope. Having mayo as a standard is a plus as is offering either provolone or mozzarella cheese. But it just did not have the wow factor. 

Service: Excellent. Very friendly service and attentive service. Waitstaff well trained and takes care of you like you should be. It has been like that each time we have gone here.  

Price: Fair prices for the pizza and pasta dishes we ordered. They also have daily specials.      

Other: Soft Italian music playing in the background makes for a nice, relaxing ambiance. We have frequented Napoli's exclusively on weekend nights and there has never been a wait. Being on Independence, many of chain restaurants have waits often long waits during the prime time weekend hours. Think Olive Garden. We would rather go to Napoli's any day.  

Tip: Sometimes Napolis has a Groupon.  If you see it, try to grab it because it's a great deal. It's too bad they don't have more coupons out there.  We think their business would really boom."}
{"text":"Napolis is an old favorite of mine. My friends and I discovered it in high school, and it was an instant hit. The pizza is great, the garlic bread is cheap, and we always have a good time."}
{"text":"On a whim, the wife and I decided to give Napoli a try. I'm certainly glad we did. Once we sat down, I got on here to check out their reviews. I was surprised to hear some of the negative things said, as our experience was excellent. Our waitress was courteous and prompt with refills, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time AND it was quite good. The bread sticks coulda had more flavor, but this isn't the only place that serves what I consider bland breadsticks, it's not a deal breaker. Now, for the people saying this is authentic Italian food: Come on. You've obviously never had REAL Italian food. This, however, is good Americanized Italian food. There is a vast difference. 

The best of all was the Tiramisu. I LOVE Tiramisu!, and this was the best I've tasted in a while.

Kudos to the staff and owners of Napoli. This may have been our first visit, but it certainly won't be our last."}
{"text":"Pizza was not good at all, tasted like rubber and cheese slid off crust at every bite. Waitstaff forgot to bring napkins and made us wait for plates after the pizzas got to the table. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Let me start out saying we always have great quality food and great drinks at fair prices.But, I have learned my lesson and will never order a Margarita Pizza again. Twice it came soggy because it was made with canned tomatoes  and not tomato sauce! The waitress insisted that the \"sauce\" makes it soggy. Hmmmm  So, go and enjoy the restaurant but don't order the Margarita Pizza."}
{"text":"I don't understand why his place has bad reviews?!?! It's honestly the bomb! If you want good Italian food this is the best place in the Monroe area! The lasagna there is the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Good food, nice evening, good service. Only negative was that they added gratuity to the check for our party of six. We did not realize and therefore double tipped. My bad, I will closely check next time."}
{"text":"Arrived early wait wasn't bad for a Friday evening.  Was in the mood for pizza. Ordered white pizza and a traditional thick with sausage. The pizza was served. The white pizza was good could use a bit more toppings. The thick pizza on the other hand was terrible!  Not enough sauce for how thick and dry it was not to mention it was burnt. (To the point where they actually cut the crust off so it \"didnt seem or wasn't so noticeable\" we asked for more sauce to dip the dry burnt pizza in and the waitress got defensive. (We werent asking for our money or another pizza) She literally reached over the table (my plate) didnt say pardon me nothing to lift the pizza to see if it was burnt and said its not burnt its just the edges. Ok the bottom was not burnt but the outside of the pizza was BURNT and you couldnt cut it! Rude and no manners. The owners should take a second look around!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible  Their spaghetti tasted like it was out of a can. Never going back again. Told everyone in neighborhood and they said thanks. They recommended some where else"}
{"text":"I love Napoli's, can't go wrong! It's where me and the fam congregate when I'm in town from NYC and the food is great! Always love pierogi pizza my Pittsburgh favorite!!!!! xoxo"}
{"text":"It's been about 8 years since I've eaten here and after reading others' recent reviews, I admit that I was a bit skeptical.  So here goes my review of lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  
We were greeted and seated right away. Complimentary bread, oil & balsamic vineger dipping sauce, and drinks came to the table shortly afterwards.  Their bread was delish, might I add!   I ordered antipasto salad, and clam chowder; my daughter had spaghetti with meat sauce.  The clam chowder had plenty of potatoes and was good, and my salad was very good. I will admit that I've never had an antipasto salad presented like this one was, with large slices of cheese placed on top of the salad rather than in rolls or smaller pieces rolled up with the meats - it looked a little odd to me, however, the taste of it was excellent none the less.  Even though antipasto typically comes with Italian dressing, I wanted to try their blue cheese after having read a previous review.  I wasn't disappointed at all in our food. Some reviewers weren't fans of the meat sauce, it is a basic sauce, but having tasted my daughter's spaghetti, I thought it was very good. I would def order the spaghetti & meat sauce, something I usually don't order in a restaurant simply because you never know how their sauce will taste. And as a side note: the drinks are huge!
I liked the atmosphere and the style of music playing - sort of like Dean Martin & Frank Sinatra.
The only drawback: their bathroom is in dire need of remodeling. Everything worked, but it could def stand a cosmetic makeover."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We ordered takeout for Valentine's Day to avoid crowds, but won't order from here again. The soup was the best part, them went downhill. I ordered veal parmigiana and it was the worst I've had. Drenched in sauce and cutlets were overlooked with coating almost burnt. When I went to eat leftovers the second night, I ended up discarding most of it. My wife had linguini with marinara and hot sausage. Linguini was overlooked and sausage was bland."}
{"text":"I always get the combo deluxe it's the closest thing you can get to a Philly cheesesteak in the immediate area.  At times it can be bland.  The service has always been good but the decor could use some updating for sure."}
{"text":"This is Italian for Old People.

I had the baked ziti and it was basically pasta flopped on a plate with a flavorless marinara and cheese that was set under the heat lamp to melt the cheese.  I've had bad pasta in my life but this is the absolute worst.  My partner fared a bit better with the steak sandwich (he eats meat) and he said it was not bad. I ordered a glass of wine and the bottle must have been open a while because it was not good.  Beer is cheap however and tastes fine.

The only upside was the server who was attentive without being annoying. 

I was told when I fist moved here that it was bad.  I should have listened."}
{"text":"Not a real Italian Restaurant or Trattoria...more like cafeteria food. 
Even the draft beer was tainted. 
Maybe it could be better if they paid closer attention to details and put some TLC into the place."}
{"text":"This is not what I had ordered.  I was extremely upset to return home and find out that I was given a salad with awful dressing.  I'm annoyed that I was charged for my dinner and had received less than for what I had paid.  I'm unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. The chicken parm was a big serving as was the gnocci, stuffed shells and steak salad."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining here, and we absolutely loved it. We had a hard time deciding what to order because their menu had a little bit of everything, and it all sounded wonderful! We started with house salads which was a perfect portion  size and their homemade dressings were very good. Fresh bread out of the oven was delicious. I ordered something called the \"basil pesto chicken\" ( can't remember the exact name) and it was not only large enough to take leftovers home for lunch today, but it was full of flavor and the chicken was moist. My fianc√© ordered the Chicken Nicole and it was unlike anything I've ever tasted. He loved it! He also got a side of linguini alfredo, and it was the best alfredo he has ever had. When we got the check we were pleasantly surprised. Our dinner was almost half the cost of what you would spend at olive garden, and the food and experience was 10000x better. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent meals for the price, pizza is just OK, the bar area is large, good for watching sports, the eating area is good for families.   The restaurant area is kept pretty clean, I always had good service here too."}
{"text":"Napoli is consistent at serving good food. It gets a little too busy for my tastes sometimes and if I see any line I don't wait. It's a friendly environment and comfortable. Could use a little cleaning/updating, but overall it's a good deal."}
{"text":"My family and I wanted to enjoy a delicious Italian dinner.  So we decided to try Napoli.  The kids got spaghetti and meatballs, my husband had the Veal Marsala, and I had the Chicken Francese.  Our meals we just terrible, I could have and should have just made dinner at home.  The spaghetti sauce tasted like the kind that comes in a can.  It was horrible.  The decor of the restaurant hasnt been updated since the 80s, it is very dark.  Maybe they should call Gordon Ramsey for some help and they we will give another chance."}
{"text":"Just had a business lunch at Napoli today.  Our waiter was great, very attentive and not to pushy.  The atmosphere was very cool, old school Italian, with soft music playing in the background.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken, it was very delicious."}
{"text":"Craving a pizza and thinking that a local restaurant would be better than mass produced chains, we order the greek pizza at Napolis.  The crust reminds me of saltines somehow bound together to make a crust.  It seemed to have layers rather than being either a thin or thick crust.  Most pizzas are made to be consumed on the run, but this Greek pizza had quartered tomatoes not sliced tomato.  Why I ask?  We ordered a side salad and it was iceberg lettuce with no embellishments.  Where is the Italian in that I ask?  All in all, disappointing."}
{"text":"Did not have a wonderful experience at this so-called want to be Itaian restaurant the owner of the restaurant was nasty the food I would not even feed to my dog so if anyone is thinking about going to this so-called restaurant I would say do not"}
{"text":"Food was horrible and very over priced. This place needs a whole new menu or people who can acctually cook. Only upside is the wait staff was good. Dont go here you will be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I had lunch with my coworker here and the meatball baked was delicious!  The meat tasted like butter and they actually stuffed them with parmesean cheese. SUPPER YUMMY"}
{"text":"After several changes of ownership this restaurant has delicious Italian and Mediterranean food. I t is solid and slightly overcooked, but it is very flavorful. We like to go there for comfort and quiet time."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant based on reviews from another website (gulp) - big mistake. 

Very greasy / tasteless /circa 1970's Italian food, replete with the map of italy place mats is what awaits in this dining establishments.

Upon entering the building we were taken aback at the overall dirtiness of the floors - food, break, cracker crumbs everywhere - there is a new invention called a vacuum cleaner that the establishment should look into.

The next thing you notice is that the dining room has two large TV in it and they are also playing loutish contemporary music, but they have nice tea lights on the table. The bar is in the back, why not put the TV's and the music back there instead of in the restaurant?

They told me that their Italian wedding soup is a specialty so I tried it. It was the strangest one I have ever had, it had minimal spinach in it, just a fleck or two, tiny meatballs and shredded beef (I think it was beef). The flavor was okay but the layer of grease on it was unappetizing. 

We tried the appetizer platter of fried greasy food. The potato skins were over-cooked potato cheese sauce and bacon  - wow original. The zucchini served in long strips was not good because the breading fell off if you tried to pick it up they served it with a canned marinara sauce that was insipid. The cheese wedge (menu said we get 2 we got 1) was good.

I had the chicken Nicole - two chicken breasts with the grizzle left on cooked on top of roasted red peppers drizzled with balsamic and tons of olive oil. Top it with blue cheese and you Chicken Valdez Oil spill dish. I probably don't have to say it but the side of Pasta was overcooked and topped with canned sauce. We also had a calzone,  the dough was tasteless, hunks of chewy whole milk mozzarella and ricotta were inside - top it off with the canned marinara and you have one pretty insipid calzone.   

Will the food kill yah? Eventually of a heart attack, you can do so much better at home that there is no way that I could recommend this place 2 stars because the food was edible - but not very good."}
{"text":"Not a place I would go back to.  Slow service, waitress was sweet.  Food was mediocre at best.   The meat sauce was in a par with Chef boy ar Dee.   Everything was sticky and the dust on the window sills and blinds was 1/4 inch thick.   Gross."}
{"text":"I lived in Monroe for years before ever trying Napoli. I don't know what took me so long, but I was pleasantly surprised when I finally did. The ambience is nice, the decor has a rustic charm that I liked immediately; it's quiet, the lighting is perfect, and the feeling is intimate. The wait staff are always excellent, and the owner is very friendly and accommodating.

They have a lot of pasta dishes and some pizzas but I'm not a big pasta/pizza eater, BUT I LOVE their Caesar salad; I've had Caesar salads in big fancy, pricey restaurants that weren't nearly as good as Napoli's Caesar. 

So for me the main things are the atmosphere, the friendly and efficient staff, and the Caesar salad, and FYI - they do also have vegetarian dises."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews and thus far my experience has been pleasant. The salad dressings are made from scratch. I love when restaurants take the time out to make their dressings and dips.. My blue cheese dressing is a little thin however the flavor is still present. 
I received my salad in a timely fashion along with my bread and dip.
I ordered the Vegetable Lasagna. I am sure the vegetables are not fresh veggies. They are either frozen or prepackaged. The spinach is a little coarse; which also leaves a little bit of an after taste. The overall taste isn't horrible...the quality of ingredients just need to improve. 
The staff is friendly and attentive. I have 3 stars because of the quality of ingredients.. If they were fresher, 5 stars would have been given."}
{"text":"Good service and decent food but the restaurant needs a major update. I always give one star less when the restroom does not have hooks in the stalls. This restroom also has tacky plastic floral display. Would probably be better for takeout than dine in."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with a friend. He said the steak sandwich was good but the shrimp scampi I had was not. The shrimp was just \"okay\" while the side of spaghetti and meat sauce was awful. It tasted like high school cafeteria food. It can best be described as bland and tasteless with canned sauce. My friend didn't believe me when I told him how bad it was, at least until he tried some of it. Not worth the price, fast food is better."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic authentic Italian food. We had the Lasagna and Manicotti. Very quick being seated. Drinks flowing in less than 2 minutes. Salads in less than 5 along with the bread. Placed our order and had it in about 10 minutes on a fairly busy night too! Came out piping hot and needed a box to carry out another meal tomorrow. With all the opening and closings of restaurants in Monroe, prime example of one that had lasted and once you eat here you'll know why."}
{"text":"Sitting here on burger night.  Beware, the portabellio \"burger\" has \"NO\" meat in it! Other than the veggie-burger , it is the only item on the menu without meat or salmon.   Not explicit in the menu, but only by omission of the word \"meat\".   Good, but not as advertised!  Waitress clueless, management absent.   After 10 years, I may need to find another neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is good depending on what you choose.  I am not a fan of the meatballs or meat sauce, however the marinara is good.  The pesto sauce was way too thick. I got the stuffed shells and they were delicious.  The homemade ranch and Italian dressing were good.  The bruschetta and garlic bread are great! Service is excellent.  Overall a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered veal parmesan; no taste.  Spouse could not eat hers ( green pesto sauce).  How do you make spaghetti sauce with no flavor ?"}
{"text":"This seems to be a popular place, especially for groups.  There were a few large groups and the Big Square Sicilian Pizza was coming out fast and furiously.

Stopped by for a hoagie.  The Italian hoagie was good and it comes with homemade potato chips which real crunchy and perfectly cooked.

The bar area has quite a few TV's and had different football games on.  Waitress was friendly and changed one TV to a different game at the request of a few people sitting together."}
{"text":"The place is situated in a shopping plaza, I had low expectations.  I was surprised at the overall quality.  We had the wedding soup and spit our orders of Seafood Alfredo (Shrimp & Scallops) and Veal Parm, all exceptional.  The place is set up family style with a  small sports bar as you go towards the back.  Service was attentive, friendly and prompt.  Could not have asked for more."}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week sometimes more! Their prices are excellent! They give you a great portion of food & it's always delicious! I have nothing but good words to say about this restaurant! The people are friendly & always welcoming! Great Italian food & great atmosphere- I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a 5-star authentic Italian cuisine!"}
{"text":"I visited here with my father after not coming here for a few years. We remembered enjoying the food! Walking in it was a little busy and the wait was about fifteen minutes. The lady seating people at the front could have been a little bit more pleasant, but the rest of the staff was super friendly. We really enjoyed our waitress, she was very nice. I got the special called chicken tortellini primavera. I also got wedding soup. Bread comes with this entree too. The bread and soup were very delicious. My chicken tortellini had so much watery sauce it was way too soupy for me. The vegetables were okay in it, but there were more of those than chicken or tortellini. I think if this dish had a creamer and cheesier sauce it could be excellent. Overall, it was an average dish for me. My dad told me he really loved the chicken Parmesan dish he ordered. I tried a bite and it did taste great! We were also able to use a coupon which was great too."}
