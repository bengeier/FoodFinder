{"text":"I came here with work friends to watch a Pens playoff game. There were loads of people, probably getting a quick bite to eat before going to the game next door. We managed to get a table inside and shared potato skins, wings and a bbq chicken pizza . I am not a huge wings fan so I didn't have any, but everyone said they were great. The potato skins were very good, not at all greasy. The bbq chicken pizza was perfect. Not too sweet or salty, the crust wasn't dripping with grease, and it had just the right amount of sauce on it and a generous amount of chicken. The waitress was friendly and attentive. It was a bit slow getting our food, but they were really busy. I would definitely have no problem going back to watch another game there."}
{"text":"You have no idea how great of a time we had here.  My bad day went to one of the funnest nights for my wife and I.  I will see you again soon and I will be sure to tell my friends and family about Tailgaters as well."}
{"text":"And this is the message the owner e-mailed me.  Seems like custome service is not our strong point?  Hmmmm  \"Hey Brian, I am the owner of Tailgaters, funny how you were asked to leave due to YOUR Behavior, also funny that I carry over 60 beers not jst the number one selling beers in the country!!!! Anyway I reported you to Yelp and told them to review all your comments because it seems you have had a problem with everywhere you have been??? Is this coincidence? Or maybe your the problem, I have been open for over 3 years Never had an incident and do Extremely Well and have great reviews , very new to yelp but it wont be long till they are all good here as well, funny not only pro athletes and coaches as well as professionals and residents from the plaza who gather here and have a blast , I do have an attorney and I will come after you for slander, watch what you say because you got shut down and then asked to leave!!!!!!!!!!! Jackie\"  And my response:  Hey Jacqueline H, I don't care who you are.  The way you have gone about this situations only brings more attention to you. This is probably worse for you than it is for me.  I have plenty of time to post about my own personal experience at your bar, but not nearly enough time to entertain your less than stimulating questions on a constant basis. If my review concerns you so much, you should consider retraining your staff. If you put as much effort into running your bar as you do with harassing patrons that give your bar less than stellar reviews, you'll be just fine.   In regards to you coming after me for slander, let me give you a brief law class, I've taken a couple myself. Slander is a defamatory remark made or communicated orally. Libel, on the other hand, is the written publication of a defamatory remark. Tell your attorney you want to come after me for libel NOT slander, that should get you on the right track. Cheers and BLOCKED!"}
{"text":"Small bar right next to Consol Energy Center.  For the location, the prices are pretty good.  Otherwise in the middle of nowhere, this is a great place to stop and grab a few drinks before heading to a Pens games.  Tons of TVs so you can catch up on other games, and there's a small heated patio out front.  They also serve pub food."}
{"text":"At the time of this review, I have lived in Washington Plaza apartments for about 1.5 years. My husband and I have been customers at Tailgaters for a couple of times. We will probably never return. We ordered foods such as nachos grande, wings, quesadillas, mozzarella sticks, caesar salad, fries, and pizza. The food tasted mediocre. We are not big drinkers, so I cannot comment on the bar."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I supposed if I lived in Washington Plaza, and I did (past tense) they would be ok for a burger if I really hate cooking.  Or a place to have a cigarette, at the outdoor seating, under cover. Bar is okay. Staff is inattentive.  Ordered a pretzel appetizer that never arrived. Ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. \"Fresh\" bun was stale ... Hard on one side.  \"Grilled\" chicken was burned... Not nice grill marks, charred black on one side and almost as bad on other.  No mayo, no setup, just burned chicken, grilled onions and red pepper, stiff bun.  Fries were okay. Would guess fresh cut. A tad greasy.  Took forever to get check; the place is small and only a quarter of the seats were filled at best.  Okay for a drink, but skip the food."}
{"text":"Came here a few times because it was at the bottom of our apartment. The food is okay but the service could be better. Most of the time people are in the kitchen and not actually paying attention to customers. I've experienced far better service in way busier bars."}
{"text":"Fun place to watch games.. And they have GREAT! Bar food yummy.. Make sure u get the hippy wings... Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Perfect place to go before or after hockey games or concerts/events at Console energy center.  Their wings, wraps, and pizza are excellent. They have a few awesome beers on tap (Sierra Nevada celebration ale and Yuengling) and 20 oz Bud lights and Labatts $3 specials all the time!  awesome, friendly bartender who will usually play whoever is playing at Console if you ask for it*.  *no guarantees on Justin Bieber or Creed!"}
{"text":"Little establishment next to Cambria Suites and the Energy center.  Food was merely acceptable, poor draft selection on tap, average to small bottled beer selection.  Prices were more expensive than I would have hoped for given the outwardly appearance of the tavern.  Service was fine.  Very convenient for those stuck within walking distance.  Nothing stood out as exceptional or above average at this establishment.  With the amount of excellent pubs, gastropubs, and eateries in the Pittsburgh area, I would highly suggest trying other locations.  Admittedly, I went because of proximity of establishment to the nearby hotel, not to catch the game, so take it as you will."}
{"text":"Best place ever!  Like a family!  I'm here all the time.  I'm originally from NYC, this place has become my home away from home.  Just like my Cheers!  Great food, drinks, and conversation."}
