{"text":"A group of us wives got a Living Social for the 6-hour grilling and smoking class for our husbands last year. Awesome gift, huh? Nope. They all had a terrible time. One employee spent a big chunk of time in the beginning of the class explaining how much money they lose when the customer buys a coupon. Awkward! The guy had a whistle that he would blow if you talked too much, and the guys spent the majority of their time doing dishes. Lame. We were all in the doghouse for awhile for wasting their entire day. The only positive my husband said was that the guy that was grilling was nice and somewhat entertaining."}
{"text":"Got this class for my husband for Fathers Day and decided to be the partner in the class.  I'm glad I did as there is too much info for one person to absorb.  It turned out my Mike was at the grill most of the time getting instruction in what he likes best and I was inside learning how to prepare the food.  I gave it 4 stars because we were told that the CD would have all the notes from the class.  There was a PowerPoint that had alot of useful info that I was led to believe was on the CD; it turned out it was not.  The CD contains all the recipes (or concepts) as the instructor called them.  I would not have purchased the $15 CD if I had known this since they send you a link for the recipes that is actually clearer than what is on the CD.  We will be signing up for the Seafood class in the future as we learned a lot.  Our ribs turned out great, something we would not have even tried had we not taken the class."}
{"text":"This class is just awesome. It is a great way to learn, mingle, and have fun. Word to the wise. Do not forget your favorite cold beverage as the grills are a bit warm.  Feel free to bring an ice chest to share with the other students. This class is as social as it is educational. Well worth the investment."}
{"text":"Great class! The food was amazing and they gave us enough simple tips and tricks to duplicate it at home! I will be taking another class here soon."}
{"text":"Just took the Grilling and Smoking 101 class. This class was fantastic. I would not consider myself a beginner at the grill and still feel that I learned a tremendous amount of information in class today. The instructor was Lynda and the grill tech was Mark. Both were great. They are very knowledgable and friendly. No question went unanswered all day. The food we grilled was delicious. Lots of great tips for grilling meat, as well as veggies and desert items. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to elevate their grilling game to the next level."}
{"text":"Honestly, I thought I knew how to grill until I attended this school.  My wife thought it would be cheaper to attend the school than ruining one more brisket trying to get it right.  In the end, it was a phenomenal experience.  Linda and Mark were engaging, fun, and downright funny at times.  Be prepared for an experience that is \"hands-in\" rather than just \"hands-on\" as you will be immersed in preparation up to the elbows.  Great class, great fun - now I've got to go get my brisket started."}
{"text":"My wife got me the Grilling and Smoking 101 Class for a Christmas present. I have a Traeger smoker and a gas grill as well. I wanted to learn more about how to use it to it's fullest. Lynda and Mark did a great job with the class and I signed up for three additional classes because I was so impressed. Food was great! Teachers were Awesome and the whole experience was fantastic.

{"text":"My husband and i took this class in San Francisco. What a disappointment! We could not believe the structure of \"lecture\" (reading a power point to us for the first hour), looking at smokers for 30 minutes (no recommendations), and then having groups of 10 students making up recipes like barbeque sauces...\"start with bottled stuff and throw whatever you like in the pot\". The most concerning aspect was the cleanliness of the kitchen. Students were TOLD about bacteria transfer for poultry and meats, but washing/clean-up was done by students in a sink with disgustingly dirty sponges and limited hot water. We really wanted to love this class."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we'd try doing something different for date night...this was truely a great time! We met new people who love food, and had a great time learning new grilling/smoking techniques. Our instructor and Ryan were terrific! I have to admit though, the venue leaves a lot to be desired and it would be great if there was a little more elbow room for our full class!"}
{"text":"I attended this class over the weekend and was amazed at how knowledgeable the instructors were. I learned more than I ever thought I could about grilling, smoking, and marinating but I believe the best part was that we got to eat our delicious homework during class!! I would recommend The Phoenix BBQ and Grilling School to everyone as it was a great experience for a great price."}
{"text":"Had a great time, learned a lot and sampled some great food.  I encourage anyone interesting in grilling and smoking to take this class.  I will definitely go back and take some of their other classes."}
{"text":"Met my expectations! The class and food were excellent, even for a novice they gave me some very valuable info not only on smoking but grilling. The presentations were tight and delivered well by Cam. He was able to provide info even to those who seemed to be more skilled now need to take a seafood class."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful crew. Great for novice and someone working to improve their skill. Fun class to take with a spouse, friend or a group."}
{"text":"What a great day!  Ok, it was a surprise day for my husband - I just told him to dress comfortably and get in the car.  He had no idea what we were doing when we pulled into the parking lot, he was not disappointed.  

Not only was the class informative with great instructors, it was just fun.  There was lots of hands on participation, numerous grills and smokers to become acquainted with, and we met some really nice people.  Not to mention, there was tons of good food!

Thanks for a great day!"}
{"text":"Was this fun or what? I was amazed at how much I learned about grilling. The recipes and the ideas were amazing! I never knew I could enjoy vegetables so much. The instructor and assistance were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I will definitely return for some of their other classes. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I have been grilling and smoking a long time. Took the grilling 101 class and had a blast. Lynda was a great instructor and Ryan was a great tech. Learned some great things and had some great food with fun people. I will definitely be going back for at least two more classes. This would be a great father's day gift for any guy!"}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved it!  Lynda and Mark were great teachers, it was hands on, the food was fantastic, and the tips were invaluable.  My only (somewhat minor) complaint was that it was a packed house (24 or 26, I think) which made getting around a challenge and made it difficult for my hard-of-hearing husband to hear. We will definitely take more classes with them, and will look for a smaller class where he can sit near the front.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I participated in the 6 hour 101 introductory class a little over a week ago and was not disappointed. So much information was presented that it would be an unusual person who would be capable of remembering even half of what was communicated, but perhaps most important was the message to use your imagination while following some basic guidelines about temperature and seasonings. Lots of valuable information was given covering many different aspects of grilling and smoking. So much food was prepared that I could not keep track of which food was prepared on which grill. I only use charcoal to smoke and grill and would have preferred if only charcoal grills/smokers would have been used, but those who use gas or pellets would have come away with lots of useful information also. Stu kept the class moving . . . you definitely will not get bored! I have been using my BGE and Weber Kettle for many years, and am excited about applying new ideas and techniques learned from this class."}
{"text":"This class was lots of fun and had plenty of good information, Chef Cam was informative and entertaining. We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and of course the food was delicious! All around fun day!"}
{"text":"Awesome class it is soooo much fun & you learn so much as well! There's a ton of delicious food you even get to take with you!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended I take this course to learn how to better use my smoker.
The class was great, the instructors informative, they stressed cleanliness and how to avoid cross contamination,presented a lit of techniques I was not aware of  and the food was delicious.
I especially enjoyed the pulled pork, burnt ends and the home made BBQ sauce.
The store front also  has a great variety of tools, rubs and equipment.
Some of the neighboring tenants were a little noisy and it made  it difficult to hear some of the outdoor instructions.
 All in all thanks for a great day."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!  I now have the distinction of \"Best Wife Ever\"!!  :D  Purchased the 6 hour Smoking and Grilling class AND the 3.5 hour Seafood class for my husband's 50th birthday.  We live in Southern California so we made it a long weekend.  He had a great time!  The classes were filled with information (temperatures to cook, correct oil to use, correct way to sear, etc).  He purchased a new injector, spatula, and some \"John Henry\" spices - he cannot wait to grill this weekend for the family!  :)    We are proud to give Lana, Tony, Annette, Ryan, and the rest of the crew our HIGHEST (FIVE STAR) recommendation!!  :D

Cheers!  :D"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong? You have the view of the San Francisco skyline, tons of amazing food options (that you help cook and take care of), you get to bring your own booze and everyone is so nice and informative. By far the best groupon purchase ever! And if groupon was not an option I would have spent that money without fail. I learned so many awesome things about how to BBQ that I have taken them home and used them! Do it! Well worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I attended yesterday and had a great time and learned alot. Lynda, Mark and Dan were terrific!  The best part was we got to eat all the food that we learned to make. Great hands on class. Want to take their steak class and holiday class at the end of the year."}
{"text":"I am looking forward to the steak and the seafood classes. Great training experience."}
{"text":"Lynda and Ryan were fantastic!  I would recommend this for anyone wanting to learn or advance their grilling and smoking skills!"}
{"text":"We attended the seafood grilling class this past weekend with Terry and Lana. All I can say is that I'm disappointed. It was poorly organized and it felt like pure chaos. Everyone seem to enjoy themselves but it felt more like a bark yard BBQ to me, versus a class that I spent a lot of money for. The communication  was poor because people were bouncing from place to place and half the time we didn't know what was going on. At the end when we were eating  the salmon  the gentleman next to me asked where the scallops were and I told him those came off about an hour ago. he missed them entirely because he was outside  talking! At one point Tony asked me why I was doing something and I told him it was because Lana told me to lol.  Even made an announcement to the class and corrected what we were told . We attended the 101 class with Mark a few months ago and that was exceptional.  Maybe my expectations were set based on the experience with Mark? They offer a 202 class but we opted not to sign up because i wouldn't want to risk spending the money for another experience like the seafood class."}
{"text":"I attended the 4 hr Steak class first and then attended the 6 hr smoking and grilling class. I was very excited when I discovered these courses and enrolled right away. My wife and I attend the 4 hr steak class. I was very disappointed with this experience. It seems as if they do not care how many people they jam into the small room where the class is held. All of the tables were full and people kept coming and they were handed chairs and they jammed them when wherever they would fit.
 The instructor had never taught the class before. He was just reading from the power point. The course advertised learning how to cook  several different cuts of steak , pork and Ahi Tuna. Each table prepared a different dish that everybody would eat later that night. My table did the Portabello mushrooms. MUSHROOMS??? not what I came for. After everything was cooked we ate. The food and it was delicious. A couple of people started packing up their take home containers before everyone was done eating. I think the instructor was overwhelmed with having too many people. I paid $120 for my wife and I to sit for 4 hrs, not really learn much and eat. I could have gone to a restaurant and had a better experience.

The next Saturday I went to the 6 hr smoking and grilling class by myself. It was a little better and the instructor still read from the power point but it was obvious that she had read it before. The same person that attended the steak class that started packing up food before everyone was done eating was at the 6 hr class. She did the same thing at this class. 

If you have any bbq/smoking experience, I would not suggest these classes. If you have never done any of this before, maybe you would benefit from these classes."}
{"text":"Class was informative and fun!  Michael keep our interest while teaching us new skills.  Good time with friends and bonus--you can bring your own drinks and you get to eat what you make.  Great group idea for group of friends.  They have several classes to choose from so something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Took this class with my son.  Learned a lot and really enjoyed the instructors etc.  Thinking of actually taking another class that's offered."}
{"text":"Wife heard about the Phoenix BBQ School from a friend at work and glad she did. We did take advantage of a Groupon and additional discount but the BBQ 101 class would have been worth it at full price. An incredible 6 hour class that pretty much showed me I was doing everything wrong :). The instructor, Mark, was very knowledgable and his technician, Ryan did the cooking. They show all kinds of techniques on cooking on a charcoal grill, gas grill and smoker. We cooked pork, beef, chicken, vegetables, peach cobbler, etc. This is a six hour class so get comfortable and prepare yourself for a lot of information and eating. Great class and worth the time."}
{"text":"Our Daughter in law bought a 6 hour Grilling class for my husband for Christmas. He wanted me to go along so bought another for me. I was reluctant to go and ended up having the best time. We cooked: pork shoulder, brisket, fajitas, pork ribs, chicken, pork loin, potatoes and carrots, stuffed cabbage, made BBQ sauce, they had Mac and cheese, rice, pico de gallo, guacamole, tortillas. You help prepare and then you eat and then prepare more and eat again. There was so much food we filled ourselves then filled our containers and had a big Sunday dinner. While you work Mark gives a terrific power point presentation. His website has so many recipes for you to use. It's close to being over for the summer so hurry to sign up. Bring your wine/beer make new friends and eat, eat, eat."}
{"text":"Recently I took the 201 class. The Day was spent learning about smoking various meats. Full of hands on instructions, we learned the essence of smoking Ribs (three different ways). Made BBQ sauce from scratch. Smoked a leg of lamb, meatloaf and made cake (yes all in a smoker). The Armadillo eggs were just fabulous. The trip tip with the grilled veggie were just succulent. 

The only thing is I could not which was the best part, learning this stuff or enjoying the food with the class mates.

Way to go!"}
{"text":"This class was amazing. The staff are so kind, hilarious and professiona.  The class itself was put together perfectly! We learned so many new techniques and will totally be signing up to take more classes."}
{"text":"I attended the 6 hour BBQ and Smoker class and had a great time.  The class was informative, the food was delicious and overall had a great time...Treavis and Jon were great.   The class moves along at a good pace, but not too fast. I can't wait to go to the steak class next.  After the class, they give you an opportunity to shop In their store from some of the equipment used in the class.  I took time to search online for pricing and found their pricing to be identical with the lowest prices I found online.  Can't wait to put the class to use. 
Tips:  
- Bring whatever beverage you would like to drink (water, tea, soda, beer, etc) ..  
- Eat before going to class (small snack) as the first tasting is 4 hours into the class.. 
- Be prepared to do a lot of tasting, first snack time, then the 2nd tasting is about an hour later.
- A note pad can be helpful to write down recipes, and tips
- Plan on doing at least a little shopping as there are some inexpensive items that can be helpful. 
- Be prepared to ask questions.  The class is 100% interactive and the knowledge the staff can provide is a bonus. 
- Have fun!

** The class is not for vegetarians, Meat, Meat, and more Meat!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to think coming in but it was highly recommended by a co worker and we were not disappointed!  It's been a blast, we learned a ton, and Lynda and Mark are awesome!!!!!  We will definitely be back for additional classes!"}
{"text":"I was dubious when I received a gift to a Smoking 101 class. I have been cooking and grilling for most of my adult life. I was sold within the first 10 minutes! Linda is an excellent instructor! I have since taken 2 other classes and have been entertained, educated and inspired by each!   If you like to Barbecue (smoke) and grill you need to take their classes. You'll be happy you made the effort and will see why people come from all over Arizona to take their classes."}
{"text":"Excellent class taught by kind experts who know what they're doing and are great at explaining and guiding us through the craft of grilling.  If you take this course, you will learn about the science that goes into grilling, as well as some great recipes and hints and tips to create a lot of tasty food for the rest of your life!
Some advice:  if you're taking the class, bring a bottle of your favorite wine or a few of your favorite beers to enjoy with the massive amounts of bbq you will be consuming throughout the class.  Also, bring a lot of to-go containers to pack up the leftovers."}
{"text":"I'd give the class near Seattle a 4 star rating, but since we had Stu come to our house for a personal class with four friends, I'm giving the school a 5 star review. We had the home class first and used our own cooking equipment. Stu brought the rest. There was so damn much food we could have fed an army. Great interaction between the teacher and students, but most of all, it was a good environment for learning, with the bonus as it turned out to be a party.

I liked the class at Tukwilla (Seattle) very much. Pretty much the same course, but more students. The class is in a tilt up warehouse and pretty crude, but plenty of room for working, preparing and cleaning equipment. Some reviews are critical of the PowerPoint, but I appreciated it since it covers more details than one would usually remember for a class like this. I have the PowerPoint and recipes for reference now and really appreciate that.

The instructor was excellent and provided lots of hands on experience for all of the attendees. He did drink a beer during the class which I thought was odd, but it actually played well with the students since most of them brought beverages of all sorts. I do recommend brining a small cooler with your favorite beverage. One student was drunk and left early thank goodness.

If your not the best person with a smoker or BBQ, I'd recommend this class. Don't expect exact recipes however since the whole tone of this course is to teach you how to cook by taste and temperature and not time or specific amount of ingredients as one would expect in a baking class."}
{"text":"I took this class in San Francisco on Treasure Island. It was a great class! Learned everything from making bbq sauce, cooking temperatures, smoking meat, steaming then bbqing, injecting/seasoning, preparing meat, special cuts you can make with different pieces of meat. He packs a lot into this 6 hour class. You don't actually get to stand over the grill and bbq, well very little, but you get all the basics and more. We learned about Trager, propane grills, smokers, infra red cooking and we tasted the difference in the food we prepared on each one. We cooked veggies, fruit, ribs, chicken, brisket, pork loin, pulled pork, I couldn't even eat the last batch we cooked because I was stuffed! Highly recommend this class. Someone wrote about cleaning with dirty sponges and dirty water, this was NOT true the day I took the class. It was very clean and very educational about bacteria, raw meat, etc.
Cant wait to take the steak class!"}
{"text":"We did the 6-hour BBQ class on a Sunday and it was really fun. You get a crash course in grilling and cooking with smokers. I never realized how much work goes into making great BBQ. The instructors are really entertaining and the food was delicious. Make sure to bring your own water and alcohol. People rolled in with a cooler and we forgot to bring anything but water. Luckily our table mates were kind enough to share their multiple bottles of wine."}
{"text":"The Phoenix class was informative and I left with a full tummy!  My husband and I had a great time!  Worth the money!"}
{"text":"lots of fun; learned a lot; and ate lots of bbq. I ready to go out and buy a smokers."}
{"text":"Did the 6 hr intro course. Was actually both enjoyable and fun. Learned a lot about grilling and had some amazing bbq in the process. Will be taking another course. Byob which is a plus."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  Instructor and son were full of great tips and gave us great hands on experience preparing and cooking a brisket, 3 racks of ribs, 2 chickens, wings, pork loin, and some great vegetables like squash, stuffed peppers, and cinnamon apples.  Can't wait for the steak class!"}
{"text":"I recently attended the 6hr class here April 2015. What I envisioned before attending was that we would be BBQing most of the time but the class is structured differently. There were 27 people in the class and we were divided into 4 tables. There is one employee that does the BBQing and you can ask him questions on style or any of the smokers or BBQ's. Another employee runs the class. There is a PowerPoint that is gone over throughout the day with tips and useful information. The hands on portion is preparing pork, beef and vegetables with injections and rubs your team makes.    

The class was good for me since I had never injected or used rubs before. There are some good tips that are covered and you get to see how some really cool smokers are used along with tasting numerous meets which helps to offset the cost of the class.
I bought this class for a friend and I to attend through Groupon and others had bought through AAA. Someone at my table had attended the Steak class and he sounded disappointed that there was not hands on BBQ experience. 

To summarize, if you or the person you are buying this for are an experienced smoker, I do not recommend this basic course, they did talk about an advanced course that might be more enjoyable. If you are like me and had no experience with injecting or rubs, there is hands on preparation where you will get (jump in don't be shy) a chance to do both a number of times. If you do go, I highly recommend being involved and not sit back to watch others prep the food and encourage others to do the same in order to create a team environment. 

Suggestion for improvement: In my opinion the class would have been better if the teams alternated cooking throughout the day with the employee that was cooking has the role of adviser. My two cents."}
{"text":"What can I say but WOW! I like to cook and know my way around a kitchen but have always been intimidated by grilling and smoking meats. Well-no more!!!! This class is a must and pretty comprehensive! For 6 hrs we learned the full concepts to a successful grilled or smoked meal. We tested in several meats. Linda is a master and really knows her stuff. Highly highly recommend!!!! Best of all we ATE all our yummy class work!!! Can't wait for the next one!"}
{"text":"Loved the class and plan to come back for the 201 Smoking class. Learned a ton, had a great time, and enjoyed some good food!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a fantastic Smoking (201) class!! Cooked so much food and learned alot.  Stu is awesome! Smoked meats galore! Watermelon salad!! Meatloaf wrapped in bacon is great tasting. The Chicken Lollipops were a great treat as well.  The Armadillo (Possum with a hardtop ) Eggs jalapenos with cream cheese wrapped in sausage wrapped in bacon were the bomb. All the material is provided from the class.  Can't wait to go to Tailgate class...BACON CITY!!"}
{"text":"Last Christmas, my wife bought me a smoker, then for V-day, she bought me Smoking 101 class for 2 at the Phoenix BBQ & Grilling School!   Her idea was that I would take a buddy with me to this BYOB school, but I think my bros were as skeptical as I was at first.  Upon receiving a couple of respectful declinations from them, I decided to nudge she-who-had-paid for the class to accompany.  Even she was hesitant at first!   

Buuuuutttt thankfully I had more sway with her than I did with my friends, so we went together a couple of weeks ago and took a little of our own beer and wine with us (this is allowed and you can consume openly while there).  

And boy were we blown away.   We learned some great tricks on smoking brisket, pork, chicken and a variety of styles of ribs.  We also learned the basics on several different types of smokers. Further, in cooperation with our classmates, we created some tasty side dishes, learned an amazing bbq sauce recipe and some great rub recipes.   

The grand finale, DUH!, was when we got to take everything we had learned how to create off of the multiple smokers in use at the facility, prepare and devour it all (with lots of leftovers to take home)!   My bros REALLY missed out but, frankly, I was glad that my wife and I did it together.  It turned out to be something that will bring us closer together in the kitchen and enable us to work hand in hand to create meals we'll both enjoy in the future.   

Our instructor was amazing, as were all of the grill techs who were assisting us and ensuring we didn't screw up anything on the smokers.  They also provide access to a web portal containing all of the recipes we learned so that we could reference them on our own afterwards.

Can't recommend the Phoenix BBQ & Grilling School enough.  Well worth it from a learning standpoint, great fun, and a great experience for my wife and I to have had together!"}
{"text":"Bought a living social deal for the school for my Dad and I.  You will learn a lot of great tips and tricks; great place to learn the basics.  The instructors were helpful and would definitely recommend the school for folks to try out."}
{"text":"This was a Father's day gift from my family. I had a great time and met a lot of nice people. Mark did an excellent job of answering all of the questions fully. My only regret was bringing only one beer. The pit master, his name eludes me, was also very professional and helpful. Going to schedule the 201 class as soon as my time permits. The tailgater class seems fun too."}
{"text":"My husband and I got our introductory class on Groupon and we're not sure what to expect.  We were so glad we went! It was so informative and Lynda made it an awesome class! We loved it! We are for sure going to more advanced classes!!"}
{"text":"Awesome class with passionate instructors and classmates! Learned a lot and had a great time. Just remember to bring a couple extra beers and cash to tip Travis!"}
{"text":"What a fun time!!  I attended the 6 hour Smoking and Grilling class this past weekend.  There were about 22 folks that attended.  The instruction was good and there were lots of food.  Good introduction to lots of different smokers and grills.  The school actually offers lots of the equipment for sale and after checking prices on the web their prices appeared to be better than can find on the open market.

The class started at 10AM and had a snack at about 2PM and lunch at about 3:30PM.  So by the time 2PM came around everyone was very hungry....especially after doing all the food prep and the anticipation of a great meal.

A couple of suggestions....when I went I missed the part about bringing your own drink.  Six hours of class and eating with nothing available was not as enjoyable as being able to crack open a cold adult beverage.  Most of the actual grilling was done by an employee and a limited amount of grilling was done by a few students.  It would have been nice to get more hands on the grills.  In addition, the store was very inefficient on getting checked out and took way too much time.  A better POS system is needed.

I did end up buying a bunch of stuff in the store.  With the decent prices I like to support a local business.

If you have a chance to attend - I highly recommend this program.  They also have a steak class and a sea food class (I signed up for that one next month!)"}
{"text":"We attended the 6 hour class under instructor Mark and there was a lot of information presented just far too much non-BBQ stories. He spent most of the class talking about stories of his life and not how it relates to BBQ. I also expected to have far more hands on cooking and we only had 2 times where we prepared things and never touched the grills or cooked on them. The BBQ tech did all of that. We didn't make any BBQ sauce and just one was made with a big jar of BBQ sauce from the store. 

We got to eat some BBQ that was cooked the night before but we didn't get to cook brisket because it was frozen. There was one brisket cooked from the night before and we were going to taste the burnt ends but the tech dropped them on the ground. 

It is not worth the money spent and I'd recommend doing something online if you are trying to learn to BBQ. There is a ton of Free stuff online to learn from."}
{"text":"We attended the 9/27/15 \"basic\" 6 hour BBQ class - Nothing like we expected - better, fuller, funnier.  We were totally hands on for 6 hours - couldn't eat another bite (and we tried!).  Please don't forget to bring lots of beverages (for yourself, your group and, if you are bringing \"adult\" beverages - plenty for Stu).   At first we thought the class was a bit large, but you really do need everyone's help.  If the classes were available in Southern California, I'd be planning group events.  Unfortunately, they are not offered here - yet???
Take the class - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tony and Mark were fabulous hosts and instructors for us!  My party of 3 thoroughly enjoyed the day, learning to smoke a variety of meats and vegetables.  We learned grilling techniques that will become very valuable to me as I learn to cook more with my first smoker.  The class drew a large following of students and was quite interactive, especially with Mark's frequent humorous accompaniments.  All in all, this was a great first step in becoming a much better backyard griller."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for the BBQ basics course - the 6 hour one where we learn how to do basic grilling and smoking. My husband and I had a great time learning lots of information...the importance of using a binder before putting on a rub, making sure we inject our meat before putting it on the grill, and most importantly, that grilling is a concept, not a science! Lynda was our teacher and Brandon was the griller. We ended up learning a lot more about smoking that I was expecting, especially considering that only 3 people in the whole class even had a smoker. It would have been more beneficial to learn about every day things that people grill, since most people don't smoke a brisket very often. That should have been more of a specialty class. What about the burgers and brats, haha! But the class was incredibly interactive; I really enjoyed the hands on time in which we got to prepare the meat and see it on the grill. It would have been nice to have the \"snack\" earlier in the day, say after 2.5 hours or so, because 4 hours was a long time to wait before eating. I am excited to put to use the skills I learned in this class!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many different BBQ schools, and this is one of the best.  I learned some great tricks and tips, plus many many recipes.  Stu is very knowledgeable and has a great manner.  Looking forward to the next one . . ."}
{"text":"My father and I recently attended the smoking class. I learned a lot about cooking and handling meat, not just smoking.  You really get \"hands on\" in this class and learn plenty of skills. It's given me a lot of confidence and motivation to cook more. I definitely recommend it. It's fun and you learn a lot."}
{"text":"Had so much fun during the 6 hour smoking and grill class. My fiancé and I made it a date day, brought some drinks and met new people. It was nice to be more hands on then some of the other cooking classes that just show you what to do. The 6 hours flew by and we were stuffed with good BBQ! I learned a lot since I don't really grill and my fiancé learned some new things as well like how to cut down ribs and tips and tricks while smoking. Thanks for a great time!"}
{"text":"Stu is the man, and his whole staff is awesome. Just completed the holiday smoking class. Excellent as always would recommend it highly to anyone wanting to broaden your BBQ knowledge. This is the third class we have gone to and we learn something new each time. Great time great people excellent student interaction we saw many repeat students from previous classes.  Can't wait for the tailgating class next. Thank you Stu."}
{"text":"If you currently BBQ or are just starting out, this is the school for you!! You will learn about cuts of meat, prep and grilling/smoking. A lot of hands on work in the class to include eating what you prepare. Have a good breakfast but then plan on eating there the rest of the day. We all walked away stuffed. Well worth the cost of the class!!!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for my husband and son for the SF class on Treasure Island.  Both were like ok.....When they returned they wouldn't stop telling me about how much fun it was, so much meat and learned so many new techniques.  

My husband brought out all the food that they took home and we were eating it, (husband and son) were too full to have anything.  

My son learned how to make bbq sauce correctly and was so excited for me to taste, it was delicious.....it's his new job.  

Husbands meat before use to be dry and tuff, now it is moist and taste AMAZING!!!!!

100 percent recommend this for anyone and a great gift opportunity........."}
{"text":"+If your new to food 'smoking' or want to know about it to decide if its for you, this is the place to go!  Lots of INFO!!!!   
+I am more of a Grill guy, but learned some tips that apply. 
+Do make sure you bring drinks as they do not provide or have any available for purchase.  
+Also, make SURE to eat a little something before you go as the first food you get is 4 hours into the class (which makes sense since YOU do the cooking). 
+The products and prices on what they sell in the store are good (and they make sure you know it at the beginning of the class!)

-You do spend time cleaning up a lot, and like any group, some do not do their share! Might be a good idea to 'assign' each table a cleaning task, just like they assign each table cooking tasks!!
-Don't expect a fancy place, just a space in an industrial plaza and I guess that works as they do create a lot of smoke outside!!!"}
{"text":"Have taken the 101 and 201 bbq and smoking class. If you want to learn about bbqing and smoking this is the place to go. You also get to eat what you cook."}
{"text":"The BBQ school I attended in Phx had it's moments but not enough to overcome the presentation and poor communication.  If you are new to BBQ and smoking then perhaps the class will be of benefit.  I was scheduled for a class which was cancelled but never communicated to me.  I took the afternoon off from work - drove 45 minutes to the school only to find out it was cancelled.  When I did attend the school it wasn't as professional as I would like for the price. Very mom and pop.  The food was good not great.  The lesson on BBQ sauce was to buy some cheap sauce from costco and add some more spices.  It was a terrible sauce.  It seemed like they were trying to cut corners financially.  Personally, I would save the money - buy yourself some good pieces of meat and watch smoking lessons on Youtube."}
{"text":"Me and the wife did the may 14th class (which was last day of season until it gets cooler), we absolutely loved it. Very informative and GREAT food. We will do more classes and possibly buy a smoker. Definitely do it."}
{"text":"Took my staff of 10 for team get together. We had a great time. It was fun, time fly by fast. Wish there was more time. They all want to come back and do another class."}
{"text":"This place is a blast!  I went there with my husband last weekend and we had such a great time.  We learned a lot and everything was great.  I am from the south and I know my BBQ, this is definitely the real stuff :).  I can't wait till they have their own public restaurant!

I recommend you bring these items with you:
Wine or beer
Water to drink (they have some there if you forget it)
To go containers (lots of left overs)
A big appetite
Pen/paper to take notes
Sunglasses for when you are outside looking at the meat"}
{"text":"Received a 6 hour grilling class at Phoenix BBQ and Grilling School as a Christmas gift last year but due to several scheduling conflicts was not able to attend until this past week.  I did not know what to expect and was a little apprehensive when I arrived at their location but any concerns were quickly put to rest.  Lynda, the class instructor was very knowledgable and delivered her presentation in a humorous but informative manner.  The grill master Mark and his assistant Dan provided many tips on the benefits of different makes of grills and smokers.  There were about 20 participants in the class and everyone was actively involved in the prep and clean-up.  The food was absolutely delicious, BBQ like you never experienced at home unless of course you attended one of these classes.  If you like to grill and want to impress your family and friends I definitely recommend attending one or more of these courses."}
{"text":"I learned a lot and had tons of fun. The  instructor was thorough and the food was amazing.  The spices and rubs were southwest spicy and left you wanting seconds and thirds. The sauces were delightful. I mever knew I could make $5 BBQ sauce taste like a million $$. This class was well worth the money and time."}
