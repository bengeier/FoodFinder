{"text":"The decor isn't the greatest but the food is great; spicy and flavourful. Great naan. I've tried several Indian restaurants in this neighbourhood and this one is my favourite by far."}
{"text":"At first, I was skeptical about ordering take-out at Bar-Be-Que Hut again, since I had a mediocre experience about a year ago.  But I decided to give it another try, and the best part is, that the food is better than I remember. Also , the staff were polite, and the chefs really take pride their food. The chefs admit that they maintain their good quality by following recipes that are passed down though 40 years of tradition.  I ordered the Chicken Korma, Matter Paneer, and the rice pilau. The rice was cooked perfectly, beautiful texture and hints of saffron. The chicken Korma was nice and creamy, with a kick. The chicken in it was very tender, and spiced. The Matter Paneer was fantastic. The paneer cubes had an amazing, chewy consistency.  I will definitely be coming back with friends and family! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time I went, awesome, second time I went, disgusting.  This place is straight out of 1970's Bombay.  The 'waiter' who seemed fixated on my wife and I and not in a good way made us feel uncomfortable.  He was a disgusting specimen with chest hair protruding from his vintage 70's gear.  We still decided on a few items, some fish and beef dishes and a kingfisher beer.  Well what went wrong? The beer was expired by about 4 months, the beef was incredibly tough, even the fat??? and Mr. 70's was was leering like a pedophile in a van stocked with candy.  he was very rude to my wife, possibly a problem with black people? but super nice to me.  Number one rule is treat my wife with respect and please trim the jungle it's falling in the vindaloo.  Never again..."}
{"text":"Had no clue where to get indian take out nearby so I dropped by Yelp and found some decent reviews for Bar Be Que Hut.  Placed my order and the  food was ready for pick up in 20 minutes.  Nobody was eating at the restaurant at 730pm on a Saturday night, but take out business seemed brisk.    My impression was that the 3 older gentlemen working in the kitchen seemed to really care for their food... hard to explain, but if you drop in you might know what I mean.  Didn't seem like the typical kitchen staff.    I liked their naan bread, butter chicken (sauce goes well with the naan), and aloo gobi.    The onion bhaji (deep fried friiter with onion and chick pea flour batter) was tasty although not that visually appealing.  It comes with 2 mystery sauces - mystery b/c I have no clue what they are - one is dark, clear, and fairly flavourless while the other is green, thick, and intensely SPICY.  You definitely don't want to smother that green sauce over your food.    Chicken tikka masala was nice, although the chicken morsels were a bit more dry and the sauce had a nice spicy zip to it.    This was all $45 tax in.  I find that getting indian take out is still fairly pricey and portions small... unlike chinese take out where for the same price, you are guaranteed enough leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.    Would consider getting takeout again however might want to try some other places first, before ordering again from here."}
{"text":"This was my first stop when I moved to the neighbourhood (two days ago!) because it's at the end of my street and we needed food. I was happy, but not, like, over the moon happy.   Earlier yelpers told me that take out was a better option than eating in, so that's what we did (though the decor was nicer than I anticipated - less cafeteria and more aging dining room). I perused the website menus and called my order in, which was easy peasy - no disparities between the two. My order was ready a few minutes before they said it would be and the gentlemen who greeted me when I arrived to pick it up were friendly and efficient. I paid with debit - no hassle there. And took home my giant bag of food.   The food was good. We had a curry chicken, aloo gobhi, veggie kofta (which was amazeballs!), eggplant something or other, daal, and lamb kebabs (from the tandoor!), as well as naan and rice. Everything was tasty, not greasy at all, and not very spicy (which was disappointing for me but relieving for my dining companions). The whole shebang (which fed five people with no leftovers) cost $67, which feels a bit pricey to me. If it was $55 this would be a 4 star review.   I'll go back, certainly, and I look forward to trying more tandoori food stuffs when I do (the lamb we had this time was great!). But not before I try the other dozen or so Indian restaurants within five minutes walk of my house."}
{"text":"Really, Really, Really dry Pakora left me less than un-impressed.   disappointing. I May give them another shot, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went to this place, after a family friend raved about how good it was. The inside is kind of old and dark looking. Nothing fancy.   I ordered a chicken dish (can't remember which one), daal and garlic naan. The chicken dish was just alright. I remember there being some questionable chicken pieces in there which we left untouched. The daal was ok, but not creamy. It was more like home-style. The garlic naan came out with no garlic on it. We told our waiter and he said he would get us some fresh garlic naan. 2 minutes later we get our naan, which looks like he just threw some garlic spices on it. This was not what I was expecting.   Overall, the food was fine. However I would not go back here. There are better places to go to in the area."}
{"text":"While the look of the place might not be the most reassuring (it seems a little neglected), you can be sure that all their energy is spent on creating the most delicious and flavourful Indian dishes you've ever eaten.  If you live in the neighbourhood, order delivery and meet the owner on your doorstep!  The Paneer Butter Masala is a favourite, as is the Chicken Jalfrezy."}
{"text":"Lost a star for dark, grungy decor.  Use your bathroom before you leave home.  I had the vegetarian thali.  It was pretty small, but good sample sizes.  The dal and aloo gobi was equal to the best I've tasted, and I'll be back for full orders.  I wasn't crazy about the saag paneer...it had almost a smoky flavour.  Raita and naan were good.  I had a mango lassi that was very fresh, and the friendly chef/server (this was noon on a Thursday, and I was the only customer), brought me the remains of the lassi from the milkshake container when I was finished.  A nice touch.  Thali, naan, lassi and taxes were under 12 bucks.  I think perhaps take-out or delivery is in my future."}
{"text":"The food is now terrible. They went under renovation and just messed up the food...Korma as no Cashew taste. The Vindaloo had uncooked potatoes and left us with an after taste of garlic powder and MSG...Big order, small satisfaction."}
{"text":"Agreed on all points for the food. Their meats are superb! I'd give it 5 stars but the fact that the decor feels like you're in a Mike Leigh film and the price points are a little higher.   Try it out at the Taste of India festival this year!"}
{"text":"I had fond memories of this place as a teenager. perhaps my palette is more refined than it used to be, but i'm none with bar-be-que hut.  the curries don't have a ton of flavor, the texure is off, and the place is looking pretty dingy. to top it off, a cockroach scurried along the wall next to us while we were eating lunch.  sorry bbq hut, i'm moving on."}
{"text":"I went to Bar Be Que Hut last weekend with some friends and had a great experience.    The decor is nothing to write home about but if you care more about decor and less about food, this is not your type of Saturday night date restaurant.    Now, if you want a culinary experience, that is authentic, Bar Be Que Hut is worth the drive to little India.  Between the four of us we had seven dishes, two lamb (chops and madras), two chicken (tika masala vindaloo), two veg and then the guys ordered a third chicken dish.  The lamb chops were well seasoned and tasty.  Aloo gobi, you can't go wrong.   The chicken dishes were all very flavourful.  My only complaint is that some of the dishes were not temperature hot.   Reasonably priced.  Would absolutely go back to Bar Be Que Hut for dinner. As we were leaving, the place was getting packed for the nightly entertainment!"}
{"text":"This is not a place you go to for decor or style. It's not a place to see or be seen at.   It is however one of the best tandoors this side of the ocean.  I went here last Monday after reading reviews from Yelp being so high and me living at the corner of Coxwell and Gerrard for the past 2.5 years, thought what the hey let's eat some tandoori!  I ordered the 'Chef recommended tandoori special' Figuring this was a meal for one I felt $15 a little steep. I took my meal to go.  Upon unwrapping it I realized I had a decent meal for 2 or a cheap meal for 3. It contains as follows; 1 Tandoori chicken leg 1 Sikh kebab 3 pieces of chicken? It was kind of yellow and Smokey and awesome 1 tub of curried beef of some sort 1 giant naan A large helping of rice pilaf  It was all amazing, cooked to perfection and super fresh  I can only imagine they have a great family meal combo.  I really like the smoky yellow-orange chicken things and I must find out what they were to order more next time."}
{"text":"Best Naan on Gerrard. Good tandoori chicken, and the curries are good too. But you're here for the tandoor right? Right. You smelled it when you walked in didn't you. And you saw it when you ordered. Now you're stoked on smoke and can't wait for your cooked to order Naans."}
{"text":"This was a great place with great food. Unfortunately, time to take it off Yelp as it closed down a couple of years ago and the restaurant that replaced it is now for sale as well. Great memories. Will be missed."}
{"text":"A great place for Indian take-out/delivery.  If you are expecting a timely delivery, however, this is not the place for that.  Expect to wait about an hour for your food to arrive at your doorstep. But it is certainly worth the wait.   My favorite dishes include Aloo Gobhi, Vegetable Shahi Korma, the Tandoori Dinner, and of course, Butter Chicken!"}
