{"text":"There are some dishes that are just terrible, like the \"water-boiled beef\" that looks and tastes nothing like the real thing. However, the good dishes are consistently good. Stick with the popular dishes and you will always have a decent meal here."}
{"text":"It's the second time I was brought to this restaurant. I wasn't too excited about it the first time but it's good this time. Huge portions, rather delicious Chinese dumplings. They did not carry the best soup and meat but the thickness of the dumpling skins was just right. This place has been expanding and expanding and yet it's always packed. This is one of those Chinese places where they give you free sweet soup after dinner."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. My friend and I have been waiting for our food over 30 mins and I have asked the servants twice to check our food but still no response. Will never come again and advice all my friend not come to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Weekend is always packed, make a rese is really helpful. One of their waitress, I think her name is Grace, always very patient and courteous, which makes me wanna come back."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely terrible. I do not recommend this place at all. Asian legend has always been a favourite place for my family but this location is the worst."}
{"text":"Quite authentic northern Chinese food with hygiene environment made it one of my favorite spot, sliced beef pancake is a must have."}
{"text":"Came here last night with the husband and had a very positive experience. It was our wedding anniversary and we wanted to recreate a fabulous dim sum meal we had in Hong Kong during our honeymoon. Needless to say it didn't live up to that epic feast but it was absolutely delicious.

We had their specialty soup-filled pork dumpings, pan fried pork dumplings, onion pancake roll with beef, wontons in spicy peanut sauce, and green beans with dried shrimp. The pancake roll was so yummy and even better when dipped in a bit of vinegar to cut the fat. The true star however was the wontons in spicy peanut sauce, I've never had anything like it (waiter said it's another specialty of theirs), the sauce was spicy creamy and nutty and the wontons had a deliciously tender skin and yummy pork filling.

Everything was delivered in a very timely fashion - in fact I would stagger our order more next time so that we have more time between dishes. However it was all hot, with the desired accompaniments (some vinegar, chili oil etc.) and some ice cold Tsingtao to wash it all down. 

Worth noting near the end of our meal there was a lady yelling for the manager at the back of the room. She was relentless and tried to force her way into the back of the kitchen but the staff dealt with the situation very professionally. Our waiter apologized to us for the disruption rather than ignoring it which I appreciated. 

Total cost was around $70 for quite a lot of food (and a doggy bag), it's also much cleaner than most Chinatown restaurants. 

We will return!"}
{"text":"Asian Legend has become a go-to restaurant for my family. We've been coming here for well over 10 years and I am happy to say that the quality of food has not gone down. It is impressive how consistent it has been, especially across all the restaurant locations.

Family favourites:
- Soup Filled Dumplings ($5.99): ah XLB... while I wouldn't say it's the best that you can get in the city, it is way above average
- Steamed Chicken Dumplings ($5.99): juicy and plump
- Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef ($5.99): portions have been shrinking over the years, but it's a great way to have your sliced beef and green onion pancake all at once
- Deep Fried Tofu with Garlic Sauce ($3.99): actually ordered this by accident once, but what a great mistake. It has a good combination of saltiness, crunchiness and sharpness that comes from the garlic. 
- Peking Duck ($39.99): not my #1 spot for peking duck, but it's pretty good and the duck is leaner than other places if you're health conscious 
- Braised Beef Noodle Soup ($9.95): I have yet to find a place in Toronto that does this better than Asian Legend. The price has been going up on this dish and portions have been shrinking... but it still tastes good after all these years. 
- Cold Noodles with Shredded Chicken & Spicy Peanut Sauce ($6.99): the noodles are a little chewy which makes it great. Make sure you mix it all up before eating it and it does have quite a bit of garlic, so I wouldn't probably order it if you're dining for lunch on a weekday. 
- Fried Rice Cakes with Pork & Pickled Vegetables ($10.99): rice cakes are properly prepared, they aren't soggy or overly hard to chew. Note, rice cakes in general are hard to reheat as they stick together and become quite hard - try to finish this dish and not take it home. 

I would stay away from the Westernized dishes (e.g. beef w/ broccoli, sweat & sour pork, etc.) as I haven't found them to be any good. Desserts are average. 

The service here is a bit chaotic, but you will never have an empty teapot. There's a dedicated person that just walks around every 5 min or so to check if you need more hot water (props to that guy). 

I have been to the original Din Tai Fung in Taipei and other locations in Shanghai, Hong Kong and LA. While Asian Legend isn't at that level (yet), I'm still quite satisfied with the food that comes out here."}
{"text":"Modern, Western(?)-looking Chinese restaurant with dish prices in the teens. Overpriced considering the area.  Service was OK. The usual efficient, not attentive Chinese restaurant service.  Ate the house special noodles, which were stir fried with calamari, small pieces of bbq pork, veggies, and a slightly sweet brown sauce.  Cooked well but the taste was nothing special.  The braised beef with bok choy, on the other hand, was a different story.  Tender beef chunks,  dressed in a dark five-spice/ginger/soy gravy,  had more meat than tendon/gristle--which is what we prefer.   Very flavorful. 

 Would've given this place two stars; beef pushed up the rating."}
{"text":"I was looking so forward to having great northern Chinese food based on the reviews, but I was very disappointed. I am too from Vancouver, and I am now still looking for good northern food. We ordered two soups, one was had too much salt and the second was tasteless, -  no spice no sour, hot and sour soup. We also ordered Kung PO chicken which was cooked, well but again very salty and not spicy at all even with all the chili peppers.( I suspect a heavy hand of MSG). The red bean cake dessert which can be a favorite of mine was not a pancake but deep fried. The red bean flavor was good ,but did not make of up for the deep fried batter thing surrounding. It is sad to say I am still looking for clean northern style Chinese food in Toronto."}
{"text":"A few years ago, I went to Shanghai, China and was introduced to some Shanghai dumplings (yes, being a \"banana\" means I don't really know everything about my culture including all the foods).  You have not eaten proper steamed dumplings until you've been to Shanghai.  Upon returning I went on a quest for these dumplings in my home city and with the help from my relatives, I was rewarded here at Asian Legend.  I'm embarrassed to say so but they've been around since 1988 and I've never been? They have expanded to half a dozen locations in the GTA and their food is consistent.  This is one of the nicer/cleaner Chinese restaurants in the downtown that won't break the bank (compared to the Crown Princess which I reviewed recently). 

For Shanghai dumplings, hands down, the closest you will find to the real deal but if you want the authentic one's to compare you'll need to get your passport validated and make your way to China.  The secret to good dumplings is thin layer of dough holding the soup inside.  That requires special cooking skills as it will likely break during the steaming process unless you make it thick skin (which tastes like too much dough and is what you will typically find at other restaurants here).  The only issue is they rather small and cost almost $6 a basket... I can eat these by the truck load.

In China, they have these dumpling kiosks everywhere like we have Tim Hortons and they're only 8 RMB for 8 pieces (that's about $1 CAD).  Other dishes you should try is the beef brisket noodles in soup and general tao chicken (fried and crispy but yummy).  Their other rice, noodle dishes are reasonably priced, decent portions and average quality or better.  4 stars if you order the right items and they do take out plus delivery :)   I usually go with family or friends as I hate dining alone but the place doesn't hold large groups but there are rooms in the dungeon downstairs for small groups.  Avoid during lunch or dinner rush cos you'll be in a line up."}
{"text":"Love the food here, service was big slow, but turn out nice with a bunch of us had a big table downstairs. a great place for having a birthday dinner with private room. I will go back for sure"}
{"text":"Thought of ordering something simple chicken dish, ended up with a fatty skin-on cold spicy yet flavourless chicken dish. Got three dishes, all bad. Avoid at any cost!"}
{"text":"I go here at least once a month so I'm not new to this restaurant. I love thier steamed pork soup dumplings, they're always made fresh and come out steaming hot so watch out, or they'll burn your lips!! They're always so juicy and flavourful! I love this restaurant! Good food and quick service! They even have a see through screen that shows people making the dumplings fresh. I also love their chunky beef noodles!! It's soo tasty!!
LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Asian Legend is one of my go to places for northern Chinese food.  Although it's a chain, the food and service are pretty consistent across the board.  It's kind of like The Keg except for Asian food - you look forward to your meal before heading to the restaurant and you leave a satisfied customer.  I always get the siu long bao, dang dang noodles, and green onion cakes, but the menu has a great selection and you won't be disappointed with your order."}
{"text":"Great food ! I like the dumping and  steam bun ! Service was ok! Will bring my family to try the p duck !"}
{"text":"Asian Legend is one of my favourite restaurants in Chinatown. It has a great assortment of great menu items that are authentic and not greasy. It's one of the reasons that this restaurant is one of my favourites. 

The location is great, it's a hop and a skip to the AGO. 

The place is clean AND had a large dining space on the lower level. 

**Go for a bite before you go to the AGO & try the steamed vegetable dumplings! mmmm**"}
{"text":"The food is about average but what's annoying is that the waiters are so lazy and arrogant towards guests. As we entered the restaurant, a idle waiter ran inside and chat with his fellows rather than leading us to seat down. We waited, and when there were more people coming in, another waitress  finally led us in. 

However, their laziness can be seen on the way they take orders. As guests, you have to write down what you need by yourself while the waiters were continue chatting and laughing behind you, loudly.
The food itself was okay, but a restaurant should be ranked by its services and attitudes toward guests also."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some dumplings, actually I had a craving so I came here for the first time.  Nice ambiance and a fairly large venue, plenty of parking as it is part of a plaza. We were seated right away and had hot tea within seconds.  We ordered pork dumplings in soup, beef and vegetable meal, wonton soup, vsteamed vegetables and seafood basket.  I found the food delicious.  Not salted at all as you would find in other places.  It tasted fresh and flayvorfull.  Overall we both enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Food is extremely sad. Lacks life and zest as Chinese food should have (called wok hey). It's now commercialized and nowhere near the quality when the owner/founder was the chef. The hired guns aren't good. Hey, but if you're into decor in Chinatown, this is the place to go. If you want quality North Cuisine you're better off a few doors west at Dundas Spring Garden."}
{"text":"I went there late, just before they closed. The service was fine (nothing to rave about, but proper and prompt). I ordered the pan egg/onion appetizer (forgot actual name of dish ) and the rice combo (shrimp and tofu). My two friends ordered a ride combo and noodles respectively. 

The delivery of the dishes to our table was strange. After drinks, or combo plates arrived first, then the soups, then our friend's noodles, and then finally the appetizer. I mean sure, adventure is great, but I was slightly concerned about letting items become cold. But the food was nice and warm; the rice was ok; soup was good (veggie clear soup) ; shrimp was well cooked and mixture with tofu was not too greasy; the appetizer was missing some salt (but that could be a personal preference). 

I may need to try more items before I make my mind up about this place. As of right now, it was alright."}
{"text":"This place is over priced for their food and the food has no quality. Bad service the manager was rude asking us to pay 20% tip the seatings are not enough about lucky not coming back. They wouldn't clean the table very terrible experience"}
{"text":"Soup dumplings! And the green onion pancakes are excellent.

I preferr the a'la cart styles to menu ordering, but the quality was excellent and price fair"}
{"text":"Thursday afternoon. Asian Legend at Don Mills had 2 tables occupied.  We were seated in the corner, filled out our order and waited 20 minutes for someone....anyone...to acknowledge us.  All the while, the wait staff circled around and served the 2 other tables.  

Made eye contact with 2 of the wait staff and neither made a single attempt to walk over to us to take our order.  Or to at the very least, to say that someone would be with us.  

We left.  Never to return again. This was once a good spot but I have zero tolerance for lack of customer service.  Massive fail."}
{"text":"Ok, so. 
Coming back from Hong Kong, I have been missing soup dumplings. Well, we just had some, and there about 90% as good as Hong Kong. Great in my book, since I didn't have to fly 15 hours!  This is our first time here, and will review it fully when I have come a few times. But first impression is very good. Especially when it's a quiet Tuesday night! Going to see if it passes the weekend test, and large party's. For now, I wish them good fortune and hope they keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Good food and good decor sums up this restaurant. We ordered General Tao chicken and steamed rice which was really good. We also had the beef and onion pancakes and they were delicious. The fried rice was well flavoured and was one of the better ones we had. We liked the food so much that we ordered more to go. 

Our server was very friendly and even though the place was very busy, our food came pretty quick. I recommend this restaurant and we will be back again. The next time we come, we will choose a time when the restaurant is less busy."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place for dumplings, it's sad that it's not as busy as the other locations!  Love their Peking duck!  The food quality is great as well as the service! The egg pancake was bland though other than that they have good food. I love it"}
{"text":"The food was great. The yanghzhou rice is awesome. The moushu chicken or pork are some of my favorites. Both times we have been we did take out. Would like to eat there one day, the ambience looked great. We have been waiting for a genuine Chinese restaurant and this place hit the spot for us. 
We have two young kids who also love the food. The general tao chicken is also really good. All in all good addition to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"The quality here is very much lacking compared to other Asian Legends in the GTA. Food temperature was lukewarm for most of the dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"Food?  Fantastic.  Service?  The pits.  Maybe it was because we went on a Saturday evening, however, we were virtually pushed off of our table.  The complimentary dessert was provided to us while we were still making inroads on the mains.  The waiters started clearing our personal dishes before we had stopped eating.  Is taking one hour for 5 people too much to ask at Asian Legend?  Apparently so.  And not one \"sorry\" or otherwise when we grumbled about the service.  I know it's busy but...   

Having said that, the food is quite good especially when compared to many other shanghainese places in Toronto.  The xiao long baos are good (almost as good as the ones at Ding Tai Fung).  The tofu knot soup was also yummy.  The fried chicken was well done, not too dry as in most places.  The only real critique I had was the \"la pi\" (mandarin) or \"lai pai\" (cantonese) - mung bean flat noodles served with cucumber and peanut sauce.  Tasteless and I've had 1000x better in a ratty street stall in China.  But this is Toronto, so I can't really hold it against them too much.  

Would have given this place a 4 star or maybe even a 4.5 star had I felt charitable, but the service just blew the whole thing for me."}
{"text":"I think it's widely acknowledged that downtown Chinatown is no longer the place to go for Toronto's best Chinese food. However, Asian Legend, a Toronto chain, is a pleasant exception to the norm downtown. Skillfully prepared food in a nice clean pleasant environment. I can't count how many visitors to Toronto I've taken to Asian legend and none have been disappointed. Highlights include: the braised eggplant, seafood hot pot, and lemon chicken."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience. This place did not have any of the items on the menu available on a week night. Also, horrible service. I felt belittled and was treated poorly. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The quality northern Chinese cuisine found in this neighborhood is hard to beat. The service is a little lacking but only when it's busy which isn't different from all other busy restaurants anyway. This is becoming one of my go-to Asian food restaurants."}
{"text":"Such a long wait time and they have really poor service. They were very rude and they wouldn't let me pay by visa even tho they advertised they accepts credit cards.
 The steamed pork buns tasted okay but their pan fried green onion pancake was tasteless."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going to Asian Legend for at least 8 years.  A couple of weeks ago was our last.   I don't think it was so bad in the past.  This was our go to restaurant despite the high priced items.  We don't mind paying a little more if the food is good.  We really enjoy their hot and sour soups, steamed chicken dumplings, deep fried tofu and a couple of their main dishes.  The cleanliness of the floor, table and especially the washroom are a big concern for us.   The washroom especially was disgusting!  It left me disturbed.  People have said the cleanliness of the washroom says a lot about a restaurant upkeep.  We are sad not to return to enjoy the food but I keep having flashbacks of the dirty condition of the restaurant.  It gross me out!  Must let go for my health sake.  Our hunt for a good & clean Chinese restaurant starts! Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Sizzling Beef tenderloin was very disappointing.  No sizzle.  Meat was prepared poorly, tough, and dry, not velvety smooth as it should be if tenderized properly.   Sauce was salty and to top it off, overpriced."}
{"text":"Had been there a few times.
Consistent food - the spicy Beef and noodle is good.
the nice thing is their choice of dumplings...
so if you are in the mood for good dumpling and dont feel like lining up at Dai Tai Fung, this is a good alternate. 

Bon Appetite."}
{"text":"Food was consistent with all the other Asian  Legends, I thought.  Like the venue, the space and seating was organized better, once again, I thought.  

(Once I ate at the North York location, and was placed almost  side by side with tables on my left and right.)

We have been here for dinner after a summer Wonderland excursion and it was packed here!  Might help to make reservations?   Have also been here for lunch during winter and it was not busy at all."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. 

Their potstickers \"wor tips\" are the best!  Crispy skin and well-cooked meat on the inside.   Alot of other northern Chinese places leave pink (raw-ish) meat on the inside, but Asian Legend I believe does it more safe, making it cooked throughout.

Only issue with this location is their limited paid parking lot.  It costs $5 to park in their lot, they refund about $2."}
{"text":"I come here for one thing and one thing only. Ok I'm kidding I get other stuff too. But the main attraction for me is the soup dumplings. 2 orders of each for me. The rest of the menu is pretty standard. Lots of northern Chinese cuisine and hot plates the the rest of the family enjoys and the hot red bean dessert after is a nice touch. But again. Soup dumplings. So good."}
{"text":"I agree that the Bejing duck was awesome. The food and service were great. Get there early because this place is busy."}
{"text":"What a massive disappointment. $50 paid for 2 orders of chicken dumplings (4 each), mediocre General Tao chicken and the lamest version of veggie rice I have seen since I made it myself during my teens. 
For prices this high you should be able to count on either decent quality or significant portions. Asian Legend delivered neither."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things from the other location.Decor was nice and there is a wide selection. You must make sure you read the menu CAREFULLY... There was absoultly zero accommodation or understanding from the manager when our dish came out and it was not even close to what we anticipated.  

We ordered shrimp dim sum which was mediocre, wontons in a peanut sauce as an appetizer which was not tasty as it came in a soupy oily peanut sauce, chicken fried rice which was great, beef with mushrooms and scallions which was our favorite dish and we highly recommend it, and crispy noodles with chicken and vegetables which is the dish that the manager did not accommodate us with...   the noodles reminded me of uncooked Mr. Noodles.

We enjoyed 2 out of the 5 dishes...this place is hit or miss. To be honest, if the staff was a little more accommodating I would have given them 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service sucks. 

The staff there are not friendly, and I sense they get annoyed at you if you ask for things like napkin, add more water to hot tea. 

I'm getting to a point where I don't bother going to a restaurant with bad service, even if the food is good. Going out for food is not just to eat food, it's also an experience. This restaurant doesn't seem to embrace this concept. 

There are just way too many options in Toronto, plenty of other places to spend money on food."}
{"text":"Very bad experiences, even the store is merely 50% full yet the staff insist on placing us in a 4 table with 6 seat. There's not enough space to place the food and the server just put down the food and gone... without even consider collect the empty plate. We politely request for ginger more than 3 times when the server passing by underhanded yet being ignored. We even pass the service button on the table but still being ignored. I guessed during morning time around 11am on Sunday cannot complain too much. 

Food is decent and at a good price point; however, you may wanna consider bring your own water since no one in the restaurant will be willing to refill your tea."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. I'm a big fan of eggplant and tofu dishes and they prepare them the same way as I remember them in China. The green bean dish is a must."}
{"text":"Not your average Chinese restaurant.  No plastic tableclothes or faded carpets.  More like you're dining somewhere in the core.  If you like dim sum or dumplings --- this is a must.  Menu is biased to more northern Chinese food.  While I think their Scarborough location is better, this will do in a pinch if you need a fix downtown.  No doubt, that's a big reason why it's always busy.  Dropped by around 9pm last night (a Wednesday) and the place was full.  +ives: dumplings, it's their specialty -ives: can be tough to find a table but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious siu long bau, (the little dumplings with soup that burst out when u  bite into it! Very consistently good. But could get pricey with ordering a lot of apps"}
{"text":"Lured by the nice looking modern interior design with a Chinese edge seen through the glass windows, a mouth watering ad for Lo Mein and a logo accepting credit cards, we made our first attempt the previous night but they were closed. 

We came back the very next evening only to have an unsatisfying and expensive Chinese dinner with poor service. The Lo Mein seems so good on the advertisement but don't be fooled by pictures like I am; it is obviously not the same chef! 
The Moo Shu Pork was terrible and so expensive to get extra thin pancakes; usually it's free. We also got The Chinese broccoli side dish but it was so salty, I couldn't eat any. The onion beef roll was the only plate I enjoyed yet it is so heavy and not a full meal. $50 without drinks, legendary enough to remind me never to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to several of the other locations of Asian Legend and usually have a pretty good experience.

Choose this one for a birthday/family dinner because we had a big table, 14 people, and this plaza usually has ample parking.

Made reservations for 5pm but were about 15 min late due to traffic but they accommodated which was appreciated. 

When we arrived there were only a handful of tables seated and eating.

We ordered about 13 dishes as everyone was hungry.

During our entire stay our waiter did not crack a single smile. He would've made Grumpy Cat proud!

The first 5 dishes came out one at a time and spaced about 10 minutes apart. Not only that but the portions seemed smaller than the other locations. This seemed odd as the restaurant was not busy yet.

Oddly enough when the crowds started coming the rest of the dishes came like a flood, which was a welcome sight as we barely wet our palettes with the first few dishes.

And to top it off we didn't even get any red bean dessert like we always did at the other locations.

Overall I would not return to this location but will visit the others."}
{"text":"Ordered take out once. I don't even want to go to the restaurant after tasting their food. I'm Chinese. My friends are Chinese, and they have ordering take out from time to time. However, I don't feel like their food is legit. The taste can't be worse. It has been modified so that most of people can accept it. Won't go there if I want to have real traditional Asian food."}
{"text":"A clean, reasonably-priced, DELICIOUS option in Chinatown. My friends and I come here regularly for an overdose of Chinese food and they never disappoint.

Favourites are the hot and sour soup (perfect balance), beef with Chinese broccoli (so tender), and the fish in wine sauce (OMG).

We also ordered the fried pork potstickers, which were amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on Friday night - restaurant was pretty empty when we got there but packed with a line by the time we left. 

Not sure what the English names were for what we ordered, but for sure there was a dried fish, green onion pancake type thing, beef roll, rice cake noodles, and dumplings. 

Everything was flavourful and tasty. Though the dishes could have used a little more spice. Pretty typical of other Shanghainese restaurants I've been too. 

The servers were very friendly and the service was really quick for the restaurant filling up quite quickly. The washrooms were pretty clean too, which is always a bonus. 

There wasn't anything too memorable about this restaurant, but I would visit again. Overall rating's pretty spot on with the \"a-ok!\""}
{"text":"The best onion pancakes here! Really flaky and has good onion flavour. The Shanghai casserole with tofu knots, pork, and bamboo was a huge dish. This was very salty but still very delicious. Soup dumplings are also very good, probably the best ones downtown. Mango pudding was creamy and soft. Tasted much better than mango puddings at ayce sushi places but didn't have enough evaporated milk. Pretty big portion, enough for more than 2 people."}
{"text":"Valentine's comes once a year, and I generally use it as an excuse to make my partner treat me to a huge decadent meal. This year Valentines fell on Chinese New Year and we made it a two birds one massive glutton fest. 
We went Asian Legend on recommendation and while we weren't disappointed, I didn't fall in love. The beef pancake was phenomenal, a Chinese burrito of sorts and started the meal off on a high note. The greenbeans with dried shrimp were great too. But the house fried rice, and sweet and sour pork disappointed. The service was unenthusiastic but kind."}
{"text":"I came here on business. After my first bite I was semi-seriously pondering relocating to the area so I could come here again.

My only complaint was that the wanton soup was a little spare, with only wantons and baby bok choy (Nothing else) It was still good and the broth was quite flavourful. 

Absolutely everything else I tried was magnificent.  The lemon chicken my coworker ordered was sublime, as was the beef in black bean sauce (my favourite. I had to order it off the menu but they knew exactly what I was asking for.)

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a bit more expensive than average. Though the food also looks on par with the price, the taste is definitely not!

However, this is the only place i know of in Chinatown that has private rooms (beneath the open dining hall)."}
{"text":"The food was too salty. Was salt on sale? Nice atmosphere though. I don't think I would return again."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the Asian Legend Chain. I come here because it is usually not as busy as their Finch and Leslie location. Service is quick and good. Very nice decor. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Bad service.  Food was just ok, better chinese food elsewhere.  Check out Yueh Tung (Not sure of spelling) at corner of Elizabeth and Dundas 2nd floor and order the chili chicken on rice.  Or try Swatow on Spadina Ave.  about 2 blocks away.  The only reason people go there is because it has modern decor, if you're into the Ikea look."}
{"text":"Siu Long Bao (pork dumplings with soup within the dumpling). That is what Asian legends is all about. If you miss it, you miss the point of going. These are quick difficult to make as can be attested to by the number of northern chinese \"restaurants\" that fail to maintain the soup in the dumpling. 

All of the dishes I have tried (various dumplings, noodles and rice dishes) were average or above average. As other reviewers have noted, this is a clean and orderly chinese restaurant good for non-asian co-workers, family & friends. 

Some of the most fun is having each person randomly choosing a dish that sounds great to them and seeing what the end results are. Prices are reasonable enough that you can actually do this and no be terrified of the bill at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the $10 lamb rice combo.  It exceeded my expectations.  Came with a lemon tea drink, corn egg drop soup, and rice.  The food was delicious, service was speedy and friendly and the  ambience was clean and modern. I can't ask for anymore for the price."}
{"text":"We went to this place for our post Friday night brunch to catch up on each other's lives as well as what happened the night before.

I went with two of my guy friends. They had never been there before - it was clear from their lack of knowledge on what to order there. We ordered the \"must have\" soup pork filled dumplings (#4), the deep fried tofu covered with fresh garlic (#39), and beef noodle soup #120). 

This place is well known for its Shanghai breakfast - pork filled dumplings with soup, deep fried dough ($1.95), spicy hot soya milk ($2.95), and green onion pancake wrapped in beef or egg/shrimp.  Its also well known for its beef noodle soup, and other noodle/rice dishes. It has a pretty good hot and sour soup as well.

The ambiance and washrooms are quite modern and clean for an establishment located in the Chinatown. Its a great date place given that if a date isn't going well, you can also focus on the food (i don't think i have ever had a bad dish except for the cold noodles with peanut sauce), the conversation at the next table - tables are in too close for comfort proximity next to other patrons, or worse case scenario, the wait staff - we had this twin-xy asian guy sporting a mullet - we speculated that the mullet could strategically be turned into a mohawk with some gel.

Our meal turned out to be $11 each but we were still hungry so we ventured next door to King's Dim Sum for round 2."}
{"text":"Asian Legend is a stellar restaurant. It is one of my favourite places to eat. This sheppard location is my go to restaurant whether I want to show a friend a good time of have a relaxing meal with my family. 

The food is top notch I particularly enjoy their dim sum menu, but here are some definite recommendations that I get almost every single visit; steamed soup filled dumplings with ground pork, Rolled onion pancake with sliced beef, Deep fried tofu with garlic sauce, Moo shu chicken (comes with six pancakes). 

The prices here are quite reasonable for the amazing taste and atmosphere, and I've noticed the staff are hard working and diligent people. I have never once experienced bad service and am a loyal custommer to the end.

Overall I would definitely rate my experience with this restaurant as a 11/10! Will be uploading pics of my next visit. Going to celebrate my successful surgery there in a few weeks time."}
{"text":"I went here with another person after looking for reviews for a good dim sum place (that wasn't with the cart) and found Asian Legend. At least for me, I thought the menu was vast regardless if it was dim sum or just other appetizing dishes.

One of the yummiest dishes I have ever tried for the first time was the Beef chunk noodle soup. The bowl was very satisfying and savouring; both the soup and noodles (especially the soup) wasn't bland and it gave me a happy in my tummy. For anyone whose looking for a filling noodle soup when coming here, you should definately give this one a try.

I also ordered the Ho Fun Fried noodles and shumai and maybe it's just me but I can't really taste the difference between here and other dim sum restaurants but it wasn't bad. Generic in my opinion but not bad.

Other things like seating and waiting for food were quick and one of the most important things I find when dining in a restaurant is how fast the waiter responds to you which they did, thankfully, despite the place looking pretty busy, so kudos on that.

Overall, I'm probably going to be coming back but maybe with more people as the more the merrier!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant in a Chinatown in any city this clean this clean.  We ordered somewhat conservatively but everything was delicious (soup dumplings, beef noodle soup, and scallion pancake).  I thought the prices were reasonable.  Also, the service was friendly and and the food was delivered promptly.  Overall, a very solid restaurant and dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is spacious and stylish compared to other Asian Legend in north York and York mills. 

I went there around 5:30 pm and the restaurant was almost full. The food is consistently great. Love the vast selection in the menu. I'm glad to see a decent Chinese restaurant opening up in Vaughan. It would be my first choice for Chinese restaurant in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Well, I guess I should review this place since I was here three times over the last two weeks. 

Hooray, finally found another place grandma (key criterion: price) and I (key criterion: cleanliness) can agree on. We even agree on a dish: the hot and sour soup. 

Aside from that, menu seems like a mish-mash of different Chinese regional cuisines to me. But I'm ok with that, the food is pretty good. I particularly liked the onion pancake and chicken dumplings. 

Unlike some other readers, I didn't find it particularly expensive. On one lunch visit, I came with four other people and we cashed out at $50 including tax and tip. Last night for dinner, for 7 people, we paid $102 including everything, and we even ordered the Peking-style duck; there were also leftovers. 

Hint to get into the parking lot: The lot (on the north side of Sheppard) is surrounded by a black metal rod-type fence. If you're driving west from McCowan, the parking entrance gap is on the west end of the lot. (If you turn before you get to the fence you'll go into the next door plaza.)

4.5 for food
- 0.5 for waiter coughing without covering
= 4.0 stars"}
{"text":"4/5! Amazing authentic Chinese food. Highly recommend the pea shoots with garlic, dim sum with soup, dim sum with peanut sauce and lamb in black bean sauce. The best dish was the beef cabbage spring onion pancakes - absolutely delicious :) we would definitely go back for Sunday brunch or take out."}
{"text":"First off the positives - the soup dumplings are delicious. We tried 2 different versions. very good.

The rest of the food was average. General Tao chicken was ok and the Eggplant dish wasn't too great either. Maybe we should have stuck to the dumplings!

Also, the service was very poor. The server took forever to bring the eggplant dish. We were finished with our meal, so we took it to go instead.

While walking out, we noticed a Toronto Public Health sign that had given it a Conditional Pass!! I wish we had noticed that before we walked in. Haha"}
{"text":"Love their northern Chinese cuisine. Definitely different from what the rest of downtown Chinatown offers. Being a northern Chinese person, I love the fact that the flavors are just right and not that much oil was used. Usually in the other restaurants, oil drips from the fried rices or noodles. I love that oil was not used too much.

I ordered the Ho Fun Noodles with Sliced Beef, Fried Onion Pancaked with Sliced Beef and Xiao Long Bao with Pork (Steamed mini buns with pork - the good stuff with juice inside). I am very happy with this purchase. So was my partner :)

I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Went for their xiao long bao and loved it.
Came back for more 3 times during my 4 day stay in Toronto. Love this place"}
{"text":"We went to this rest on Feb 14, 2016 for lunch. When we arrived, we noticed that the resto looked very full with few staff.

It took awhile for us to be seated. Our waiter came around and told us the food service may be a bit slower because they were very busy today. 

We got our tea right away and had to ask for water a second time before we got it. On the bright side our food came right away. We ordered soup filled dumplings ($5.99), deep fried tofu ($3.99), green onion pancakes with egg on top ($3.99), and a Cantonese chow mein ($12.99).

Soup filled dumplings served with red vinegar and ginger was very good. The deep fried tofu was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside - melts in your mouth goodness, the green onion pancake was good but slightly mushy for my taste but very good overall, the chow mein had lots of generous toppings (cha siew bbq pork, small scallops, squid, shrimp, sliced Chinese mushrooms and broccoli) it was good but la lacked the slight crispness you expect from traditional chow mein but very good overall. 

The service was good and they were very accommodating for our toddler. 

The place was very nicely decorated with very high ceilings and modern rendition of a traditional Chinese style. The bathroom was very clean. 

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been going to other locations of this restaurant and loved them. Now that they came in my area, this location has instantly became my frequent dining place. 

As they just opened, they are still looking to hire more staff. They are often short staffed but each waiter is doing their best. They are truly working hard. Seeing that they are doing their best, I don't mind waiting. 

Food is great. I haven't been disappointed with anything I have ordered so far, except that a few dishes were not available. Not sure if it is because this is a new open location and they are not yet equipped to make those dishes?
I hope they will have all dishes on the menu available soon."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my bf. The interior is nice. I didn't check out the restrooms so cannot comment on that. We had the onion pancake, siu mai, dumplings and a noodle dish. The siu mai was still pink inside when I bit into it. Unfortunately my bf had already consumed his in one bite. I flagged down a server who took it away to steam them some more. The food was just okay... Nothing I would crave again. I was full after my meal, but unsatisfied. One of our servers was very pleasant.

Overall, I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location ever since they converted the Swiss Chalet into Asian Legend. I've always gotten good service and great food! No complaints!

I normally get their Hot & Sour Soup with Shredded Chicken, Snow Pea Shoot with Garlic in Soup, Sautéed Green Beans with Dried Shrimp, Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Ground Pork, Pan Fried Chicken Dumplings, Pan Fried Pork Dumplings, Pan Fried Green Onion Pancake, Chinese Bun (steamed or deep fried), Pan Fried Pork Buns, Shanghai Noodles and Chicken Fried Rice.

I know it's a lot of food but usually I'm there with at least 4+ people and we put the noodles and rice into take out containers for the next day. 

Overall, it has a great atmosphere, beautifully decorated. You can always order online and go pick it up!"}
{"text":"Used to come here 2 or more times a week but over the last couple of years have noticed that the quality has deteriorated a bit.  The food is still ok, but not great.  I would actually give them 3.5 stars if I knew how to add half a star.  

They have the typical Shanghai food, and the price is pretty good.  If you like the place, on your first visit buy a VIP card that is valid for 1 year and costs $20.  It gives you 10 percent off every time you go."}
{"text":"Called in wanting to order take out at 9:30pm, the phone rang for almost 15 minutes before someone picked up. I told him I wanted to order takeout and the guy told me the kitchen was closed, I then asked why the kitchen is already closed when the store is suppose to close at 11:00pm and the guy said \"well it's just closed\" and hung up on me. Let's not talk about the food, but the service is definitely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Poor service. Have to try real hard to flag anyone down. I have had better food. If you want disappointment then this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings! The rest of the menu is good too but the dumplings here are my favourite. Order all the dumplings! Vegetarians - they have a delicious spinach dumpling you can get steamed or fried. Feels a little more posh than most places in this part of Chinatown which I enjoy, however it unfortunately closes earlier than most places in Chinatown too, so go before 10pm. I've been coming here for years and it is consistently excellent. If you have a big party of people they have private dining rooms on the lower level."}
{"text":"(2.5 stars)

Went on a Wednesday night at around 8pm and it was surprisingly busy, when we got there.  Fortunately, the long line of people were mostly waiting to pick up take-out.  We were shown a table for two which had just been vacated and cleaned (the seats were still warm!).

Usually when we come to Asian Legend, we go all out on dumplings.  I would rate most of their dumplings and appetizers at 3-stars.  But we changed plans this time, and ordered some main courses, and a noodle dish.

The dry-fried rice noodle with beef was very disappointing.  The beef pieces had waaaay too much tenderizer to the point that you can't distinguish the beef's soft texture from the rice noodles, and the taste of the tenderizer was very overpowering.  Thankfully, there was not a lot of beef pieces in the dish (normally this would be a complaint, but this time, a blessing in disguise.)  And the rice noodles were gooey and stuck together.  This is a fairly  standard noodle dish at any Chinese restaurant and this may be the worst I've ever had.  Ugh.  Rating:  1 star.

Salty spice pork chop was very good!  A bit on the greasy side though, but the pork remained relatively most.  Rating: 3 stars.

Ma po tofu:  Boyfriend had been craving this dish (which led us to Asian Legend this night) and said it's the usual quality.   Not quite spicy enough, and not quite enough minced meat in the dish.  But for ~$10, it'll do in a pinch.  Rating:  3 stars.

Pork and chive dumplings (pan fried) saved the meal!  Asian Legend does do dumplings well, and this was no exception.  The dumplings had plenty of filling, and the wrap was not too thick.  When you take that first bit, you get hit with the \"juice\", which is delicious.  They serve this with vinegar, but we like our dumplings plain.  Rating:  3 stars

Although we didn't order more at this meal, we typically order several kinds of dumplings (steamed as well as pan-fried); their deep fried tofu;  and their beef pancake wrap;  (most dishes from their appeitzer page) and if hungry, their salty-spice pork chop.  And we usually leave satisfied.  Too bad we strayed off of our usual course this time, leading us to a 2.5 star, rather than the usual 3 star experience.

Overall, Asian Legend is cheap and cheerful.  The servers speak English, the service is efficient, the decor is up to date, and the restaurant is overall relatively clean (in the context of Chinatown).  We will return, and order our \"usual\" next time!"}
{"text":"Good tasting, clean and most importantly fresh food. I had crispy cantonese noodles with vegetables and vegetable spring rolls. Both tasted amazing, especially the spring-rolls. They were crisp and fresh. At other restaurants spring-rolls usually drip with oil, but not the case here. I was pretty impressed. It may be a bit on the expensive side but well worth it.

The decor is simple but elegant. The service was amazing and fast.

I would definitely recommend this place to others and will most likely go back soon."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst dim sum restaurant I've ever been to in quite a while. The seating is cramped, and the staff there have some issues. To be fair, they don't really look like they want to work there, they are also extremely rude. Food is overpriced and just bad, for example, the starter jellyfish tastes so bad I want to throw up. All the food I ordered today is either bland or taste like crap. Maybe I am too entitled or whatever, but that dining experience is absolutely miserable!

tl;dr I would not recommend going to this restaurant at all!"}
{"text":"This is a good Asian restaurant for a quick meal.  It is not too expensive but just right for what you get.  The portions are relatively large and consistently good.  I haven't tried too many of the dishes but others have told me the same.  

I like the beef and broccoli as well as the fried rice with shrimp and eggs.  We usually start with the steamed shrimp dumplings. The general Tao  chicken is average to good.  Used to larger pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review by saying that I had worked in the service industry for about 10 years and have made my share of errors but I literally had my worst dining experience at the Don Mills location of Asian Legend. 

I'll start by acknowledging that the restaurant was busy because it was Mother's Day. Our family had a reservation for 25 people and they squeezed is in to 2 round tables usually set for 8 each. Putting in an extra 4-5 people at each table, we literally sat with each chair touching each other. That should have been my first red flag but we are a close family and decided to roll with it since we were already there. 

Our waiter seemed very nice but I noticed that he was wearing the \"in training\" name tag. I'm all for being patient and even more forgiving with new workers but perhaps it may have been a good idea to send a more experienced server to such a large group. Super nice guy but we had to ask for drinks and extra cutlery a couple of times. Not quite a red flag but something none the less. 

We ordered the same dishes for each of the 2 tables and a few of the dishes came out in one large plate so we had to pass the dishes back and forth between tables. Not a huge deal because we were hungry and like I said before, we are a big happy family. 

Each dish came out between 10-20 minutes apart which I found a little ridiculous considering we each ate one chicken wing and waited 20 minutes for a bowl of rice at one point. Considering we had 8 children and 4 elders at the table, this was a hot button for me. When we inquired what the hold up was, our server apologized because it was so busy. Tables seated after us were all leaving but perhaps they had smaller orders. We had ordered quite a bit of food. About 30 minutes after our last dish came out and several inquiries on our other dishes, our waiter came back and asked if there was anything else we needed. We had not eaten our main dishes and the kitchen lost the rest of our order! I'm not sure why they kept saying that they were sorry that it was busy, when in fact they had no orders in the kitchen for us. Long story short, they had written down our order on two sides of a paper and only put in the dishes on the first side. 

We asked to speak to a manager and the waiter came back and forth but no manager until we hailed the manager looking woman at the front. First she said she was a manager and then she said she needed to speaker to the manager. She apologized offered us free desert and a 10% discount on the food we received. I don't expect to eat for free but 10% off is a pretty insulting discount considering we waited 3 hours at over crowded tables for chicken wings, fried rice, braised chicken and dumplings. They threw in 2 bags of frozen dumplings to take home, which were in manufacturers packaging so we now know that they do not make their own, and they brought out 8 mango puddings for 25 people. My sweet family members were happy to just go home and be done with it but I had them throw in some more frozen dumplings. I didn't even want them but I felt like it was about the principle. The manager never showed his face to apologize. 

I would never go back to this restaurant. The little food we ate was decent but completely not worth the stress. I took my kids to the Golden Arches on the way home."}
{"text":"Good deco. Fair service. Disappointed  food.
I ordered Dandan noodle, pancake with egg and Xiaolongbao. They are not disgusting, it's just mediocre, and you just have nothing to say about it. 
The Dandan noodle technically is from Sichuang. It should be hot, spicy and \"tongue-numbing\". But it tastes just like sesame sauce instead of pepper and it is not even spicy. It's probably because they changed it to suit the area, so it turns out to be not authentic. 
The egg pancake. tasteless. The egg is overcooked. 
The only \"attraction\" for the Xiaolongbao is its green outlook which it is really cute. But the inside is tasteless. Where is the scallops?!
But I smelled the dishes from the table beside me,it was great. So maybe I ordered the wrong thing?"}
{"text":"Straight up be prepared for the worst customer service experience ever.  The staff bearly speak english and they will keep you waiting and bring you the wrong order.  On the other hand, the food is truly amazing.  I tried to do take out here to avoid the sloppiness of the staff's customer service, but each time i take out i do not get what i order or the food depreciate in taste and quality."}
{"text":"Always consistent service and food quality. Great pricing if you have a vip card to boot."}
{"text":"Popped in here after a fun time at Canada's Wonderland which is across the street.  The decor is nice and appears to be a higher end Chinese food place.   First of all the tea was on point.  It's been a long time since I had proper tea at an asian food restaurant, and so this was perfect.  It also seemed to hold an unending amount of tea which made me quite pleased!  The food was good as well.  We ordered two different kinds of dumpling, veggie and chicken.  The veggie one was amazing!   It was full of bok choy and glass vermicelli noodles and was delicious!  The fried rice had pineapple and chicken and was really tastey!  I would totally recommend this place and I would return."}
{"text":"It was Meh.

I've been here before where I've enjoyed the food more.  Today, I wasn't as impressed, but it could be what I ordered.  I tried the fried intestines.  It was OK but wasn't as good as PaPa Chang's.  I tried the xiao long bao, but I preferred the one at Ding Tai Fung.  Even my son didn't like the udon noodles with pork chops.

As usual, it was busy.  Service was good considering the place was very busy.

I will go again and just assume they had an off day today."}
{"text":"Long-time fan, even before renos...one of my favourites spots to eat in Chinatown. The food is flavourful and cooked well, consistently. Although Asian Legend now has many locations, the original downtown location remains a fave for their soup dumplings, hot & sour soup, fried rice cakes and veggies. Try their eggplant dish - too yummy to pass."}
{"text":"like many asian resturants, asian legend is pretty well known.


unfortunately, today was not one of those \"OMG THIS IS SO GOOODDD\" days. rather, much of the food felt as if they poured a gallon of salt into their food. also known as MSG. 

quite normally, i would completely recommend this restaurant to a friend, as i love their food. unfortunately today, i would simply tell them to be ready to go and drink a gallon of water in preparation for the saltiness that is to come."}
{"text":"LITERALLY just came back from here!

Decor is nice, service is average chinese restaurant type and cleanliness is ok.

Onto the food!

-Sweet and sour pork, a little too tangy for my liking, but overall I would order again

-Vegetable cantonese noodles, aka, chow mein, very good. Loaded with lots of veggies and flavour.

-Ho Fun, aka, rice noodles stir fry with beef, VERY GOOD!

-Pork and chive dumplings pan fried, very food! not on the crispy side, which would have made them perfect, but still very delicious. 10 for $5.99

Came with complimentary desert and tea (like most chinese restaurants)

Next time I vow to try the pecking duck with the pancakes, aka wraps, at the Vaughan location!

P.S All that came up to $44 excluding tax and tip."}
{"text":"Conveniently located across from Wonderland, not too far from Vaughan Mills and right off the highway was Asian Legend. I've read great things about the location on Leslie and i wanted to try this place when it opened up.

The decorations and aesthetics of this place was quite nice. It was spacious, clean and comfortable.

The food was pretty good too. Since i was there for a light dinner with one other person, we had \"ho fun\" aka stir fried beef rice noodles (5/5) and dim sum dumplings that were made fresh (4.8/5).

The staff was very friendly and the food was fresh.

Overall i'd come back again!"}
{"text":"Decoration - A

Service - B+

Cleanliness - A

Food - A

-Ho Fun with beef was very tasty
-Dim Sum was made fresh to order (i saw them wrap it as I was walking by the kitchen)

Overall I really like this place, the decoration and space is great for larger parties."}
{"text":"Best dim sum you're going to get around downtown. The soupy pork dumplings along with their rolled onion pancakes with beef  are my go to's at this place, but most everything I've tried here has been above average (granted I haven't tried their general tso, or mango chicken - or anything that is likely going to be a disappointment when you want authentic tasting food) Service is decent, and the atmosphere is a 5/5 for china town."}
{"text":"Food: too greasy 
Tried beef boodle soup. Some kinda stir-fried spicy chicken. Fries rice. All too greasy for me. 
Stir fried green beans & kung paw shrimp are ok.  
Service is average - nothing amazing. 
Tables felt greasy. But at least dishes seemed clean. 
I didn't find any hair or bugs in my food thats always a blessing. 
My mom & her friends seem to like this place & some of my friends do too.
Maybe I'm just not too crazy about greasy salty Chinese food."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese restaurant!  General Tao Chicken is excellent.  Steam pork baos.  All excellent.. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Solid food, I always get the classics.  Dessert of red bean pancake took way longer than the 20 minutes prep time listed on the menu though"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, everything we ordered was delicious. Service started out great, tea on the table before we even sat down. Aside from a little bit of attitude when we asked for water everything was perfect. Then our bill came and the server added a service charge to the bill... There was only 2 of us eating. We paid and I picked up another menu to see if there is any note of gratuity being added to a bill and to my surprise the menu clearly states that they do not add gratuity to their bills! The only explanation I can think of is that we were discriminated against. Not cool! Very offensive!"}
{"text":"Just visited for lunch and I must say that the quality has certainly gone down at this location.  We had the pan fried dumpings, the XLB, sweet and sour pork and the noodles with braised beef which used to be my favourite dish.   The dumplings were decent, but the XLB had no soup in them as they were already punctured when they arrived at the table.  This normally means that the chef did not do a good job wrapping them to ensure that the soup does not leak out.  The sweet and sour pork were more like sweet and sour batter as there was not much pork in them at all.  Id say each piece consisted of about 65% batter and 35% pork.  The broth for the noodles was extremely salty and we had to ask for hot water in order to water down the broth to make it edilble.  Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This is another place that I usually end up eating at whenever I'm visiting the Toronto area.  Overall quality of the food is consistent and good.  You usually can't go wrong here.  I'm fortunate that my wife usually picks good dishes to eat.

Like another reviewer mentioned, their steamed soup dumplings are good - not the best, not the worst.  Their pancake with chives are very well done, not oily at all.  The choy sum with garlic was fresh and cooked just right (i.e. not limp/overcooked).

Despite being a chain, Asian Legend has done a great job in providing a consistent experience at their various locations.  Staff/service is decent and quick.  I haven't had any complaints yet and plan to continue eating here whenever I visit the area."}
{"text":"Glad to see a real Chinese restaurant in the area...it's about time!  I frequently visit the richmond hill, North York and Scarborough location and the food portion, flavour and ingredients do vary but that is somewhat normal as it really depends on the cook.  Nevertheless, I am happy to have real Chinese food close to home.  Although this location is not my favourite, the food is still great!!!

Service, decor and washrooms are very good too."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a clean, nicely decorated Chinese restaurant, this is a good choice.  I come here whenever I have a get together with some former co-workers.  We always enjoy the food here, whether it's dumplings, Kung Pao chicken (George likes his chicken spicy), sizzling beef or sweet and sour pork.

The staff is friendly.  The food comes pretty quick.  It's a bit on the pricier side for Chinese food in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times as it is pretty close to where I used to live, the chinese food selection here is extensive, like most chinese restaurants, you have lots of options.

Vegetarian options are limited compared the the amount of items on the menu, but you still have a choice from about 11-15 different dishes. The food here is flavourful and they can customize it to your needs.

Service can be slow here when the place is busy, but during off-peak hours service is fast."}
{"text":"this Chinese restaurant is pretty good compared to certain others around Chinatown. The food doesn't taste as oily and is probably made with more effort and fresher ingredients.. of course, the environment feels much cleaner as well. I usually like ordering the eggplant with fish sauce, onion beef stir fry, mango chicken~~~, and house special crispy chicken. The only gripe I have against this branch is the close proximity between the tables. Nonetheless, if I go to chinatown, most of the time I would go to this restaurant for chinese food."}
{"text":"This is our new go-to for Chinese fare since our favourite, Chicken & Noodle (formerly at 1 Glen Watford Rd) closed for business.

The decor here is beautiful. The ceiling is made to look like the roof of a hut, with carved wood panels meeting at a point in the middle, and red light shining through.

The menu is based on Northern Chinese fare. The Hot and Sour soup is the best I've had in the city. Other favourites are the Seafood Casserole (it comes out sizzling in a hot pot), and the General Tao...

AKA CRACK CHICKEN!

I can't even begin to tell you how delicious that dish is. It's like chicken candy. Once you pop one, it's hard to stop. Trust me, I have a lot of self restraint, and this one sucks me in every time.

Service can be slow during peak hours, but overall the staff are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great lunch with the family here! Get the XL sweet and sour soup if you have 6+ people, it's worth the price!! Also, they really fill up the soup to the brim.  Highly recommend their soup/tea and meat dumplings. The Shanghai noodles seemed popular as well! Service was great! We are and will continue to be regulars here."}
{"text":"Service was not the best. The xiao long bao was good. The dan dan noodles and wonton noodles were soggy but the soup was good."}
{"text":"Off my do-not-fly list, thank goodness.

We loved the Asian Legend location on Yonge (now closed) and were happy to see a location open closer to us.  Sadly early experiences were rough.  Happily things are much smoother now.

The kinks around service have been worked out (I will admit it was quiet when we went there on Saturday for lunch).  Green onion cake, soup dumplings, Peking duck, and noodles were all very good.  

Service was prompt and attentive.  Glad they've sorted out early operational problems."}
{"text":"The service is really lousy.Very rude staff.Found cockroach in soup.and the staff was in denial.On top of it staff will literally ask for tip.and if you don't leave a good tip they will abuse you with a smile.Don't go to this place unless you wanna ruin your evening..."}
{"text":"The absolute best Chinese restaurant I have ever been to (yes - including Chinatown NYC and SF).  I am in Markham-area once or twice a year and never skip this place.

(1) The soup dumplings are tremendous.
(2) The little pork chops with the chilies on the side are out of this world.
(3) Everything else is very good to exceptional
(4) The quality of the ingredients is so obviously great that you don't mind the steep bill that follows them."}
{"text":"Food at Asian Legend today was such a disappointment. 

1. Their staple soup-filled pork dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) had broken skin on every single one of them. 

2. Their fried pork buns tasted sour...

3. The worst part is! They advertised their \"hand-made noodles\" for an extra $1. When the dish came, it's like one of those flat store-bought noodles. (I will post the photo for proof.) 

Overall experience is subpar."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese restaurant with a good variety.  They cover a range of Chinese cuisines but do a good job.  Free tea on the table.  Chicken with Chili Oil was pretty good.  Lamb with Cumin not so good.  The lamb had too much sauce.  I normally order this at Sichuan restaurants and it is drier.

Asian Legend is a solid choice in the area and I would go back."}
{"text":"Came here because I saw that they had soup dumplings here, I am on a quest to find good soup dumplings in Toronto (not successful so far, oh how I miss Shanghai Cafe in NYC for this!). Anyways the decor is similar to Spring Rolls, they are so similar that my husband wondered if this was a Spring Roll chain. The food here is slightly better than Spring Rolls,  edible, but nothing noteworthy for sure. 

The soup dumplings were NOT good, meat is too grainy and not enough filling. Filling lacks flavor as well. Prices were kind of high for the caliber of food and for its location."}
{"text":"Do not go on a Saturday night if you're a couple, as most of their tables are for large groups. It took close to an hour for them to sit us down, but with such a high rating on this site we thought it was worth the wait. The food was fine but they sat us down at a make-shift table with cheap fold-out chairs held by tape. When you pay the same as everybody else, you expect to sit at a proper table like everybody else. It was disappointing. It made it difficult for us to enjoy the food. 
I spoke to the manager about it and his response was that we didn't have to sit there.  But what does one do when you're hungry and don't want to take the chance it would be even longer for another table. That's just rude.
I may try to give this place another chance, but next time we're going as a group with a reserved table."}
{"text":"I have been to the downtown and Leslie-Finch locations and have always had excellent meals. This Don Mills location is newly opened with lots of tables. 

We love Dim Sum and the dumplings with soup inside them is a favourite. We love Peking Duck and the restaurant makes it to a delicious crispy finish which is carved table side. We had it in two courses - on a thin pancake with onions and hoisin sauce and then in a lettuce wrap. 

Congee Queen has been a great place in the area and Asian Legend elevates the Chinese food offerings. Prices very reasonable - 5 adults, 2 kids $130 plus tax - with plenty of left overs."}
{"text":"Although Decent, this location is nowhere near as fantastic as Asian Legand Richmond Hill. Allow me to compare

Was really disappointed that their chili sauce was not mind-blowingly fantastic as other locations. Lacking in both heat and star anise. 

The Spice Salt Fish here was not at all the same. Instead of a thin light batter, it was heavily battered and dark brown, more like fish-and-chips than Spice Salt fish. Would have benefited from a toss in sauce, Had me wishing we were at Congee Queen. 

The Dry Sauteed Green Beans were good, although oily, and even though we ordered them with the dehydrated baby shrimps, they were noticeably absent.

Dumplings (Dim Sum All Day) were really really good. Comparable to Ding Tai Fung, at least what I ordered.  

for Downtown Toronto, this would be my first choice for Chinese food, in comparison with GTA Chinese eats, This wouldn't make the top ten for certain.

Asian Legand generally has good service (compared to other similar- price-point Chinese restaurants) , and this location was no different. We were stuck in a private room in the basement because it was so busy, but we were not forgotten. Service here was definitely more downtown casual and friendly, than stern serious and all business like up North. I did miss the fresh plates/hot tea seriousness though."}
{"text":"In the plaza across from Commerce Court, Asian Legend serves Northern Chinese, Bejing style food. Thankfully more spicy than some other regional Chinese cuisines.  

Disclaimer, I went with the SOs parents for a little Chinese New Year dinner, so I had no control over what was ordered. This likely affects my rating. We went for dinner, and did not sample any of the dim-sum, although they do have a reasonable selection. 

Chef's special Spicy Bass, for $19.99 was a disappointingly tiny fish. Very spicy thanks to the coating of chilis, and swimming in oil. Tasty, but not worth the price.  

Soft Tofu with shrimp ($10.95) came adorned with a very gloopy sauce and peas and carrots of the frozen variety. Very bland, benefiting greatly from the fantastic chili sauce* on the table

We had Sauteed Green Beans with Dried Shrimp ($9.95) that was actually, really good.

My dining companions had beef wrapped in green onion pancake and a crispy ribs dish which they enjoyed. The spring rolls ($3.95) (they clearly ordered these for me) were decent. 

Service was good considering the place was RAMMED due to Chinese New Year celebrations. Our server even exchanged our plates midway through with clean ones. Tea came hot and whenever we needed it. They gave me a fork but I'll forgive them. He did pack me a little chili sauce* to go.  The staff was noticeably flustered but on the ball. 

Note there is a VIP card for discounts for regular visitors. 

*The chilli oil sauce on the table was amazing. Seriously. Spicy and flavourful, hint of anise or chinese five spice. They must make it themselves, better than the generic you usually get.

I will return for sure, and get some of my go-to dishes, then I will be able to make a better comparison to the other Chinese eats in the area. A-Ok for now."}
{"text":"Food was very good the service was mediocre. Would  highly recommend this place and will return."}
{"text":"I had read about their pork floss in glutinous rice roll and had glimpsed their austere interiors on a couple of sites (this included). Service was slow on a mid-afternoon with only a few other tables occupied.

The much anticipated pork floss with fried donut and glutinous rice roll arrived and was met with some dissapointment upon inspection. The rice roll was not at all glutinous, rather was sticky and packed tight against the rest of the dish, which ended up falling apart anyway on your plate.

The two other dimsum dishes were acceptable but forgettable. I'm not sure I'd return to try any of their dishes.

Extra points however for having possibly some of the cleanest and most well-designed washrooms in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Consistent quality and service. A good place to fulfill your dumping craving and other northern Chinese foods. The price is fair and plenty of option  to choose from."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently. In the past 2 months the service has completely gone down hill. The portions are smaller, and are frequently not delivered hot. Yesterday, the fried rice was burnt and lukewarm, the beef with green onion was barely warm. General Tao chicken and fish were hot."}
{"text":"Today's soy milk tastes as though it is made with expired soy beans.

#83 Spicy fish soup is good though, not in the sense that it tastes the same as the traditional dish, but in that it gives off a delicate and yet flavourful smell. But could be even better without the hot pot ingredients inside: I could imagine a better dish with a more subdued and lighter taste soup.

Nothing good nor bad could be said of today's #141 noodle."}
{"text":"I like their dim sums, not the main dishes. It's a relatively pricier Chinese Restaurant, but the food quality and decoration are better too.
My favorites are: Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef, Pan Fried Calzone w/Garlic Chives, Shrimp & Egg and Preserved Pork."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good. One of the cleanest restaurant in Chinatown. 

When my parents come visit, they always craved the beef noodle soup (hand made noodle is $1 extra)

Couple of my favourites: Dumplings (the green one), general tao chicken (crispy and sweet), pork chop with spiced salt, green bean, braised eggplant and tofu and moo shu chicken.

Great for big groups too."}
{"text":"This is one of the more frequent visited restaurants.  The hot sweet soya bean drink is good.  \"Xiao Lung Boa\" the juicy soup inside the pork dumpling is delicious.  Fried dumpling is also good.  We have the hot Beef soup noodle but are disappointed with both the beef quality and the taste of the soup.  They have it much better last few times I have visited.  Didn't know whether it's a different chef. The fried rice is good though a bit oily to me but my father in law likes it. 

The service is very good.  It has to be mentioned that the waitress serving us is a trainee."}
{"text":"So it isn't unheard of for someone to bash the Halifax, Chinese food scene. With hopes that Chinatown in Toronto would offer some good Chinese eats, the boyfriend and I ventured out after a long day of shopping. 

Not familiar with the city, we used our phones as our compass and arrived at Asian Legend a lot of hours after we left. We actually walked right by it as it was neatly tucked away into the rest of the colorful Dundas st.

Needles to say we were tired and hungry. Never a good combo; especially for the boyfriend. 

I was more or less expecting a hole in the wall but Asian Legend rather surprised me with a pristine decor and fancy wait staff. My favourite part upon entering was that we must've arrived during all of the cook staff's lunch break. They were all sitting around a table in the seating area, conversing and chowing down on what I can only surmise as their own creations. While I thought it was cool I quickly realized we were left waiting for our food. We had to wait for them to finish their break to serve us. Odd? I kind of thought so. It kind of made up for it though as once we did order, it came out super fast. 

Little teapots filled with hot tea were at every table and helped you sift through an extensive menu. I was overwhelmed by the menu and my boyfriend, well he didn't even try and attempt to look at it. Chicken or beef? Sweet or sour? Those were the questions I asked haha. 

I've never tried dumplings before so we settled on steamed chicken dumplings, fried cantonese noodles with mixed veggies, and kung pao. We were weirded out by the dumplings and didn't care for them. I have friends who disagree and say they are the best in town. Its the first time I had them so I don't really have anything to compare them to. The fried cantonese noodles though? OH EM GEE. Get them, get them, get them. They were ammmmmmmmazing!! They came in a big serving dish with crunchy noodles underneath and the mixed veggies on top. So the edges of the noodles were crispy and the insides were chewy. 

I'm drooling just thinking about them. Do it. 

Not your average cheap chinese take out. You're looking at spending a few more dollars but in my mind it's worth it."}
{"text":"Modern, minimalist Shanghainese cuisine - the decor definitely aligns with (if not pioneered) the new-age fusion restaurants that are popping up all over the GTA.  This particular location was recently renovated - definitely for the better with more efficient use of space.  The past arrangement had a big clear glass box in the middle of the restaurant where people waited to be seated - always gave me a chuckle whenever I was there.

The food is pretty standard selection of Shanghai cuisine - from the pork soup buns to more speciality items like fried egg whites with red bean paste (both great dishes to order).  Other recommendations include the $4 cold chicken noodles, green onion pancake, chicken/seafood earthenware and spicy beef brisket noodles - choose 4 out of the 6 above recommendations and you have a pretty tasty Shanghainese meal for 3 to 4.  That being said - I haven't yet tried something here that is flat-out bad, so I would say anything on the menu is pretty safe.

I also hear the lunch menu is pretty good for nearby office workers.  All in all - a sure choice for a good meal from Shanghai."}
{"text":"Good place for Chinese foods - yes it's a bit more expensive than other restaurants, but I find they are consistent. Plus they have a nice mixture of food with Northern Dumplings and Shanghai Noodles and Southern comfort foods like Sweet and Sour pork.

Service is above average for a Chinese restaurant, no real complaints.

Parking can be a PITA on the weekend."}
{"text":"Food: Franchise average at best.

Service: Always pay a minimum of 10% tip (even if the service is lacking). They will remind you of that (even if you're a $1.00 short. If you like the bitter taste of harassment at the end of your meal, this place can definitely provide you with that.

Must know some Cantonese because they will address you in their language. I guess every asian is Chinese. 

Atmosphere: Plenty of seating.  Even for Saturday lunch.


Side note: 

Even homeless people have more dignity than to demand 10% tip minimum.  Sure, I've seen them ask for change but never demanding it. Some servers here (not all) will fight for the dollar, even if it results in customers to never return. Short sighted. 

2 Stars because Kitchen staff is not to blame."}
{"text":"Not sure how people gave this place a bad review.  I've been here three times and have not been disappointed one bit.  The first time that I've been here, my aunt, mom, and myself were driving around for food and decided that all the restaurants were packed in this little strip mall on Saturday night...but this one stood out because of its large windows and chic design inside.

We waited for half an hour in the cold entrance and wind up being seated beside the door and this was close to winter.  We were extremely hungry and they didn't give us any utensils aside from chopsticks.  I was just starving that I ate my seafood fried rice with chopsticks.  The food was amazing! My first impression was...great food, NOT overly salty and I even started drinking real tea that night.  After that we were back two more times and I've had their (*SP) pork mushu with pancakes, soup filled dumplings (probably the only thing I hated), beef hu fen, and crispy chicken.  All were incredible! Now that I moved far from the GTA I've been missing this place terribly!"}
{"text":"Still my 'go to' place for some comfort Shanghai food! I prefer this location as it's close to me and it's never super busy! I always stick to my staple dishes - Shanghai dumplings, ja Cheung mien, Shanghai thick noodles, pan fried dumplings and sticky rice."}
{"text":"Normally I won't go to Asian Legend since I live in Scarb and there are tons of more authentic Chinese restaurants around. However I was in the area and needed to eat. Ordered soup dumplings, Cantonese fried noodles and crispy chicken. Soup dumplings were breaking when we tried to lift them from the plate, so not the best. The noodles were average, as expected. The main star was the crispy chicken, really tasty and beyond what I expected. If i were to dine at Asian Legend again, I would order it again. 

Servers were ok, but they mixed up the crispy chicken order as something else (you write your own orders on a piece of paper they give you), and it took longer to come."}
{"text":"Great food but a lil pricey compared to other dim sum places.... Worth every penny though"}
{"text":"Good stable quality Chinese food. Ordered a variety of items: duck, dumplings, fried rice, beef noodle. All were good. The duck was a bit dry but still decent. The beef noodle was the best. Dumplings were also good with a thin wrapping like it should be. 

Service was good, came to change dishes and replenish tea frequently. However, the free dessert was way too sweet. It was the red bean dessert soup (with coconut)."}
{"text":"The food is decent but nothing surprising. 

Environment is good. 

Definitely not authentic northern Chinese food!!!"}
{"text":"Love Asian Legend! This location is much nicer looking than the Spadina location. Food is the same level of quality. This location is definitely better for larger groups. We usually get the hot and sour soup, General Tao Chicken and, just last visit, we got the Spicy Beef Noodles. The Noodles were good but it was rare to come across meat and the portion was kinda of small. Other than that, I definitely recommend it as a great place for Northern Chinese Food! :)"}
{"text":"You can have lots of options here, from dim sum to other Chinese dishes. I have been there many times, every time ordered different dishes, all of them are good."}
{"text":"Snap Judgement:  We love this place!

When the question of where to host an informal celebratory dinner with friends and family came up, the answer was easy, Asian Legend.  Good food.  Nice, clean space.  Lovely private rooms.

From my experience, Asian Legend has been consistently good.  I knew I could count on them to deliver a great dinning experience and set the tones of the rest of the evening.  They were right on.

The entire dinner has been pre-ordered ahead of time [Thank you, you know who you are].  So when the entourage arrived and was seated, the staff brought out each course without a hitch.

One dish that stood out was the Peking Duck.  It was Peking-Delicious!  The crispy skin and tender meat were so good.  It looked so tasty that one of our vegetarian guests ALMOST jumped off the wagon to join in!  Thumbs up from all around the table.

The lobster dishes with Szechuan and Ginger & Green Onion sauce were also a hit.  They were freshly and properly prepared.  Our dad didn't say a word after the lobster dishes arrived.  You wonder why?  Both dishes stayed right in front of him most of the time.

We love and appreciate that the meals came out fresh and hot from the kitchen like they should.  And in terms of tastiness, you know that everything must be mouthwatering good, when there are no photos attached to this review.  No time for snapping photos when you are dinning with my group of people.  You snooze, you lose!

Overall, I could not ask for a more fun and delightful evening at Asian Legend.  Even the staff, who usually look stern, cracked smiles...or was it the promise of the automatic gratuity that brought out those bright smiles?"}
{"text":"Want to feel like a celebrity in a crowded Chinese restaurant?  Bring a 6'3\" West Indian man with long dreadlocks and his beautiful wife to dinner with you.  Not only will everyone stare at your table, you'll get extra attentiveness from staff as well (curiosity, perhaps?).

Steamed Shrimp Dumplings were average for us.

Rolled Onion Pancake With Sliced Beef, our friend loved this one.  I have a feeling that she would return for more.  (Personally, I could inhale 2-3 of these easily.)

Stir Fried Ho Fun with Beef.  One of our favorites, we love the smokey flavor in noodles.  It reminds me of Pad See-Eew.

Our friends ordered Kung Pao Shrimp.  The tall fella cleaned the entire plate (while the entire Asian crowd watching in awe).

Fish Filet with Chili Sauce was a hit!  Each fish filet was well seasoned with garlic and the sauce, extremely flavorful.  Despite the 3 Chili spicy rating, this dish was packed with the right amount of heat.

Sautéed Snow Pea Shoots with King Mushroom was delicious.  

\"Sorry to interrupt, but, this is REALLY good, guys,\" it was the first time our super tall \"celebrity\" friend raved about  food at the beginning of the meal!  And that pretty much summed up our experience."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and veggies with mango sauce. A different dish than usual, but very good. Ordered shumai from dim sum menu. Biggest shumai I've ever seen. This is probably the best Chinese food on Dundas."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for a simple noodle dish .. asked servers 3 times to check on its status. No one ever came back to let us know what was happening and when the dish finally arrived it was cold noodles slopped on top of a gooey peanut sauce.  Other food (soupy noodles, duck tongues and deep fried tofu) was bland and disappointing."}
{"text":"The environment is the best among the eight, and the tastes are at par. So I'd go to this one for sure if I want to have northern foods. But normally I prefer Southern foods. I can't name any particular dish here that I can't leave without. They ae ok and the price is fair."}
{"text":"I should have checked out the stars before sitting down and ordering. This is the first time o the Asian Legend franchise and I can say I was disappointed. I ordered the Siu Long Bao which is the quintessential Northern Chinese dish. Unfortunately I wasn't able to introduce my son to my Chinese heritage because it never arrived. By the time I noticed they stopped bringing dishes to our table, it was too late. He was full and I wasn't going to eat all 6 by myself. The food was actually not salty, but underwhelming. I expected a lot more flavour for the price. Probably won't come back to this location but might try the others as I'm searching for the Siu Long Bao that I remember from my youth."}
{"text":"I discovered this gem for I live across the street from Art Gallery of Ontario.  The soup dumplings are to die for.  The place is modern and clean.  The service could be improved."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant, food is great but a bit noisy, the staff tried hard to please our group of ten and genuinely met our expectation. We had a great time there and again, food was good."}

Asian Legend seems to be one of the less reviewed Chinese restaurants located in Chinatown. Which is surprising because they serve all different types of Chinese food starting from your foodcourt style, hand made dumplings to Shanghainese chicken. This restaurant seems to be fairly new and is managed by younger generations of Chinese assuming from the interior and the restaurant layout. There are 2 floors and the restaurant is very clean

Both times I visited, I sat upstairs and the lighting seems to be an odd issue. Seats closer to the store front has excellent lighting cause of the huge window upfront, but as you walk more into the restaurant, it gets super dark because the ceiling 'lamps' they have are very dim.

They have a paper menu system so you basically write down the number from the menu depending on what you want. This system is convenient because the restaurant is so busy they can't spare time to wait for you as you flip through the pages plus you can take your time browsing the menu.

First thing I noticed even before I got my food is that they actually have very good service. They actually smile at you and are fast and efficient at same time. YAY for friendly asian restaurants found in Chinatown! 

Ordered: DRUNKEN CHICKEN SOAKED IN LIQUOR 2/5
*#33 on the menu and a plate for $6.95
*Usually when I order drunken chicken, they are actual chicken pieces with some bone inside
*This one was in round pieces without any bone
*This is a cold chicken dish and you can def smell and taste the liquor
*Drunken chicken usually has this bright yellow skin outside due to the liquor but there was no skin
*I had this with hot sauce, which isn't a good thing in this case because good drunken chicken should be seasoned enough on it's own
*This was almost a little too mushy
*I prefer it done the right way, just regular chicken pieces on bone with the skin (the meat is chewier)

Ordered: SAUTEED SNOWPEA SHOOTS WITH GARLIC 3/5
*#102A on the menu and a large plate for $11.95
*This is a very big dish even for a vegetable
*Overall it had good garlic flavor but it was over cooked and too soft
Ordered: Steamed Shumai with Shrimp & Pork 3/5
*#7 on the menu and 6 pieces for $5.95
*This is the Shanghainese style (not the usual ShuMai you get at DimSum)
*There were lots of seafood inside the ShuMai
*Shredded shrimp and crab meat on top
*Good to share between 3 people
*It was kind of mushy inside and there was no texture
*Tasted good overall but would be better if I could tell whatever was inside

Ordered: STEAMED SOUP DUMPLINGS WITH GROUND PORK 3.5/5
*#3 on the menu for $5.95
*I've had many soup dumplings at different locations but this one had the most soup inside
*It has very thin skin so be careful when you pick it up
*It comes really really hot right out of the steamer
*Vinegar dip could be stronger

Ordered: HOUSE SPECIAL STIR-FRIED NOODLES W/ BBQ PORK & SHRIMP 5/5
*#131 on the menu for $9.95
*Hand made noodles with sweet soy sauce 
*Very big portion (can be shared between 2)
*Noodle is thick but super chewy
*Lots of ingredients (pork, squid, shrimp, mushroom, carrot, bean sprouts, green onion, cabbage)
*This was really filling but so delicious
*I would get this dish again for sure!!

Summary: Overall I enjoyed all the dishes I ordered at the restaurant, especially the House Special Fried Noodles. The noodles were so chewy and it comes with seafood, meat and veggies. After my first visit, I went back the second time to try their noodle in soup and eggplant dish and they were both really good. I would go back to this place just for their stir fried noodles alone. This is a good find in Chinatown considering it's location, food, service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. The good - dumplings, fried rice, noodles, and veggies. The bad - salt and pepper fried pork (too salty) Service is mediocre. Washrooms are confusing (lady entered men's room accidentally)"}
{"text":"Great food and service.
Very clean."}
{"text":"I wish I lived in the area.

THE FOOD
- \"Green beans with dried shrimp\" was the best I've ever had. My son said \"These are awesome and I dont even like green beans\", about $13
- \"Mixed seafood with vegetables\" also outstanding. The shrimp were very flavourful without being fishy, the squid were ultratender and the peas were very sweet and crisp. ~$17
- \"Sirloin with chinese brocolli\" also made outstandingly well. ~$10

THE SERVICE
Very fast, and quite efficient.

THE ATMOSPHERE
A repurposed Swiss Chalet, with upscale furnishings and finishes. Very nicely done.

SUMMARY
I wish I could come more often."}
{"text":"The Asian Legend chain restaurants are not all created equal. This one is slow and not as flavorful as the Asian Legend on Steeles, east of the DVP. That Asian Legend convinced me to buy their discount card because I knew I would be coming back again and again. The Asian Legend downtown was a once only and I will not return.

We had Dong Po pork - the broccoli was raw and the Dong Po pork meat itself was not thoroughly heated - warm on the outside and cold on the inside

The other 2 dishes were forgettable. 

They charged us for items we did not order, and forgot to bring the rice until we asked 3 times and were almost finished our meal."}
{"text":"Fast service, cheap and good. I can't ask for more. Free tea too! Great for the winter.
I liked the onion pancake and the spicy shredded pork. They didn't give fortune cookies with the bill, but I asked if they had some and they did...although they are deemed authentic I am glad they still cater to people like me!"}
{"text":"It is probably the most successful chain of Chinese restaurants in the GTA area. 

But once a upon time, Asian Legend used to be....

Well - really it was food court oddity on north side of Dundas, west of Spadina in a dingy place I think was called Hong Kong City?  It moved to its current location and was pretty much one of the only places to get good inexpensive Northern Chinese food.  Was the best place to just get a few pan-fried dumplings, a fried salty donut and a bowl of hot soy milk in relative peace at any given time.  Then the renovation happened.  Then the food became more expensive (on average each dish was at least $1-$2 more), the service worse, and I could never get a seat.  

If you regularly patronize Asian restaurants whatsoever, you'll notice this phenomena happen to genuinely good restaurants that are now being run by second generation MBA graduate children of the owners.  Please accuse me of being bitter of its success and the resulting effect being that I can't get a seat at the more expensive, worst tasting restaurant, that I helped keep afloat for 10+ yrs., because I am.  In fact, my friends know exactly I why mean, when I say a restaurant has been \"Legended\".  

But certainly some credit is due - they still make some decent dumplings and have standard good Northern dishes.  Avoid all pan-Asian items (their valiant attempt to capture some of that Spring Rolls crowd) - and stick with the Chinese food.  Does anybody really think that mango grows in Northern China?  I think they are definitely overextending here.  Certainly something has to be said for the restaurant raising the standard of cleanliness and presentation - kudos.

[Totally irrelevant observation: what's with their actual dishes and cutlery - I don't know any Chinese people who use square dishes with FOUR sides, I wonder who they're catering to?   Hint: It's not your friendly neighbourhood Chinaman!]

Definitely a legendary story of expanding your market and brilliant management, but as a food story, not so much."}
{"text":"Prices rather high, customer service  not amazing (possibly due to language barrier), food quality quite decent.

I went to this venue with a few friends on Chinese New Year's eve, so I was expecting to possibly have slower service due to less people being at work during their holiday.

We placed our order, and every single one of our meals came staggered, so we were unable to eat at the same time.

Also, I placed one order for myself and another plate \"to go\" for m'lady. They ended up giving me 2 plates of what I ordered for m'lady, instead of giving me what I originally ordered. This mess-up was likely due to a language barrier, and also partially my own fault as I mentioned my order change to another server, an not the one who originally took our order (even though the one who originally took our order came back and confirmed, and I tried my best telling him I still wanted the original plate as well as the other plate to go). They offered to correct this, however they said it would take at least another 40 minutes, and considering we had to wait around 20 minutes for each plate to arrive for each person, I decided to keep my order as-is. They ended up giving me a free rice to compensate, which I feel wasn't enough to win me over as a customer.

So all-in-all, I wouldn't return to this venue, considering it seemed to be impossible for a party of 4 adults and 1 child to eat together at the same time."}
{"text":"I was expecting more from this restaurant because it came so highly rated.  There is almost always a line to get in and the restaurant is always busy, but I am not sure what all the hype is about.

 The hot and sour soup is good, not the best. The   Deep Fried Tofu with Garlic Sauce and Shrimp & Pork Wonton in Spicy Peanut were very tasty. All dishes served with a deep fried breaded  chicken like General Tao or Kung Pao Chicken are made out of such thinly tiny shredded chicken pieces that you think you are eating batter and sauce, was very disappointing. The Singaporean Style Fried Vermicelli with Shrimps, BBQ Pork & Egg was my favorite dish.

 The service in this restaurant is service if you can get somebody's attention, good luck with that."}
{"text":"Asian legend always delivers. The food is fresh! Delicious and the service is excellent. Our favourite Chinese restaurant. We love the soup dumplings, the Shanghai noodles and chow mein are the  best. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food that's great quality, and definitely reasonable prices, although more expensive than many Asian restaurants.

I've never ordered anything there I didn't like. They have a 10% off discount card that you can buy if you intend to go frequently or with big groups.

Busy on the weekends, so either book ahead or plan to wait a little before you can get a table. Definitely worth the wait, though."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and was not disappointed.

Portions were bigger than i expected, ended up ordering way too much for 2 ppl but finished everything anyways because it was THAT good.

The food came fast and was decently fresh - dimsum was steaming hot, but our cold noodles were stuck together (maybe left out too long?).

I liked how their menu included pictures so none chinese folks can have a glimps of what some of the dishes look like (ones we got loomed identical to the photos)

I took one star away due to their poor service. Our server sat us down, took my order paper, and was nvr seen again. Though it was a busy night it.does not excuse them throwing down our menus and bill.

Pros: great food, lots of variety of dish

Cons: loudness of clanging utensil at the back & lack of good service.

Would recommend to friends"}
{"text":"Folks, 

I grew up with some of the best food in San Francisco's Chinatown and this place isn't even authentic, its just plain gross! I ordered out through a resto delivery service and had to get replacement food brought in for the food quality.

The dumplings were watery and had at least one inch of oil floating at the top. We stirred up the dish and tasted it which tasted like sandpaper. The texture and flavor of the meat stuffing was like none I have ever tasted. I'm not sure what animal meat the used, but it was defiantly something new for my pallet.

The General Tao Chicken had a decent sauce until you bit into the meat. It was dark meat with the tendons acting like rubber bands as if the chicken was thrown straight into the deep fryer after being plucked and slaughtered.

The spring rolls (which were supposed to have chicken) didn't have any meat in it. I guess they forgot.

The noodle dish was ok, but its hard to ruin veggies, noodles and soy sauce fried in a wok.

My advice; unless you have a free coupon stay FAR away!"}
{"text":"This location just opened.  

Standard Asian Legend ambiance (clean, and a bit dark).

Food is great.  This restaurant specializes in Northern Chinese or Szechuan dishes, so its not quite a good comparison to compare it to Congee Queen / Wong / Time.  They are both good in their unique ways.

Get the Siu Long Bau (Pork Soup Dumplings) for sure, but I don't think I've had a dish i didn't like here.  Lots of selection, so don't be afraid to try a few things you don't normally have. You just might like it!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stairs, I would. Avoid during special occasions. I took my family here for father's day dinner today. The service was beyond terrible. I made a reservation for 6:30. When I arrived at 6:30, I had to wait another 25 minutes. We were understanding since it's father's day. 

When I was finally seated, we ordered lots of food. When all my food arrived, I was in the middle of chewing when they asked me if I wanted to pack the rest of my food up. We were here for about an hour and they asked me if I can pay my bill three times. It's not like I was eating a cheap meal. It was $185 for the four of us. This was one of my dad's favourite restaurants. Honestly, I enjoyed taking my family here before, but after this experience I won't be coming back. The managers/owners should think about their business practice."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean, service was good, food was hit and miss. We ordered soup dumpling (good but I had better), shrimp dumpling (good), rolled onion pancake (not impressed), shanghai noodles (good but less meat than expected), and general tao's chicken (awful). The problem with general tao's chicken was that there was no chicken. It was 80% batter; and who knows how old the chicken was, because whatever little piece I could find, it was dry. It was awfully sweet and lacking in complex flavor that it should have. 

I complained to the waiter, who checked with kitchen staff and then explained to me that someone new in the kitchen probably wasn't making it right. And the waiter offered us a free desert as an alternative. We did not want any desert so then the waiter offered the VIP discount.  Sounded nice but it was only worth $4 on a terrible $12 dish that was not edible. Despite their efforts, I was deeply disappointed. I will not return to this place."}
{"text":"Was not impressed by the Dim Sum here. I usually go to Chinatown downtown but wanted to give this restaurant a try as I just moved to the area. Not as good a selection as downtown Dim Sum places and our steam shrimp balls were undercooked - the shrimp inside was cold and still grey. Will probably just make the trek downtown from now on."}
{"text":"I visited this place with friends. It was Friday evening and it got pretty busy. We were seated at the very back with very little view of the restaurant and definitely fewer visits by the servers.
The food seemed to be made hastily, and if not, certainly delivered so, because the dumplings were all stuck together in one place. In particular, Mapo tofu and cantonese chao mein lacked flavour. We didn't come for a cheap meal, but the quality of food nor service met our expectation. We did get the red bean soup in the end which was nice, but the overall experience wasn't great. To sum up, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was absolutely terrible. The water took forever to come, the food took forever to come, I had to ask the bill for 3 times before it would come. I didn't end up tipping them and they stopped me as I walked out to remind me \"I'm not a special client and it is mandatory to tip.\" I refused and their last words were \"Don't ever come again.\" 

Never have I ever experienced such rude behaviors from anyone in my life. It is their responsibility to make sure customers are satisfied throughout the entire meal, and if the customers are happy, then they will tip depending on their preferences! 

This legendary move to curse the customer that they are not special is for sure the most effective way to persuade them to tip. 

Good job Asian Legend(s). Even though your food may be decent, but I am for sure never ever coming back again. Just as you wish."}
{"text":"I really like their moo shu pork and sticky rice with donut and shredded pork. I came in a Sunday with a friend and returned with my family a couple days later...proves how much I enjoyed their food. Upon return we got the assorted platter for $48. It was not good nor worth even $4-$8. The green onion pancake with beef is nice too. The snow pea shoots with prince mushroom had a nice accompanying sauce. We all fought over the fried green beans they were finger/plate licking good"}
{"text":"You're given the task to make dinner plans for all your friends. No one has particular preferences and as usual, not voicing their opinions - so it defaults to Asian Legend. Their menu caters to most people's palettes, the clean decor and decent service definitely helps in securing it as a \"safe\" restaurant to hold a gathering.  

Pros:
The decor of most Asian Legend restaurants are quite nice, with the nicest one being in Scarborough (near Sheppard and Brimley). The restaurant are usually spacious and can accommodate a big group. This particular North York location is rather cramped though. The prices of each dish is reasonable with generous portions and there is consistent food quality across the chain. The Fried Dough Ball with Red Bean paste dessert they have is rather difficult to find in Toronto, so I would give it a try if you've never had it before! It's made of lightly deep fried egg whites with red bean paste in the center, sprinkled with sugar. 

Cons:
I find that each dish in the restaurant is only mediocre. None of the dishes are done exceptionally well but at least the level of quality is consistent across the menu. Some popular items on the menu such as shanghai soup dumplings, beef noodle soup are much better at other restaurants. 

Personally, I try to stay away from Asian Legend but I do come here once in a while to please the Asian Legend fan club out there =)"}
{"text":"Hit or miss everytime you dine here. Each time we come here, the food will be either delicious or below average with poor seasoned dishes.

They have a good selection on their menu and that's about it."}
{"text":"It's a confused place really. They don't know if they are delivery Chinese with 183 items on the menu! Or a sit down place with HUGE seating with a decently upmarket decor. They have cheap kettles and paper napkins in a huge place with high ceilings which would mean you have a better place.

Now to the food, I had 6A, 7 and 2..well that's what you write on a piece of paper with pencil and you get your order. Well let me tell you-stay away from the soup filled dried scallops and pork dumplings (2). Thought since it's so heavily advertised it would be special..it's not! Then the beef filled onion pancakes are tooo heavy, so stay away. Then the pan fried chicken hotstrips, Tasted ok but too oily. I won't ever come here again. Toronto has disappointed me yet again in food, Atlanta rules!"}
{"text":"I find that their food is not as good as before. Every dish we ordered was so salty and greasy. A little sloppy in my opinion. Don't think I'll be coming back for a while."}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food presentation. 
The waiters gave me a dish I did not order which was the green Xiao long bao, which didn't even look like a Xiao long bao haha. Anyways, they tried making me pay for it and I clearly did not order it. After a long time trying to make me pay for it  (while I was eating) they checked the order sheet and realized that I didn't order it. They then took away the plate. 
Yea, go to the Sheppard location.

I posted a picture of this \"green Xiao long bao\" I no longer trust green Xiao long Bao cause this a green wo teep. Bruh."}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing special. 
The taste was more blend i don't know i thought after reading the reviews it will be a good place but I didn't like the food flavors. 
We ordered a lot of food.
After waiting so long that someone's gonna pick up our order.
To this counts noodle with beef, crispy fried noodles, veggies and dumplings and beef pancake.
Actually I liked the beef pancake and the dumplings.
When we were finished we ordered the bill. 
A lady came with the takeout boxes and then the drama starts I don't know the lady was packing the food and she throws angry the empty plate on the table. 
She got so upset first I thought I gave here to less tip and then I was like no it can't be. 
So she was so angry she went to the other waiters and keep on pointing to our table and she was like angry like no tomorrow. 
I was literally shocked what happen to her.  
Trying to ask but well she didn't speak English.
So I ignored them all of them. 
I don't know maybe she got mad that I couldn't finish my food.
So my advice for this place is nothing special. If you want some waiter getting angry at you for no reason sure go ahead. This place is not recommended from my side."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese chain restaurants in Toronto. They specialize in Northern Chinese, but have a pretty diverse menu. I like their soup dumplings (xiao long bao), their beef noodle soup, sauteed green beans and fish fillet with wine essence. 

They are pretty consistent and that's what keeps bringing me back. Other places may have better individual dishes, but overall Asian Legend delivers. I have yet to order something that I disliked. The service is usually efficient, the ambiance is modern and the restaurant is physically clean. All these things make Asian Legend an enjoyable dining experience. It's one of my Toronto staples."}
{"text":"And once again, for our weekly fam dinners, this Asian Legend location delivers all our needs: great food, efficient service, and relatively inexpensive considering the amount of dishes ordered. Yesterday, we had a group of 8 and we had:

1 large Hot and Sour Soup
1 large Fish Maw soup with white egg drop
Fried tofu - crispy on the outside, and warm juicy on the inside. This dish is extra yum due to the garlic bits
Onion pancake
Pork dumpling 2 orders
1 vegetable dumpling
1 plain white bun with condensed milk
Fried chicken wings and legs (6 pieces)
Assorted vegetables with vermicelli noodle in soup. This is a great dish that is in a big clay pot with tons of crunchy Napa cabbage and extra soup. A great meal all in itself!
Baby Bak Choy with Enoki mushrooms
Tofu with steamed shrimp and peas
1 steamed fish with vermicelli noodles. This fish was slightly fried which made it tastier. Sometimes steamed fish has a fishy taste - however, if its fried, there is lots of flavour.

Needles to say, we were very hungry which is why we ordered everything and anything. However, the total came out to be $127!! We have the discount card which is 10& off the bill so $12 bucks off already. The discount card can be bought for $20 and is valid for one year.

They also gave free dessert which was the signature Chinese soup paste dessert (green bean). Not my fancy but you cannot argue with free. Our family prefers this Asian Legend location out of all the ones currently open and it is also close to certain members of the fam.

If you are looking for good eats for a large group, but without spending too much, let this Asian Legend location be your next destination!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years, it was a pleasant dining experience this time. They did not skimp on the Peking Duck. The second course to the PD was also well made (lettuce wrap with duck). The crab soup dumplings were average. All in all, I would definitely dine there again whenever I'm craving Peking Duck."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here it's 70 bucks.  Whatever I order, no matter what amount of food, even if it's completely different from the last time I always end up paying 70.

This Asian Legend has become my \"Let's catch up but I don't want to go far\" restaurant.  I entertained at least 6 people in the last two years here, just because I was in no shape wanting to leave the area.  It's a causal enough establishment to accomplish this, and just upscale enough to make my friends feel comfortable.  Out of every Asian Legend in Toronto, this is the best.  This plaza is Blessed wit successful restaurants.  

The décor is a hundred shades of brown with bright but also amber lighting, there are square and round tables.  Semi-sectioned off area, and two main dining spaces split between by..not much.  Ideal for groups of six. 
The biggest attraction here is all day dim sum!  Yeah baby, all day dim sum and it tastes fresh from morning to afternoon to late night.  It's more expensive, but there are no other places to go when that craving hits you 10 O'clock at night.  
Must try items include; Braised Pork Bellies, chicken soup, crab buns...and I forget the rest.  The food is on another level from all the other locations, and the service is attentive.  Not saying anything in particular, but this restaurant is primarily serviced by men, and they run a tight ship.  Happy Women's Day! =D

I've had my Korean, Indian, Russian, Chinese and 'Other Asian' friends here and they were all impressed by the food.  But I'd like to think that it's my infinite wisdom with the selection that only I can bring to the table.  I know what they'll eat, and we order all kinds!

70 Bucks though!!..=["}
{"text":"So slow service so greedy for tips. Food was ok. Other locations are better tbh. Would not recommend. Waiters so so slow. This places needs to hire more waiters."}
{"text":"This by far is my fave Asian Legend - it doesn't have the typical hustle-bustle-Chinese-restaurant feel. Service is excellent.

Since AL is a chain, you're guaranteed all the usual fan fare of dumplings, soup, fried rice, noodles, etc... All great, a bit greasy, and always a crowd pleaser at crowd please prices!

Always great with big groups and wallet friendly. I think this is one of the newer locations."}
{"text":"Saturday of Good friday weekend, this place opened a little after 10:30AM

Ordered the Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Carb meat & Pork and Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Dried Scallops, Pork & Luffa. They weren't that good as it wasn't that fresh."}
{"text":"You know what you're walking into when you go to Asian Legend - good Chinese fix with all the staples: Xiao Long Bao's, fried turnip cake, Dun Dun noodles, eggplant dishes, and the likes of fried rice and noodles. This isn't wow cuisine, but it's not that bad either!

I like this location as it's close to home, and the times we went, it's never busy. Service is efficient and quick.

I always feel heavy and full after an Asian Legend outing as the food is simply too good to pass up. Decent price. Great for large groups."}
{"text":"My family comes here often for our weekly dinners; It's efficient and food relatively good. Sometimes, the place is packed by 6pm, other times, we can get a nice, round table by the window.

Our go to dishes are of course the dumplings, but we also love getting Fried Rice, Fried Tofu with lots of Garlic, White Bread with condensed milk to dip, Fried noodles and soup. As you can tell, not the healthiest of meals with everything being fried, but YOLO.

Overall, a decent place to grab grub. Service is quick. Seating gets a bit cramped and they have 2 large party rooms. As with all Asian Legend restaurants, good place for big groups. 

FYI - Don't forget to use your discount card here!"}
{"text":"Modern looking and nice interior but the food lacking in any Ooomph.

Tables felt too close to each other, almost communal such is the proximity of the people dining next to me and my friend.

We ordered for appetizers the shrimp dumplings and garlic fried tofu.

The dumplings (not being a fan of dim sum) were okay but the portion was good value I think. The tofu was gooey, not sure if it is supposed to be like that since I am a tofu virgin. The garlic flavouring and sauce was nice and only the outside of the tofu was fried so therefore the inside was like runny eggs. Not great at all.

For mains I ordered the spicy beef dish and my friend ordered sweet and sour chicken. The portions were big! For a $10 dish I was unable to finish it and took the rest home with me. The same for my friend. 

The beef dish had a kick to it, but the beef was not over cooked, and dry. The sweet and sour chicken was nicer and the one serving of rice we ordered with it was also not great. Again too sticky and moist for my liking. 

So for both of us the total bill was around $35 which was reasonable but I have eaten much nicer food for much cheaper in other restaurants.

No where near the best experience I have had in an Asian restaurant so totally did not make the legendary status for my taste buds."}
{"text":"Came here with a fairly large group of people with 4 kids under the age of 2 but over the age of 1 and one newborn ...

We came specifically for the peking duck since we heard from a friend that it was quite tasty here.  The peking duck that is served here is simply the duck dish with the wraps - there is no soup or fried rice/ noodle dish that has often accompanied \"peking duck\" when I have ordered it at other restaurants.  

So, the duck itself is quite good ... not the best that I've tasted and it didn't blow my husband's socks off as he had hoped ... but it wasn't bad.

We also ordered some sort of green onion beef pancake wrapped in foil ... it was okay ... not my favourite ... a little on the salty side.

We ordered another whack load of dishes that I can't remember.  We ordered so much that night - an insane amount of food.  

It was all fairly good but it really didn't wow me like I had hoped.

And as for the service ... the servers seemed a little/ hella annoyed at us.  We had 4 kids who were a little noisy and a little rambunctious and sometimes a little naughty :(  And I can see how the servers could be annoyed but we were trying to control them ... we really were...  

Its a nice looking modern restaurant that is very easy to miss if you are just walking by.  

Decor is sleek and very trendy looking.

I'd suggest making reservations since I did see quite a few people waiting for tables."}
{"text":"Please note that this review is for DELIVERY FROM ORDER-IT.CA ONLY

As I ordered delivery, the only really relevant aspect of this review is for the food. When I saw the delivery menu, I was slightly disappointed, as a number of the dishes that I had tried in the restaurant were not available for delivery. In retrospect, it may be a good thing that some of the items are not available, as soupy shanhainese dumplings likely wouldn`t have fared as well in delivery.

Our order included chicken dumplings, red bean pancakes, green onion pancakes, mu shu pork,  sweet and sour fish,and  apple juice (I think it might have been fresh squeezed!). The chicken dumplings were moist, and the 'skin' still surprisingly soft, definately not half bad for delivery. I would otherwise comment on the mu shu pork and the sweet and sour fish. The flavour and texture of the mu shu pork was true to its roots, albeit slightly oily (which, I suppose, is also authentic), but the pancakes included were too few for the size of the dish and had started to dry out by the time the arrived. So far, not bad, but the real disappointment  was the sweet and sour fish. To be honest, I'm not sure what the dish is supposed to taste like, but what we received was nothing close to what expected. The dish came as 2 deep fried fish filets, and a separate container filled with an obscene amount of what I would liken to bad candian-chinese restaurant lemon-chicken sauce. The flavour of the fish 
was bland, and the sauce very artificial. 

Overall, I give my experience a 3/5, which I think could have been a 3.7 if I had eaten at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have certain expectations of a Chinese restaurant, and Asian Legend scratches all those itches. Brusque yet prompt service, screaming-hot tea, and food that shows up fresh from the kitchen in an oh-how-did-I-order-this-much pile in the middle of the table.

Catching up with some old friends, we all had to order our favorites and they were all executed well. Multiple dumplings, a number of veggie dishes, fried chicken, spicy tofu, fried rice and noodles; everything was hot and flavorful. 

I'm sure there are local family places that might execute one or the other dish better, but for the variety on offer here everything hit the right notes to make the dish what you expect. Chinese food is always a nostalgia trip for me, so I'd like to thank this spot for making that happen."}
{"text":"I avoided Asian Legend because it is a chain and the ratings didn't seem great. My mistake. It's actually excellent. Service is good, clean with nice decor and above all really great food. It is a little pricier than smaller places but not by much. Excellent dumplings. Stand out spicy stir fried pork."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner with my boyfriend and we got the set dinner for two which included hot & sour soup, two spring rolls, general tao chicken, chinese brocolli, and chicken fried rice to share. This was a lot for two people so there was a good leftover portion to take home. I would say it easily could have fed four people. He loves hot & sour soup and always gets it when we go to an Asian restaurant and he gave it a 6/10. I love general tao chicken, it's my staple for Asian restaurants and I gave it an 8.5/10. I also really enjoyed the chicken fried rice, which I don't usually care for at other Chinese restaurants so I never order it. Overall all of the food was good and very tasty. We would definitely come back to explore more of their menu."}
{"text":"Being a lifelong fan of Northern Chinese food (think heartier fare, lot more dumplings and wheat noodles than Cantonese) and having been to the very first Asian Legend at Woodbine Square near the turn of century - I have to say this place has been steadily declining in quality while increasing in price points. I think it's riding coattails of being  the default choice for downtown Chinese food without the \"hole in the wall\" decor.

Not sure why no Chinese resto (Cantonese or Northern) can make a go of it DT while there is so much quality in RH and Markham. AL crab and pork soup dumplings barely have any crab in them and the beef stuffed in onion pancake has beef brisket that is super dry - without the long marinade in star anise and other spices that used to make this dish memorable. I feel AL flavors have become very one note. It feels they are making shortcuts in prep. 

Honestly, AL is probably pretty good vs typical North American Chinese fare but the bar is high here as Toronto has some of the best Chinese food on the continent (Vancouver excepted). Prob it's all around Highway 7. For those willing to make the trek 3-6-9 at Kennedy/Highway 7 serves this type of cuisine but heads and tails more tasty. Or if you really want to taste what epic soup-filled dumplings should taste like try the Ding Tai Fung chain (offshoot of Taiwan's main store) in California. The Ding Tai Fung in Markham/RH just rip-offs the name and has no affiliation with the real deal."}
{"text":"From the inside you would never know that you were in Chinatown..really sleek and minimal.  As you've read...you write your order down on a piece of paper and voila your food arrives promptly.

I won't go into great detail about the food except to say that it was all excellent.  We had the soup dumplings with pork, scallops, and few other ingredients that I can't remember at the moment.  My wife had the crispy noodles with vegetables.  We're really sad that we don't have a place like this back home...great food at a good value."}
{"text":"Good: The menu had a pretty large variety of dishes from traditional northern Chinese breakfast foods (onion pancake, shao long bao, etc) to some pretty decent main dishes.  The restaurant is pretty non-Asian friendly because of the menu being in Chinese and English and all the employees being able to speak English.

Bad: The price was higher than most in Chinatown and the dishes were not 100% authentic tasting but good enough."}
{"text":"Asian Legend? What the what? Beyond the kooky name, this place is great! Authentic regional dishes in a nice-for-Chinatown setting.  If you're a spice hound, try #59A - Chongqing spicy chicken. The Sichuan peppercorns give it an extra numbing kick!  And if you order noodles, definitely upgrade to the handmade noodles for $1 more. 

Note: Asian Legend has multiple locations in the GTA, unfortunately the downtown location doesn't offer delivery."}
{"text":"Food 2/5 (60% of final grade)
The food was quite standard of Chinese restaurants, with nothing special to be really noted. My friend and I ordered the chili-oil fish, beef pancakes, a soup, cumin beef, and also chili-oil innard slices. The beef pancakes were the highlight of our meal, and even that wasn't anything special. Asian Legend's cooking isn't much of a culinary experience-- nothing special about its taste. The chili-oil fish was too thick, and not impressive in its spice level. The cumin beef didn't even taste like cumin, I don't even remember what the soup tasted like, because it was so bland, and the innard slices were unimpressive as well. 

Ambiance 3/5 (10% of final grade)
The ambiance was actually quite nice for a Chinese establishment... if the bowls and cups weren't sorta still dirty. It was obvious that they spent some money on the interior decoration, and the place itself wasn't dirty (though it wasn't particularly clean either). All in all, I would have given the interior a 4 for trying, but it wasn't clean, so I'm giving it a 3.

Service 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
We walked in and weren't even greeted for a seat until we walked right up to the cashier. Then we were greeted by a lady who obviously had better things to do than tend to her customers. The staff were not attentive, and we had to wave them over to get our order down. I only gave them a 2.5 because at the end of the day they still brought us our food... 

Cost 2/5 (10% of final grade)
For what it was, it was on the pricier side. I would much prefer spending the same amount for better food at a shadier Chinese place. 

Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade)
Not my favourite place.

Final Grade = 39/100 =  2 Stars

TLDR:  If you're looking for somewhere to bring your Caucasian friend, then this might be the place, since they might not know what good Chinese food taste like, and prefer a bit more of an ambiance to their meal. Don't bring your Chinese friends here though -- they're better off eating better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food, and I have eaten it in many places, including renowned restaurants in NYC when I once lived there, and Asian Legend's dim sum is as good as any I have ever had.  Another plus is that the decor is very nice as well.  If I lived in Toronto, this place would get a lot of my money.

Make sure to try the beef wrapped in a scallion pancake.  It was absolutely amazing.  The soup dumplings were great as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service and selection. I come here because I know I can always find parking and can count on the quality of food. It's never an issue getting seated, unlike their other locations which is not because of the quality of food, but more to the remote location, which works in my favour."}
{"text":"Simply an amazing experience and very delicious food! I came here with my mom for a dim sum brunch. It was my first dim sum experience but I can't imagine anything better than this. Beautiful dining ambience and decor with wonderful high ceilings; more upscale than the dim sum dining establishments my mom has been to before. The service we received was decent and the wait staff were courteous enough so we felt comfortable and welcome. Our orders came out quickly and everything was hot, fresh and full of  mouth-watering flavour! We ordered the Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Pork (6), Pan Fried Pork Dumplings (4), Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef, Glutinous Rice Roll (Pork Floss and Sugar) and Sesame Biscuit Stuffed with Sliced Beef and for dessert (like we had any more room but we both have sweet tooths), Crispy Fried Banana with Toffee Honey (8). We SAVOURED EVERY LAST MORSEL and were stuffed and satisfied afterward. Loved the tea they give you to cleanse your palate before the meal and between bites of yummy dim sum heaven. Can't wait to dine here again- next time I'm bringing my husband and the rest of the fam for a feast! This is definitely my choice dim sum restaurant in Scarborough, I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their service. The employees work fast and they check your table's teapot every 5 minutes to see if they have to refill it with hot water. The employees work very quickly and efficiently. They have specific employees that serve out the food only which is a much more efficient way to operate in my point of view. 

I mainly come here for lunch so I don't order the big set dinners. My party usually orders the deep fried tofu in spicy chili sauce, beef brisket spicy noodles in soup, xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings) and another noodle dish.

They are pretty consistent with the food quality. Sometimes the deep fried tofu comes out colder than usual but nothing more worth mentioning. Overall, this location of the franchise is solid."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see this location expand to Vaughan. I tried this place multiple times and found the quality better when the place is busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"We went for new year eve dinner.  The staff was wonderful genuinely happy to have you there.  The wait time was great.  I don't want my food to come out too fast... The food is very fresh.  seasoned lightly but very flavourful.  my tummy felt soo good after the huge meal that night.  (not weighed down feeling)  Excellent Staff and food Oh yes and wine options were awesome.  Price is cheap  I was expecting our meal to cost way more.  I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for many years and are never disappointed. We always order two plates of the moo shu pork because it is our absolute favourite. Great atmosphere, good prices and quality food. It is usually busy but we never have to wait too long. It is a good place to go with a large group so you can order a variety of plates and share."}
{"text":"Went there this weekend on Sunday of labour day weekend. It was very busy but we got sat immediately.
This place has a great system if you are aware of it. 
First, you write down your order on the paper they give then on the table they have a pager system, you press the order bottom and someone comes. 
The food came within a reasonable amount of time. Service was good for us.
Our order, hot and sour soup- family loved
Steamed shrimp dumplings - loved
Pork steamed dumplings -loved
Green onion pancakes- little greasy but still good
Beef with Chinese broccoli- liked my 7 year old loved 
Minced pork and tofu with noodles in a peeking sauce- everyone loved. 
When we were finished you press the bill button and our bill came. 
The waiter checked on us regularly and was kind."}
{"text":"Worst service, even when its NOT a rush hour. Had to wait for 45 min before someone can come to take the order. Lady that came to take the order was rude. One of my friends wanted to have one more noodles and she said, 'No you already ordered 2 noodles'. Does it matter to her? Not just that, after waiting 20 min, she bring me the wrong order. 
When I went to the manager, he told me to look carefully before ordering. Seriously? I checked the menu option and order the dish that doesn't contain pork. It was not under any of the non-veg sections. Not just that, I confirmed with that lady, taking the order, if that dish has any meet or fish; and she confirmed that it doesn't. But still what I get is the pork dish.
I highly recommend it for the worst place to eat lunch.
Very disappointing. 
You may never know what you are eating"}
{"text":"When I want to take one of my less-versed-in-chinese-food-and-very-white-relatives to a place they can feel comfortable in, I take them here. The menus are easy for them to understand, its clean, well decorated and modern feeling inside and the service is accomadating (if a little hard to attract sometimes). For me, however, the food seems a little overpriced for what is, in the end, pretty good (but not exceptional) non-region specific chinese fare. The dumplings are good, as well as some of the fried noodle dishes. Also if the restaurant is at all crowded, expect it to be loud."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto recently and my bro-in-law decides to take me out for a bite to eat.  We decided to go to Asian Legend.  Rumor has it that this place was as close to Ding Tai Fung as you can get in Toronto (especially for their xiao long bao). 

We had some spicy chilli oil cold cuts ( typical beef stomach, five spice roast beef, and tendon).  This was delicious!  Some of the tendon tasted a little salty but honestly with a cold beer and the amazing chili oil it was a great mix. 

The Shiu Mai and the Xiao Long Bao were great.  Let's face it - it is not Ding Tai Fung but the broth was clear and flavorful and the pork was juicy and had rich taste.  You know when you have bad soup dumplings - it's like a one-way trip to vomitville!  

The other dishes were just as flavorful.  I enjoyed the Noodles as well as the scallion pancake but I could honestly have skipped that to be honest...

Service was good and food was tasty.  I would definitely recommend to anyone traveling Toronto's Chinatown."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese restaurant with nicely made Shanghai Soup Dumplings. The hot and sour soup and bitter melon were excellent. Good service and good ambiance."}
{"text":"Walked in yesterday for dinner with wife and kids.  Ordered 12 pan fried dumplings (5.99/6),they were only half the size of  the regular pot stickers,  tasted OK, but over priced for dumplings that size!  Then the second dish we ordered was fried pork chops, which was 90%fat, with very little meat. The other dishes were yang_chow fried rice and enoki mushrooms with Chinese cabbage, which were up to par with the quality I've associated with Asian Legends!  We were quite disappointed due to inconsistency of the dishes, not only at different branches,  but also at the same restraunt!  Don't think I will be returning anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner, overall I'm pleasantly surprised! The decor is really nice and the service is great, especially considering this part of town. The food was also quite delicious. We ordered about 7 different things and everything was really good except for the \"jelly pork\". That's usually something I always order at Shanghainese restaurants but here it was just flavorless and I wouldn't recommend it. Other than that dish though, everything was good! For 4 people including dessert it was about $75."}
{"text":"I'm partial to the one on Dundas, just west of Beverley, but there are about five more locations to serve you.


Asian Legend is one of the few chains I adore. It's simply well-made, reasonably priced, tasty asian eats. They specialize in Northern Chinese cooking, which means they have two of my favourite Chinese treats: soup dumplings and green onion beef pancake wraps. These dumplings are 'to die for'. They are delicious mixtures of meat and vegetable with broth all wrapped up and steamed. Damn.




AL puts a modern spin on all their restaurants, so the décor is tasteful and consistent. Staff are all uniformed and generally polite.


One of my favourite buddies (I suppose I should tell you his name now since he's come up several times.  Everybody, meet Onre, pronounced \"Henri\") and I met up this weekend.


We did what we do best together - talk and eat. Normally we would have gotten Peking Duck, but I just started a new workout regimen, and eating delicious fatty duck just wasn't in the cards. 


There were two of us, and we ordered all of this: soup dumplings, pancake, surimi with broccoli, spare ribs, and fried rice. We didn't get my other favourite AL dish: green beans. They're not your average green bean.  I would consider being a vegetarian if I could eat this everyday.  

Onre and I rolled out, pretty proud of ourselves for eating so much. Course the table next to us gave us a run for our money. Two youthful looking boys and about two dishes more than we had. Beasts.  Ha, kettle meet black."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in China Town area.  As a Chinese who grew up in Shanghai, I love almost everything they have, fresh ingredient, flavorful, not oily, and a good variety of traditional offerings. 

I tried numerous Chinese restaurants in different price range, and this restaurant is the only one my family ended up going back again and again.  I do not understand why they claim themselves Northern cuisine, coz quite a few dishes they carry are very authentic Shanghai cuisine and they all taste great."}
{"text":"This branch is conveniently located for me and family, and has become one of the go-to dinner locations. Be sure to make reservations in advance no matter the night, time, or party size - will ensure speedy seating as they'll be expecting you. They've also implemented a table service system with a tabletop device with buttons indicating if you need service, want to order, or want the bill. This is super convenient for non-Chinese speakers and ensures your service comes timely without battling the other patrons to catch servers' attention. The traditional hand raising will also work fine. Ordering is also done by paper and pencil, be sure to specify customizations for applicable items (usually in brackets after the item name on the menu). 

We ordered xiaolongbao (mini steamed soup buns with pork), potstickers, spring onion pan cakes, kai lan with ginger, Shanghai-style noodles, and a ginger and chicken fried rice. Dessert was fried egg whites covered in sugar, and house dessert soup of red bean, purple rice, and tapioca.

The dim sum (xiaolongbao, potstickers, pan cakes) were up to par with their usual quality - served hot and steamy and fairly tasty. Of the similar places I've been to in the area, I think their quality is one of the few that has not suffered over time as much. The skins were thin, the meat was flavourful, they were served hot - all the basics were covered. The spring onion pan cakes are the thin variety - not the puffy ones. Id you're a fan of the flat thin ones I think they're quite good here.

As for the kai lan...they have a large variety of greens in the menu that you can get plain or with minced garlic. There's also ginger \"sauce\" - not on the menu but also a Chinese kitchen basic that you can order at no added cost. I assume writing \"ginger\" on your order will suffice to explain. The kai lan wasn't fresh and some of it tasted too bitter, disappointing. Willing to write it off as partially a seasonal problem as opposed to a fault of the restaurant entirely.

The Shanghai-style noodles were chewy, lots of shrimp and a good balance of other fix-ins like cabbage and pork strips. A good starch dish for something filling but not too heavy, and something fairly mainstream. The ginger and chicken fried rice also had egg whites and was a pleasant surprise - the ginger bits gave a refreshing kick and the chicken and egg made it a hearty comfort food style fried rice. Would definitely recommend and order again myself as an alternative starch staple.

Finally, dessert. We ordered their fried egg white puffs, they have sugar sprinkled on top and there is about a 10-20min wait for them. They don't serve these at dinner time on the weekend because it's just too time consuming, so either book your table early with the dessert order on the weekend or come on a weeknight. Here's red bean paste inside to give flavour and additional sweetness. The chef took their time my last visit - the egg whites were fluffy yet filling, the puffs were big and poofy, and they were served hot. I was worried there'd be a lot of air space given the size of the puffs but they turned out to be well-filled. A crowd favourite that didn't disappoint!

The house dessert on the other hand was disappointing, red bean soup worth purple rice and tapioca. It must have been sitting in a warmer pot for too long because it was lukewarm at most and had the viscosity of a cold gravy - goopy and runny, not appetizing. At least it was free. Definitely plan to order dessert or skip out - unless you want to make a fuss to have them heat it up for you, which is viable an option if you don't mind waiting a bit.

For the reliability and overall quality of food ordered, this is a place worth revisiting all the time. As you get to know the servers you'll find them to be fairly patient and hardworking, but they won't take any shit or sass from difficult patrons."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, and our family took us here saying that Toronto is known for some delicious Asian food.

The décor was very nice for an Asian restaurant, our family said that this location used to be a Swiss Chalet? The two course duck was pretty cool - something we don't have at home. First it was served traditionally with crepes, then second were the lettuce wraps. Don't know if it happened to every table or if they know we're out-of-towners, but our duck was served tableside! 

Second thing that was noteworthy was the eggplant with garlic sauce. My parents still rave about it, and still regret that they let our family take it home instead of us. Finally when we returned home to Texas, we couldn't stop raving about it. Guess we'll have to fly back again!"}
{"text":"We've been to the Asian Legend a couple of times in St. Catherine's before it closed and we absolutely loved the food there, which is why we took a chance on this Asian Legend despite the mediocre rating and reviews, While service was exceptional (especially for a Chinese restaurant), the food wasn't anything special. Most of the dishes were bland and under seasoned."}
{"text":"I came here on Good Friday because I was craving Shanghai noodles. The lineup to wait was about half an hour to seat two people. They were extremely busy and understaffed with a host and two servers running around. The noodles were very oily but the pork and cabbage dumplings were just OK. Service was pretty bad. I couldn't flag down a server and had to walk up to get bowls and the bill. I would not come back due to the extreme lack of service. Parking was also bad in the Metro Square plaza as limited space."}
{"text":"A favourite Toronto Chinatown dim sum destination.

Outside of the usual dim sum classics, I tend to order more of their northern Chinese-inspired dishes, such as Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Ground Pork, Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef, and so on. 

Also, their Millet Congee is highly recommended, as well as a very accomplished Hot & Sour Soup with Shredded Chicken; Sauteed Chinese Broccoli is never too saucy/garlicky/oily like in most Chinatown eateries in town. They have a nice enough wine list. 

I like this place because the design is somewhat sleek and modern. You won't find a dim sum trolley pushed along here. Just order what you'd like, and the service team will eventually bring it to you, sometimes one-by-one, sometimes all at once. Service is what it is here, a bit chaotic when it's packed, yet, timely for the most part. Lastly, be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I think they have really good customer service as I was greeted immediately by the server even though they were super busy on family day.  We ordered four dishes with hot and sour soup, dumpling, beef slices and wonton dish.

The hot and sour soup had the correct amount of spiciness but not enough sourness.  It was still really good after adding some black vinegar and the meat julienne and vegetable julienne just perfectly complement the soup.  The dumplings were reallt well made with thin and elastic skins with wonderfully seasoned minced meat inside.  The spicy beef slices was just the best dish for me with good heat and sliced thinly to give it surface area for the spicy sauce.

I love this place, and staffs were really friendly throughout the meal.  Most importantly, their washrooms were really clean which is a plus for me."}
{"text":"The northern Chinese cuisine is as good as it gets in downtown Toronto. I especially love the green onion beef pancakes and the beef noodle soup. 

I've had some good experiences with the private group dining here as well. 

However I wouldn't really recommend the Peking duck here or the Shanghai Siu Long Bao as they are only so so."}
{"text":"I had a craving for some xiao long bao one weekend so we dropped by for a late lunch at Asian legend.

We ordered the xiao long bao, dan dan mien and fried mantou with condensed milk. It was an overall fulfilling meal and we rather enjoyed it! Between the two of us that day, we were definitely stuffed from the three items we ordered!

The service is average but I didn't have high expectations for these types of chinese chain restaurants.

Will definitely come back sometime for another helping of some shanghai food."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a couple of times along with another location. I'm not really sure what is wrong with the waiter that took our order. We asked him for the roasted duck two-ways. He took the order without any regard or questions. We even asked him if he understood that we wanted the two-ways, and he replied yes. We sat there for a very long time. At the end decided to ask the waiter, and he tell us he has already packed the \"second\" way in a bag for us to take home. What's the point of me coming to a restaurant if I just wanted to take it home without even eating it. Then he told us the second way cost money like we didn't know. The last time I checked, everything I ordered on the menu costs money. If we didn't have the money why would we go there. At the end we decided not to give any tip. He actually had the nerve to say where is the tip. The service was horrible. The food was mediocre since it wasn't even what we ordered. The waiter an egotistical jerk. Even if he admitted he took the order wrong, we would have left some tip. However, from the very beginning he completely disregarded us. I guess if you were expecting a tip because you \"stood\" there without doing your job correctly, you may want to look into a new line of work rather than waitressing because your tip depends on how you treat your customer and take their oders."}
{"text":"Typical \"asian fusion\" food. It is average but tasty. I like it for take out. And the price is always right for the amount of food you get. If you want a specialty item id recommend going to any of the other dozen places in Chinatown. This is a solid chain and a big space for dT."}
{"text":"I love getting the beef pancake and the soup filled dumplings. Snow pea leaves are also very good here, as are the dim sum options. I also love the fried spicy tofu, very nice sauce and nice textures. 

Definitely the cleanest restaurant in Chinatown but also fairly pricey so I usually stick to the dim sum/appetizer menu."}
{"text":"This review is primarily for the beef roll in onion pancake.  I have been eating this for a decade at this location.  I always take a couple rolls back home with me.  It's the best in North America.  Their soy bean milk is good too.  I have had all the food there.  It's not bad, but you are in Toronto.  You have SO MANY more options that are better.  Come here for the beef roll."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOSH. why didnt we find this place sooner? My family and I came here on our last day in Toronto for lunch before heading back to Boston. and WOW. was not expecting it to looks soooo nice inside and to have food to match the amazingness.

As we waited for our food to come out, we got to watch a waitress cut and plate a peking duck. it looked soo amazing. For our meal, i ordered fried dough to dip in sweet soy milk, yea, sounds weird, but it;s like eating a donut. yum! scallion pancakes, fried tofu in a garlic sauce (really good) steamed dumplings, pan fried baos (not sure what they are really called in english, sorry) panfried dumplings, chive pie (ordered by mistake thinking it was something else...) and TWO orders of xiao long bao, or soupo dumplings. Everything we ordered was AMAZING. the soup dumplings were the highlight of the meal though. lots of soup, tasty meat and the wrap (skin) was so thin. Will DEFINATELTY come back here when I'm back in Toronto.

So jealous of all you canadians, you have such great asian food, wish it I could get it here in Boston."}
{"text":"I've tried out a few of the other Asian Legend locations uptown GTA and decided I should give this one a try.  It was my sisters birthday so we decided to go out as a family to a new Chinese restaurant and Asian Legend came up.  My parents are very picky with Chinese food, so naturally my sister and I were a bit nervous taking them here for dinner.  

First off, the parking lot is awesome!  It's so easy to find a spot unlike the uptown locations and restaurants in Richmond Hill and Markam in general.  There are tons of spots even on a weekend, and the spots were nice and huge (I'm a bit picky when it comes to parking my car).  Inside the restaurant was pretty fancy, the interior was very detailed and you can tell a lot of money and time was spent on the decor getting this place just right.  It looks much better than the other locations and was nice and dimly lit inside.  Not too dark though, I still want to see my food!

The service was pretty good as well, I had a lot of custom orders to make since some of my family is particular with food, and they catered to our every need.  We ordered lobster, chow mein, stir fried cucumber leaves with musroom, fried tofu and the full peking duck courses.  The food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary in terms of presentation or flavours.  The highlight was definitely the peking duck though, it was juicy and they served us the duck when it was nice and hot.  We ran out of the wraps and lettuce leaf, but the server got us more (on the house) in a flash.

Overall the place looks great and there is plenty of tables and parking if you're concerned about those things.  It's not the best Chinese food I've had in the GTA and probably not even top 5, but definitely worth the money I paid.  I would come back here again in the future to try out the other dishes and bring a group of hungry patrons.  Oh yeah and my parents, well they really enjoyed the meal, so that's why I'm giving the review 4 stars instead of 3!"}
{"text":"Back then I used to go here for family dinners and thought that the food was great but I was wrong. Recently I thought of ordering takeout there and was not only disappointed but disgusted in the quality of the food and how they screwed up my order.

I ordered the sweet and sour pork rice combo (9.95) for takeout but instead got some Chinese bacon with veggies combo which at first was somewhat decent but I soon regret eating it. I did not return to tell them they screwed up my order due to waiting for a half an hour there (probably them screwing with me) for that order and finding myself to wait even more. 

This Chinese bacon rice combo also comes with some sort of egg/tofu soup and Lemon tea which kinda help the foul taste out of my mouth after eating that putrid bacon. 

I now seriously do not get the hype, the fact that the dim sum and the items here consists of either processed or grocery brought foods and people here think that this is delicious. Seriously go to a real Chinese restaurant not this \"chain-restaurant\" crap."}
{"text":"Nice Chinese restaurant at dt area. Clean and good place for get-together with friends. Steam dumplings are highly recommended. Price about 20 per person."}
{"text":"I like how there are lots of locations for this restaurant, but I've only been to 3 of them and I still like this one the best. The food here is always decent, and even during busy times they keep your tea pot full. 

We ordered the XLB, steamed dumplings, pan-fried dumplings, shanghai fried noodles, and stir-fried pea shoots for three people (and yes, it was too much food). The bill came out to be $45 incl tip, so a decent price for a very filling meal. They even provided green bean dessert soup free of charge, which was a nice surprise. Over all, it's not my #1 pick for dumplings, and I've had better XLB but in a pinch it fixes all cravings."}
{"text":"Very good, one of our go to Chinese restaurants.  Usually dependable and good food.  Service is OK nothing great.  Order food you can recognize and it will be good, We like the dim sum, hot and sour soup, cream of corn soup, shrimp dishes, beef dishes, and noodles,"}
{"text":"Great food that's not to oily. Prices are reasonable too. Favorite dish is the curry eggplant!"}
{"text":"Friend took me to this place today. Pretty good food, my family went to Asian Legend once in Scarborough and we were very impressed, food wasn't typical Chinese fair, it had a lot better presentation as well as the decor is nice.

Food was really good and the prices are decent. Nice place to go back to."}
{"text":"The food at this location was a step above. for sure! Decor is nice and the service was adequate. I've heard other reviews saying that they were short staffed. Tonight they appeared to have more than enough staff on.

I'll break it down by dishes we ordered.

Green Onion Pancake with Shredded beef: Very good, but I think I prefer the regular pancake with green onion only. This was a little heavy with all the food that we ordered.

Peking Duck: Had the crepes and the crystal rolls. Generally very well done with lots of crispy skin for the crepes. But the stir fry for the crystal rolls was deep fried and didn't have the same delicate quality that I've enjoyed before. Having said that I would order this here again.

Geeral Tsao Chicken: Yuck. My friend ordered this. It was actually much better than anywhere else I've had it, but I don't like these deep fried dishes in sweet sauce and don't consider them to be food. That's not Asian Legend's fault and I do think that this item is one of the best representation of the dish that I've had to date.

Shredded Beef with Sezchuan Peppers: This was really nice. Very spicy with lots of hot chilies and peppercorn. 

I'd come back with a larger group to try more things. As it was, we took home lots of leftovers for our men."}
{"text":"My friend tried the Asian Legend in St. Catharines and was raving about it, so we had to check out the one here in Chinatown. We had two very western-like entrees so I can't comment on authenticity. However, the Cantonese Chow Mein was a solid 3 stars. A couple of the shrimp tasted of chlorine, but other than that, the noodles were nice and crispy without being greasy and the broccoli was nice and crisp. I might have liked to see a few other types of veg such as bok choy or carrots, but it was decent.

The beef with bell peppers and chilies was a little oily, but very tasty with loads of roasted and slightly pickled peppers. Yum.

Soup filled pork dumplings were nice-- I was worried that I was going to burn my mouth, but they weren't as hot as I expected them to be. Panfried green onion pancake was divine. I love green onion pancakes!

Service was very quick and efficient. No problems here at all. Five stars for service and you can't say that about a lot of Chinese restaurants.

There were two things that turned me off and prevented this from being a five star review: The really dirty teapots on the table-- These were super grimy and they really should invest in some new ones. Also, when I used the bathroom before we left, there was poo all over one of the toilets. I'm not sure how poo got into all these places where it was, but I left there feeling pretty sick. I get that it was a Tuesday night and bathroom cleanliness checks were probably not a top priority, but after having the really good meal that I did, being greeted with fecal matter was not especially pleasing. I also feel sorry for the person who passed that matter. Ew.

I will go back, but I'm going to have to let the visual die. That may take a while. I think I'll try my luck at the St. Catharines location next time when I'm home to visit the parentals."}
{"text":"Positive: Good dim sum, and clean space.

Negative: The chef doesn't know how to cook northern Chinese dishes, to the extend that the waitress warned me when i tried to order one (say what???) , so this tells you how unauthentic it is. 

Advice; Go to the Asian legend in North York near  Finch and Leslie, this is where you get authentic dishes."}
{"text":"I ordered this meal through UberEats and had it delivered while we were downtown overnight at a hotel.  Because of UberEats AND the general cost of food at this restaurant the meal was pretty pricey but I have to say the food was pretty good.  We ordered the soup dumplings and they were delicious....also ordered the chicken dumplings, General Tsao chicken, chicken fried rice and wonton soup.  We were a little disappointed with the lack of packaged condiments (no soy sauce packets, no chili sauce, no fortune cookies) as the only things provided were a few plum sauce packets and a very small cup of soy sauce on the side.  Not nearly enough for the chicken fried rice which was clearly very light in the sodium department.  Otherwise, overall pleased with the experience apart from the Uber Eats gouge."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this asian legend didn't have more review. Good or bad it should have more people talk about it.

About 90% of my visit are take-out, usually done with a telephone order to avoid waiting. a 4 star place for us.
This time we dine in. 

we ordered the lunch special.
Pork Chops with Special Salt & Pepper on Rice
Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetable on Rice
Kung Pao Chicken on Rice
(price and additional info please refer to the picture)

to start the meal, we were served 2 bowls of soup.
as we were trying to taste it, we wonder if we should get 3 bowls of soup (as we ordered 3 special)
once we finished the first bowl (it's really small when you share), we try to ask the waitress about it when we start to attack the second bowl.
(it's not really flavorful, but nothing else to eat or do...)

after our meal is here, the 3rd soup finally arrives.
but it's a totally different looking soup.
the once we got before was a clear soup with tiny vegetable bits floating in it.
the 3rd one we got was in like a beef broth color soup base with a un-appetizing cloudiness to it. 
after we stir it a few times, seems to us that it's the same soup but really like an attempt to wash the bin to get one last bowl out.

after that, we just quickly finished our food and left.

I mean, if you don't have the soup, suggest some else for us, or just sub it with a drink or something. don't give us dish washing water..."}
{"text":"4.5.

I liked this location better than the other two I've visited. Our friends arrived early and we were stuck in traffic. Despite being 6:30 in a Friday, there wasn't a huge wait and we sat at a really nice round booth that was conducive to conversation and sharing.

We began with the soup and pork filled dumplings with the green onion pancake. Both were good. For our mains we had the shredded beef with chilies, Cantonese chow mein, shrimp with noodles and the meatballs with mushrooms.

Everything was good, with the exception of the meatballs. The sauce was really gloppy and the meatballs were flavourless.

Service was excellent! There was always someone refilling our water and clearing empty plates.

Bathrooms could use attention as the floors were flooded with water and paper towels."}
{"text":"For what you get, 3 stars.  Medium priced Northern chinese food, with more MSG to satisfy the tastebuds of the downtown core.

Really a hit and miss with most dishes.  You really cant go wrong with the beef noodle soup, beef pancake, or steamed dumplings (xiao long bao). But I found the hot and sour soup had a bit of a strange after taste, the potstickers soggy, and the shanghai friend noodles far too salty. 

I may be a bit of a critic because I've had the pleasure of eating at a lot of Northern Chinese restaurants, but the irony is if you go to an Asian Legend in Markham/Richmond Hill, it will taste a lot better.  Still, not a bad place to go if you don't want to make the trek."}
{"text":"Even though Asian Legend has grown to become a small chain of local Chinese restaurants, they continue to be very high quality and a regular go-to place for me and my friends. While a few years ago, I would have confidently said that they have the BEST General Tao Chicken and Wontons in Spicy Peanut Sauce, as new chefs come and go, the dishes in which they excel seem to change. 

It helps that they specialize in Northern Chinese cuisine and so their selection is slightly different than the more common Cantonese fair that you can find in the area. All told, the quality is always on the high end, the service is always good, and the ambiance is pleasant."}
{"text":"First time at this location. At first it's hard to find it due to its location in the Plaza (it's at the end behind). I came with my family and my experience was better than expected. The service was great compared to the other franchise. Very quick, friendly and came oftentimes to check up to see if we needed anything else. The food is somewhat more flavourful compared to the other locations and seemed more fresh. Atmosphere is calm and decently quiet with a nice and clean interior. It is quite easy to move around from entrance to table and to the washroom. If I am back in the area, I'll definitely go back. 
Despite its hidden location, it's a plus that it's part of a Plaza where you can grab dessert which is located just around the corner."}
{"text":"This is our go to place when craving for Chinese and we don't want to drive far. We have been regulars here eating in and taking out as well. My favourites are the beef and onion pancake, crispy tofu in garlic sauce, General Tao's chicken (favourite of my kids), sizzling beef with mushrooms, and salt and pepper pork chops....nothing mind blowing but they serve good, reliable, Chinese food that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I ordered 6 dishes but I only like two of them. 

I like:
1) Glutinous Rice Roll with pork floss (8/10)
This is my childhood memory so I would really want to try it. It tasted good but not as good as traditional ones that can be found in Shanghai restaurant or old Hong Kong shops. But I think everyone should give it a good try!

2) Fried Silver Thread Roll (10/10)
It comes with condensed sweet milk, which I think is the best combination with the rolls. The rolls were huge! Bigger than those found in Asian countries. It is definitely a must-try dessert! Steamed ones should be good too(I haven't tried) if you want to be healthier!

Dislike:
1) Pan fried green onion pancakes
They are too crispy; unlike those traditional ones. 

2) Steamed shumai with shrimps and pork
Huge and good looking appearance. Yet the essence of the dimsum - shrimps are not sticking together, which I dislike. (Normally, most restaurants will have bundled shrimps that give us a sense that the shrimps are fresh)

3) Steamed shrimp dumplings
Same problem as #2: shrimps not bundled together. Another one is that they have too thick \"skin\" or cover. I can even tasted the smell of flour or some sort of plastic texture.

4) Mango pudding
It is enormous, yet quite expensive (I think). That would be good if there were real mango pieces inside the pudding. It actually didn't taste like mango, so that's why I think that improvement is needed.

Of course, the above are only my personal opinions based on my personal preferences and experience. Some may find the food here perfect too, so it depends on you! These are just my thoughts and suggestions!"}
{"text":"This location to me serves the best food out of all Asian Legends around town. I know eh? you would think all Asian Legends should be equal, but that is not the case. The downtown Spadina location tends to be heavier on the flavour, location on Yonge is bland, and the one located Warden/Steeles is just not very good. (been there twice, and that was enough)  Back to the Sheppard Asian Legend, love the food, service is fast and efficient.  A great place for good solid Chinese food, never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've come to Asian Legend twice for lunch now and both times were impressed by how clean the restaurant is. The food is not overly greasy or oily, like you will find in most Chinese fast food or even restaurants, thank god. The staff there can b hard to get a hold of. I didn't like the seating arrangement at the restaurant. I went with a friend and their table for twos were trapped behind other tables with minimal walking space which made it hard for servers and for me to get out at any time. Not to mention it was too close together to the other table and lacked any kind of privacy. 

The food was great though. I especially love the Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings. I had it in the ground pork version as well the crab. The skin of the dumpling is perfect - thin enough to see the big bag of soup in the dumpling but sturdy enough not to break. As someone who loves Steam Soup Filled Dumplings, I have only tasted better in New York and Shanghai."}
{"text":"Over the years I've eaten at every Asian Legend location and this one is still my go-to. This is my place when I'm craving carbs, need to bring a non-Asian friend to eat Chinese food, or am feeling a bit homesick.

It's not the best Chinese food in Toronto, but the taste is consistent and the menu is extensive enough so there's something for everyone. They even have combo dishes in case you don't feel like going 'family style'. 

My go-to dishes:
-Beijing duck 3 ways (wrapped with pancakes, diced and stir fried with lettuce wrap, and bones cooked in soup)
-any of their soup dumplings
-beef wrapped in green onion pancake
-snow pea shoots with mushroom

New discovery:
-savoury soybean soup (only $3.50!)"}
{"text":"Good food but loud. Good wonton soup and I like the beef onion roll thing. Can't remember the name of it. Good fried rice too."}
{"text":"A clean and nice restaurant in Chinatown. Good for Chinese food fans. Helpful staff."}
{"text":"They've got terrible TV commercials that even my parents think are too old fashioned - but I guess that's what they're going for - Northern Cuisine done well and traditionally.  The food really is good - not too oily, not too crazy saucy (as it should be), not so salty that you have to drown yourself with tea.  For our early Chinese New Year dinner, we got a little private area in the back.  The waiters were very attentive - the food came hot, fast and fresh.  We had the gamut of the dinner menu - the cold appetizer plate, veg, braised pork shoulder, fish, noodle... etc etc... so much food! Discounts if you have the VIP card."}
{"text":"I normally really love Asian Legend, but this location is just TERRIBLE!!! The food is soooo salty!!!! Are salts really that cheap that u just spread it on everything??? Normally other Asian legends would cut the beef rolls or the sticky rice rolls for take out and put it in a foam box, this location left it as whole and put it in a paper bag for me. They didn't even give me chopstick or forks to eat!!!! How am I suppose to eat the noodles??? With my hands??? Not to mention the service is SOOO terrible!!! It's like I owe the waiters money or something :S"}
{"text":"If you are ever in Toronto and need a place to eat.  I would recommend Asian Legend.  They have a couple locations but this is by far the best one.  Every time I come here there is two dishes I must get. 

Their XLB is delicious and to die for.  The wrap is thin, filing is delicious and steam to its perfection.  2 orders please as always.

Another dish is their Peking Duck.  Yes, Peking Duck there is the best =) well definitely better than all the ones we had in Sacramento.  The best one would be in Hong Kong but that's a whole different place we are talking about.  The kitchen staff would skin the duck in front of you, its a show you do not want to miss.  Then of course once it is skin, ask them to use the leftovers to make a lettuce wrap.  Yum Yum.

Writing this review makes me drool already, I sure miss it."}
{"text":"Your traditional dim sum and Chinese dinner. If you are there for dim sum, come early or else you'll be waiting in line with the others that go from the middle of the restaurant all the way to entrance. Food overall deserves a thumbs up as it is tastier and fresher than many other dim sums across the GTA."}
{"text":"Went on Feb. 15, 2016 at around 3 p.m. and there were only 5 occupied tables so it was very empty.  Nobody offered drinks (however there was a kettle with green tea which was only half full) and we had a party of 6.  After 30 minutes of sitting there with no one coming to check on us, my brother-in-law had to get up and find a server so we could place an order (we should have left at that point but we were too hungry).  

Finally the tasteless fried rice, noodles and green onion pancakes came by however the chicken plates were alright.  

As we were eating no servers were around, people started to gather at the door as they were waiting to be seated, 15 (maybe 20) minutes went by and some people left the restaurant because no one seated them. 

My dad was so thirsty and had wanted another drink but there were no servers around, so I went to the kitchen and asked for a glass of water. All of the servers and kitchen staff were just eating and hanging out.

Again, we were waiting for the server to come by and check on us as we had wanted the bill, finally I saw our server walk by and i said \"excuse me can we have the bill please?\" and he yelled out to me \"I am not working right now!\"...wtf?  

My family and I had a really crappy time at this \"restaurant\".  They added spring rolls onto the bill even though we did not order it, so we had to wait another 10 minutes for them to remove it off the bill.  We definitely did not tip and will never, ever return."}
{"text":"We had steamed chicken and pork dumplings. It was perfect and very tasty. We have tried dumplings all over US and this was on par with Chicago/philly dumpling places."}
{"text":"Wait!
  We can review in Canada!!!  Yay!  I wonder if I can start reviewing in the UK...

  Asian Legend Rocks...  It's definitely got a more northern flair, compared to the ubiquitous cantonese dimsum in Toronto.  For a chinese restaurant to survive in Toronto, you've got to be relatively good -- none of that, \"I moved to north america and need to make ends meet, so I'll just fire up a wok, and use internet recipes --\"

  So, try out the XLBs, the chive dumplings, the dan dan noodles.  Shanghai chic in North America.  Come to think of it... I need to go A.S.A.P!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. But the service is seriously lacking. They act like they don't want you there.  Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The same as all asian legends ive been to. Service is good and fast. Food is always delicious-I always order the general tao chicken, spicy wonton soup, and the chicken dumplings. Always have enough to take home too!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have enjoyed the food each time I've been here. The servers are friendly and the food comes out pretty quickly.

I suggest going with a group so you can order a bunch of dishes to share. I like that their food a nice mix of different things. 

I like the Braised Bamboo shoots, which were slightly sweet and crunchy. If you like bamboo  shoots you should give this a try. Another nice cold dish is the drunken chicken soaked in liquor.It reminds me of deli chicken, Chinese style.

I love their soup dumplings! Some of best that I've had. The dough is not too thick. The best part is drinking the soup out of the dumpling before you eat it. The pork also had a nice flavouring to it and the dumplings were cooked well. 

A nice alternative is their steam buns that is served with condense milk. You can either have this as a semi dessert or it pairs nicely if you want something a bit filling and will pair well with any of the other dishes,

Another dish I really enjoy eating here is the deep fried tofu with garlic sauce. The tofu is cooked really perfectly so that you get that nice crunchy texture and the inside is silken and soft. The sauce also has a nice spicy kick to it.

Some of their dishes can be very spicy so if you don't like spicy food, be careful of what you order. I would suggest just trying different things off the menu I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is always a family favorite and hit with our family. They have improved their service and quality of food over the years. Most recent time our family came here for boxing day after Christmas and the wait was not long at all. This time though the quantity of food seemed a bit less on the dishes. Love their fried rice, steamed dumplings and cold noodle dishes. Also their fried red bean pancake is the best!"}
{"text":"We had soup dumplings, Shanghai style pan fried bun, and dong-po pork. Soup dumpling was our favorite! Make sure you eat them hot and remember to dip in the vinegar!"}
{"text":"I had recalled that Asian cuisine in Toronto was top notch from a trip during school over 10 years ago.  On this return trip, I was happy to see it was still the case.  

Asian Legend, located in the Chinatown area of Toronto is a perfect example of this top notch cuisine.  Having eaten in Hong Kong, China, Vancouver, San Francisco, and LA, I have certain expectations when it comes to Chinese food and flavor.  Asian Legend met them and in some cases exceeded those expectations.

The decor is modern and really belies it's Chinatown location.  But the diverse menu, friendly prices, and casual service remind you that this gem really is in Chinatown next to many 1 star locales.  

Our choices:

Crab meat and pork soup dumplings - excellent.  The crab meat and pork were both very distinct and very fresh.  The dumpling skins were a tad thicker than many places, but there was plenty of soup in each one.

Crab meat and fish maw soup - a large bowl of soup came out piping hot.  Not as much crab meat as I expected, but reasonable given the low price.

Lobster e fu mein - a huge lobster accompanied the e-fu noodles.  At least three large claws were present and the flavor was wonderful.  The noodles were a bit dry though and could have used more lobster sauce.  Overall, a huge portion for the price.

Asian Legend accepts credit cards, but not American Express."}
{"text":"The food is not bad there, but i find it very greasy and it's very inconsistent.. One day, the dish you order will taste great and the next time you go there, the same exact dish can taste horrible..
The service is not bad and it's a little over priced there.."}
{"text":"Wonderful Northern Chinese restaurant serves soup dumplings, peking duck, steamed fish and some fancy vegetarian dishes.

Toronto has a gazillion Chinese restaurants, so be impressed that the sturdy Asian Legend chain continues to thrive and prosper. We went to the Scarborough location at Sheppard/Brimley which looks like it was a converted Swiss Chalet.  Inside, the decor is sleek and modern.  Service is attentive.  The menu is extensive.

A sour note is that the washrooms are deep downstairs in the basement - you might think you've entered into a Look of Kohler dungeon!  Another sour note is that in spite of the spacious looking lay-out, once the restaurant was filled up, it was next to impossible to back out of your chair without hitting the table behind you!

Food presentation was first rate.  We had sliced drunken chicken that was practically ginger-thin sliced!  The peking duck wasn't prepared at the table but presented in a giant platter, hot and crispy with steamers of wrappers. We had a steamed sea bass with ginger and onions - wonderfully light and tasty BUT they didn't do that great a job of scaling the fish. We also ordered a vegetarian dish of edame beans with bean sprout pasta and enjoyed a complimentary dessert of red bean/coconut hot soup - a nice finish to a wonderful meal!

Of course, no visit to Asian Legend is complete without an order of northern style soup dumplings which are currently all the rage (just like Pho!). Asian Legend features a variety from seared, vegetarian to various stuffings of \"potstickers.\""}
{"text":"Though I'm not usually a booster of chain restaurants, I'm a big fan of Asian Legend.  But this location is sub-par. The service is not great, but it's the environment that really sucks.  Despite some dramatic design elements, it's an incredibly unpleasant place to be.  There is something about the ventilation in this place that makes you feel like you are eating in an airplane hanger.  The sound of loud, gusting wind is omnipresent.  Occasionally, the cheesy music cuts through and you find yourself wondering whether you were better off with just the wind sound.  Conversations echo throughout the place, adding to the din.  The result is constant discomfort.

And the food itself also seems lower quality than at most Asian Legends.  Hot and Sour Soup is just not quite as good here.  Most of the dim sum are on par with other locations, but it's the soup that I like best, so disappointed in this location.  I was hoping for an Asian Legend in this part of Toronto, but after a number of disappointing visits, I won't be visiting this Asian Legend again."}
{"text":"I have to do another top notch review because i went here again and i STILL love it.  I lov eit so much I would even go alone and order an unrealistic amount of food just so I could take it home.

For those of you who dont' realize, this is the ONLY good chinese food I have ever had in Toronto- and that's sayin' SOMEthin cuz I come from Vancouver.

there is nothing bad on the menu and this is the only place I trust to take any friends who are in the mood for chinese food.  Everyone I bring here adores the food and then comes back time and time again to introduce it to other people. 

soooo good."}
{"text":"One of my preferred Asian Legend locations. Why?? Because it is never crowded or full like the other locations across Toronto. In my opinion, the food quality is similar to the other locations. The service is more attentive (probably bc there are less clients). Also, this location is cleaner than the other locations. They also have private party rooms if you like to eat with your friends and turn it up without affecting the other people in the restuarant!"}
{"text":"Too long; don't wanna read: It's average dim sum at a price well above average. Won't visit again. If you're thinking about it: do yourself a favour and walk across the street to Rosewood Chinese Cuisine. 

Service: 3/5
Food: 2/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Price: 1/5

My friend and I went to this place for dim sum just now, 2 hours ago. It has a decent review on yelp so we decided to try it out. We ordered 8 dim sum items, which amounted to approximately $60 after tax (that's ridiculous if you've ever had dim sum anywhere. It shouldn't be more than $15 per person in most Asian places). I'd gladly fork over $30 - $40 for a decent meal, however their food can be considered average at best. 

Highlight dishes:
- The pork and onion pancake thing wrapped in foil- that was good. I think it was about $5 or $6. A little pricey for the quantity but worth it. 
- We got a medium bowl of congee, crab meat and mushrooms or something, $12. Way too much starch, and I think a little heavy-handed on the MSG. I'm still chugging water. 
- The pan fried buns (sheng jian bao). OMFG those things were awful. Tasted undercooked, looked undercooked, and the too-thick dough didn't rise at all. Terrible. $5
- Shrimp Dumplings: $5 or $6. Edible compared to the buns, even a little above average in taste, but again, not quite worth it. 

The other dishes weren't even memorable, just some steamed bun or dumpling with something or other. Generally things you can find anywhere, and this place is starch-heavy on EVERYTHING. The dough is always too thick, even though the filling is seasoned nicely, it gets overpowered by a mouthful of dough. Honestly there's a place across the street called Rosewood Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum is $2/dish during happy hour, and the food is so much better than here. 

Service: waiter looked like he didn't want to be there, mumbled the dishes' names as he put them down, so we had to ask him to repeat it. Twice. Depressing man. 

The only thing that prevented me from giving it 1 star is the furnishing. The wall panels are quite beautiful. And the dipping sauce, but I mixed it myself so that doesn't really count. Though another thing: Their tables are quite small, so the two of us took up 2 of the 2-person tables."}
{"text":"Ohhhh sooo full... We did a family event! The whole 3 of us... This include a girl's age that is 1.. 

We had a chicken both noodles with chicken, veggies and Chinese mushroom with noodles in soup. That is my all time favorite!!! Specially on cold days it keep us satisfied and warm. Please note not all location have the Chinese mushroom... Only at the metro square and commerce gate location. 

Siu long bai.. World famous! You can't go wrong with that! The skin is thin with fair enough juice inside the bun that doesn't overwhelm u.. The size is prefect not to big not too small... And it comes out steamy hot! Add black vinegar mmmm so yummy! Three ways of eating it 1. Break it apart eat skin, eat meat, drink the juice. 2. Break and release the juice in a bowl and save it with the rest of the meal to add extra flavor and just eat the skin and meat! 3. Also My favorite way!! my then bf now hubby taught me! Put the bun on a spoon. Take a bite at the top of the skin, tear open slightly so juice doesn't fall out and everything is intact . Add ginger/vinegar in the hole (where the meat and juice is in the skin. Note: don't put too much vinegar or it will cover all flavors!) blow twice and eat whole... Ohhhh soooo yummy!!! I love it!!!!

Fried dumpling: sear to a crunchy skin with juice intact like the Siu long bai Take a bite at the top of the skin, tear open slightly so juice doesn't fall out and everything is intact . Add ginger/vinegar in the hole and eat. Best to use chopsticks for this one!

Fried tofu: we once saw this order on another table and decided to order it and we never stopped! So good it's spicy but for someone that doesn't eat spicy I loved it! Fried to perfection with garlic and green onions it went well with the spicy soya sauce that came with it! Incredible!!!

Total cost under $30 for everything!"}
{"text":"I hear this is the best Asian Legend, food wise.  Not that I have tried all other locations, I am just happy this one is close by, and the food and service has been consistent ever since they opened here.  

We usually go there for dim sum / snack food, not formal dinners.  We will try something different every time, but we almost always order these dishes:
- Glutinous rice roll with Chinese donuts and meat floss fillings
- Wonton in in spicy peanut sauce
- Rolled onion cake with slices of beef
- Dan Dan noodles in spicy peanut sauce
- for dessert, my MIL loves the deep fried Chinese donuts with red bean paste filling.  Six in one order, they come out piping hot and you want to eat it as quickly as possible when the dough/skin is still fluffy and inflated.  So greasy, so good.

By the way, this is supposed to be a \"northern Chinese\" cuisine restaurant.  But it more closely reflects what southerners' view of Northern food is.  Not saying it's a bad thing."}
{"text":"Best Asian Legend location out of the GTA. Some of the other locations have changed owners and had decreased in quality, but this location has kept their food quality up. 

The hot and sour soup, Peking duck and stir fry green beans never fail to disappoint. I've been coming here for years and the consistency hasn't changed by much at all. 

The restaurant is pretty big, nicely decorated and has plenty of parking behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Serving up Northern Chinese food, it's always a little bit of home. From stir fried green beans to cumin beef to hot and sour soup, it's an affordable place that's got pretty good consistency every time you go. One of my favourite things is actually their Peking duck! Their duck is so perfectly roasted and sliced well. The pancakes are also made thin and soft enough. One of my favourite places for affordable Peking duck. There are also many locations so it's pretty accessible regardless of where you live."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and I was disappointed to say the least.  I've eaten at other AL locations before, and the food has been okay.

I was stuck in the Don Mills/Eglinton area for the afternoon and craving Dan Dan noodles, the traditional spicy Sichuan noodle dish with the sauce on the bottom topped with the fried pork and veggies (and sometimes the preserved veggies that take me back to my parents' cooking!).  I have had Dan Dan in numerous restaurants, so when I quickly ordered it and some dumplings, I thought it was a no-brainer.  Nope.  What came was a soupy mess--limp, too-thick noodles drowning in a weird sauce devoid of any of the usual flavours, with a sprinkling of diced peanuts.  That's it.  No pork, no veggies.  Nothing else.  I have often seen diced green onion and/or coriander in many restaurants' versions.  Not here.  
When I called the server over to ask what this was, they called the manager over, who emphatically denied my version of what Dan Dan noodles are, saying that his wife was from Chengdu and they never do it that way.  He even challenged me to name a restaurant that does it this way.  I explained that they all do--I was so stunned by his reaction that I couldn't name one.  

Nevermind that this is the first restaurant in at least 10 throughout the GTA that does it this way.

I regret that I didn't have enough time to drive up to Hot Spicy Spicy at Finch and Leslie, the closest place where they do it right, nevermind up to Markham or north Scarborough.

I wish that these Pan-Asian, over-large menu restaurants like AL would please go away and stop pandering to the Lowest Common Denominator.

I truly should have just gone next door and had a decent bowl of pho at Pho 88."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight.    

Service was really good, staff was helpful and attentive.

We ordered a few things, of course siu lam bao which was tasty.   Egg and crab soup had lots of flavour and the sizzling beef with pineapple and peppers was delicious.

A dish that was good but portion was a little light (esp for the price) was the snow pea leaves with king mushrooms.   Definately tasty but to much of the plate was showing.  

Another negative would be the washrooms, definitely could have been attended to (puddles everywhere and not just at the sink.

Would go again if in the area."}
{"text":"You know that a Chinese restaurant is pretty good and authentic when 90% of the people eating there are Chinese.  I would never say that the food is healthy, but my goodness it's tasty! 

The ambiance is simple but nice enough for a date night and comfortable enough for lunch time.  The service is prompt but not very interactive in terms of conversation.  You even write down on a piece of paper your order to avoid unnecessary communication (however this also ensures that your order is accurate).

Favorite dishes:  The steamed soup filled dumplings were a nice treat top with the fresh ginger.  The crispy chicken was also very good with a side of green beans.  I'd love to go back and just have a dumpling meal and also try the soup dishes."}
{"text":"Ok food when you want pork soup dumplings. Service was rushed. Pan fried potstickers were ok. Fried noodles was ok, prefer congee wong. Table was too small for all the food ordered and waiter struggled to organize."}
{"text":"This review is ONLY for #69 Beef Broccoli, carry out.

Supposedly a premium offering featuring sirloin steak but sadly, the broccoli was woefully undercooked with hard inedible stems.

The beef had flavour but the quantity was seriously lacking given the premium price.

A picture is worth ten hundred words so behold the attached one.

Overally, I'd have to say it's definitely not worth the $14 price tag.  You would be better off with BestCo Food Mart's offering (see my review) of tenderized flank which is more flavourful than Asian Legend's and has twice the amount for almost half the price."}
{"text":"This place looks nice from the outside but that's all that's good.

The food is highly overpriced. 

The service is horrible and the food is even worse. There are so many better restaurants in the area.

They took FOREVER to take our order and it was not busy at all.

I will never come back here."}
{"text":"I had to update this old review.  We still eat lunch here very often.  The food always tastes great! It is pretty busy and loud at lunch but the food comes fast and hot.  It is also a great deal at just over $10 for the lunch special, highly recommend."}
{"text":"As a chain restaurant, the foods are delicious. My favorite 2 dishes pictures are attached. I would give 4 stars if we didn't have to wait that long before we are being served, at least once someone come to clean our empty dishes and one of my fav dish was not available. 

It was around 8pm on a Saturday... we were  basically the last customer waiting to be seated. Not sure if they are low staff at this location or the service is just slow here. The only dish we ordered that we didn't enjoy is the shredded pork noodle which has no taste to it. The soup wasn't hot enough and noodle wasn't cooked enough. In general, glad to find this restaurant by Canada's Wonderland.... after a long day walk, good food in out tummy before bed time. 

Total of 8 dishes came about $90 for 4 of us."}
{"text":"Many good options and a great choice when you're in Chinatown. Can't go wrong with General Tso chicken.

Downstairs there are private rooms, so it's a good place for large parties."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as it used to be. 2.5 stars to be exact.  

The restaurant was only serving 4 tables  during our Friday night visit at 10:30pm.

Service was attentive and friendly, but they did a sloppy job with the cleaning. Our table had left over pieces of food particles on the seats and on the table.

The 4 dishes we ordered required different  cooking methods: boil, steam, bake and pan fried. So even though the food tasted fine, all the dishes seemed to lacked HEAT - as if the food was just re-heated. Didn't seem as it was made fresh. Maybe it was because it was late. But still!!!

I prefer the Scarborough location better. I feel that location is cleaner, but more importantly...the food is served the right way!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch today and ordered off their lunch menu. Went with a couple of other people. We ended up ordering the double cooked pork lunch as well as a couple of other things. 

Pro:

The food was spicy. For someone who loves spice, it was actually very flavourful
Not a long wait. The food was there within 15 minutes.

Cons:

The food was too oily. When I put the twice cooked pork on my rice, it was all oil
The corn soup was so small, and half the bowl was empty. It seem like they short changed us. 
It was very salty. The cold noodles was spicy, but the salt overpowered the taste. 

On a side note, as we were entering, there was a HUGE sign that said that Stephen Harper visited. Don't know what to feel about that. I just kept looking at it."}
{"text":"The food here is good and it comes out hot and super quick. Make sure you make reservations on Friday and Saturday nights as this place was jammed when I came here. We ordered the usual staple chinese foods such as sweet and sour pork, fried rice, veggie dishes, and a variety of other dishes that all tasted fresh.

The service is exactly what you expect from a chinese restaurant.... medicore and rude at best. The parking is kinda crazy on busy days but there is a pretty big parkade near the back as well.

This would not be my \"go to\" asian place but still decent for the prices and location."}
{"text":"Asian Legend is a place I go to whenever I want to splurge on Asian food.  I come here mainly for the Soup Dumplings and usually end up ordering some congee or duck soup or some expensive snow pea with Shrimp dish but I can tell you that they ALL taste delicious!  The price you pay is a little bit more than their neighbours (congee star) BUT it also shows in the quality of the food and the overall service.

Asian Legend also has some more \"traditional\" chinese food items but they are all full of flavor and the presentation is always on point!"}
{"text":"Best crispy noodles in town. Very good service and friendly personal. Very very good authentic Chinese place."}
{"text":"When my mom told me we were going to Asian Legend for dinner, I made a face. When they first opened, it was awesome. There hadn't been many Shanghainese restaurants that was open to the casual western diner. It was really good, but then the franchaise grew. 

I went to the one at Leslie/Finch for lunch, and everything just tasted wrong. It was filthy and they didn't clear dishes at all! Metro Square was okay, but not amazing either. Dundas was passable. 

But then we came here. Huge place, with high ceilings, and really posh looking dark wooden decor. Zagat rated for 2011. And more importantly, my Uncle comes here - must be good. 

Packed on a Monday night, there was lots of good stuff. 
Peking Duck, with all the sliced meat and they give you all the bones. 
Braised Eggplant with Chili was good, but very flavourful and needs rice to go with
Dan Dan Noodles was excellent, (it was watery, but I know that's the way it's supposed to be - but I like it creamy)
Rice Cake stir fried in double broiled pork with chilli  - something I've never seen before, it's SO good, must try.

My Uncle has a 10% dicount card, $20 a year and free sweet soup at the end of it all. 

Next time I'm up in this area, I'm requesting to come here again!"}
{"text":"Very run down now.  Cabinet looks like it will fall apart any second.  Fake flowers covered with an inch thick dust.  The glass are so cloudy and greasy looking.:. This place is a disaster now.   Staff's outfit looks like they haven't wash it for weeks! Coming here for the last time.  Don't even want to image what the kitchen would look like."}
{"text":"Not amazing by any standard. Just consistently good seafood or beef cantonese chow mien, and a few other dishes. However, the $35 ginger lobster was chewy and not sweet. You'll get more food when you dine in as opposed to having it delivered from Orderit.ca."}
{"text":"There are lots of \"real\" Chinese restaurants in GTA. These are characterized by generally reasonable prices, less than stellar decor, no attention on service, and minimal attempt at making the food look nice. I call these \"real\" because if you go to China, most places will be like this. There really isn't fine dining in traditional Chinese culture. Most people just care about taste.

Then there are \"westernized\" Chinese restaurants. These are usually pricey. They serve food that's not even real Chinese food (like General Tao Chicken). They have nice clean decor and (relatively) attractive servers. The food is often not authentic, and served on really nice plates.

Asian Legend is a fusion of the two types. It's clean and well decorated that it attracts non-Chinese people. The prices are noticeably higher than most places. The food quality is good. Chinese food is famous for using lots of MSG and often leaving you with a greasy after taste. AL's food seemed to have contained either no MSG or very little. This shows that they are cooking using authentic methods using traditional ingredients.

This is a Northern Chinese restaurant. GTA has a greater proportion of Southern Chinese immigrants so the menu selections are noticeably different from the Southern Chinese restaurants. One item that is almost a must when you come to AL are the Shanghai dumplings. 

The service is noticeably better than other Chinese places. You don't have to flag the server down for tea. They regularly fill it up. The restaurant is well staffed and getting help is not a problem. But don't expect Western style pampering where the server tries to make small talk with you.

Overall it's a good introduction to Chinese food. I went to the North York location a long time ago and was very disappointed. This time they've impressed me. And you can tell it's authentic Chinese food because there are plenty of Chinese customers. If a Chinese restaurant doesn't have mainly Chinese customers, you can probably conclude it's not authentic. Asian Legend (at this location at least) is the real deal and well worth the price premium they charge."}
{"text":"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I'll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn't order the best dishes.

We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I'd say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.

To sum up, the food was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and on point. Great prices, and quality of food. We ordered the peking duck (two courses), beef and green onion pancakes, eggplant casserole, fried tofu cubes, green beans, and Xiao Long bao with crab meat. Servers also refilled our team and water constantly. 

Would recommend 100%!"}
{"text":"The food is good. It's pretty standard Shanghai-nese food with dim sum, and main dishes and dessert. 
I like that the quality stays thru all the locations and it's very standardized. 

Service wise, it's a chinese restaurant. We don't have type for politeness. Just wave em down and get to business. 

The downtown location gets a 3 star because of the venue itself. 
It's loud and noisy. And cramped. Sitting on the bench (no cushion) we were really close to the next table. Everyone can hear my conversation and I can here there. You glance sideways, and suddenly you're talking to the next table. People talk loud, and poor acoustics make it louder. Not the best place after a morning hangover

They also have 4-5 rooms downstairs you can book for bigger group."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian Legend location. I love coming here. I enjoy almost everything I order. My friends are in love with the soup dumplings. Unfortunately, I cannot attest to their greatness as they are made with pork, and I don't eat pork. However, my staples are the beef and onion pancakes, crab and corn soup, spicy shredded beef and the stir fried ho fun with beef. Everything is served family style, which is perfect for groups of 3 or more."}
{"text":"We come here for lunch every week. It is not too expensive and have good authentic food. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Service is not the best but the food makes up for that. 

Upon entering, we noticed that there was no one at the host/hostess desk. It took awhile for someone to notice that the front of the restaurant was getting packed. Once we were seated, it took awhile for our server to introduce himself. He then quickly took our order. With 2 red flags in the air, it would probably still be difficult to get someones attention. Do your best and stay patient. The restaurant is crazy packed even on weekdays. Employees are running every which way. 

Soy Sauce, Vinegar, Chili Sauce are on each table. We decided to try the Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef, Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings w/ Crab Meat & Pork, Peeking Duck, Yang Zhou Fried Rice, Stir Fried Ho Fun w/ Beef, Pork Chops with Honey Garlic and House Special Crispy Chicken. Serving sizes are generous.

The Onion Pancake had loads of green onions cooked into the batter. Lots of flavor. Filled with thinly slices beef and slices of green onions. Highly recommended. The  Xiao Long Bao (XLB's/Soup Dumplings) were OK. There are better ones in Canada. The skin was on the dryer side and though the filling was juicy, it was not all that flavorful and quite salty. Their dumplings are excellent, thin smooth skin with juicy and flavorful fillings. They are generous with the servings and the price is right! If you like fried rice, you may want to try their Yang Zhou Fried Rice. It's our favorite type mostly because it isn't drenched with soy sauce. This dish is on the oilier side. The Ho Fun w/ Beef was slightly lacking in flavor but the consistency of the noodles and beef were right on. 

Peeking Duck had a crispy skin. The meat could have been more tender but it wasn't bad. Plenty of pancakes come with the duck so you can get your wrap on. I appreciate that cucumbers, hoison sauce and spring onions accompany this dish without a separate charge. I've been to some restaurants that charge for cucumbers, which I find odd. 

The Pork Chops w/ Honey Garlic were mad good. They were ooey gooey and sticky. Sweet and savory. The coating has a similar consistency as caramel popcorn. The pork chop was juicy and packed with flavor. This dish was definitely a favorite among the table. Similar to caramel popcorn, these suckers will get stuck in between your teeth. The House Special Crispy Chicken was another hit. Lightly crisp skin with tender pieces of meat. Seasoned well and not overly salty. 

We ended with complimentary Red Bean Soup for dessert, which was OK. A bit too watered down and light in flavor but Free. Greatly appreciated. 

Overall, our family had a wonderful meal here and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service,
Debit machine doesn't work 
Asked about the chicken, she told us it's cold 
Waiters was extremely rude and spoke in another language in front of all the customers."}
{"text":"Came on a weekday for lunch since I was in the area. It was nice and quiet and had a comfortable ambience. My friend and I decided to share. We ordered a mapo tofu rice from lunch special, soup dumplings, fried dumplings, and fried tofu with garlic. The lunch menu pricing is pretty decent. One menu is without drink and soup but for cheaper of course - The other menu that includes a soup and an ice tea was around 2 dollars more. Generally, the food was not bad. However, I really didn't enjoy the ice tea that came with the lunch special. It was made wayyyyy too sweet. The other thing I didn't enjoy as much were the soup dumplings. The skin was too thick and one came to the table burst already. I also thought it wasn't soupy enough. I guess it still helps satisfy cravings tho... However, there are many choices out there for it. Overall though, service was okay and there are still many items in the menu still worth trying with this chain. So... I'll be back... eventually."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Favourite dishes are the moo shu and general tsao chicken. The general tsao chicken... so yummy! Deep fried tender morsels of spicy and sweet goodness that melt in your mouth. Healthy it is not!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, food is a little expensive if you compare it to congee Wong for example. 

Their xiao long bao lacks flavour. 

They do however have unique dishes like rice roll with shredded dry pork or their delicious seafood soup. 

Their atmosphere is mediocre. 

Otherwise nothing special about this place."}

This place has been out for a while. The place is designed to look modern, but the place is overall dim, so you can't really notice anything negative or positive. Overall look is average.

Service here was impeccable. Even with a full house and people constantly coming in and out of the restaurant, I felt my table had 2-3 dedicated waiters at our beck and call. However, not everyone there speaks chinese though. Regardless, our plates were changed, soups were served into bowls, teas refilled, and fast paced service. The food just kept non-stop. Definitely top notch service for a chinese cuisine place, and a chain at that. 

My table ordered the 8 person combo, at $238 with green onion rolled pancake with sliced pork, 2 extra orders of Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Ground Pork, and Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Dried Scallops, Pork & Luffa. The combo included, 5 variety cold dish, fish maw soup, peking duck with lettuce wrap upgrade, broccoli and eggs, leg of a pig, seafood veggie mix, steamed fish, mushroom greens, and lobster e-fu noodles.

Let's start off with the extra sides. The steamed dumplings are definitely good. Not as good as Xiao Long Bao that opened up just down on huntingwood, but still better than most places. The green onion pancake with sliced pork is definitely top notch. I find most places skimp on the green onion, the sauce, or/either the amount of pork. This place got it just right!! I was honestly expecting subpar food since this place was a chain, but a lot of the items were above expectations. The ones that shone the most were definitely the 5 variety cold dish taking first, broccoli and eggs taking second, and peking duck takes the third.

The cold dish honestly surprised me, it is usually too cold, making it lack flavour or too hard/chewy to have good texture. This one was bursting with flavour, moist and appetizing. The eggs within the broccoli is usually tame, but this one made my eyes go O_O, \"what is this?\" I typically don't care for this dish, but this was unique. It was strong, but not too salty and it didn't require any vinegar at all. Peking duck taste third, since there was ample meat in each slice, and the mix with the lettuce was crispy and refreshing!

All pictures attached, and definitely recommend people come try, as this chain restaurant is better than some traditionally opened chinese restaurants!"}
{"text":"Living in San Fran for 3 years has made me a bit of a dim sum snob.  But that being said I was very plesently surprised with Asian Legend.  We've been here twice and have loved both expxeriences.

There's no old school carts going around but instead you order off the menu.  Which at first i was a bit sceptical but now i think i like it better because the food is nice a fresh.  Nothing is over greasy, the prices are reasonable and the restaurant is clean.  We loved all the things we got ... oh except the bitter mellon... but we should have known better.  It's not that the restaurant did anything wrong it's just that bitter mellon is BITTER!  Go figure!

Loved the #3 pork steamed dumpling and the pork buns.  The pork buns were steamed then fried and not huge but a cute little bun.  Which was actually better for me because i think sometimes there's too much breading around the pork.    The chicken fried noddles were delicious too.  Seriously, everything is wonderful.  I liked the atmosphere, the cleanliness & the food!

Maybe i should have given it a 5 star???"}
{"text":"Love this place! Too bad I have to drive so far for great Chinese food.

My favs - steam dumplings, pot stickers, wrap, camphor duck... come to think of it EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"It's definitely one of the cleanest restaurants in Chinatown. If this is what you're after read no more. 

We order just two simple noodles, and both disappointed. The spicy noodle was by far the worse. First of all, it wasn't spicy. In fact I can't remember the last time it was spicy. The soup base lack life. Never again will I order this at this location. 

The dai lo mein was missing sea cucumber and a host of other stuff. Felt ripped. Oh well. At least the place looked clean ."}
{"text":"We had a team member who was leaving work to pursue his dream job and we took him out for lunch. This place was suggested and quickly liked by a few.   

The restaurant managers/owners generally I think underestimate the power of mentioning a bit more details on the menu or at least a server who is knowledgeable about ingredients. In the absence of information I went the safest route of ordering a plain congee and a steamed bun. My order would easily have been more than double if the right information was provided. 

So on the limited items that I could have, my review is not a review per se. One cannot mess up a Congee and a bun.

However the food did not arrive all together and out of respect for others, all of us had to wait. Which resulted in food going cold. 

The congee and bun were as good as they can be"}
{"text":"Early dinner Sunday:
- Just 80% full in dining room not too hectic
- awesome stuff, everything is seasoned just right, Excellent!

Eggplant, dim sums, moo su wraps, jelly fish... yummy!

Free sweet soup for dessert"}
{"text":"Not all Asian Legends are the same. This location is one of the better ones on both customer service and food. At least the 15pct gratuity added doesn't feel too bad here."}
{"text":"Until this location changes their substandard noodles to the noodles the other locations offer; I shall not return. Up until lunch time today, I was contemplating using http://www.myfod.ca/ for lunch delivery to the office next week. After today's experience, I am forced to find alternatives.

Their dumplings weren't different from the other locations, but ultimately, this didn't provide the dining mood."}
{"text":"Shanghainese food is their specialty. Been coming here for the same couple of dishes ever since it opened. Portions are very,very decent and quality always the same. Also quite affordable."}
{"text":"Would have given this Asian Legend a higher rating for the food, but my experience was ruined by what happened at the end. We came to Asian Legend with a large group, so tip was automatically added to the bill (which was expected). After paying the bill, the waiter came back angrily asking us why we didn't tip him. I understand that serving staff depend on tips, but this man should have double checked before demanding that we tip him. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for dinner one chilly evening.

The food was fantastic. We ordered pot stickers; snow pea shoots in lemon and garlic; beef and scallion pancake roll; beef shank noodle soup. We ordered other dishes but those were the stars of the show for me. 

Portions are big and the food was flavoursome, hot and well seasoned.  Beef noodle soup is s definite favourite of mine and I have since had this as take out. 

It is quite intimate in terms of the seating and I agree with what others have said regarding the spacing of tables.  The restaurant feels clean; staff were attentive; reasonably priced too. 

Will return for sure."}
{"text":"My friend and I were at the Ravel location. We are very disappointment with both the service and food quality. 

We ordered several dishes. 
Spicy Shredded Beef is not bad, just a bit greasy. Sauteed Green Beans with Dried Shrimp is really bad, beans is not fresh and taste bad...EKK :S
Spare Ribs Wuxi style looks decent, meat is dry and meat texture is tough. 

Finally, hoping to end the night with a better experience and a little sweetness. Waiter strongly recommended Crispy Deep Fried Banana with Toffee, apparently it is the popular dessert dish. Waited for over 45 minutes and finally the dessert arrived.

Interesting way of serving, hot deep fried battered banana with toffee, soaked into a big bowl of ice water. Removed battered banana from the bowl, toffee hardens and served. The taste is pretty good but it sad that the ice water sipped into the batter and it make the inside of the batter soggy.

Terrible experience, very unlikely to return :("}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed because I love Asian Legend (and other location but something happened today where some of the food was terrible and the service mediocre

It was Sunday around 1:30pm and the place was pretty full. 

We got the glutinous rice with the dough fritter in it. I didn't know that they put an egg in it now and you can't get it just with the sugar like normal.  The egg was good, but quite filling.  I wasn't impressed that the saran wrap was loosely wrapped and falling apart. 

We got the green onion pancake filled with beef, except I found it bland and tasteless. 

The sauteed snow pea shoots (dow mui) was really good, but a simple dish.  The xiao long bao with crab meat was good too. 

We got the hot and sour soup, and i just found it to be a big soup with just some hot chilli oil added to it. I wouldn't recommend it. And needed more corn starch to be thicker. 

We also got the rice cakes, they were okay. 

The worst was the red been filled fluffly dough balls.  It's meant to be a egg white flour type bun, light and fluffy, filled with red bean.  Not only did the red bean inside taste funky, but I think the density of the egg white was too much.  It should be thinner, and the egg white was undercooked and mushy. 

In terms of service, they would be attentive, but no one speaks cantonese anymore! And I find it weird to speak english in a chinese restaurant, but I think I will have to!

If I were in the area, I might not come back here, but instead go to Peking Man (although the decor is not the best, the food is much better than this). 

But to be honest, I don't understand why it was so bad."}
{"text":"Nothing about the food here is special, we ordered about 5 dishes and they were all over salted and bland. On top of it there is a giant poster of Steven Harper on the front door of this restaurant, that alone I told my husband I didn't want to eat here, if that was what they were proud of, he convinced me to try it and even he was underwhelmed!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the dim sum. The shui mai was delicious and the soup filled dumplings were good too. We had the corn and crab soup which was amazing and my favorite. Finally, the General Tso chicken was very crispy which I liked, but way too sweet. Brian said it was like candy lol. It could have been spicier which I would have liked. I would like to go back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Shanghai style food, especially their dim sum.  I've visited this place twice and they have been consistent....consistently slow service.  Their soup dumplings are really good, but I've tried their rice cakes, a few hot pots and they were either too tasteless or way over the top with the sauces.  I prefer yummy dumpling/Szechuan garden in first Markham more, which is only a 5 minute drive east on highway 7"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open.

Ample parking. Nicely decorated and lots of room for larger groups (a couple of private rooms in the back).

Food was good...my wife says there were a few dishes that were not the same as the other locations and she was happy with that.

They were good about my kids peanut allergies but we just ordered the same as we always do to keep it safe (well as safe as it can be).

Overall a nice meal, good service and great location."}
{"text":"The food was alright tonight. If I remember correctly his was one of the first AL in Toronto and this location isn't as big as I remembered. 

The menu is easy to order from with lots of pictures. I got my favourite Red Beef Noodle in Soup, but it wasn't as amazing as I've had in the past. I also asked for hand pulled noodles (extra $1) but they gave me thick ones (i didn't specify). Anyone who's knows, knows that bad noodles to soup ratio doesn't make a good meal. the beef was tender and good, but soup didn't have much taste or spicyness to it. ($6.99). 

We also ordered a rice combo. Seems like they added this to the AL menu for folks who weren't into communal chinese dishes. You get rice, ice tea, and some sort of meat dish, on a plate! Strange to eat for me, seems perfect for some others. 

The waiters here aren't the friendliest. They just do their jobs."}
{"text":"Ok fine... your spicy peanut wontons are worthy of 3 stars by themselves... however I will never dine in again.."}
{"text":"Went here with my dad. Service was a little slow but the food was amazing. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was a bit confused when ordering the peking duck because I didn't know it came with these super thin flour wraps. 
The duck was moist and delicious. (5/5) I really liked that it came with a side of challots/green onion and some hoisen. 
The pork soup dumplings were delicious. I didn't find anything special about the green colored dumping. The soup inside these ones was more of a thin broth. 

The rolled onion pancake with slice beef is a decent sized appetizer/snack and was tasty. Reminded me of paratha roti."}
{"text":"I don't usually come to Asian Legend as I find it too crowded and sometimes the food gets a bit oily. So I came here for a dinner party and we had a set dinner for 20 people. Food was alright, surprisingly didn't come out super oily. My favourite dish of the night is the diced duck with the lettuce wrapping and their hand made noodles."}
{"text":"The taste of the food overall is comparable to most other Chinese restaurants in the area. However, I can only give one star because of the poor experience I had with their food and service. When you expect to be chewing on veggies, but instead end up chewing on a wad of paper, I think most people would be put off by that. When we told the server that there was paper in the food, they were extremely accusatory, but eventually gave us a fresh plate of the veggie dish. 

I will note that the decor is nicer than some Chinese restaurants, but that nor the food would encourage me to return after the experience that I had."}
{"text":"Today is Mother's Day and it's busy. Surprising how fast the service still. The food is pretty good. This location is better then the one in Scarborough."}
{"text":"It's sad to come here as a pescatarian now, because I can't eat any of the dishes I used to love including the soup-filled dumplings (which include pork).

However, there's still a range of vegetarian options which include the green-onion pancake (do try), some vege filled dumplings and fried tofu.  The Har Gow is a bit pricey (at more than a dollar a piece), but they come in such huge quantities that you feel quite full after.

Service wasn't horrible, but we noticed that our servers kept accidentally spilling the parts of the dishes, both when they were bringing them to our table and also when they were taking it away.  They left messy stains on their own white tablecloths and just gave off a sense of incompetence as this happens."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Chinese food restaurant. It isn't super quick or cheap, but it's well worth it. Their food is very good and tasty and always good portions. 
My favourites: Shangai noodles, sauteed chinese broccoli and excellent dim sum.
They are friendly and their food is very authentic. 
Yum Yum Dum Sum!"}
{"text":"I've been at this restaurant many times throughout my life in Canada and I'd like to say that their food is really good. Try their xiao long bao if you dont know what to get!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is decent.  I would sort of classify it as Westernized Shanghai style food.  However, for a Chinese restaurant, service can be pretty terrible at times.  The first time, the orders got mixed up.  The second time, my dish came out way ahead of my friends (and while it's not typical for Chinese restaurants to serve food at the same time, it's got to be within 5-10 minutes) and my food came about 15 minutes ahead of my friend's dish.  Also, I expect Chinese food to be served within 10 minutes of ordering, and I think we waited for almost 35-40 minutes for the entire order to complete.  This is not good for a Chinese restaurant.  Granted, this place is very busy, so maybe I'm missing something, but I'm not the biggest fan of this place.  

Much rather go to any other Shanghai style restaurant.  I would classify this as the \"a la carte Spring Rolls\" of Shanghai food."}
{"text":"Asian Legend food is normally good but not this one. They quality is not even half of the other one."}
{"text":"It's a pretty standard Asian Legend location.  Some of the usual dishes that we ordered was pretty similar to other locations (soup dumplings) though some of the other dishes were a bit different, for better or for worse.  For example, the appetizer dish - sliced pork with spicy chili sauce - features thicker slices than the one in Chinatown.

Service we had was fantastic though."}
{"text":"i experience the service to be fast which is good.  also they have pretty good variety.  ive personally been to tastier chinese restaurants and therefore based on that standard i would say 3/5.  the restaurant decor is good.  its nice inside clean and modern."}
{"text":"The decor here is nice
relatively good service
parking lot is horrible
always full house, make reservations or prepare to wait
the food is good, the soup dumplings have a nice thin wrapper with good amount of soup and meat. the fried bun that you dip in sweet condensed milk is nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the shanghai noodles have a really nice texture."}
{"text":"Julie 

Whew... had a feast at this spot last night. Needed some good Chinese food and spotted lots of items on their menu that I wanted to have so headed over and here's a list of what we had...... 

Apps.... 
1) Juicy Buns of course... Xiao Lun Bao. Had the pork only.. Good 3*** 
2) Pork and Crabmeat version of Xiao Lun Bao. Much better than the pork only version and top item on the menu for me. 4**** 
3) Steamed Glutinous Rice. Typical and nothing special. 3*** 
3a) Beef stuffed in sesame biscuit was tasty 4**** 

Cold Apps 
4) Beef Shank was ok 3*** 
5) Jelly Fish was pretty good 4**** 
6) Wheat Gluten (Kau Fu) was terrible. This is one of my things to get at a Shanghainese restaurant so I know what to look for and this place made it taste like a sponge 1* 

Soup 
7) Hot and Sour with Chicken. No real flavor and forgettable 2** 

Entree 
8) Peking Duck was served with one plate of the good meat and skin and one plate of the cut up bone parts. Never seen it this way but I guess they want to make sure you get the whole duck. The meat was a bit fatty but overall, not too bad. The cucumber are cut way too thick and messes with the taste when you put it in the wrap. 3*** 
9) Steamed Whole Bass was ok. Didn't do it for me as the fish just didn't taste fresh... 2** 
10) Pork Chop with Honey Garlic Sauce was too sweet and meat was not tender. I tried to get them to do it peking style and they stared at me like I was crazy. 2** 
11) Dry Sauteed String Beans flavorful and well made 4**** 
12) Yang Zhou Fried Rice was fine. You can't really screw this one up. 3*** 

Desserts 
13) Crispy Deep Fried Bananas. Terrible. The banana was basically caramelized and smothered with the chewy and overly sweet covering making it almost inedible. 1* 
14) Mango Pudding. Not good either.. Bland and almost a bit bitter. What up??? 1* 
15) Sweet Rice Dumpling with Sesame Filling. Finally a dessert that was worthy. The rice balls were excellent in a soup with taro and tapioca and definitely the thing to get. 4**** 

Overall, the experience was average. Food is decent. The wait staff is NOT attentive and hard to get their attention. I had to ask for new plates and for things to be taken away. You walk in and the restaurant feels very contemporary but you end up getting the typical Chinatown bad service experience. I'm just overly picky but the rest of my party REALLLY enjoyed themselves...."}
{"text":"While in Toronto, I stopped by in Chinatown for dim sum.  I ordered many of the steamed soup filled dumplings and the steamed dumplings.

Everything was very tasty and I would definitely come back.  I am used to Cantonese dim sum with waiters pushing tray carts and dumplings made to order.  Being from Los Angeles, I am quite particular and spoiled about dim sum.  

I wish I had more time in Toronto.  I would have visited other Chinese restaurants for variety.  I am glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Came back here today for an early lunch on Saturday. Things seemed to be a bit better. The food was good today. We had the steam pork Shanghai buns, green onion cake, fried noodle with pork chop, cha chuen noodle with sliced cucumber on top, beef lettuce wrap. The service was attentive and several servers were helping my table. Very polite service today as well. If this restaurant improves things it could be a great place. However I'm still waiting. Will check back in a few months if there is are any lasting changes for the better."}
{"text":"What happened to Asian legend ? The last few times I went the food was not on point . The Peking duck was very dry and we also ordered the shrimp and scallop stir fry with beans. On the picture it was suppose to be big scallops but instead were the tiny ones. The service was horrible as well, all new staff. They don't come and pick up your plates when the dish is empty. Most likely will not be returning"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant ever. The restaurant looks great but services and foods are horrible compare to the appearance of the restaurant.
I ordered pecking duck. The price is $40. I,'m not complaining about the price... Surprisingly a waitress carved the duck!!! at the corner of the restaurant and it was awful! Usually a professional come to the table and carve the duck in front of the customer but waitress? Far back??? I ordered some more green onion and cucumber but never got them. I ordered more tea but never... If the price of foods are little more than other restaurant, customers expect more quality services but it was below average. Food and services are way below average."}
{"text":"great dim sum place! great selection of soup dumplings! and a lot of northern chinese dishes... a little pricey but very anglo friendly for those who need to \"ease\" their friends into asian fare... nice private rooms downstairs for bigger groups!"}
{"text":"Asian Legend used to be one of my favourite places to eat probably because it was decorated fairly well and the food was pretty good and it was in a good location. I stopped coming here though because I wasn't in the area as much. 

Anyways, I would recommend coming here early, because the lines can get pretty MASSIVE when you come here for dinner. Walking in, the décor felt very Western, but the servers, menu and dishes were fairly Asian styled. I thought this was more of a Shanghai Cuisine, but they currently offer dimsum and many Chinese dishes and classify themselves as a Chinese restaurant, so I guess I can't argue with that. 

I got their ???? which had a pretty standard price for $6 for 6, that's about $1 per xiao long bao. Yes, it's pretty expensive, but I could taste the soup from these dumplings and they didn't have the bad smelling pork taste to it, which gives it extra points. They have two other versions of xiao long bao which are: ????? the steamed soup filled dumplings with dried scallops, pork and luffa which are green and are $6.99 for 6. They also have the crab meat xiao long bao which is $7.99 for 6. 

I also always get the ????? Braised Beef Noodle Soup, which I think is pretty average tasting (not too spicy), but for $8.99 for a regular sized bowl. That's probably one of the reasons why I stopped coming. I found decent options in other Shanghai restaurants for decent quality food and a good price."}
{"text":"I didn't want to like this place. Too fancy for Chinatown and the prices oh so slightly more than the other holes-in-the-walls in the hood. After reading reviews on the soup dumplings, I had to go. 

Random Notes: 
1. Pork soup dumplings - pretty damned good but it's no 'Joe's Shanghai' in NY. Only six (smaller) dumplings to an order (most places have eight) and more than $1 per. Quality was quite good, but not as soupy as I like. Still, very good. 
2. Kung Pao chicken did not illicit a reaction nearly as memorable as George's from Seinfeld, but was a tasty dish nonetheless. I suspect the peppers were either flash deep fried or cooked in a lot of oil. 
3. They actually serve the dan-dan noodle. They tasted like they could be house made. That being said, they're not very flavorful. This dish is forgettable but not regrettable. 
4. Thursday at 9:30pm = empty. 
5. Good -- seeing a lot of good service from Asian places lately, this scares me. 

I like this place a lot. Going to try dim sum there soon. Maybe even try a UYE on for size!"}
{"text":"I remembered when I moved to Toronto 3 years ago, I only go here when I got homesick. Only the food here has a nearly real northeastern Chinese taste."}
{"text":"The food wasn't good, tried four dishes of random options on the menu, hot n sour soup, shrimp shanghai noodle, general tao, and stir fry shredded pork. The dish was either too salty or had no flavour. The waitress kept talking to me and my boyfriend in Chinese and we have no idea what she is saying, we just spoke in English. The wait for the food was long, after finally receiving all the dishes, the waitress never came to check on us and asking for extra napkin or a glass of water is damn hard as the waitress is nowhere to be seen. We are the meal and wanted to pay for our meals to leave and yet again , waitress is nowhere to be found. The best part about this place is the fact that they don't want to give you back your change, meal was $61.44 . Gave $80 cause had no other bill besides 20's and they wanted to keep as their tip..uhhhh...I don't understand why these Chinese restaurants ALWAYS feel like their entitled to whatever tip they think they should be getting. Never have a problem with other ethic restaurants, always the Chinese ones that leave a bad taste"}
{"text":"Very bad service and very average food. We went there today (a group of 3) with good expectations. 

We were greeted by a non smiling waiter, which was okay with us until the following episode: I ordered a dish and when it arrived I realized that was not what I had meant to order. I very politely asked our waiter if I could change my dish (which at that point hadn't even been touched), and he said straight out: \"I can't\", with no further explanation. When we said that most restaurants would have accepted this request and if he preferred to instead lose three potential customers, he continue to say: \"we don't do that\". 

Well I tried to eat my food (even though it was not what I wanted at all). Before that I had a wonton soup that's was honestly very bland. My two dinner companions were not impressed at all. I, for sure, will never be going back to that location.

If you want good quality chinese food and much better service, you should try Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine very close by (160 E Beaver Creek Rd #4-6, Richmond Hill)."}
{"text":"I have to say the food her is average. The service here is okay. But for the prices on their menu I was expecting more in the quality of the food. I think the only thing that I liked was the dumplings. Everything else we had ordered, was below average."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, ordered a bunch of dishes including snow peas shoot, Kung Pao chicken, and a few other dishes meant for sharing and consuming with steamed rice.  Food was on the salty side.  Two stars because for an Asian restaurants, they failed the steamed rice to me.  The rice was a little dry, perhaps not enough water used to cook it."}
{"text":"Asian legend is really good i recommend the spicy peanut soup its spicy and delicious:)"}
{"text":"Great place to hold your banquet.  They've got plenty of capacity and fairly classy decor.  I especially liked the meat appetizer plate, which came with quite a large variety of meats; the lettuce-wrapped mushu pork; and Peking duck."}
{"text":"Food and service were both good. I was surprised at their better-than-average Chinese restaurant service. Tea was refilled, and they were always quick when we needed service.

We had hot and sour soup, sticky rice with pork floss and fried egg, xiao long bao, green onion pancake, shanghainesr noodles, and toffee banana for dessert. The soup and banana were definitely something worth re-ordering the next time. The pancake, sticky rice and XL bao were average. Typical for a taiwanese/shanghai restaurant. 

Overall, we were pleasantly surprised at the above average service, and the food wasn't disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here for a farewell party for a group of 24 people.  Our table decided to go with a set meal plan for 10.  The highlight dishes included peking duck wraps, large squares of braised pork belly, and the lettuce wraps.  They also included a soup starter, steamed fish, a rice dish, a noodle dish, and some veggies.

The food wasn't amazing but it was done well and satisfying.  It was more than enough food to feed 10 and we ended up having leftovers.

This is a great value-for-money place that is great for groups.  The service is fast and the food comes flying out the kitchen. :-)"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Scarborough hands down. Atmosphere is really cool. While you eat there is this very zen music in the background. Decor is like modern/asian. Food is really really good! Private rooms as well. 

+Steamed Shrimp Dumplings = mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Came here for a large group lunch celebration and occupied 2 large tables with our group of 20+ ppl. Amongst us were 4 kids, all under 4 years old. With a group like ours, having change tables and breastfeeding-appropriate-areas now play a part in choosing where we bring our business. 

Like always, the food was delicious and consistent. Ordered our favourite go-to dishes: soup filled dumplings, beef and green onion roll, pan fried buns, pork pot stickers, braised beef soup noodles, green onion pancakes, shanghai fried noodles, broccoli with egg and crab. Well-seasoned food, good portions and attentive service, what more could you ask for? 

Well, when I went to change my daughter's diaper I remembered why it's been awhile since we've come to this Asian Legend-- no change tables (or space) to change a baby in the bathroom downstairs. Had to change my daughter standing up and it was not an easy process. I decided to speak to the manager in order to suggest installing a change table downstairs and met a very pleasant woman who was attentive to my concern. 

What I learned is that there are actually 2 bathrooms on the main level, around the corner from the window where you can watch dumplings being made. In one of the bathrooms, the staff had placed 3 chairs side by side to form a makeshift bench for parents like me. In the back there are more (then unoccupied) dining areas for private bookings I assume, which could be used for moms who need some quiet space for breastfeeding. I suggested putting up signage downstairs to inform other parents looking for a change table. She also told me that they had purchased a change table but was having challenges installing it which is why it wasn't up yet. She asked me to spread the word regarding the makeshift change are upstairs to other parents in the meantime."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, but compared to the one at Ravel, it's not quite as excellent.  The xiao long bao, seasoned soy milk, green beans etc were all great, but the pan fried pork and chicken dumplings were not so good - too much meat, and not crispy.  I also didn't care for the sesame biscuit with egg and dried pork.  But still a great choice for lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always come here every time I'm in Toronto.  Note it's a bit more glammed up than many other Shanghainese/Taiwanese breakfast places, but it's very reliable.  We always order the same things - seasoned soy bean soup, glutinous rice roll, xiao long bao, four seasons string beans.  This location is always very packed, compared to the one on Yonge at least."}
{"text":"I have a looong history with this restaurant. When I used to live in Toronto as a kid, my parents and I would come here almost every week for lunch on Sundays. So when I came back to visit the city after many years of being gone, I of course had to come eat at my old stomping grounds. It's gone through a renovation that has turned it into a really good looking space, and the food is just as good as I remember. The fried dumplings with chive/egg/shrimp filling and the fried rice noodles with beef are my favorites--super delicious and a really filling lunch."}
{"text":"This place is pretty popular. Expanded to I think in the GTA region, around three stores. People at work really like to go here. it's relatively cheap and filling. Portions are pretty big, so expect to be taking home a doggie bag if you're ordering for one. 

Popular items are the steamed pork dumplings and the green onion pancake. I enjoy the dan dan spicy noodle in peanut sauce and the cold spicy noodle in peanut sauce. Watch out though because their food has quite a bit of garlic. ask them to go lite on the garlic if that's not your thing. 

Parking is sorta a pain in the area. There's a lot to the south of the restaurant, but you have to pay (Green P parking). There's also street parking in front of the restaurant, but remember to put money in, they patrol Yonge street pretty regularly. 

The only other advice I can give, is not to  feel the need to eat everything on your plate, or else you'll eat up falling asleep after your meal.."}
{"text":"Menu has big selection. Food is very good. Service was friendly and quick. The restaurant is a little hard to find located in an off street shopping plaza. It helps to know Chinese :-j"}
{"text":"I'm impressed that this is a (small) chain restaurant.  The food is authentic and on par with some of the best in Los Angeles and Vancouver. 

The braised beef noodle soup was a standout.  The soup flavor was really good.  The preserved vegetables and pork noodle soup was solid but nothing to write home about.  

Their dumplings were solid and so were the Siu Mai. 

My recommendation would be to get the braised beef noodle soup with the handmade noodles."}
{"text":"A pretty good restaurant for its price range. Not the quietest place, but good for family/group gatherings. Service is quite good

Food: come in large portions with a very reasonable price 

They give you free red bean soup as dessert. It's really tasty too. (If u like sweet stuff that is lol)"}

{"text":"Our go to alternative to dim sum, our usual include steamed soup filled dumplings, pan fried dumplings, rolled onion pancake, glutinous rice roll Andrés bean pancake.  Always good here"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Surprised how many people there were. Handed menus. We didn't realize we had to write our orders down ourselves until we tried to order and the waitress told us to write it down. This has happened to me at a number of different places, and it has never irked me before. This time, it did. I know why, too. It's because all the other places that ask me to to write down my own order are little diner-esque places. Asian Legend is not a diner-esque place. It's a proper sit-down restaurant. I expect better service because of it. The prices I'm paying sort of demand it (Yes, I know that the prices aren't exorbitant by any account, but my logic is that I wouldn't expect as much service at Tim Hortons as I would from a fine dining restaurant). 

Had:

Rolled onion pancake with sliced beef ($5.99) - a tad more pricey for this item than I'm used to, but I'm okay with that because Asian Legend is supposedly a bit more upscale than the other places I usually get this item at. The beef is tender, although I wish there was a tad bit more of it. The pancake is slightly flaky. I wish it was a tad more crisp, and a tad thinner. I'm also used to this having sweet sauce (or more sweet sauce) inside of it, and this one didn't have it. That all being said, I'm a sucker for rolled onion pancakes with sliced beef.

Boiled dumplings with pork and chives ($5.50) - comes with 10 dumplings. I didn't order this one, but I had three or four. They taste like the ones you buy frozen and boil yourself. I might as well do that at home.

Moo Shu pork with 6 pancakes ($11.99) - I don't know where other than Asian Legend to get this. I'm quite a fan of this dish, and I order it almost every time I go to any of the Asian Legend locations. It's shredded pork, carrots, wood ear fungus, cabbage, egg, etc. It comes with crepe-like pancakes, and is served with hoisin sauce. It's high in veggie content, but isn't vegetarian. I feel like I'm eating healthier than I could be (increase in veggies), but I'm still getting my meat. The portion of shredded stuff to pancake is a tad ridiculous. I could have twice as many pancakes and still have stuffing left. I think that's part of a scam to make you buy more pancakes ($0.60 each, and you have to order them in pairs. The waitress didn't let us know about the ordering in pairs thing when she told us the price. We told her we wanted an odd number, and she left and then came back and told us about the pairs thing. Um..okay). 

Good stuff, but not quite good enough to make me a fan..just yet."}
{"text":"Is it just me, or are the portions shrinking? Well, the rolled onion pancake with sliced beef, anyways. It's still very yummy, but it seems much smaller than usual. Less beef and smaller pancake? My brother's piece also wasn't hot enough. 

Braised beef noodle in soup seems to have risen in price by quite a bit. About $9.50 now. That's quite a bit for a bowl of beef noodle soup. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't pay $9.50 for it.

Fried tofu was good. $3.99. Decent portion. Probably the most worthwhile thing we ordered today. 

143 (no number) - cold noodle with shredded cucumber in chili oil? Yeah. Lacked depth. Sauce was vinegar and chili oil. I expected that. I expected a savory component that I did not find (for example, a touch of soy sauce). For $6.99/$7.99 (I forget which), I did not find this worth it at all. So easy to make. One thing I did find slightly mystifying was that they used a spice that I have yet to be able to distinguish. I really want to say it tasted like lemongrass, but since when do they use that in Northern Chinese cuisine? All in all, I won't be ordering this again.

Hit and miss here. I'll still most likely be back."}
{"text":"I was kinda skeptical with this branch of Asian Legend because over the last few years, every restaurant to set up shop at this location has failed or was simply not good however AL has met my needs for Shanghai type food in my area. 

I'd rate as 3.5 as not amazingly awesome but good enough, I'm ok with rounding up. 

Seating is no problem compared to Scarborough location where it's a mad house. 

There is also parking at the back and they reimburse you $2 for every $20 you spend. 
There is also a back entrance door that many are not aware of you happen to park at the back. 

I usually get the typical items, sweet sour soup, pork dumplings, pan fried onion cake and noodles. I did try the sticky rice cakes but would not recommend it, in general it's a tough dish to make I think. 

All in all I would recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Used to be our \"nice\" dining place when we lived in downtown. 
I believed the steamed items and roast duck are fine. Safe to order. Service is okay.

Don't try other dishes like stirring fried vermicelli (poor portion and bland, for all the Cantonese dishes,I recommend congee Wong nearby) or traditional Chinese dishes like fish flavoured pork slices(?????, sweat & sour fish is a big joke...check out my photos--it's even a joke for the Westerners, okay? It's basically just deep fried fish fillets with warmed ketchup..

I had stomachache right after dining there and low fever which lasted for 3 days . (My husband was fine) 
We ordered a bunch of things, the fish flavoured pork slices is the only one he didn't eat. So...

I like their frozen dumplings, cheaper to buy it in T&T. But hey, are you supposed to be an above average Chinese restaurant first? Come on..."}
{"text":"Had lunch there with 2 colleagues.  The lunch menu was pretty good at about 8 bucks a dish but portions were on the smallish side.
The food was ok. Not amazing but good enough.
The location is nice. It's a standalone business and the atmosphere is great. Bathrooms were awesome too :)"}
{"text":"had high hopes for this new Asian eatery in my hood, but the quality of the food is seriously lacking, portions are relatively smaller compared to the restaurant next door and noticeably pricier.  I had wanted to try northern cuisine but it's just meh, they do offer traditional dishes and even some North American Chinese dishes but they were just alright. service was good and you can tell they were making a serious effort,  but it couldn't make up for the pricey and poor quality dishes coming from the kitchen,  the decor is commendable for its take on modern Asian, but feels over the top in an overcompensating/distracting way given the food it serves."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here tonight.

my girlfriend and I came here for date night. she is allergic to cellantro and we wrote in big letters on the order form and clarified to the staff that we can't have cellantro on anything.

first dish that arrives, my girlfriend takes a bite and the dumpling is packed with cellantro. we call the waiter over and explains that we can't have the dish. he apologies and said he'll bring the dish back.

30 seconds later this other staff name Carol comes over and rudely tells us that there no cellantro in the dish. I tell her sorry we can't have it because it'll make my girlfriend sick and the thing is packed with cellantro. she gave us tons of attitude and storms away, goes to the kitchen and tells her friends in a loud voice that the customers are the table are retarded... 

I go over to confront her and she said that she didn't say it. my girlfriend and I leave the restaurant and one of the employees comes out to apologize. I asked him if he heard her call us retarded and he confirms that he heard it also... 

this staff Carol definitely needs to be disciplined. that is no way to treat customers. even if we are wrong and there is no cellantro in the dumplings, we should not be referred to as restards.

I am never coming back to this restaurant or any Asian Legend location. I will tell this story to all my friends and coworkers and advise them not to support this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Asian legend location in the GTA! Excellent, attentive service and food are delicious. 

Price might not be the cheapest but is worth my money. Soup dumpling is up to our standard. Pan fried dumpling and pork ribs noodles are amazing. Basically everything that's made with flour in this location is good!! You can never go wrong with it. The only downside is that there are not enough  parking spots."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in years! The atmosphere was nice the green tea delicious and the food quite good."}
{"text":"I love Asian Legend, however this location is just terrible. Every single dish we ordered wasn't close to what they would be at the other locations (I've been to the Highway 7 and the Dundas locations). The dumplings didn't seem fresh, the fried rice had shrimp that tasted undercooked, the peanut dumplings had too much salt and fish sauce overpowering the dish, and the general tso chicken barely had chicken - it was just fried dough with popcorn sized chicken bits without the usual sauce (See picture). 

The service was just awful. Server barely came to our table and she insisted that I fill in the order form for her with the numbers. To make things worse, they also had a table near us that had kitchen staff coming and going to eat with their full chef uniforms on (apron and all) - I don't think I've ever seen that and somehow I don't think it's code. 

Fair to say that I'll be going back to the other locations and will avoid this particular location."}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant a few times now and I can say that the food is solid. Not the best Chinese food I've had but nonetheless the food is good here.

I'm a fan of dumplings so I tend to order different types each time I'm here. So far I've enjoyed each type that I've tried (steam soup filled and vegetarian). Hope to try them all some day. We also had the mapo tofu which is our favourite dish here and we've also had fried rice and meat dishes which were good as well.

The food arrived quickly and the servers were fairly friendly and checked in on us often so I am pleased with the service. In terms of the restaurant space itself, they have tables on two floors. They usually do not open up the tables downstairs unless it is packed upstairs so there is quite a bit of space in the restaurant. 

If you're in the Chinatown area Asian Legend is a fairly good option if you're craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"So this is really my consistent go-to for downtown Chinese food even though it principally violates a few fundamental Chinese restaurant rules, one - more expensive than average,  two - you pay for the service and decor, three, certain dishes are over oiled and over garliced in the non-Asian style.

But, you have to admit that there really aren't many options downtown where a venture to the bathroom makes you feel dirtier after you've done the deed. 

The soup dumplings are pretty darn good quality, especially the ones with crab meat - option #1. Also, they have a decent selection of veggies and tofu dishes. The pork belly is delicious is cooked properly. Still, the service seems spottier especially when there is a crowd and having to wait 30 mins for rice when all your other dishes have arrived is ridiculous. 

Nevertheless, I'll keep coming back. Just wish there was somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"Chili chicken was so, so salty we had  it taken back to the kitchen. They  cooked another  identical dish but if was still too salty.  Cooks should dial down the sodium in their dishes. Not very impressed... The  shrimp/pork wonton soup was good  but the noodles could have been less soggy. Service was fast but servers need to smile and engage either their customers a bit more..."}
{"text":"I like it here. Food is tasty, prices are fair, atmosphere is clean and service here isn't so bad. Love their drunken chicken and soup filled dumplings. There are other great choice on the menu too."}
{"text":"I imagine ordering at Asian Legend for the first time is kind of like casting out a fishing net and seeing what you get...

They do some of the pseudo Chinese dishes though it's not their specialty, so if you're looking for Chicken w Cashews, Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour, etc, you may not be impressed.

But they do some \"Northern\" Chinese dishes consistently well which is hard to find in the city, even one as multicultural as Toronto. I say \"Northern\" Chinese but to me this type of food has always just been Chinese food but with so many different styles of Chinese food I guess they've had to define it as \"Northern\". Northern in this case I assume refers to Beijing though they have a wide selection of traditional Chinese dishes.

Now I'll be honest, I've had better food in Asia and if you're a purist then I'm afraid you'll not find a adequate substitute here but I've taken many people here from all cultures and they've always been happy with the food.

Plus they're one of the cleaner places in Chinatown which helps if you're entertaining and it's a fun place to bring larger groups and eat family style affordably. Tables of 10 welcome!

If you're looking for things to order here are my recommendations in order of amazingness:

Steamed pork soup dumplings (we usually come here just for this dish)
Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef
Sauteed Green Beans with Dried Shrimp (but I always ask for garlic instead of dried shrimp, I think they've actually changed it to garlic but haven't updated the menu)
Stir Fried Ho Fun w Beef
Moo Shu Chicken
Shredded Pork w Sweet Peking Sauce
Fried Tofu
And they do a decent peking duck which is always fun if you're with larger groups.

These are super safe dishes for those who are new to Chinese food. I'd imagine that if you're not, you'll probably know what to order on your own.

I've just realized that I usually go with non-Chinese people so I've actually not tried some of my favourite Chinese dishes like Dong Po Pork, Shredded Chicken w Noodles, Beef Noodle Soup, and Braised or Sauteed Eggplant. 

I'll have to make a point to try them next time and update accordingly... stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Usually not a big fan of chinese food but this place had some great food. Went with my family and we all ordered different dishes and everybody was satisfied.. Good food and good portions. Also the price wasn't bad."}
{"text":"An unbeatable $8 lunch.  That's what I found when I stopped in to try this Northern Asian restaurant fighting for position among a dozen other Asian restaurants.  the lunch menu choices were interesting and authentic-no \"sweet and sour\" as I recall.  I ordered the Green Beans with Beef, which is sautéed in bold flavours and a rich gravy.  Including a bowl of rice and bowl of soup, it is a complete meal.

I also ordered a Hot and Sour Soup, one of my faves as a further comparison point.  Nicely flavoured, with just the right heat, I took most of it home and finished it later.  It was still great.

I have been in a couple of times, noting the dominantly Asian clientele, and observing the fast service and enjoying the addicting aromas passing my table.  The menu is also a treat, with a ton of choices and high quality photos to get the tastebuds quivering.  This is a place you visit many times to sample the great variety.  But get there early-they are packed for lunch!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to eat Chinese food in Toronto. I've taken my family and friends and everyone is always pleased with the experience.

My go-to-orders include chicken fried rice, steamed soup pork dumplings, and the sweet and sour chicken. The chicken fried rice is so delicious I've honestly had a hard time finding any other restaurant that can replicate the taste. The sweet and sour chicken is crispy and juicy. The soup dumplings are always a crowd favourite and fun to eat!

The service is decent and the prices are very fair. I love the interior, it's fancy and comfortable. A nice place to go on a date although it is very loud upstairs during dinner on the weekends. To avoid that, ask to be seated downstairs if possible.

Overall, you can't go wrong eating here. The food is delicious and made in a reasonable amount of time at a good price."}
{"text":"Updating my review for this restaurant.  Was back here on a Friday night and was surprised that parking was plentiful and the restaurant was not packed.  So it was a nice evening for a meal (my mom's birthday).  Service was excellent and the food was, once again, very good.  I was so glad that the place was not crowded with people and the noise level was to a minimal."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on saturday. Really good spot for some casual dim sum!  The steamed shrimp dumpling was the best, highly recommend! We also ordered chicken potstickers which were fresh and shared the shredded pork noodle soup with pickled greens which was good to share. The one thing we got that I wouldnt get again is the soup filled green dumplings with shrimp and pork... they were ok. The service was attentive which made this experience good. Some other dim sum places around are just as tasty but lack service so i was impressed. I would definitely come back to try some new items!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good for family gathering lunch or dinner. Try out their lunch special. Price is decent. Service is good. Not a lot of parking space and the entrance of the restaurant is a high risk for car collision, watch out if you are about to go to this restaurant after reading my review."}
{"text":"First time here, tucked into a little strip plaza and conveniently close to apres-lunch bubble tea joints.  Service wasn't as slow as some reviewers seem to have experienced - but perhaps that was due to being in a big group and the socializing helped to make the time go faster.  The food was a nice array of soup dumplings and spicy meat dishes which had a good amount of kick - reminiscent of hakka in many ways, but I'm no expert so I'm sure there's a lot of people who'd call me crazy for saying that.  

I do wish they would have brought the soup dumplings before the spicy dishes - the spice is so powerful that it takes away the more delicate dumpling flavours.  Overall though, not bad and I'd come back again.

ps. White guy bonus - the menus have pictures!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean and tidy!  most impeccable service I have ever received.  Staff were super attentive- they always come to you before you request.  Food tastes delicious.  Food comes fairly quick.  From start to finish is an awesome experience!  Can not wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The best dumplings, whoa. My Chinese mother-in-law requested we spend our Easter lunch here. That means A LOT!"}
{"text":"Excellent Shanghainese/Taiwanese food. Probably one of the best in Toronto. There are a few Asian Legend restaurants in Toronto but this is without a doubt the best one in Ontario. 

Must order dumplings and other famous Shanghainese dishes (xiao long bao is a must!). Prices are extremely fair as well. You will come out full and still have enough money to go shopping ;-D"}
{"text":"We came to Asian Legend late on a weekday and I thought it would be empty, but surprisingly, there were a few tables and people were still coming into the restaurant while we were eating.
I remember coming to this restaurant when I was young and from what I remember it was good. There are a few locations around Toronto and this is a pretty well-known chain. It definitely did not disappoint as I came with my family who came from Edmonton and they loved the food! 
We ordered siu lung bao (steamed soup dumpling), tea smoked duck, stir fried garlic snow pea leaf, seafood soup casserole and shanghai fried noodles. I have to say that the seafood soup casserole did not look like the picture in the menu; however, it was quite tasty with a variety of seafood, meat and vegetables. It was definitely a really good chinese \"comfort\" dish and the soup was not too salty- it didn't feel like they put MSG in it, which is awesome!
The tea smoked duck was very tasty. The texture of the shanghai noodles were perfect, not too soft and just the right amount of chewiness. 
As it was late and we were hungry, the food came quickly and we were all quite satisfied. Even though there were at least 4 tables that sat down after us after 8:45pm, the service was great and we were happy with the food and experience!"}
{"text":"First off, the sign \"Asian Legend\" is a little hidden behind all the other neon signage from the other restaurants on the street. The food quality and quantity is a little worse off than the other Asian Legend restaurants uptown (Richmond Hill, Markham, etc.). E.g. the xiao lung bao (small soup dumplings) have skin that's thicker and the Shanghai noodles are smaller, the chive \"cake\" has a thicker skin and is less tasty overall. Otherwise, the food has the same price and menu options as their other stores uptown.

The waiter/waitresses here are generally polite but seem to struggle with their English, and primarily communicate in Mandarin. The customer base here also seem very comfortable with communicating solely in Mandarin too. Note that the store itself is fairly small and a long rectangle with the washroom on the lower level down a very dark narrow hallway (which is mildly creepy seeming). Otherwise, if you're craving some Shanghai food, this is a decent option in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for Shanghai food! Tucked away in a corner of the row of restaurants, this place is almost always packed and bustling with people during their lunch and dinner times. We came for dinner on a Friday night at around 7pm and had to wait around 10 minutes to be seated. We ordered around 5 plates of food, including a wonderful dessert, but the order in which our food arrived was a bit baffling. Our cold noodle with chicken appetizer actually came very last with a small reminder to the waitstaff.

A small portion of their sweet and spicy soup was already a large soup bowl, so something nice to share around the table if you'd also like to try other foods. Overall, their food quality is great, in particular their smoked chicken and candied apple. They also have candied banana, but you can't mix 4 pieces of banana with apple, so we went for the apple. It was so delicious, with a thin coat of maple syrup/candy around the fruit. It's dipped in ice cold water when brought to your table, so it's a nice show and unique food.

After the dinner rush and near the end of our meal, their waitstaff and chefs did begin to have their dinners in nearby seats. Very reasonable prices for their food quality and variety - such a large menu with unique and traditional Shanghai food! Will definitely be back for more fantastic meals!"}
{"text":"Ten of us came here for a big family dinner to celebrate my mother's birthday.  We called in advance to make our reservation and found a table awaiting us upon arrival.  We were able to get wheel my grandmother into the restaurant without any difficulty and we were all seated comfortably at a round table.

I observed private dining areas behind us, which would've been even better had they been available, but the noise-level in the restaurant was under control and we could all hear each other without a problem.

It took a little while before our orders were taken, and because we had such a large number of vegetarians with us, our choices were rather limited.  I did the ordering for the group and tried to mix up all the vegetarian options; unfortunately I didn't realize that there were so many variants of \"green stuff\" and we ended up with four plates of green veggie dishes that looked essentially the same (of which the dry sauteed green beans were tops)!  Nonetheless, the vegetarians quite enjoyed the hot & sour soup (which we had customized for them), the deep fried tofu, the shredded radish roll, and the eggplant.  In retrospect, I would've probably ordered doubles of the last three dishes.

As one of the few meat eaters on the table, I had the responsibility of devouring the onion pc roll with szechuan beef (very tasty), the kung pao chicken (hit the spot), the steamed green bass (not bad) and the soup filled dumplings (mouth-watering).  Mission accomplished.

Once the food started arriving, we requested hot sauce, which came in a small dish and was finished within minutes.  They then brought us a rack of spices, which was also completely finished by the end of the meal.  What can I say, my family likes it hot!

Overall, everyone enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere was perfect.  We all ate to our hearts content for only $20 per person (tax & tip included).  Two thumbs way up for Asian Legend!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for the first time and just wanted some decent asian food, walked into this place and was pleasantly surprised. Price was ok and food was pretty good. We tried some new things like the beef pancakes, fried bread (dip in sweet condensed milk), shanghai dumplings, half peking duck and fried rice. 

Only thing that I have had the in the past was the shanghai dumplings of course, these were pretty good since it was juicy and flavorful.

Since it was the first time trying the beef pancake and fried bread, i don't have a comparison but they were pretty decent. I probably wouldn't order it again since I tried it once before - its too much carbs honestly, i prefer more meat. 

Half peking duck was over cooked - not great
Fried Rice - was okay 

It was a pretty long wait for this place but it was probably the best of all the other options at the peak dinner time."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me as a great spot to get some Northern-Style Chinese food.  There were quite a few items that looked pretty appetizing on the menu that I was looking forward to trying here.  A good indicator that helps you spot out good and bad restaurants is the amount of traffic they have at peak hours.  This place did have pretty good traffic, so I wanted to give this place a try.

I must say I was disappointed in the quality of food that was served.  This place seems to have the brand name that the Asian Legend carries, but this location did not serve out good food that you would expect.  Much of the food was a little bland and on the dry side.  

This place does have positives though.  The restaurant definitely fills up.  There seems to be a good crowd, but the seating can become a little crowded at peak hours.  They have a service request device on the tables which will allow you to ask for common things like bill, beverage, service & cancel at the touch of a button.  Some of the attendants have pagers where they get notified right away and come quickly to provide service.  That is a plus!!

With this place being a chain, possible that I just had a bad experience with the food.  But I am open to trying out other locations and hopefully other locations are better."}
{"text":"Spent a full day at the zoo last weekend, and came here for dinner after finding it on yelp.  Parking lot is not very big, so had to park in the back of the next plaza.  Was told 30 mins wait.  With 1 pregnant and a little one, normally we would not wait that long, but it was getting late and probably would have to wait everywhere else as well.  Ended up waiting 1 hour to be seated.  They should have some chairs out front.

Decor was very nice.  I always thought this was a western style chinese place, and was pleasantly surprised to find it was actually traditional chinese.  

Steamed dumpling was great, Sesame Biscuit Stuffed w/Egg & Meat Floss was good too. Was not too big on the Shanghai Style Fried Noodles, not much taste, but fried rice was good.  Everything came first, then the fried rice.  Has to ask about the noodles near the end of the meal, and it arrived within few minutes, but I am pretty sure they forgot about it.  

Very busy place, will definitely return with more people to try the duck and other items I did not get to try. And definitely make reservations."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings are on par with Din Tai Fong and the sliced beef scallion pancakes were pretty good. I also really liked the beef noodle soup... I haven't had such tender beef cubes before and I was really surprised.  I would give it 5 stars for the food but had a very big problem with their tableware.  I'm not sure how they wash their dishes but I smelled bleach on all my plates/chopsticks/cups.  It was nauseating and had to make them switch it out.  My advice is to do it HK style and give everything a quick tea rinse with before using it."}
{"text":"Living in Korea Town and a stone's throw from Chinatown, I eat Asian food at least four days a week.

On the recommendation of a friend, whose last name happens to be Cheng (a good sign), my husband and I popped into Asian Legend for lunch on Saturday.

The restaurant was spotless and although it was busy, we were seated right away (albeit touching elbows with the people on either side of us).

Our order was exclusively dim sum: chicken pot-stickers, steamed soup-filled pork dumplings and veggie dumplings.

Everything arrived piping hot and within 10 minutes. Plus, no mystery meat here - we could pinpoint every ingredient in all three dishes. Our server was also super sweet, which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"Service was horrible and food was mediocre. We were a party of 3 and there had been a couple ahead of us. They were given #1 and we were given #2. When the couple were seated then logically the next available 4 top table should have been ours. That did not happen. The head waiter gave that table away to the couple that came in after us.  And when we were finally seated the head waiter berated us for not ordering ahead of time. When the food came it was not piping hot. The pan-fried dumplings were soggy and the Shanghai noodles were way too oily. We felt absolutely rushed to order, eat and leave. I think next time we will travel a little further to the North York location or Scarborough location instead"}
{"text":"I love restaurants that are consistent with food quality and Asian Legend is one. The dumplings are generally finely done (e.g. not too thick on the dough) and the franchises have the best hot and sour soup pretty much city wide. The menu is huge and I have never had anything that is under par. The main problem is the 2 inches between you and the next table. It's just too close and can be really quite loud. Not great if you want a quiet date night."}
{"text":"This place makes certain things very well. The spicy shredded beef, pickled chilli fish, garlic shrimp and a few other items. It can be inconsistent in terms of flavour so the same dish can be just fantastic one day and just ok the next. They seem to serve a lot of people at a time so the attention to each customers order is obviously not top notch but they have recipes that work and I eat from there pretty regularly because it's close to my office, it's not too expensive and it's another half decent option for food selection in this area"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely hopeless. Patrons are waiving to get the attention of waiters who steadfastly ignore them. I had to help a fellow patron by pointing out to an annoyed waiter that someone was trying to pay the bill. I like their food but they simply don't care about their customers at this location"}
{"text":"Came here on a chilly Sunday morning after hanging out at the AGO just down the street. We had to wait about 20 minutes, which we were expecting, on a Sunday morning. 

We ordered the soup dumplings (naturally) as well as green onion pancakes, the beef wrapped in pancakes, the dandan noodles, and some spring rolls. The food came quickly, even though the place was busy, and overall, the food was excellent. The spring rolls in particular were awesome, and we loved the beef wrapped with onion pancake. My criticisms: The green onion pancakes were not as crunchy as I've had, and the dandan noodles, although tasty, were somewhat simple and homogenous. 

My friend who has not had much Shanghainese food thoroughly enjoyed himself. For the price and quality, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I always come to this place for shanghai food but this time is really disappointing. Service and food was really bad. I ordered a tofu dish which the tofu was sour. I told the server about it and she insist that their tofu is fresh. They took it back to the kitchen and came back out with the same dish telling me that there's no problem with it.  I have no problem paying for it but is really bad bring it back out on my table. I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Went here this past Sunday - quite busy!  But since we only had 2 people we were seated quickly (although close to the door so we were a bit cold).  The service is pretty fast considering it was a full house.  

the menu is pretty extensive - they even have a separate chef's special menu.  We chose a couple of dim sum and some fried pancake thing with onion/chives (YUM!!) and some fried rice.  Everything was deee-lish!  I would def go back here again.  Can always tell a good restaurant if people of that ethnicity actually eat there :)"}
{"text":"This place is packed at night. And for a good reason. The food is very good. Just to make something clear before I finish this review, you can ask for hand made noodles instead of the pre-made ones. I prefer the hand made noodles a lot better than the pre-made ones.

Decor is good. Service is fast. Menu is also in english. This is one of my favorite chinese places in Toronto and whenever I'm back, I usually try and hit this place up. The dumplings are delicious. I highly recommend the steamed pork dumplings. They are very good. Just be careful not to break the dumpling because there is a soup inside which when mixed with the dumpling, is very delicious. I also recommend getting the pan fried pork dumplings. There's 4 in an order so you may want to get some more as they are fantastic.

The chunky beef with noodles is a personal favorite. I usually go with my family so we order a lot of food and share them. With this dish, we always tell them that we want the hand-made noodles because they taste so much better with the broth.

The sauteed snow pea shoots with garlic are a very good vegetable dish as is the sauteed green beans. I usually order one of these two. We sometimes add on a Surimi with Brocoli because that is very good when mixed with the egg.

Fried rice is always the Yang Zhou Fried Rice."}
{"text":"Went in for the shanghai style rice cake with shrimp and beef soup, very little beef and shrimp was in the soup and the lettuce inside the soup was kind of old. Service was decent but quality for the price wasn't worth it. Won't be return back here."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior. Food was okay but I find the cheaper Chinese places have better tasting food. If you want Chinese food with a nice environment, this is the place to go. Otherwise I would recommend congee queen/time/won or downtown Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"The eager beavers me and my friend are...we anxious went here for brunch.  Our noses were pressed up against the window wondering why they weren't open yet and then realized they open at 11am on Sundays and it was 10:50am.  So we nonchalantly went back to  he car to wait it out.  When we finally  walked in at 11:03am we were one of the first ones here.  This location is pretty big - I am sure it could seat well over 100 people.  It has a clean feel to it, with some architectural details on the walls. We ordered a variety of dim sum - chicken pot stickers (ok..nothing to really get excited about) and some onion pancake roll with sliced beef.  I really liked the way the flavours all melted to together for this.  It was one of my fave dishes of the brunch.  Shrimp dumplings - can't really screw this up and some beef noodle dish rounded out the brunch.  As we stuffed ourselves silly we couldn't help notice how fast the staff would be over to clear up the empty plates.  Actually it felt a tiny bit creepy how they would stalk the tables looking at you and just waiting for that empty plate.  But I would rather have this over dirty dishes just sitting there so I will let it slide.  I wouldn't say the staff is overly friendly...but how can they been when they have super sonic hand motions to whisk away the plates..they don't have time to smile!  Overall it satisfied our needs and now I am sitting here like a big lump writing this review because I am soooooo full

Lots of parking and this is good location if you have a large group."}
{"text":"I have been to Asian Legend many times (mostly at their Hwy 7 and Leslie location) and have never been dissapointed. Their food is different than most chinese restaurants you will go to and I find that their food can be described as a bit of `modern chinese` (this coming from a gwai-loh so I might not know what I`m talking about haha)

The atmosphere of the restaurant is always lively and they have a lot of waiters to take care of your needs. Going in big groups is always recommended as that way you can share and sample a lot of their food (they have a lot of food selection).

Must Have`s:
 - Soup-filled dumplings - absolutely amazing! 
 - Most of their soups, I generally don`t like soup but they just have such unique tastes

ABSOLUTE must-have:
 - Red bean Pancake - one of the best desserts ever!!

All in all, I don`t think you will be dissapointed with what Asian Legend will serve you, they have a lot of locations all around Toronto so definitely try them out. They have started to grow a lot recently and it is obvious why."}

{"text":"Without question the worst cashew nut chicken I ever unfortunately ordered...
Smaller than most restaurants portions, to top it off; $18.01 for garbage food.
There are many WRONGS in this world; a bad meal is pretty low in the grand scheme of things/life.  BUT; a garbage meal is still a garbage meal.  Staff looked miserable, absolutely unpleasant.  I don't need an ass-kissing or TLC at a fast food Chinese restaurant, this was depressing.  Waste of money, waste of time."}
{"text":"Came here for vacation about half a year ago (going through a backlog of restaurant reviews right now). The xiao long bao was great; my Shanghainese grandparents approved of them. The cold meats sampler was lackluster. We got some kind of vegetable and I think another seafood item as well, both of which were pretty good but nothing special. Still a solid choice, though."}
{"text":"We were here today, there was a pretty large group of us (15 ppl-ish).  Anyways, as per usual, we ordered a lot of food.

I personally really like the beef and green onion roll.  We ordered several plates of dumplings, sadly most of them were pork (my cousin ordered not realizing that my sister doesn't eat pork or beef).  Regardless, it was delicious.  The pork dumplings are tastier than the chicken ones in my opinion.  After the dumplings were served, they brought out plates of veggies (green beans and spinach), then the rice and noodle dishes.  

There was lots of variety, so no one went hungry.

The service was pretty good, considering it was a larger group.  Street parking was readily available, but I think there is also a lot right next door.

I think I'd prefer other locations, b/c this one is semi-inconvenient, but the food is pretty much the same at each location, so you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Slow service took fifty minutes to get a fried pancake. Had to call them twice. Sticky rice wrapped in non food safe plastic bag. I never seen it done anywhere."}
{"text":"Friday nights is a good idea to make reservations.

Great food.  Fast service, it's our favorite chain restaurant.  

We went again on a Friday night without a reservation and I have to applaud the wait staff, the cooks and management.

After a short wait they found a table for us. In the back, behind a panel near the emergency exit.  (Felt like we were in a private room... cool) I was simply glad to have a table without the wait.

Seconds later our first server is here with hot tea and the menus. We placed an order for the appetizer right away as we were afraid we'd have to wait a long time.

A few minutes later we placed the order, then received our app within minutes. (It's a cold dish mind you but still impressive)

The rest of the order followed promptly and was hot and fresh. Quality and taste of the food is always a constant excellent at this location.

Hot delicious food for 3 people, a bill under $40 served within 20 minutes on a busy Friday night deserves 6 stars, get 5 from the heading and 1 extra star here *."}
{"text":"How come all of the Chinese restaurants suck in Richmond Hill now. What used to be a good place to eat Chinese food, when first opened. Now this place is overpriced lacking service and food quality has dropped drastically.... we order a beef sirloin and vegetable dish, which was vastly overpriced 15.99$ it was more of a vegetarian dish with little to no beef at all. To top it all off the beef tasted sour as shit..... we ordered that dish plus this spicy wonton dish. With 2 bowls of rice the total was 35$ lol not sure how much longer Asian legend can stay in business with this overpriced garbage..."}
{"text":"Yay, the restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated. I like the Peking roasted duck and toufu soup very much. Two ways to eat the duck were both very good, one was duck and crispy skin wrapped with green onion, cucumber and sweet bean paste, another one was fried duck bone wrapped with cabbage. We also ordered toufu soup, fried eggplant, green onion fried beef and three-cups chicken stew. All dishes were delicious although a little greasy. This branch is better than the downtown one because the food seemed to be more authentic."}
{"text":"For Mother's Day yesterday, I chose to go to Asian Legend.
The food I chose on the dim sum menu appeared delectable - 
crab soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, beef rolled in scallion pancakes, spring rolls, pork fried dumplings and then there was the mapo tofu, a noodle dish with beef and baby bok choy in garlic sauce.  
Clearly, for myself, my husband and our 2 year old daughter, my eyes were bigger than my stomach and we wound up taking home the entree dishes.  Initially, I thought the food was pretty good - well presented, quickly delivered to our table piping hot.  It wasn't until my husband found a piece of plastic in one of the crab soup dumplings, and then later, he found a small hard white mass that looked like someone's fallen out tooth, that my feelings towards this restaurant went sour.  After brunch, I was desperately parched.  Turns out, so was my husband.  We also felt that we didn't need to eat for hours afterwards.  I can't help but think that not only is the food sodium heavy, but perhaps some MSG as well?  I will never go back here again - the leftovers were thrown out with today's trash.  For dim sum, next time I'll go to the Queens Quay and eat at Pearl."}
{"text":"As you all know by now I LOVE dumplings and am always on the hunt for a serious grade A dumpling.  Now Asian Legend isn't exactly a dumpling house, but damn do they make good dumplings.

First of all, of course, their soup filled dumplings are off the hook.  Definitely best I've had recently.  The good thing about them is that they have a really thin dough with a good amount of soup in the middle.  A MUST order.  If you feel like a baller you can even order the ones with crab and such.  I'm not a baller, I go for the original, which is amazing.

Other notables that should be on your Joe's recommended list are the smoked duck which is what fantastic would taste like if it was made into a food.  Seriously... try the smoked duck, it's really good.  The shanghai thick noodles and chili beef noodle soups are also bomb.  Go with these and you will surely have one of the best experiences you've had in a while.

Now one thing that I usually never order is desert (I'm more of a main course kind of guy).  However, try the fried \"un see guin\" (I guess the english translation is fried dough hair thing?, don't worry, you don't look stupid asking for it... I think?).  It's basically fried dough, that they serve with condensed milk.  AMAZING!  

This is one of my favourite restaurants in Richmond Hill, take my list of things to order and give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I always like going to Asian Legend. But when I step foot into this Scarborough location, I was like \"Wow\" this is quite posh looking compare to other ones I've been to. They had high ceilings and all wooden pattern details on the ceiling and walls. At the far end there was nice sliding door rooms, which were also nicely decorated with wooden pattern doors and walls. I usually order the steamed pork dumplings with soup inside, they are so delis. I also order green onion pancakes, beef pancake rolls, and pan fried dumplings. I would definitely come here again for the great food and ambience."}
{"text":"Gosh, ya know, I love dim sum. So when I had an opportunity to go, I sure as heck jumped at the chance. Sadly, very disappointed by everything except the restaurant design.

Each dish just had no zest, no flavour. Whether it was the shu mai, steam filled dumplings, the tofu and the overly dry rolled onion pancake with beef.  

I did not try anything from the menu that wasn't dim sum but to be honest I was full and very disheartened at what I had already eaten.  Rather than order more, I ended up just eating the rice  with the tofu sauce."}
{"text":"Best authentic chinese food in Vaughan . shanghai noodles are ti die for and the seafood tofu soup is amazing"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is terrible and after a few trips, I've come to the realization that it's not going to get better. Case in point today: we ordered the large deep fried egg white with red bean paste - it's an order of 8 and when our order came out, they decided to split it at the last minute because another table ordered 4. It requires 20min to prepare so they said they'd serve us the 4 and wrap the other half to go - we never asked for our order to be wrapped to go. So they took the 4 back that were already prepared and told us they'd make us a brand new order, requiring another wait. How does this make any sense? 
If you're fine with crappy service, by all means come, but this is my last visit to this locat"}
{"text":"ordered their soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and one shredded radish pancake. dont understand why everyone seems to like their XLB so much, the skin is way too thin (lack texture), and the meat inside tastes funny (either they didnt use fresh pork, or the dumpling's been sitting around for way too long)."}
{"text":"My experience at this Asian Legend out of like 3 times have all been terrible. The wait time wasn't so terrible (10 minutes) during dinner time on a Friday but they did serve two other guests before us that came after us. I'll let that one go. We got seated at a gloomy corner behind one of the cashier booth, we can literally touch their screen and keyboard, THEY SHOULD REALLY GET RID of this table! Its not worth seating anyone here, its awkward and you feel disconnected from the whole restaurant atmosphere. 

The staff does not speak good english so expect to be frustrated as they look clueless when you ask about the menu. 

We ordered the braise pork balls and when we sliced the ball in half, the PORK WAS RAW. So we asked the waiter to look at it, he said \"its like that!\". We were like no way you can eat this, IT WAS STILL MUSHY AND PINK. Then he brought it to the floor manager, and he quickly glanced at it and said \"yah yah its good\" and he places it back  on our table. The waiter even said, look at the dumplings, they all like this. So we did, and the dumplings was cooked and grey looking, not mushy and pink like the braised pork balls. At this point we lost our appetite and knew the management will not do anything. 

We will never go back to this location. And I suggest you guys go to other locations. This is 2012 and serving raw pork, where is the quality control?"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a reasonably priced and delicious meal. I recommend the crabmeat and corn soup, the pan fried egg, onion, and chives appetizer, the mu shu chicken, the Cantonese chow mein, and the sizzling beef plate....oh and if u like tofu get the pan fried tofu with egg. The sauces and seasonings are spot on and delicious. Soups and appetizers are all around $5 and mains are in and around the $10-$15 range."}
{"text":"Salty, can't taste anything else. Probably one of the worst Chinese food experiences."}
{"text":"The thing with dim sum style restaurants is that (like the old expression goes) often you don't know what you got 'til it's gone. So, in this instance, its you wouldn't know how good this place is until you've been somewhere where it's really not as good and then regret not going back here. 

Friends recommended this very clean and busy Chinese restaurant on Dundas just a block west of the AGO. I had heard that it was owned by the same company as Spring Rolls (the sign outside also uses the same font) but was told it isn't, which is a relief (street free would have been flushed right down the drain if it had been). The atmosphere is bright and comfortable . The clients are almost all Chinese which to me speaks to its authenticity. We ordered dumplings, beef ho fun, and actually...more dumplings! But the food was really good. Very tasty. The Ho Fun was excellent. The dumplings arrived with some vinaigrette to dip them in which did not disappoint. Service was quick. 

I'd have liked to try more of the menu, but my dinner group wasn't very hungry (save for me), so it had to wait for another day. Servings are a bit smaller than Spadina joints, but are still enough to keep you full.

Worth the trip"}
{"text":"Far from legendary, this Chinatown hotspot had some major culinary shortcomings.

The space is actually quite nice and the service is quick and responsive allowing for fast table turnover in the popular, no reservations restaurant.

My girlfriend and I went because we wanted to enjoy some of Toronto's legendary Chinatown cuisine and were in the mood for some xiaolongbao and the place was highly touted online. We were seated after roughly a 15 minute wait that was in line with what the waitress/maitre d' had suggested. There was a tea kettle on the table with tea cups that was strangely just hot water and was not removed from the table even though we didn't order tea and they did not add complementary tea to the kettle at any point of the meal adding clutter to a smallish but otherwise adequate table space.

The food itself was really lacking. We ordered their #1 pork and crabmeat xiaolongbao that was OK but not great by any means. We also had their #2, a dried scallop shrimp and luffa xiaolongbao in a spinach infused wrapper that had a completely flavorless brothy filling. We also had a fried pork bun that had a completely flavorless pork filling that could potentially have been completely unseasoned and an incredibly thick and wide wrapper that had pockets of scalding oil inside of them that were dangerous to eat and scalded my entire mouth. 

The two bright spots: We also had a scallion pancake that was rolled and filled with shredded beef that was enjoyable but nothing special. The green beans in garlic, dried shrimp and other spices were actually quite nice as well.

Overall, not worth the time or the hype. The price is reasonable but I would certainly not go back voluntarily."}
{"text":"The food here was incredible, full stop. But if you're going for the dining experience and looking for top-notch, attentive service, this is not the place for you. 

When you go in, you're seated and given a piece of paper and a pencil, on which you're expected to write your food/beverage order. When you're ready, you hold it out and someone eventually notices and comes by to grab it and take it away. The food will come in random order (I got my main course before my soup dumplings) and no one is going to come back and check to see how your food is. 

So, if you go in knowing all this, but knowing you're going to get an excellent meal from start to finish, with very fresh, very hot food and a dining experience that moves quickly, you'll be fine. And you won't be sorry you visited, because really--fantastic food."}
{"text":"For this review, I used my Android phone to write and continuously updated it. When we arrived, we were quickly seated. Food was very fast to arrive to our table. Atmosphere is friendly and welcoming.  

 The first dish was dumpling pork with chive and it was very tasty.The shanghai style fried noodles were tasty but very oily. The soup-filled steamed bun was average. Hot and sour soup was tasty and was not too spicy. 

Chunky beef noodle arrived at the table and tasted amazing. The house special fried noodle was very oily.  The last dish was the pan fried green onion cake and it was average

Overall the food was oily but still tasted delicious. Portion sizes size is just right. The decor is nice and modern. The service is impeccable and very friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone who enjoys authentic chinese food. Although it was a disappointment from my last review, Asian Legend continues to impress."}
{"text":"Food greatness, thus far, has led me to another magical gem. Located yonder, in the midst of Commerce Gate and Times Square in Richmond Hill, here lies Asian Legend. The successful chain of restaurants, sets precedence of food that never disappoints. I only realized later I did not write a review for the current location. 

Ending my strenuous day of work, I decided to venture here for a great takeout dinner. Arriving at the restaurant, I decided to order: Chunky Beef Noodle Soup, Hot and Sour Soup, and Mapo Tofu. My stomach growled loud, as my mind was in dire need of food. And at last, the food arrives and I drove towards home.

The Chunky Beef Noodle Soup tasted amazing. The soup was brewed to perfection and the noodles absorbed the tasty flavor. Each bite was more satisfying than the last. 

The hot and sour soup was spicy. I wiped tears and sweat as each bite I consumed increased the burning sensation. The soup itself was brewed to perfection. The bamboo shoots and carrots complemented nicely. 

The Mapo Tofu was extremely spicy, of spices that burned my mouth. Despite the side of rice to ease the pain, the tofu was unbearable. After a few bites, I rushed towards my cup and drank cold water. Several moments later of manly tears, I finished the Mapo Tofu. 

Asian Legend satisfied my hunger and thus considered food greatness. The food was spicy yet was delicious within each bite. Although this location is not the best, sally forth here, as your hunger instincts will not regret the decision."}
{"text":"This restaurant is what I like to call the \"maestro of All Asian Legends\". This restaurant really defines itself as a top restaurant in North York and demonstrating what Shanghai food is. I have been going to this restaurant for 2 years and it never seems to have any major flaws. The food here is authentic and always proportioned welled. The flavors are amazing and remind me of China. The food comes out quick and hot. Also, the servers are great and are always welcoming. They are responsive and always happy to take your order. Along with the great food , the restaurant decor feels amazing and looks like a true restaurant. I recommend this restaurant to everyone. This restaurant deserves my 5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good quality food with a wide selection.  For a chain Asian restaurant it is very good. Love the soupy dumplings! 
Service is good and the price points are fair."}
{"text":"Hands down the best general tao chicken in town! The vegetable egg fried rice is super good too.. I always order these two dishes. The kung pao chicken is great too, I ask for extra peanut in it and they are always nice enough to add extra!

I wouldn't order the chicken wings again or the wonton in spicy peanut sauce though..

Ordered through Ubereats."}
{"text":"Asian Legend is good, but short of amazing. Here are a few key points:

1. The dumplings are excellent. The soups are good, but a bit salty. The duck is average. On a whole, I found a couple of items to be too salty, but most things were pretty good.
2. Despite other critical reviews, this place does a brisk business. It is popular among the local Asian community.
3. The service here is absolutely horrible. If you want nothing but the hot tea they bring out and your food, you may be fine. Otherwise, you will not be offered anything else, plates will never be cleared, nothing.
4. The menu here is quite extensive. You can order a plate of very North American buffet style Chinese, or more regional/ authentic cuisine. They also serve dim sum style portions. Prices are somewhat reasonable.
5. The restaurant is loud. It is a difficult place to have a conversation.

In conclusion, you can eat a lot here for an ok price. You might like it. If you want service or ambiance, forget it."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is nice very high ceilings. We were a group of eight and decide to get one of the combos recommended for 7-8 people. It was a lot of food I would say it good for 9-10 people. The highlight of the combo would be the roasted duck. The roasted duck is a two course meal. First course is the skin of the duck with a flour wrap and 2nd course is the meat stirfried with a lettuce wraps. 

The combo okay I would recommend order separate dishes"}
{"text":"Solid Chinese cuisine in a stylish environment. The service was good but the food took a long while to come so lost some points there. The soup filled pork dumplings were done perfectly and worth the wait. The skin is so thin that they sometimes break from rough chopstick handling. Snow pea sprouts were tender but the sauce was gloppy. A good meal but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent Peking Duck! Succulent and tasty. Reasonably priced at $39.99, but there is extra charge for Duck soup.  Good choices for Dim Sum. Well arranged menu with illustrations."}
{"text":"I always passed by this place, but never went inside it. I finally went with a friend the other day on Christmas Eve, and the place was PACKED. However, we quickly got a seat because it was only for 2. We had the following: steamed soup filled juicy pork dumplings (delicious!), braised bamboo shoots (good, but oily), hot and sour soup (really well-done), and fried rice cake shanghai style (good, but a bit bland). We were really filled, and the food was quite good.Service was good too considering the amount of people that were there. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Overall, good experience. But there are not many dim sum choice, but the dim sum they have are delicious; the other courses are good, normal. The environment is fine."}
{"text":"Read this is 3.5. Peking duck was overall good. Service was decent but the kitchen was slow. There werent many tables left being it was past 9PM and yet it took forever for it to come out. And instead of doing it in two separate orders like the usually do, with the peking coming first and the duck/lettuce wrap second; it all came out at the same time.

I will try Peking Man next time and compare to see which is better."}
{"text":"Given the variance of the reviews, I think we fell on the lucky end of the spectrum. We had friendly servers and generally great food. We got the duck, fried dumplings, meat roll, egg white with crab meat and broccoli, and dan dan noodles. Apart from the noodles (which had no peanut flavor) and the fried dumplings (they weren't potstickers and had a flimsy texture), everything else was good.

The duck came with thin chinese style pancake/tortillas and crunchy cucumbers, and along with the sweet sauce, tastes rich and refreshing at the same time. If you like diy, then good news, you get to wrap it however you want. The egg white with crab meat and broccoli had a perfect savory taste and the egg was done just right where it slides down to your stomach and warms you up as you swallow it. Meat roll is also worth a try! Tons of beef wrapped in a chewy thick pancake.

That's it for the food description - now for the more personal side - two of us couldn't speak mandarin well but tried to, and the server was cool. Corrected us whenever we fumbled into something awkward. At some point, though, she was like, so... tell me what's the number? lol"}
{"text":"So first off -- we love \"the Legend\", have been to many locations and love their crab+pork soup dumplings, beef roll ups and noodle dishes.

For the most part -- this place was spot on -- the food was the same wonderful dumplings that we are used to.  So folks, this is Shanghai dim sum - not like a lot of the other trad Cantonese style.  No - you won't find carts --YES, the dumplings will come hot and fresh to the table.

Quite a large space and lots of different rooms including a number that would allow for private parties (up to 14 people).  

We had some crab/pork soup dumplings, pan fried pork dumplings, cantonese chow mein and Moo Shu Pork as well. 
Everything hit the spot for me except for the Moo Shu Pork and the service.
I found the pancakes a bit hard and there didn't seem to be much pork in the dish.

Also, it was not exactly busy, but we had a real challenge (twice) trying to get a waitress to help us, and candidly, well she was not too friendly.

We are used to the friendly, bustle of the other \"Legends\", so we hope this was a one off.

We were so excited to see one open up close to us -- so we will give them another chance -- and we still love those dumplings!"}
{"text":"I love the \"Legend\".  I mostly enjoy this one and the one on Dundas.

Here the crab and pork soup dumplings are the best. 
If you like shanghai dim sum, it is a great place to go.

Favs include:
Pork soup dumplings
Beef roll ups
Pork pan fried dumplings
Moo shu pork
Beef flat noodle
Cantonese Chow Mein
Wontons in Spicy Peanut sauce
...and so much more

Today we saw the Peking Duck being prepared for someone and it looked fabulous.... next time!!

Modern decor, good service, great food quality.
Also, they have a VIP card which costs $15 a year, but gives you 10% off your bill.  If you enjoy this dining spot as much as we do... SOOOOO worth it.

Note - the parking lot can be challenging but there is a parking garage that a lot of folks don't seem to use, but we always find a spot there if not outside."}
{"text":"I have come here on and off over the years.  

PRO: 
Consistent quality and authentic northern food
Not expensive at all, especially for lunch
10% VIP card is valid even with credit card (some Chinese restaurants give 10% off on cash only even with VIP card)
Nice interior decoration
Effective service if you get to talk to them
Clean bathroom

CON: 
Insane parking at lunch and dinner time
Take reservation for group only
Under staffed 

The first thing I noticed when I walked in here was that the restaurant was big.  The second thing I noticed was the really high ceiling and the rest of the tasteful decoration.  This restaurant was crowded every time I had been here.   The food was delicious every time I had been here, lunch and dinner.  My favourite dish is the Peking duck.  However, I cannot even remember any dish that is less than good; any difference in opinion will most likely be contributable to personal preferences, such as how spicy and how salty.  If you prefer less oily dishes, please remember to mention it when ordering, since northern Chinese food is oilier by tradition."}
{"text":"This is a smaller Asian Legend compared to the uptown siblings.  We came in as a group of 6.  The set up of the restaurants cater more to smaller group, so it was a longer wait for one of the very few big tables.  When seated, waiter was quick with tea and order taking.  We ordered dumplings, eggplant stir fry, bean sprouts stir fry, green onion pancake, hot beef noodle and a dessert.  The food was standard Asian Legend food, meaning an above-above, consistent standard.  The only thing that caught my attention was the eggplant stir fry. It tasted like eggplant stir fired in a saucy hot and sour soup.  I am not sure this is the same way at other Asian Legend locations.  Would this be a modification of the original recipe, to cater to a more Westernized downtown clientele?

The decor is more modern and comtemporary than some uptown locations.  Is it another modification to cater to the a more Westernized downtown clientele?"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Usually not disappointed with the quality of food or portion sizes. Conveniently located and usually there is no wait. Service is mediocre, but we keep coming back because the food is good."}
{"text":"This is one of our family go to places for Shanghainese/Northern Chinese food. Most dishes are consistently good and portions are great. They also have a good variety of dishes on their menu. Service is pretty good too."}
{"text":"my girlfriend and I decided to try this place for Christmas eve dinner. Although very busy even at almost 9pm, we quickly got seated. the service is fast but it does take a bit of waiting to get the attention of the servers (it was a busy night so understandable). the food tasted great. I tend to eat things as \"natural\" as possible so many food tasted a bit too salty for me, but my girlfriend loved it. assorted seafood fried rice, crispy half chicken, spicy pork chops, dim sum, and bok choi with crab sauce were all great. the drinks are on pricey side so we only drank water and tea."}
{"text":"Love the decor. It's upbeat and stylish. The food is great and high class. It is like the other Asian legends. The service was okay and the server was well mannered. All the staff are new so they would need to get experience over time. The location is close to wonderland and Vaughan mills mall. Overall this is one of the best chinese food in Vaughan."}
{"text":"This has one of the best high quality chinese food in china town. The food is a bit over average but the food is definitely worth the money. The soup filled dumpling were the best and the fried rice was amazing. Everything else is great. The washrooms were very clean. There were private rooms so we enjoyed the great privacy. There was a bell in our room so we had great service."}
{"text":"A group of 5 of us ventured into the new Asian Legend located in a plaza near the Jane/Major Mac intersection. One of the group frequently visits another Asian Legend  location and has always raved about the food. Based on her ravings about the place, we decided to give it a go on a Friday night.
As our friend was here before, she wrote down our selections and passed it to the waiter. I don't know if this is par for the course here, but I noticed small pads of paper on most tables and a pencil as well. Perhaps it's done this way to avoid confusion, as the menu is fairly large. Anyways...it worked and we received all the items ordered. 
We ordered far too many dishes to comment on them all, so I'll list some of the hits and misses
* Steam Soup filled Dumplings with Ground Pork - the person who recommended this place said this is one of her favorite dishes at Asian Legend, so she loved it. Being a \"newbie\", I found it interesting. Not sure I would order it again, as it was a bit salty for my liking, but it's a neat combination of items.
* rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef - the onion flavor is fairly light. I found it to be a bit on the gummy side (I had an end piece)  but all my dining companions loved this dish. 
* Vegetarian  Spring Rolls - ugh. Not very good unfortunately. I've purchased frozen ones better than what we were served. 
* General Tao Chicken - had a nice heat to it, generous portion size. Very good.
* Stir Fried Spicy Shredded Beef - complex flavours which were completed overwhelmed by far TOO much salt. Generous portion size. 
* Fried Sliced Noodles with Sliced Beef - pretty flavorless 
* Sautéed Baby Bok Choi with Garlic - the hit it of the meal. Cooked perfectly with an intoxicating aroma of garlic. Perhaps the best I've ever had at a restaurant.

Our male waiter was very good. When we saw a dish on someone else's table we asked what it was and asked for it. He came back laughing a minute later to inform us we had included that item in our original order. He was attentive and friendly. 

So, based on some of what were ordered, a few dishes were definitely misses, some were fantastic. I'll most likely visit again just to sample more items."}
{"text":"side note: we were in a higher class/ private room, so experiences may be different 

atmosphere: really fancy and clean - also, this building is MASSIVE.

{"text":"Fantastic food. Large servings. Great service. Our favourite 'Chinese food' restaurant."}
{"text":"Jumping straight to the food -- it's decent, definitely better than anything else in Vaughan. With regards to specific menu items, I did not find the dumplings particularly good. Maybe I've just developed a distaste for overly thick dumpling wrappers. We ordered a soup of some kind; I can't remember what it was called but it was the vegetarian one (side note for any vegetarians out there: there are actually a decent number of vegetarian options on the menu). The soup was surprisingly quite tasty. There is also an interesting rice called the \"Shanghai steamed rice,\" which serves basically as an alternative to your standard white rice. The Shanghai steamed rice is salted white rice mixed in with some veggies. NOTE that the rice is actually cooked in with some sort of animal fat to give it some flavour and moistness (I think it might be lard), so be careful about ordering this if you've reason to be. I really wish that they would be more descriptive in the menu.

As for the space, it is large and comfortable with decent decor. Large would also describe the menu as well -- the options seem endless. But this is nothing surprising compared to the typical Chinese restaurant. I suspect that the Asian Legends that I've been to in Scarborough/Markham may be a bit better, but I've never quite had the most discerning palate when it comes to northern Chinese cuisine. Something unique to this location is that they will put your order in and then come back with little tickets with your order and stick them to your table, checking off the items as they arrive. I've seen this done at the occasional Chinese restaurant, but I don't think I recall this from Asian Legend in particular.

Asian Legend is definitely a welcome addition to the Vaughan food scene, and for that they get 4 stars from me. That's not because they are doing anything remarkably well though; it's just that there's a serious shortage of decent Chinese restaurants in Vaughan. Asian Legend comes in to save the day, saving Vaughan citizens from having to necessarily trek down to Richmond Hill for Chinese."}
{"text":"I'm not unfamiliar with Asian Legend - excluding this one, I've been to three of their other locations (Vaughan, North York at Leslie/Finch, and Scarborough). I've not the most discerning palate to distinguish between all of the different locations (unlike some of my friends), but I do know that this Markham location stands out - frankly, my experience here was the worst out of all of them.

We ordered a number of different items: a lamb dish, the Peking/Beijing duck, mapo tofu, an eggplant dish, green beans, and some veggies. 

The two meat dishes were good. The lamb was a touch salty but it was masked by the spice, so that wasn't a big deal. Unfortunately, this didn't apply to the rest of the dishes. The mapo tofu barely had any kick to it and its flavour was predominantly salt. The eggplant and green beans were so salty and oily that I was tempted to rinse it off in the tea. Again, I'm no stranger to Asian Legend or northern cuisine, I can handle food that's heavier on the sauces/seasonings, but this location was overboard. Even some of my companions, who normally like Asian Legend, shared the same sentiments. The highlight of the meal was the dessert soup that came with the meal at the end. It was taro based and very good. 

Service was ok, more or less standard for a Chinese restaurant. Servers all seemed to have decent mastery of the English language in case you're wondering (that's noteworthy in Markham). Food arrived fairly quickly though they did forget one of our dishes and claimed to us that all of the food had arrived when it in fact had not. The location is also very small compared to the other Asian Legends, and they are pretty busy, so if you are going to come with a large group, your best bet is to make a reservation.

Prices are slightly higher than most Chinese restaurants and the portion sizes can't be considered generous. If the food quality was there, they could justify the premium, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Let me first tell you the determination it took for me to eat here. The night before my boyfriend told me he wanted to leave early the next morning to drive home so I tried looking up the restaurant hours online and it could not be found so I figured most restaurants open after 10am. We got there exactly at 10am the next morning and it was still closed as were most of the other restaurants in Chinatown. I wasn't giving up without eating dim sum in Toronto before driving back so I walked up and down the street asking random chinese people what time most restaurants open on sundays using my elementary level chinese skills :) 

No one seemed to know so I went to the internet cafe across the street to speak to the employee on duty and he also did not know what time it opened and was extremely puzzled why someone would have to eat specifically at Asian Legend when he could recommend other restaurants down the street that were opened. I wanted to call Asian Legend hoping the hours would be recorded on the answering machine but my phone internet doesn't work in Canada so asked if I could buy like 5 min internet time at the internet cafe. The guy was really nice and let me use his own computer and when I called Asian Legend they picked up and told me they were opened?! I was like umm I was just outside and he told me he was on the way to open the door as we speak. 

So now that I've wasted a half hour and my boyfriend is irritated waiting in the car we go inside and my boyfriend is expecting this place better be no less than amazing. I ordered soup dumplings, jelly fish, deep fried tofu, red bean pancake and the waiter recommended this onion/beef fried pancake which was very good. The fried tofu and pancakes were my favorite picks and we had some pancakes leftover for our long drive back. 

My boyfriend and I were both very happy we got to eat here."}
{"text":"Having been to only Asian Legends up north (Markham, Richmond Hill), I was actually skeptical that the downtown one would be consistent, but it was definitely what I was craving in terms of Northern and Southern Chinese fare. 

We ordered a huge bevy of dishes: 
- shrimp shumai: standard tasting shumai, a little larger than usual
- pork soup dumpling: solid dumplings with a nice thin skin
- beef roll: tasty rolls with green onions and surprisingly not oily
- garlic marbled pork belly: my favourite dish of the night! Spicy and just the right fattiness
- tofu stew: at this point we were too full to finish, so this was enjoyed back at home
- silky tofu + peanut dessert: hit the right spot of sweet and tasty
- sesame dumplings: well-made, but could have been from just the grocery store

Service was great. Our tea was constantly refilled, and the servers were able to split the check umpteenth ways. 

They also have private rooms downstairs that can accommodate at least 8-12 people (kiddie table included) for large group gatherings. 

For the price and location, it's fancier compared to its Chinatown counterparts, but guaranteed success for those who desire finesse to their Chinese dining."}
{"text":"We came here during a busy Sunday afternoon.  I've been to Asian Legend before and it's a pretty good chain.  Modern decor with menu in English, parking was plentiful.

The Beef Hor Fun with Black Bean Sauce was delicious.  Probably the best we have ever tried as it was bouncy, light and tasty.  It wasn't on the menu but they made it for us.  We also had a fried rice and eggplant dish.  The dim sum here was expensive so we didn't order any.

As with many restaurants, you might want to pick a seat away from the entrance if you don't like the cold draft during winter as people will be coming in and out."}
{"text":"I've dined here so many times I can't even count.  I've just never been compelled to write a review until now.  

We've celebrated many a birthdays and anniversaries here including our wedding rehearsal dinner and most recently, my daughter's 1st birthday party.  As a new mom planning a baby's 1st birthday for 60+ guests, I was a ball of nerves trying to find a restaurant that could deliver great quality food and also have a nice looking private room for the festivities.  The choice came down to a handful but what really won me over was the manager, Joyce, who was so helpful in planning the menu and accommodating us for numerous access requests for decorations and deliveries.  I must say that she did such a fantastic job for my daughter's birthday, I will always return to Asian Legend and they have a customer for life.  

The challenge was that out of the 60+ guests, about half would be children under the age of 8.  And as I did not want a sit down menu with multiple courses (C'mon, who has kids that'll sit through a nine course lunch), it was a new thing for Asian Legend to tackle.  But they stepped up to the plate and served a buffet-style lunch consisting of lots of dim-sum menus and traditional dishes alike.  There were a total of 19 dishes so I will not go into listing them all here but all I can say is that the food was excellent and the staff did such a fantastic job serving our guests as they arrived with fresh food.  They even helped serve my 2 gigantic homemade cake!  

I cannot say enough great things about Asian Legend and their staff for making my daughter's first birthday party so stress-free for me.  As most first time moms would agree, sanity is a very precious thing.  :)"}
{"text":"This place sucks now!

My family used to frequent this restaurant quite often, but we recently went back and the food and service has gotten much worse!!

The bad experience basically happened 2 minutes into walking into the restaurant. It was 7:30pm, and prime dinner time, so obviously our first instinct was to ask how long the wait was. The answer we got was, \"Soon, it's almost your turn.\" So we decided to wait. A few minutes later we realized that we wouldn't be seated anytime soon as most tables were still eating. We this time asked a different server how long the wait was going to be and he again said soon, but this time at least have us an estimated time, 10 minutes. We were seated almost 30 minutes after we arrived - definitely not soon.

Our number was soon called but our table was actually not yet ready, instead they handed us two menus and made us make our choices on what to eat prior to eating, this was a sign to rush us out of the restaurant - if I wanted that, I would have went to McDonalds. 

It only got worse from here. We were finally seated and as the food started arriving, we realized immediately how bad this meal was going to be. Our $7.99 plate of 'sliced brisket, ox tongue and stomach in chili sauce' was actually a 4inch plate of green onions with maybe 5 slices of what was actually meant to be eaten. It didn't taste all that good either. Next came the 'Shanghai fried noodles' and these were equally as bad. The noodles were unbelievably oily with more cabbage than there were noodles, was lukewarm, and felt unpleasant to eat. My whole mouth was coated in oil by the time I was done my bowl. The 'soup filled dumplings with crab meat and pork' were mediocre, no crab taste at all, the packaged and frozen ones at grocery stores were actually better. The only 2 good things that were actually decent was the 'deep fried crispy intestines' and the 'deep fried Chinese silver bun', but God forbid someone mess up fried bread. 

When I go to Chinese restaurants, I don't go for the service, but the service here today was terrible. A younger man, boyish even, was put in charge of our table, and never once did he smile, and was as rude as could be. Every plate that came was thrown on our table, and to make room to new food, he would move the plates we were eating off of, WHILE WE ATE. Who does that?! We definitely got the feeling he didn't want to be there. And trust me, I didn't either

Our meal came up to about $50, but felt more like it should have been worth $20. I can definitely tell you I won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Having been to one other Asian Legend restaurant I figure its gonna be the same all around. For the most part it was the same but one item that was really different was the noodles with spicy and peanut sauce aka dan dan noodles $6.99 - It was served in a really small bowl for some reason with very little sauce. Usually its swimming in sauce but this one had just enough to cover the noodles so by the time everyone took their share some were left with very little sauce. It made the noodles taste a bit dry.

The xiao long boa  and the beef onion pancake wrap were pretty much the same.

Also got a chance to try the jellyfish appetizer. You know the stuff you usually find at Chinese wedding dinners. For $7.99 I found it a bit pricy. The jelly fish were cut a bit thick which made them a tad chewy and it was drenched in an oily type sauce. Tasted okay but I would not order again. 

Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. The place was busy but still had empty seats. Parking is horrendous in this plaza. There is lots of parking spaces but just too many shops and restaurants. I had to park on the 2nd floor cramped parking spots.

Ordered only three items as it was only two people dining for lunch.
 
Soup dumpling with scallops and pork $6.99 - its $1 more than the standard pork soup dumpling and honestly I could not tell the difference. Still tasted good though. Mental note: (stick with the cheaper pork soup dumplings). There was even one on the menu for $7.99 with crab meat. I bet that will taste the same as well since they dice everything into a paste anyways.

Onion pancake beef wrap $5.99 - crispy and soft at the same time. Tasted great.

Dan Dan noodles $6.99 - spicy sauce with peanut paste mixed with noodles. People that do not dine at Shanghai restaurants will find the combination weird but its awesome. The noodles were nice and chewy and came in a large portion. It was just the right combination of spicy soup with peanut paste.

Service was fast and amazing. They guy filled out teapot 3 times and we were only there for 30 minutes max."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. It's got good food. It's nice & clean. The service staff is fast and polite as well. The menu here is pretty large. The food is authentic. And if you have a large group, there's a private room downstairs (two actually I think) to accommodate the number. I come here for the dimsum a lot (try their soup dumplings). But their dishes for lunch and dinner are good too. I like the chow mein and any of their veggie dishes."}
{"text":"Asian Legend is a popular local chain - so keep in mind that some locations are better than others.

This one, in particular, has been around for a long time and quite frankly, i consider it to the best location, in terms of food quality and consistency.

Now I usually don't come here for dinner, but for a pretty decent Northern-Style dim sum. This is one of the few places that does the savory soy bean soup right. The savory soy bean soup is not for everyone, but anyone wishing for that spicy, slightly sour, salty and crispy sensation - it is worth trying here.  Equally good here is their steamed soup dumplings; I find that their skins are much thinner and more translucent compared to the other well-known soup dumpling places.  Other favorite dishes would be the savory sticky rice; and their lean salted pork and veggies fried rice cakes. 

Service is what you expect for a Chinese owned and run place, but at a slightly higher level. This location can accommodate largish groups with a series of private rooms that run along the back area - the private rooms aren't what I would say spacious and roomy - but it does the job in terms of offering privacy to chat with your group."}
{"text":"This place has seriously outstanding Chinese food and it's never a miss. I tend to make it here at least once during my many trips into the city. Highly recco the Shanghai soup dumplings, shanghai fried noodle, pot fried dumpling (wor tip) and salt and pepper squid. Duck was a bit dry. And when you're done, hop across a block over to Sanani foot massage for a feet and/or feet body combo. Mark is the best!"}
{"text":"Great food, PRICE and service. I would definitely recommend this place, love the food here quite a bit. Restaurant is cleaner than your typical greasy Spadina joint. Lots of classic Taiwanese/Chinese dishes. Service is quick, you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Asian Legend is one of my favourite chains of Chinese food restaurants across Toronto. The food from this particular Asian Legend has always kept up to a certain standard of quality, and so I've enjoyed my meals there every time.

You can tell they use higher quality ingredients to make their food, and that's why the menu prices are a bit higher than many of the other Chinese food restaurants in the area. I'd say it's well worth the price.

The staff here are also very friendly compared to most other restaurants in the Chinatown area. They actually greet you with a smile. I know, it's pretty bizarre."}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service is terrible.  We had to get up several times to find the severs and then they have the nerve to charge us a mandatory '15% service charge'."}
{"text":"We always order their appetizer platter ($58.00) which include 8 typical Shanghai style cold dishes when we have meal gathering at friends' home or our home.  They are very tasty and decent volume. It contains fish, pork, beef, bamboo shoots, tofu, etc. Their Beijing fried duck is way too expensive, we ended up picking up in Da Ya Li, which is famous for that. They have quite a few dishes we lwhen we tried in the previous occasions."}
{"text":"This place provided an horrible experience for me and my family, they demanded tips even though they did not deserve it one bit! Our food was late 1 hour yes 1 hour and they would not change our seating for us when my mother and grandfather were feeling uncomfortable in the seats."}
{"text":"Asian Legend, despite the tacky name, is actually a chinese food restaurant without the tackiness.  No \"chicken balls\" on the menu here - Asian Legend serves what I'm guessing is reasonably authentic chinese food at equally reasonable prices.  

This is the kind of place where the bigger the group you go in, the better the experience, because you can try more things and share them out.  As a group of three, we were able to polish off an order of steamed dumplings (delicious), an onion pancake wrapped with beef (greasy and fantastic - I would love to be able to buy these from a cart on the street late on a Saturday night), moo shu pork, and kung pao chicken with steamed rice.  The kung pao was disappointing in that it lacked any kick at all - this is supposed to be a spicy dish but yet I didn't even need my glass of water - very strange.

The restaurant is large, with nice decor.  Our server was void of smiles, pleasantries, or anything resembling conversation, but he was never less than efficient."}
{"text":"I wanted to check out this Asian Legend because I've heard good things about their other locations from friends. The sign says 'northern Chinese cuisine,' but this restaurant is owned by Taiwanese. In a strip mall, there is a lot of parking on site. The decor is modern with black and red as the theme. Anyway, my father and I ordered a few dishes - we probably ordered 5 dishes, which was way too much food for the two of us. The portions here are quite large so Asian Legend is perfect when going out with a group of people. The price point is quite reasonable and the menu is extensive (there's something for everyone).

Good for: Chinese"}
{"text":"This is the best Asian Legend location that I've been to.

I love their beef pancake roll, pork dumplings/potstickers, and chunky beef noodle soup. Their xiao long bao's are good too, but the other three are must-haves each time I go or get takeout.

The service is good and the atmosphere is nice, large, and spacious. The decor is dark and it makes the place look somewhat dim.

Pricing is decent, approximately $30-35 for two people including taxes and tip, depending on how big of an eater you are. 

I come back to Asian Legend every couple of months for my fix of beef noodle soup. It's awesome and they make it best at this location!"}
{"text":"I've been to at least four other Asian Legend locations and this is probably the worst one for their braised beef noodle soup.  I thought that the quality would remain the same since it is a chain, but it's almost night and day compared with the one in say...Scarborough! The noodles they use are also different and flat (although that's just a preference I guess..but they don't seem to be traditional Shanghai noodles). The soup was also not as flavourful.  The potstickers were also smaller and they sometimes forget to give you vinegar for dipping. I've ordered takeout from here multiple times but I'm almost tempted to travel a bit further to another Asian Legend to get better quality food."}
{"text":"Solid choice for Chinese food in the North York area.  Large menu that includes dim sum and soup dumplings that rivaled Din Tai Fung.

Had a going away lunch for a coworker here and we ordered family style.  I left overstuffed and my portion of the bill was $15.  Not too shabby.

Definitely can't rival places in Chinatown or Richmond Hill, but for the North York neighborhood it'll get an A-OK."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is just a let down and horrible. Last night I went there around 10:10pm on a Friday night . When I got there the waiter told me the kitchen is closed, so I have to come back tommorow. Which it's completely bs. Their website clearly says it closes at 12:00am. So it's not my fault that they don't update their website. And I hated the fact that the waiter wanted me to leave badly. He told me it's closed at 10:30 which it wasn't even 10:30 yet. I was very disappointed. I told him that it is not 10:30 yet. Then the guy was like whatever and asking me to have a seat. I sat down and the guy immediately told me to sit elsewhere. Because it a 4 seats table. It's understandable that they want to save seats for people. But it wasnt busy and it was late and the restaurant was almost empty so what's the big deal? There were at least 15 empty tables.  The table I sat down wasn't even that big. It didn't make sense to me. So I was forced to sit on a very tiny table with two people sitting beside me :( I won't come to this location ever  again."}
{"text":"The food was starchy and lacked the extra flavour notes I expect.  Each dish we had ordered was unfortunately one note.  The deep fried chicken was dry.  

That said, staff were efficient and the location itself is large and accommodates a larger party.  It's possible the dishes we ordered are the culprits.  Soup dumplings were nice but again, I've had better.

For the cost, the value isn't quite there.  Can definitely do better given the vast array of restaurants off Hwy 7."}
{"text":"I have been here with my partner a couple times after work for dinner. All of those times, the food was good and the service was decent. 

The general atmosphere is rather pleasant. Although, like most restaurants, the seating is really close to the next table (especially if it is only two of you). We requested a 4-seater table so we don't feel squeezed between two tables.

Generally, I feel like it is just your average chinese restaurant. Except the environment is probably higher than the rest. In terms of pricing, it is also a little bit higher. The food is average and service isn't bad.

My favorite dish would be the steamed buns (xiao long bao)."}
{"text":"By far the worst Asian Legend location! I've mostly visited the one downtown (close to the AGO) and the one on Don Mills and this one is just awful! 
I Tried this location 3 times and sadly 80% of the dishes are bad! The vegetable dishes are decent but everything is not up to par! The Dumplings are so salty and lacks flavour, the noodles and fried rice lacks ingredients, mostly starch- noodles and rice. Everything else isn't memorable... the service is just ok! It seems like the kitchen staff and employees that works there just don't care anymore. 
I gave this restaurant enough chances and \"I'll never go back!\" Unless they change the kitchen staff/cooks! I rather drive the extra miles to the other locations instead. Save yourself from disappointment and go elsewhere! Oh there's a Congee Wong in this plaza, go there instead!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for years, and I have to say that over the past year it had somehow managed to get worse every time we came here. Not learning from our mistakes, this time was the WORST experience ever. I never turn down Shanghai food, but you cannot pay me enough to come back to this place. I downloaded the Yelp app just to leave this review. 

First of all, they couldn't even get something as simple as putting the right sauces in the right container. I ended up with a mouth full of vinegar instead of soya sauce. 

When we ordered, their signature items such as their pan fried dumplings were sold out (they could've just walked over to T and T to buy a few bags to cook!). They suggested another cheaper alternative instead that tasted like the frozen stuff you buy at the Chinese supermarket. 

Later, the Tantan noodles that we used to order every time we went, came; and to put it nicely, it was a not hot, and super watery soupy mess. When we brought this up to the server, she had the audacity to blame us and lectured us about how it was always that way (not sure why that was something to brag about) and that maybe we remember it wrong. Then she spent another few minutes explaining to us that it was probably because the peanut sauce was stuck at the bottom. We looked: there was no trace of peanut sauce AT ALL. This was then followed by her bringing a bowl of peanut sauce for us to put into the noodles FOR OURSELVES. (This was such a joke I took a picture of it here) That's like us asking her to provide her own tips. When she was tired of that excuse, she thought maybe we had confused this noodle that was order EVERYTIME we went with this other peanut sauce COLD noodle. Maybe she was trying to convince herself?

The pan fried pork buns were half empty (image also here) and the noodles were three quarters of the portion it used to be. The sticky rice rolls were hard as rocks but somehow still fell apart! 

The fact that it was during dinner rush and the restaurant was half empty should have been a huge red flag.  Having said that, why did they bring dessert before we were done chewing on the rock hard and disgusting food? Before we had time to maul over the terrible meal after dessert, they promptly brought the bill without asking like they were trying to escort us out. 

This meal was a complete joke. I'm sure I will laugh over it one day after I get over this indigestion."}
{"text":"Food is pretty much on par with other Asian Legend locations. However, the service is extremely lacking. When coming into the door, there is no reception or employee greeting us, which was not a big deal. But, when trying to wave an employee down to give us a table, all the employees were intentionally looking away. Also, trying to get an employee to provide us with napkins or tea was a mission. I rather go to other Asian Legend locations that provides better service."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer said, Asian Legend is supposedly Northern Chinese cuisine but they have stuff from all over the map on their menu.  The standard noodles in their beef noodle soup tasted very processed so I would definitely pay the extra $1 for hand-pulled noodles.  Both the cold shredded chicken noodles and the braised eggplant were just ok.  The restaurant is very nice though and service was above average.  And also, free parking in the back is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Under staffed? Or poor service? Doesn't matter.

Food is above average, flavours are of your generic Asian fare. Although not worth the time spent waiting for a table, nor the time spent trying to get waited on. 

2/5 would not return."}
{"text":"Cheap lunch specials but the chow mein for a dish to get you high blood pressure....salty as hell, the sodium content in that dish must have been off the roof, we told the waiter and they were really resistant in changing or making a new one for us so we just settle with them to just ate more noodle, which didn't do squat since they added more sauce.......we got their dumplings but it was pricy like $1 a piece 
Won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"Maybe because of the stairs and the location but sitting in the first seat by the window I was reminded of having similar fare in Hong Kong.   

One of a chain of restaurants that turns out some great food. 

We had a spicy beef brisket soup with noodles. The beef chunks don't always look appetizing but when you do try them it is always worth it. It is a very rich broth and a tasty soup. Although the soup came a little too cool for my liking. 

We also had some pan fried chicken dumplings (they were huge!). We ate an onion pancake wrapped up in a roll with beef, this is my wife's favourite and probably the main reason we come here.  This was exactly as expected and is nice with a little hot oil. And finally some traditional soup dumplings.  Which were pretty good, not Din Tai Fong (sp?) good but good. 

Overall very pleased with all of the food taste. It came out quickly and the servers are fairly attentive as we asked for some hot sauce and the tea was brought quickly and had a lovely flavour. 

The ambiance is a little less than enchanting and people focus on eating and not talking. We were there at around 6 and were seated right away in a half filled restaurant. But within the time we were there it filled up with a queue. Decent experience for about $40 with tip."}
{"text":"Came here because we were shopping in the area. The interior is very nice. However, the food was not that good. The food was salty or bland. I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Not bad. The place was packed on a Sunday night. Our food was good but our expectations were higher. I think it was our fault because it was our first time here and we didn't pick the stand out dishes. 

The server forgot to bring out an exotic fish dish but did not charge us either. A little disappointed. Parking sucks."}
{"text":"I came here because there seemed to be rave reviews.  Everyone is talking about how you need to check out the Northern Cuisine (but no one goes into what Northern Cuisine is in their review - as if it's obvious.  I've eaten Chinese food for decades, but I've never pulled out a map and figured out what comes from where.  I only do that for Japan, and noodles.) 

I went in - shared a soup, and a Shanghai noodles.  They were both tasty treats - but they weren't the greatest thing I'd ever had, and the price point was higher than just about anywhere else in China Town.

I'm thinking this is a place best for groups of four or more, because while the portions are huge, you don't really get that much variety, because two people can only eat so much.

If I had a tour-guide with me, I'd return in the future.  It was an experience I'm glad I'd had - but I'd rather someone else help me out with what to eat.

...for what it's worth - I really want to come back for the duck."}
{"text":"I like asian legend! I come here all the time with friends and family--it's so versatile. And now I sound like I'm reviewing some pair of sensible shoes or something.
Yes, their food is on the greasy side. Yes, it's usually crowded and loud. But the portions are on the large side without being mammoth and the price is pretty good. I especially love the dimsum-esque food they have, but their vegetable dishes are also pretty good. I think you need to know what to order to have a good experience here--lucky for me my parents come here wayy too often and have educated me in the ways of asian legend!"}
{"text":"Have the VIP card as this give you 10% off over $20.  This place, and all the other Asian Legend, are owned by Taiwanese, but it is mainly a Chinese restaurant, so you are not going to see dishes from Mama Bear.  The flavor is great, plenty of variety, the dumplings are good, almost as good as Ding Tai Fung.  The beef noodle soup is also good here, but not as good as Mei Nung.  But you come here for the combined food variety and flavor, and this place is still one of my favorit restaurant.  

I give it a 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"Dropped by the Asian Legend on Dundas for a quick dinner.

There's both an upstairs section and a downstairs section. The upstairs section contains the bulk of the seating, but there's a large room for private, larger parties, and a smaller seating area downstairs. We got seated upstairs - the dining room has a nice view of Dundas because the facade is basically all one window, which was important for us because we needed to figure out if it was raining or not. 

The menu is pretty extensive but also pretty typical of a Chinese restaurant - I didn't find anything particularly exciting that you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else down Spadina.

Service was a little strange - it seems like they aren't quite in sync. We were approached by two waiters within about five minutes asking if we were ready to order. We got the shredded pork in chili sauce and an order of the beef wrapped in chive pancake.

Both were pretty blah - nothing bad, but I've definitely had better. The portions for the plate dishes are huge though - for the two of us, we ate until we were full, and were able to pack a good amount back home. 

Overall, a very solid but unmemorable dining experience, especially considering the fact that we were in the middle of Chinatown and could have probably gone anywhere else. Considering the portions, it was priced very reasonably."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in North York. I have never been disappointed. Large selection of menu items, all of which are delicious. Great Chinese food without the snobby prices of, say, Pearl or Dynasty.

Be sure to try the Peking Duck, Deep Fried Tofu, Beef Noodle Soup, Dong Po pork, and Crystal Pork Aspic.

Or, just order whatever and enjoy it."}
{"text":"A disappointment.  Server did not get an order correct of only three items.  When asked about the missing item I was made to feel as if I had done something wrong.  The food quality was standard for the part of town."}
{"text":"Last summer, my family and I went here for dinner. We tried the 
* XLB with dried scallops, pork and luffa(??????)
* peking duck
* sautéed green beans w/dried shrimp(?????)
* rolled onion pancake w/sliced beef(????)

Everything was really good, especially the peking duck. The duck's skin was crispy and the meat was very tender. One of the best peking duck dishes I've had in North America!"}
{"text":"Took hubby to this restaurant for his birthday feast. We had steamed fish, garlic veggies (look at the chunks of garlic!), Shanghai dumplings, fried rice, and a siu mai dish. Everything tasted amazing; it would have been a perfect experience had the presentation been less sloppy."}
{"text":"Reoccurring theme from these reviews: poor service. 

The wait staff is unmotivated and actively tries to avoid your eye contact so to avoid attending to your needs. We were served by a few different people and they each had problems remember what it is we asked for (were they not listening or did they forget because they're understaffed and have too many things to do?)

The taste is average, gets you the fix you need. However, given the number of smaller restaurant in the city that serve their type of cuisine I'd go to those instead."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Toronto. Metered parking is available on the street."}
{"text":"We went there to have their Beijing duck. It was nice but somewhat on the dry side. There was too few pancakes. When we asked for more, we were told they were $0.80 each. Really? 

Also the dishes from the south are great but the northern dishes were not so well executed."}
{"text":"See, the first time I went here we went here for a different \"northern style\" dim sum experience.  Their dim sum selections were quite small and although it was a different dim sum experience than your traditional \"har gow\", \"siu mai\" kind - it was quite expensive.  They had similar dim-sum type foods but they were just different kinds of meat.  The best part however, was the soup-filled dumplings!  I found myself craving that all the time after coming here.

I was reluctant to go back to a chain-type restaurant for Chinese food, but when we went for a friend's birthday, I had to admit that the food was well worth the price.  It is not at all comparable to chain-type restaurant, Spring Rolls and I'm more than willing to pay a small premium for the cleanliness and atmosphere that the place has.

What I highly recommend here is their roasted duck skin wraps!  They do up a whole roasted duck, and they cut the outter crispy skin of the duck off, which is eaten with a flour-like wrap (DIY).  Then you can choose what dish you'd like the rest of the duck made into - I recommend the DIY lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"pricey, tiny portion, effort-less, worse-than-homemade quality dishes. I would not come back"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite place for Chinese food. It's a bit pricey (compared to other Chinese restaurants) but I love the selection. The best thing about this restaurant is that they have the same menu all the time but I can always find something interesting and new to try. This isn't one of those boring restaurants where you always have to order the same thing just to play it safe.

Be careful of the spice level on some of the dishes. I can't handle much heat so I lean towards non spicy food here.

If you come here for dinner, you should get a complimentary dessert which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I really like Asian Legend and I haven't gone to one in so long. I decided to come here for dinner one day since I wasn't up for Korean food. I always avoid the General Tao chicken because I find it's such a western item to get. My friend ended up getting that and it was surprisingly good! It could've had a little bit more heat though! I got the noodle with soy bean paste and it was very satisfying. We also shared a beef pancake which was the best part of the meal. Service here was average but it was a busy day so I don't blame them for not being on their game."}
{"text":"My good friend and his parents took me out to this restaurant when I was visiting Toronto over New Years. As I would only be in Toronto for a few days, I really wanted to try out the Chinese food. This restaurant is his parents' favorite place near their home, and it certainly did not disappoint.

I should preface my review of the food by saying that his parents, in their kind generosity, overordered. By a lot. By the end of the meal I was literally so full I could hardly move, and my stomach was trying to fight its way out of my jeans. This led me to remember the meal through a fog of leptin-induced food coma, but I can say with certainty that each dish was consistently very good. 

Beef with Chinese broccoli: one of my favorite dishes. The beef was very tender and full of flavor.
Cold appetizer platter: probably my least favorite. This platter had an assortment of odd things like cold squid, pork gelatin, some sort of jerky, pickled cabbage, etc. Not really my thing but most likely these dishes are acquired tastes.
Slow cooked pork belly: delicious, melt apart in your mouth tender meat with a healthy serving of belly fat, stewed in a flavorful sauce and served with pickled mustard greens.
Szechuan bubbling oil fish: a beautifully presented dish with a combination of tender fish, cabbage, and bean sprouts cooked in a spicy broth, with red chili peppers floating inside. This dish is perfect for a cold day and will immediately clear out your sinuses.
Peking duck: one of my favorite dishes of all time. The restaurants did a great job of butchering the duck and preserving the crispy skin. The crackling, fatty skin and tender duck meat go perfectly with hoisin sauce, cucumber slices, and spring onion in the wrapper.
Mapo tofu: another excellent dish. Not too spicy, but a good balance of tofu and pork.
Kung pao chicken: I didn't like this as much, as it was a little bit spicy for me and on the dry side. I also expect more peanuts in a kung pao dish, but the chicken was cooked well.
Soup dumplings: no visit to a Shanghai restaurant is complete without soup dumplings. The skin was nice and thin but not too easily breakable. The broth was flavorful and hot. 

Although my stay in Toronto was short, I left feeling extremely satisfied that I had accomplished my goal of eating some good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place and would have given 5 stars, but this is now the 2nd order I placed online for take-out and they didn't receive it for some reason. Now I have to sit here and wait 15-20 minutes for them to cook the food that should have been ready. They really need to adopt a better system for online ordering or abandon it and take phone-in orders only."}
{"text":"Great food and good service! 

I have been to this Asian Legend a few times over the past few months and have left satisfied every time. Their soup dumplings are amazing and very juicy and flavorful. My favorite items here are the crab meat soup dumplings, beef brisket noodles, seafood fried rice cake, and stir fry green beans. I have been to every Asian Legend location before and have been quite impressed with their consistency. The service at this location is especially good and food comes out fast. I have been hoping for a Din Tai Fung (I know there's a DING Tai Fung in Markham, haven't tried yet) to open in Toronto but this is a great option for my beloved xiao long baos."}
{"text":"I should have known to be disappointed when their soup buns came out too quickly. it wasn't hot nor juicy enough.  Yes I would go back to try their other dishes.  their cold appetizer dish was quite good."}
{"text":"Best dumplings ever   . I would definitely recommend this place to anyone new to the northern Chinese cousine like me!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times were utterly disappointing. 

My first time around my sister and I came and were seated in a back corner. After being ignored for 10 mins, we were provided tea and we ordered. An hour passes and no food. We tried desperately to catch the attention of our waiter who just seemed to ignore us. When we finally got his attention, he went in search of our food. 10 mins later, he returns telling us they \"misplaced\" our order. So we had to order again. Once the food came, 1.5 hours after we arrived, it was really good, but the service was so horrible. 

The second time I went, I actually warned my friend about the service, but we decided to give it a try anyway. Again, it was like we were invisible. Our food came in an ok amount of time, but one of our dishes was stone cold, so we asked for it to be heated up. They took it away and it never came back. Neither did our waiter. My friend finally got up and hunted down someone so we could pay (it was like 10:30pm at this point). After paying, we realized they totally charged us for the dish they took away but never brought back. 

The food here is delicious. But the horrible service has ensured that I will never go back."}
{"text":"418 Dundas location specifically: when you walk in to a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown and half the ppl in there eating aren't Chinese, an alarm should go off if you are looking for something authentic. Ordered hot and sour soup and spicy won ton - pretty basic dishes. Neither dish was spicy at all, and the won ton tasted like it was simply boiled in water. While a lot of dumplings are cooked that way, if done properly they dont taste so bland. Since I've eaten regularly at the Scarborough location, I expected a certain level of authenticity from them here, especially being located in Chinatown. But I was wrong. Quite disappointing. This type of cuisine is known to have good spicy dishes, but they took out the spiciness to accommodate their mostly non asian clientele. Go elsewhere if you want authenticity."}
{"text":"Not bad for an asian restaurant. As an Asian, I always go to Rhill or Markham for good eats, but I'm satisfied with the food I had here..finally some delicious non-fast Asian food around here!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times over the last two weeks and have not been happy with the quality at this location.

Food:
It's okay.  I've had better northern Chinese cuisine uptown, and it still doesn't compare to my favourite place, Ningtu, in Vancouver.  The portion sizes are small and especially disappointing when we order from a set menu for 10 people and it probably was good for 6-8.  The two lobsters looked like all the pieces weren't there.  Even the e-fu noodle dish was small and rice and noodles are usually fairly large in quantity given they're the \"filler\".  

The worst was that we ordered Peking Duck as a substitute, and when the lettuce wrap part came, they didn't have enough lettuce wrap for the whole table (i.e. less than 1 leaf per person seated and we were around 8).  We ordered more and they CHARGED US for the extra lettuce.  

Their red bean pancake was good though, but don't order the red bean in meringue.  They didn't turn out well (oily and dense vs. fluffy and light).

Service:
Restaurant wasn't busy and service was still slow and not attentive.  It seems they aren't used to doing \"banquet\" dinners because they were slow at clearing plates, getting drinks, cutlery, etc.

Needless to say, I will not be coming back here again despite its proximity to me."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this Shanghainese restaurant. Good service. I think the Xiao Long Bao was great, but this dish seemed to be slightly better at Ding Tai Fung from my memory. The hot and sour soup was indeed excellent and authentic (and I would NEVER order this at Westernized Asian restaurants). Fried tofu was pretty good, as was the cold meat platter."}
{"text":"Great experience. Service was great. Dishes were great. Flavourful and well seasoned. 

Dishes we enjoyed:
-beef pancake (lots of filling, thin pancake, not messy in tin foil)
-minced beef and egg white soup (nice flavours with parsley and peppery taste) 
-wontons in peanut sauce (not too thick, a mild heat, yummy sauce, lots of chives in filling) 
-green beans (good amount of garlic and ginger, nice texture)"}
{"text":"What does one feel for after a long day at Wonderland?  Chinese food of course!  

We decided on Asian Legend as it was right across the street from Wonderland and being group of 25 they had enough room to seat us all.

Asian Legend is basically the Northern Style Chinese equivalent of Congee Queen.  They have various branches throughout the GTA serving Northern fare such as dumplings, noodles and spicy dishes.  The standout dish for us was the spicy Sichuan chicken and the Fujian fried rice.

Service was very good and the food was pretty solid but to be honest not as good as say a Congee Queen franchise.  3/5 overall."}
{"text":"Yap, I really like this place. Its always packed, really busy. They have very nice dumplings and chicken dishes, I also love their green beans, I always order those and in this place they taste great. The location is also good, very close to North York Center + they have parking (I think). The prices are okay too, the interior design is very nice too but its usually cold in there, so grab a jacket if you are usually cold in AC places."}
{"text":"This is the best dim sum I have ever had. Clean place, great ambiance and smiling people are usually rare at dim sum places. This place has all of those and has great food in great qualities. We had some spicy shredded beef in curry kind of a prep, it was the winner! I had no idea I could eat so much food. Was so good just couldn't stop."}
{"text":"We have a get together with old friends once a year here.

Easy to make reservations.
Staff is friendly and provides good service!

The hot and sour soup is Goood!

The only thing that we noticed was some the the dishes were too oily. Like the squid dish was dripping in oil.
Other than that, the food has been consistant.

Good place for big groups!

Our waitress was fast on refilling our water! Which is bonus! I never had to ask for refill.

4stars"}
{"text":"I came here near christmas.  Phoned in on a saturday afternoon and asked to book a reservation for 24people.  They were very accommodating, and when i got there, they had 2 of the 3 tables ready. Good service and staff !!!
Food was good and tasty! 

Very good first experience!!
A bit hard to find, if you have not gone here before. Ample parking on the sides of the building."}
{"text":"This has always been a 4 star restaurant in my books! My grandma and family really enjoy coming here for a few notable dishes...

My grandma passed about a year ago and haven't been here in a while..

Unfortunately, the food sucked this time...

We usually come here for the shanghai shalong bao dumplings and the Peking duck combo..

The dumpling skin here is one of the best in my opinion because it's uniquely thin compared to most other places.. I would usually give it a 4 to 4.5 star.. not 5 cuz I know another place which has slightly less quality... but only 1/3 the price.. and it's authentic shanghai cuisine.

The Peking duck was also below average this time.. because the duck skin was not crispy and the wrapping was also thick (just like the dumplings)

Hopefully next time I re-visit this place the dumpling skin and Peking duck wrappers are on par with my expectations or there won't be much of a reason for me to ever return.."}
{"text":"Asian Legend marks itself for being \"Northern Chinese Cuisine\", similar to other restaurants in the area, I'm convinced this is simply what is interpreted as northern cuisine by those running the places. Having been to northern China, I can report this is definitely more southern cuisine; not that I have a problem with that.

Remarkably loud, the food and service were pretty good for a place as full as this. Which is saying quite a bit, given there must be about a half dozen places in the plaza where this restaurant is located.

Try the rice cake: it's sliced rice tubes with cabbage and protein, and while looks may be deceiving, this dish was really pleasant. And massive, so some could definitely be taken home after full. Hot and sour soup wasn't its usual red and probably had the equivalent of a shaker's worth of pepper per bowlful. Otherwise, full of tasty and well-prepared ingredients (the tofu was brilliant) and worth it."}
{"text":"My fiancé's mom wanted something other than buffet after a heavy dim sum brunch so we returned to the family dinner stable - Asian Legend. We called to make a reservation 15 minutes before arrival and they told us that the place was pretty empty - we should get a table with no problem. Somehow within that 15 mins, this place was filled. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait too long to be seated and was able to eye what other tables were having for dinner. 

Initially wanting to just go with something light - somehow we ordered crab tofu, Shanghainese seafood noodle, beef pancake rolls, fried whole fish in brown sauce, garlic stir fried string beans, appetizer platter sampler (drunken chicken, jellyfish, and pork?) and two orders of crab meat soup dumplings (yep too much food for the 5 of us). I loved every dish we ordered. Tofu was light but flavorful. Beef pancake roll carried the same exact reminder of last year of why I should return to eating/loving meat. Drunken chicken was so tender and I loved the hint of soaked white wine in each bite. The crab meat soup dumplings were better than the ones I had in joe shanghai and Tim Tai Fung In Taiwan. The fish although was first deep fried had a surprising super moist flakey meat! The noodle and string beans were a bit too greasy for my liking but still well seasoned. 

We were beyond stuffed when we were given complementary red bean soup right before we asked for our check. Awesome food, friendly, on point service, and extremely reasonable price. Will definitely return for more Asian comfort food!"}
{"text":"I often go there with my family, and we're pretty satisfied after our meals every time (and my dad's pretty picky when it comes to Chinese food, being a Chinese who can cook really well, hahaha). 

I don't actually eat the normal \"peking duck\" and stuff like that, so I can't tell you how their peking duck skills are, but I always order their Tea Smoked Duck...at least, i think that's what they call it? I only know it really in Chinese. They really get the flavours in there. It's REALLY good and I swear I can eat it all day. Literally. The meat is tender and moist and is so flavourful, and even when I bring the left-overs home and re-heat in the microwave, the meat is still great! The other item I love from them is their fried Tofu. Their dipping sauce is my favourite out of any other fried-tofus I've orderd at any other restaurants. (I'm still trying to recreate it at home, to no avail).

Those two are just my must-have when i go into the restaurant. My family likes to order a variety of dimsums, because they taste authentic; like their pork soup dumplings, which tastes great, especially when you dip it in the tofu sauce (hahaha).   I can't remember most of the names of the rest of the items we ordered though...not in English anyways :(. 

I'd recommend it to people :). The price is decent and the food's great. the waiters are always pretty nice and things are served pretty fast, even during rush hours. But if you're going to walk-in during dinner time, be prepared to wait for a bit (10-20min)."}
{"text":"Very cool spot , definitely would like to go back.

At first I was a little intimidated by the menu as it all looked pretty authentic and definitely not take away Chinese food,  also as the only non asian people there we certainy stood out..LOL

The menu is very diverse and there are several large family style tables so it's a great spot for groups and splitting a bunch of different menu items. Our food was great and my only regret was that there was just two of us so we couldn't order more than a couple items and rice.

Anyway...don't be shy all you white folks... this is a great spot with friendly staff who went out of their way to make their customer's feel welcome."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, and the staff is always polite and efficient. 

I generally have no idea what I'm doing in a Chinese restaurant, so I like that their menu has a lot of pictures. 

I agree that it's a little pricey for Chinatown, but it's not like I know how to order at the really authentic Chinese places that are a lot cheaper - I need my friend there for that. It's a chain, and I haven't tried the other locations, but this one is worth coming to."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Chinese restaurant in Toronto.  Ofcourse I've heard of how amazingly the Chinese food is in this area so I had to try one of my favorites - Xiao Long Bao.  These soupy little dumplings, although pretty darn good and def a must get if you get a chance to stop by the restaurant, are still not comparable to those in California.  What is a must get is the fish soup (which I actually don't know the Chinese name of, not helpful I know).  But it was absolutely amazing... took the longest to make and included an entire fish with other veggies such as bamboo shoots, shitake mushrooms, and carrots.  Fried tofu (appetizer)was also pretty good.  We ordered the smoked duck as well but it was too smokey for my taste buds.  Definitely would come back to this place, if not for anything else but the soup!"}
{"text":"If you wanna get a general taste of Chinese food,have a try.Since they are not specialize in cuisine of a certain place,they offer a variety of food from north to south of china.The taste is good and acceptable but not highly recommended."}
{"text":"A decent chinese restaurant with good food and clean washrooms.  Excellent peking duck and soup dumplings.  Not the best soup dumplings I had but definitely ok to get by those cravings."}
{"text":"We pulled up into this little plaza around midday on a Saturday. Asian Legend is the newcomer joining the same strip as two existing restaurants - an Italian place, and the family-favourite, Congee Star. 

It was clear from the large flower arrangements and well wishes written on red paper just inside the door that this location hadn't been open for very long. While I haven't visited any other Asian Legends, I thought the decor of this one was spot on. Dark wood paneling and geometric light fixtures gave the feeling that this joint was one step up from the bright, bustling Star next door. We got seated very quickly, most likely because there were only two other diners in the huge, brand spanking new place. Clearly not everyone had gotten the memo yet. I'm a fan of the spacious circular booths that occupied one side of the restaurant, and for those with larger parties, I did spy a few private dining rooms towards the back.

Our waiter was fluent in both Cantonese and English, if that sort of thing matters to you. The menus are also fully bilingual. Asian Legend offers a healthy selection of dim sum a la carte, not unlike next door, but with a greater variety of your not-so-typical snack fare. We opted for the 
Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Dried Scallops, Pork, and Luffa ($6.95), Steamed Shumai with Shrimp and Pork ($5.95), and Pork Potstickers ($4.95). I'd definitely recommend the soup dumplings if you want some warming up, the way they incorporated veggies into the wrapper to make it green is a nice visual touch as well. I also enjoyed the potstickers, which are nice and big, hard to go wrong with these. 

We also tried the Drunken Chicken (6.95) as a cold app, and the white wine they marinated it in made for a nice, refreshing small dish. I have to note, our food all came at an impressively fast speed, despite the argument that there weren't very many customers. My favourite entrée was the Sautéed Lamb Sirloin with Green Onions on Sizzling Hot Plate ($15.95), which was really tender and flavourful. The House Special Fried Rice ($11.95) we got with it was pretty typical, nothing really made it stand out. Portion-wise, it was smaller than what we would've been served at Congee Star, but it was also more mild, missing the strong soy sauce taste that's pretty common with these dishes. 

While my hopes generally aren't very high for desserts at Chinese restaurants , I did want to finish our meal off with something sweet. The Mango Pudding ($3.95) and Soybean pudding with Peanuts ($3.95) were both underwhelming and didn't seem to be made in-house, would not get again despite the fact that they were surprisingly big enough to share. 

All in all, it was a pleasant meal and our server was very attentive with our tea refills and bringing out new place settings for dessert. Unlike many dim sum and Chinese casual dining places, Asian Legend doesn't charge a tea tax. It's also nice when they're passing by and actually top up your cup for you; one of the older ladies at the other table clearly enjoyed the attention and took the opportunity to flirt outrageously with our waiter. But I digress. Final verdict: would come again! While I'm sure this place will fill up soon as the word gets out that an Asian Legend has arrived in the area, there's a novelty to being the minority at my own culture's cuisine, and eating dumplings to strains of a My Heart Will Go On instrumental. Circle booths!"}
{"text":"Went there again yesterday - gave them a 'final chance' and it turned out really well.  Not sure what happened the last time I was there but yesterday was the same Asian Legend that I have come to love.  Had the wuxi-style, slow simmered gorgeous ribs, shaolong bau (that broth inside is exquisite) and my favourite hot and sour soup ... 

Attentive table service and the Manager (who always seems to be there regardless of the day of week or time of day) always remembers us - is a very gracious host.  It seems as though they're back on track."}
{"text":"This place is consistent.  We had not been there for a very long time and it was good.

Staff there are always pleasant.  Never had a bad experience service-wise.  There is a Manager on site who keeps the place running smoothly.  The hot and sour soup there is terrific.  The Shaolong bau are mmmm melt in your mouth with just the right amount of golden liquid inside each one.  Oh my ... the fried taofu with garlic ... lovely.

Was a bit disappointed with the rice rolls with pork floss.  A bit too much rice and not enough floss ...

Otherwise, good experience overall.  As always."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I've been a repeat customer of Asian Legend since 2010 (mainly 505 Highway 7 East - Commerce Valley Drive West Thornhill location). Compared to many past positive experiences there, I could not believe how unappetizing the food was at this new location (9781 Jane St. Vaughan). The food quality and taste at 9781 Jane was beneath what I have come to expect and always received from Thornhill. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I went with a group of people.
The food was alright but the service was absolutely horrible.
Took awhile for food to arrive in random order.
A waiter had knocked over one of the soup dishes and then just threw napkins on the table..."}
{"text":"I ordered online, and missed a confirmation phone call. As a result, nothing was done with my order until I showed up to pick it up. What's the point of online ordering if I have to wait for a confirmation phone call?

I was told the order would take 15 minutes, and I took a seat where instructed, a few meters from and in full view of the cashier. 30 minutes later, I asked the cashier if it would be much longer. She found that my order was sitting there right next to her for who knows how long.

After I got home and microwaved the food, it was fine. Just okay. I won't be ordering takeout from them again, however."}
{"text":"Alright I give it to them the place is GORGEOUS. The customer service is perfect. Like they make sure you have everything around the clock. But why 3 stars? THE FOOD IS DISGUSTING!! I do not know what world this \"Asian\" food is from but it sure as hell isnt Asian. It cold damp and tasteless. Like the chefs apparently."}
{"text":"My family loves to come here. It's our new \"Ding Tai Fung\" replacement. We love to order the veggie dumplings (I can have 6 alone!), siu lung bao or as I like to say \"little dragon bread\", green onion pancake, pan friend dumplings, fried rice, and many other things! The food is delicious though some things have too much oil imho. 

The service is always excellent and fast, especially if we get the waiter called Yin Tung. Very competent and nice !

On the downside, at our last visit, we had a waiter by the name of Collin who slammed the dishes down on the table after we told him we just needed takeout boxes so we can pack up the extra food home ourselves. I don't know what his deal is, but so rude......The nice waiter came immediately to apologize for Collin's behaviour."}
{"text":"Giving it a 5 star for the FOOD ONLY. Very authentic chinese food. Not those weird sweet and sour pork and broccoli beef type of westernized food. The menu here is extensive offers food like preserved cabbage pork belly, which only chinese would know to order. My bf spoke english, so staff were recommending only \"western\" dishes...I guess it s a good place if you know exactly what to order."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings are great here. Been here a few times now and I haven't had a bad meal. Always reliable and consistent. Love the noodle dishes here. Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**

Asian Legend is one of the cleaner/nicer restaurants in Chinatown. However, service is VERY slow. It was full to capacity and only had 4 or 5 waiters so every time we needed something or wanted to order, we had to flag someone down. We ordered the pork soup dumplings ($5 for 6) which were on the smaller side, but tasty nonetheless. The green pork/scallop/luffa soup dumplings were $1 more, but not as good in my opinion. We also got the general tso's chicken ($14) which was crispy and plentiful. They don't add too much breading, which makes it more authentic. The pork fat dish ($14) had a tasty sweet sauce, but way too much fat compared to meat. Overall, I'd come back for the soup dumplings and general tso's chicken if I don't find a better restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"Decent food, a bit expensive, the restaurant chain has good options, can satisfy the vast majority of Chinese food lovers. However, the reason I gave three stars since this location has rather rude staffs which are loud, terrible English, and bad attitudes. I understand English is not their first language, and I'm speaking from my own experience, it is a minor problem if they don't respond with \"what\", \"huh\", etc loudly rather than a simple excuse me. Not recommend."}
{"text":"Been here probably 30 times in last 4 years. Food is good decor is okay. Service actually improved over the years which is the opposite of normal Asian places. 

Today for example they went out of their way to get stuff for my toddler to keep her happy. We even got a free mango pudding dessert out of it."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is horrendous. The food is pretty consistent with other Asian Legends but service was exceptionally bad. All the wait staff seem to be pissed off."}
{"text":"Love some of the dishes here, especially beef ho fun, green onion pancake, and twice cooked pork. Main issues are the portion sizes and the prices of each item. For the ho fun, you're paying $14 and the amount that you're getting is very little, which is disappointing because it tastes great despite it being a bit oily. As for the twice cooked pork, you're paying $12 and the amount of tofu is much more than the amount of pork, not a great sign.

The servers are friendly and try their best but the service is incredibly slow and even if you ask for something small such as a drink or an extra side dish, it takes quite a long time."}
{"text":"Fantastic for dumplings. Several locations. A huge variety of items on menu. Open late."}
{"text":"Asian Legend is one of my favorite places for Northern Chinese cuisine and dim sum. Consistent with the quality you'd find at many of their other locations, Asian Legend always delivers. You pay slightly more than you would at other restaurants nearby, but the improvement in quality is demonstrative. This is also a much cleaner and more approachable style of restaurant for those just starting to explore different Chinese dining options."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to come for traditional high-quality dim sum. There's no shortcuts taken at this place, and is definitely the best location of the chain. The Shanghai soup dumplings are perfectly crafted and contain a filling of unmatched clarity and flavour. They make a house pancake that contains green onion, egg and shrimp that is a staple of the chain. Their fried rice can be a little dry, but everything always exceeds expectation and the consistency is remarkable."}
{"text":"I had so much Chinese food while in Toronto that all my memories of the food are starting to blend together.  What I do recall is waiting for a table at lunch (about 15-20 minutes) and watching a lot of white and Asian people come out of the restaurant. 

The xiao lung baos here were not bad ... very juicy though the skin was very thin.  I was skeptical of the XLB so I was pleasantly surprised.  The people I was dining with tend to order a lot of noodles, rice and other carb dishes - atypical of what my family likes to order and what I'm used to eating.  That being said most of the food I had here, albeit on the greasy side, was all tender and tasty.  I'd come again for the food, but only if there weren't a long wait."}
{"text":"Toronto is a place which has pretty high standards for Chinese food.

1. I wouldn't really call this place a \"Legend\"- lol.
2. The restaurant looked really nice, but the food seemed really salty. 
3. Our hosts invited us to this restaurant, but I guess they didn't know that this place specialized in Northern Chinese food.  So we ended up eating really pretty lame Canto food.  

-I'd come back, but probably more for the Northern Chinese food and not Canto food."}
{"text":"Their website says this location is open until midnight.

Yelp says this location is open until midnight.

I just called at 10.40pm to place and order and was told \"Closed\" and hung up on.

I called back to get an answer to the question \"What time do you close\"? First I was told 10.55. When I pointed out that that was still fifteen minutes away, I was told \"Oh no actually we close 10.30.\" 

Eh, forget it."}
{"text":"Bitter because a waitress spilt a dish all over my new jacket and all they offered to do was pay for dry cleaning. The dry cleaning didn't help since their sauce totally destroyed all the fur lining.

I'm sure their food is okay but I haven't been back since :( still sad."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 dishes. The appetizer was jellyfish with cucumber and carrot. It was a little bit salty.
I liked the beef with Chinese broccoli. And the atmosphere is good. Also the restaurant is clean. They have vegetation food :)
Street parking free after 9:00pm on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to restaurant for shanghai food. Over the years, the quality of food has degressed but still sits closely to a 3.5-4 star rating. This is because of the poor consistency of food, however, my recent visit was a pleasant one. We ordered hot and sour soup, potstickers, and the xlbs. The xlbs are honestly their best dish and could easily compete with the original din tai fung. Hot and sour soup was OK and potstickers were a little bit of a disappointment. It didn't have a good filling to potsticker cover ratio. The filling was tasty but lacking in content. I would still return as this is the best and original location of Asian Legends. 

I will return and I suggest anyone craving Shanghai food to also visit!"}
{"text":"The thing I was most impressed about was the good service. Chinese restaurants usually have horrible service with attitude but not here. All the servers were really polite and genuinely wanted to help you. It was super busy (New Years Eve) but they were appropriately staffed and the food came out in good time. Servers were very prompt with your requests. 

The Peking duck was super delicious and the xiaolongbao is a good choice to for Asian Legend. For a family of 4+baby it was a good amount of food and reasonably priced. They also give you free red bean desert which is a nice added bonus.

We've been to other Asian Legends but so far this is the best one I've been to. The others have been hit or miss for me."}
{"text":"This place is like the typical Chinese restaurant but more fancy. The food was good but nothing special. The portions are really good considering the prices that you are paying. The taste is not pure Asian but Canadian Asian cuisine. 

The service there was great. The waiters were really nice and friendly. It was not too busy the day I went. The atmosphere was very comfortable and the decor was fancy. Also, there is a lot of parking. 

I found it weird how my appetizer came out last after my main courses. It took them about 10-15 minute for the food to come out but appetizer came out when I was done the main course.... 

Overall, I wouldn't really recommend this place to a friend but it was not bad. I would go back, but not often."}
{"text":"Decent food and service.  The restaurant is really nice inside.  When they are busy the service slows down as we were waiting for 20 minutes to pay our bill."}
{"text":"Similar to other reviewers one of the servers asked about the tips. I did indeed paid 10% tips but on the before taxes amount. I asked how much short based on that and she didn't say anything. Got a comment saying that it is usually not that less especially in a non Chinese area. Food quality is average. One of the dishes I ordered has not enough flavour. It should not be made like that. Go there only if you have no other choice and would like to play the tips game with the server. I suspect the one asking is actually the owner.

Food is acceptable but there is better one for the same price."}
{"text":"We originally wanted to go to Izakaya right next door, but they don't open for lunch on Sundays, just for dinner. So we went into Asian Legend to give it a try. There was a good amount of people in the restaurant when we walked in so that was a good sign. The decor looks pretty new so they have either renovated recently, or haven't been in this location for long. 

We sat down & ordered some dim sum, fried rice & a lamb sizzling plate dish. I have to say I was surprised to see lamb on the menu. It's not something you normally see at Chinese restaurants.  Anyway most of the dim sum was good, except for the vegetarian dumplings. The fried rice & lamb were delicious as well.  There were plenty of waitstaff around so service was prompt. They do take out but I think you can only pick it up & not have it delivered. Would consider coming here again."}
{"text":"Visited this North York location with family. It's a very clean and bright Chinese restaurant. Signage indicates it's Northern Chinese cuisine. We came for lunch and ordered a variety of dishes including: 

green onion pancakes - thin, crispy, delicious
Chive pockets - thin, crispy dough as well. Must have been good as my sister-in-law ate half the order herself that I had to order another plate so my husband and I could try.
String beans with garlic - standard
Pan fried dumplings - standard
Shau mai - standard
Soup dumplings - didn't try as they were eaten by the rest of the family before I had a chance to get one
Soup dumplings with crab egg - good but not sure worth the additional price
Beef noodle soup - I liked the broth as it was spicy and thick ( not watered down lacking flavor) and the meat was extremely tender falling apart as you bite
Chicken with mango and onions - my brother described it as sweet and sour chicken with pureed mango. Never tried before.

Service was quick, bathrooms were clean. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food with large portions. Just make sure to ask for rice if you want some as it doesn't come with most. Typical Asian Legend. Many are in the GTA. authentic Chinese food with a slightly higher level of taste than most other places."}
{"text":"I came here during my search to find Salty soy milk soup (Xian dou jiang) while in Markham/Toronto.  For a place so full of incredible and authentic Chinese food, it was surprisingly hard to find a restaurant that served this.

Asian Legend had it - we ordered it, with some sweet soy milk (which came in a bowl - I thought it would be served in a cup), some dumplings, and some sesame bread (which is often eaten with the salty soy soup and fried bread sticks from what I understand).  Oh, we also got fried tofu (age tofu basically) I believe.

The food was pretty good, though I won't say it was the best I've had.  The dumplings were quite good, about as good as you'll get at most places, and they tasted home-made.  But don't expect the super juicy, flavor-saturated stuff you might find at Ding Tai Fung.  But they were good, and it's hard to go wrong with dumplings.

The sweet soy milk wasn't as sweet as I had hoped - maybe some will prefer it that way, but when I ordered it I expected a sweeter drink that came in a cup, as you can find in some places in the Asian malls around Markham.  Could just be lack of knowledge on my part.  It's something I look for often, because I swear that Chinese soy milk is different from western soy milk.

The sesame bread was pretty good, with some flaky texture, but it wasn't great.  The salty soy milk was good as well, but not as flavorful or salty as I hoped.  I did add some soy sauce/dumpling sauce in, and it tasted better.  I just remember having this dish at some other restaurant, and it was thicker, with more dried shrimp, more spice, more flavor.  Unfortunately it wasn't quite as good here compared to my memory of that other restaurant.

The tofu was great, though.  Plenty of flavor, nice crispy texture.

The service was wonderful as well.  The servers were very nice, and frequently came by to refill water and see how we were.  The atmosphere is quite nice as well.

Nearby there is a small supermarket and bakery which is fun to check out too.

Overall, pretty good food, but not the greatest; wonderful service and atmosphere.  Maybe a tad on the pricey side, but I don't think it was too bad."}
{"text":"Being the Asian xenophobe that I am (which is pretty ridiculous being that I am Asian!) Koreatown, Chinatown, J-town ethnic towns in general tend to unnerve me and sadly as such I don't get to take in the sights, sounds and tastes of Chinatown as often as I should.  Well Asian Legend has come to my xenophobic rescue with it's polished post modern trappings, ultra hygenic facilities and of course it's excellent Chinese food.

My Asian Legend cherry was popped this summer thanks to my sister's recommendation to dine here for her birthday.  Being the Leonine epicurean she is we ordered nearly EVERYTHING and happily it was all consistently delicious. It was a Chinese feast of Bacchanalian proportions with;

- 3 types of steamed dumplings Pork, Shrimp shu mai and veggie, 
- Deluxe seafood soup
- Moo Shu Chicken with pancakes
- Assorted seafood with tofu
- Peking Duck (Superb!!)with pancakes along with the duckmeat chopped up & sauteed with lettuce to wrap
-Spicy Shredded beef
-Sauteed King Mushroom with Snowpea Shoots
-Sauteed Eggplant with House Sauce 

It was all fantastic, delicious, and neither too salty or greasy.

My sister and her S.O. apparently have hollow legs as they effortlessly ate us all under the table.  Hubby was also very pleased and ravenously devoured his food with fork in one hand and chopsticks in the other.  I just shake my head at him as the old Chinese folks seated nearby look at him like he's a nutty gweilo. For dessert we ordered the smooth rich mango pudding mmmm :)   It was the perfect light yet still decadent way to finish off that epic meal.

The service is the usual Asian stoic, yet shotgun style which I'm used to but the pace can feel very go-go-go! with efficient servers dressed in white button down shirts incidentally with awesome creatively gel spiked hair changing up our hungrily emptied dishes with new hot entrees faster than you can say Dance Dance Revolution.

My one caveat was the uber-lame muzak piping in the background as I swear I must have heard a sterile instrumental version of Crystal Gayle's \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\" about 5 times, had this been 1977 and we'd been at a Ponderosa in Georgia that may have sufficed but I'd sooner listen to Traditional Chinese folk music than to this aural pablum.  

Upon going to use the facilities, I was hesitant to make my way down to the basement bathroom as I'd had some close encounters of the unhygenic kind in some China/Korea town restos and feared the worst.  Well, Asian Legend's WCs are super slick and spotless to boot, housed next to a number of spacious and modern private dining rooms, I saw no gambling, no haggard masseuses,  just private diners having a ball singing a Chinese Karaoke version Single Ladies...oh oh oh....

Thank-you Asian Legend for dispelling my absurd and outdated misconceptions about dining in Chinatown...now if ony I can get hubby to stop harpooning his food with chopsticks &_&"}
{"text":"This Chinatown restaurant is not big. My friend here in Toronto recommended to me, saying that it is popular and has several chain restaurant in this area. We ordered a fish and some veges. The vege was ok, but I found that the fish was great disappointed. It is not fresh. We joked that why it took so long to serve because of defreasing."}
{"text":"Actual rating 4.5.

So I dragged the family to Asian Legend yesterday for lunch.  Noteworthy point one - we didn't have to wait for a table!  I had been concerned about the lines I have experienced in the past, but for no reason.  After a couple minutes we were shown to our table.

My parents aren't the most adventurous when it comes to ordering, so I stuck to dishes they are familiar with such as hot and sour soup, General Tao chicken, lemon chicken, Cantonese Chow Mein and so on.  Everything was cooked well and totally satisfied.  The portions were so large that we ended up taking a lot home. My favourite dish was still the beef pancake.  Even my parents who were a little apprehensive about the words beef and pancake being thrown together, after trying it totally dug it.

In total, we ordered seven dishes and the bill was around a hundred dollars with a generous tip added in.  Considering there was enough left overs for another meal for two, I would say that is pretty good value!"}
{"text":"This is usually my go-to when visiting Asian Legend. Their Peking Duck has perfectly crisped skin and comes with fresh pancakes, scallions, cucumbers, and sauce to make your wraps! 

Not pictured above was the soup we ordered made up of leftover duck meat and bones. (One of my favourite reasons to eat Peking Duck - you can be creative with the leftovers!). The soup was a beautiful compliment to our meal. 

The dumplings were served as a side to our dinner and were both savoury and delicious."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular there for me. It is always packed, so be prepared to wait a little, and the tables are so close together that you feel like you are in one big cafeteria. There are some hits (mostly dough related) like chives and shrimp fried pancake, fried dumplings or thick noodle dishes, and the rest is just ok, with all the meats being covered by liters of thick and sticky sauce. Their Peking duck is $30 and it includes only first course with a limit of 12 pancakes, the duck itself is rather fatty for my liking and their sauce is too concentrated. The service is fine, I like that the tea is served in the thermos pot which keeps it nice and hot and it is being constantly refilled with hot water. It is somewhat pricier than other Chinese restaurants, so unless I'm with a group I'd choose to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dinner at this establishment earlier this week.  My two friends and I ordered four dishes to share:  

1. Stir-fried spicy shredded beef;
2. Kung Pao Shrimp;
3. Braised Spicy Eggplant (without pork); and
4. Fried Noodles with Shredded chicken.  

All of the dishes were good, with the shredded beef and eggplant being outstanding.  The Shrimp dish was also excellent with an abundance of plump, perfectly cooked shrimp.  They certainly don't skimp on the shrimp in this dish!  The noodle dish was also very good - a little on the bland side for my taste but still enjoyable.  

It's cool that you can place your take-out order online:  https://www.asianlegend.ca/index.php?p=home 

I'm not sure if you can specify a pick-up time (which would be ideal) but you can also have your order delivered.  

I will most definitely return, hopefully with a larger group of people so I can try more dishes."}
{"text":"Great wonton soup however they should cut up the bok choy because they didn't  wash it completely. Having said that the food is always tasty and service is great. 
My only cons include: smelly bathrooms  and I wish they moved the dish/cutlery station away from the dining hall because it's sooooooo loud! Hard to have a conversation with dishes and cutlery clanging."}
{"text":"People really love this place. And who am I to disagree, other than one among the throng of Yelpers. 

There's nothing really wrong with Asian Legend. This is but one outpost of a chain that spans Toronto and it's suburbs' Chinatowns. The menu is expansive, capturing more and less authentic dishes, so if you're going with a mix of adventurous and less-adventurous diners you can get your abalone and pigs intestines fix right next to your moo shu pork and chicken show mein. 

About that moo shu; it's actually very good, and for a dish that seems to be dying out in downtown Toronto I'm happy to see it on the menu. 

Lunch is a great excuse for a noodle soup, and Asian Legend's satisfies; plump wontons or ample slices of barbecue pork; springy noodles and crisp veg in a broth that has some character. 

There are three things that preclude a more enthusiastic review:

1) Asian Legend tries to cover off all the Chinese Food bases. There's nothing wrong with that, but I imagine it's an approach that works better where you're the only game in town. BBQ, Dim Sum, Noodles...unless you're in a crowd with varied cravings, there's any number of restaurants in the hood that you can visit that do any one dish better-the trick is finding a place that does them all capably. 

2) For being in the heart of Chinatown, Asian legend is a little hard to get to. It's weird-I can walk by it a million times on my way somewhere else, but the second it's a destination unto itself, it goes stealth on me. 

3) Ties in to the first issue-Asian Legend is surrounded by small, independent businesses operating on razor thin margins...many of whom still offer similar food for a few bucks less. Again, unless you're trying to meet a wide variety of tastes in one sitting, why pay more?"}
{"text":"BEST BEST BEST chinese food ever. I can still taste the General Tso's chicken after moving from Canada 3 years ago! I have yet to find a chinese place as good as Asian Legend. Also they serve sodas in cans which is a huge selling point for me. 
I miss you Asian Legend..."}
{"text":"When people ask where to go for ''dragon buns'' I usually tell them ASIAN LEGEND. Why? 

1. Their service is always attentive and great consistently (even when it's super busy)
2. The decor is spacious and more modern than most Asian restaurants (which personally I like)
3. MOST importantly:  The food is consistent and delicious with reasonable prices

Favorites:

D r a g o n   B u n s 
- I honestly don't think there has been a time that I've been here and NOT ordered any dragon buns. The skin of buns are thin but are still able to maintain the meat and juices inside without ripping, but be cautious you still have to be careful when picking it up off the plate. And the filling is delectable. (always eat these when hot 'cause it doesn't taste good when cold)

B e e f   B r i s k e t   N o o d l e
- Another no brainer on the menu list. I'd say I get this almost 85% of the time I come here as well. The meat here isn't as tasty as the one at Steeles Ave, but hell, it's still great. Very flavourful and the noodys are chewy (I fkin -LOVE- chewy noodles). And the base of the soup is great too although I wouldn't drink it on its' own. 

S h a n g h a i - S t y l e   R i c e   C a k e s
- I don't like this dish as much as the beef brisket one, but nonetheless rice cakes are known to be chewy and I am a huge fan of chewy goodness. This dish is a mixture of rice cakes, cabbage and small strips of pork. Everything is great and the flavours come together really well! It's a big plate, we usually have to get take-out for this. Oh yeah, try the glutinous rice with dough fritter. Another must get!!

Overall:  My mom got a discount card here. Enough said."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.. The food isn't that good. The only thing I go there for is the shanghai soup pork dumplings, along with the pan fried pork dumplings. Fried rice was horrible.. Squid calamari with peppers = TOO salty. I don't recommend this place unless you're looking for the dumplings. I only come for the dinner menu, and haven't tried the lunch one. The setting is very modern and nice for an asian restaurant."}
{"text":"The problem with writing 3 star reviews is that I'm writing about an average experience, which is neither horrible nor wonderful and as a result, I feel rather uninspired.  

Today's visit was the third time I've visited over the past year and a half or so.  First time with my mom.  It was fine, the sesame pancakes were not as flaky as they should have been.  Second time with a friend.  It was ok then too.  I just remember the pot-sticker dumplings to be a bit disappointing - too thick skinned.  And today with my husband and daughter we had deep fried squid (I've had better), gai-lan with garlic (good), xiao long bao (good, but nothing exceptional), and spicy shredded beef (good flavour but overcooked I felt).

For average food it's on the pricy side.  I guess you are paying for the dark decor?  

So sorry, no witticisms or clever observations in this review.  I'm even bored after proof-reading this."}
{"text":"We, party of 4, cam here for lunch on April 3, 2016.

We ordered, Hot plain soya bean Milk, Steamed soup-filled pork dumplings with ground pork, Steamed vegetarian dumplings, Sautéed pig stomach, Braided beef with noodle in soup, Sautéed Chinese Broccoli Plain, and House special twice-cooked pork & dried tofu with spicy sauce.  We asked for no msg to one of the servers. He took our preferences to the chefs. Awesome service so far.

Hot plain soya bean milk arrived quickly which isn't hard to make. The rest of the order took quite awhile to arrive on our table. There was a table who arrived later than us and also ordered later than us got their steamed soup filled pork dumplings ahead of us. That left sour tastes in our mouth. We brought his attention to one the servers and he apologized. We accepted his apologies on behalf of their incompetent kitchen. 

The food tasted not bad. The servers constantly filled our empty tea pot. I was very happy with that. 

Overall, we enjoyed our meal at this restaurant. Will we come back again?  Yes."}
{"text":"We, party of 6, came here for dinner. This is one of the oldest running Asian Legend location. The chef at this location is an OG and trains new chef when there's an expansion. 

This place is packed at dinner time. Luckily we had a reservation made before coming here. We were seated immediately while there's long lineup. 

We ordered medium Xi-hu Soup with Minced Beef and Egg Whites, along with House Special Twice-cooked Pork & Dried Tofu with Spicy Sauce, Smoked Fish, Crystal Pork Aspic, Stewed Chicken with Three-cup Sauce in Casserole, Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Ground Pork, Sautéed Plain Green Beans, Steamed California Sea Bass, and Shanghai Style Soft Noodles with Pork & Shrimp. 

Cold plates came first. This Crystal Pork Aspic is an interesting dish. They don't use pork belly, it's shredded pork meat. I can taste the pork stock in the gelatin and a hint of star anise. I would say this is not the best aspic I've had. We had to cancel the Smoke Fish as we felt their portions were off which they oblige. 

Xi-hu soup came next. We find that cilantro and sliced spring onions were too overwhelming. If they can cut back on those garnish, the soup would be wonderful. 

Steamed Soup Dumplings were not bad. Not the best I've had.  Eat the dumplings fast because if it sits out for too long it dries up. 

We find the House special dish very delicious. Spicy sauce was not too oily and not overwhelmingly spicy, just the right touch. Then the casserole came to our table. Another tasty dish. Chicken was tender and flavourful. No pink chicken!  Big thumbs up!!!

The steam sea bass was alright, they soy sauce really goes well with the fish. Shanghai noodle was good, not the same in Shanghai though. 

By the way, the service here was not too bad. They take the empty plates and constantly refill our teapots. Curls to them!

My party ate everything. Like a pack of wolves. Came out stuffed like a hippo. Really enjoy the night. Just wish they could improve on the Smoke fish portion. We will be back. 

Food:  4/5

{"text":"Great place for dumplings!! All types of fried dumplings and soup dumplings. Is our go to place for dumplings until the next best one. 
 Shanghai noodles we had last time was not fresh. Will give them one more chance in the future. 
Paid parking on street, wish there was a better option"}
{"text":"Dumplings here are good, not as good as the one on Yonge street but other dishes here are better compared to over there. Will return to this location for noodles and rice dishes. Free parking - yay! Convenient because in the same plaza as groceries store."}
{"text":"I always come here for family gatherings as this is our go to spot for big family dinners. We've been to the many locations they have all over the GTA, and by far this is our favourite location. The staff is always consistent in providing excellent service each time (e.g when I came a few days ago I dropped my chopsticks and LESS THAN 5 SECONDS a waitress passes me a new one) and food never disappoints. Food always comes out quick even when the restaurant is packed and the portions are quite generous. The dishes are not overly seasoned with salt or extremely oily like most Chinese places so you can really taste the natural flavours there. 

The only \"bad\" I guess would be that it's more expensive than other typical Chinese restaurants. But the price you're paying is the quality you're getting so I'm not complaining. The restaurant is situated in the metro square plaza so it might be hard for some people to find. You have to drive into the plaza in the middle to see it-it's by the popular bubble tea place CoCo. Lots of parking available too. 

As winter is coming I would recommend the hot and sour soup- one of our favourite dishes!"}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good. Especially the duck.   But it's usually filled with people for the weekend so they kinda hurry you out near the end.

Their front door is pretty heavy so take a note of that when you do go."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a (very) good surprise to me.  

The menu is huge and what i had was really good and globally more refined than in the usual places in Chinatown.  You have to try #1 on the menu.  

However, perhaps i was lucky because it was my first time there (beginners' luck)
I will have to go back again to reassess.

By the way, staff is a bit more friendly and the place is a little bit cleaner than other places around."}
{"text":"it used to be one of my favorites until a not so pleasant experience few months ago.

i tried to make a dinner reservation at 6 and was told no need for it as it would still be considered early.

when we arrived, it was almost full and we didn't have much choice for tables, other than the very first one from the entrance, and the other one a few tables in. problem was both were right under the a/c vents with very cold air blowing out. not only it felt uncomfortable, the food would soon be cold as well. 

so i said i didn't mind to wait for a better table without the cold air. but it was busy and after a few moments the seater showed a little impatient or annoyed that we're there waiting still while there were a couple of those tables empty. and asked if we're sure not to take them as it might be a long wait.... in a tone that we're being unwise to keep waiting. well, we ended up giving in and took the \"cold\" table.

i really didn't understand first why they would not take reservation, and next, why shouldn't we have a preference on where to sit as we did not want to be frozen and to take the food turning cold in a few minutes?

they used to be more friendly and with better attitude. haven't been there since."}
{"text":"I knew this location was no longer the same good one we used to enjoy going, but still gave it another try and were still very disappointed. A place still seems to have no management at all. Food really is just so so, service is not good at all. It was so noisy, not because of numbers of customers, but whole bunch of kitchens and the other staffs making the place like a playground. And when you see how the kitchen staffs take a cigarette break, you may easily your appetite and wondering what would it be like back in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Asian Legend is a chain all across Toronto.  I've been to other locations but this is my first visit to this Scarborough location.  We came here for a late lunch around 2pm.  The restaurant was pretty quiet. The decor was pretty modern for an Chinese restaurant.  There were some lunch specials going on which ended at 3 pm.  I had the sweet and sour pork with rice.  It also comes with the soup of the day and a choice of a spring roll, 2 dumplings or 1 pork potsticker for $9.99. Pretty good price.  I picked the pork potsticker.  My boyfriend ordered the small wonton soup.  The soup of the day was corn soup.  It wasn't good at all.  I didn't finish it.  Maybe it's me but it was weird that the corn was sweet and the soup was salty.  My boyfriend's wonton soup was extremely salty with a lot of MGS.  My sweet and sour pork dish was not bad but the pork had a lot of fat in it and chewy.  Asian Legend is known for their soup filled dumplings, beef pancakes and pork floss donut fritter rolls which I've had at other Asian Legend locations and it was pretty good. I wasn't craving for those items so didn't order them.  Big mistake. I would come back but I would go back to ordering what they're famous for.  Service was fine, nothing to write about."}
{"text":"We had a very bad takeout meal here.  The Hot and Sour soup was neither hot nor sour.  Moreover, it was white and unappetizing looking.  The cashew chicken was made with what seemed like rubber chicken in a goopy clear sauce with no flavour.  The beef with Chinese broccoli was made with strange, spongy mystery meat.  Even the Singapore vermicelli (which is usually a tasty, reliable dish) was dry and pasty.  I tried hard to find a redeeming quality, but I couldn't."}
{"text":"I think Asian Legend made a very smart business decision when they decided to pander their $15 discount card in their restaurants, because every time someone asked me to go eat in an asian place, we'd end up at Asian Legend, as they get the discount. 

This was my first time at the downtown location. I was pleasantly surprised by the English service, which is non-existent up in Markham and North York. The pleasant hostess led me down to the basement eating area, which was well decorated in the typical Asian Legend fashion. Our service was mediocre, the food was typical. 

I didn't like how loud all the patrons were, from tiny children to obnoxious mid to late 20s."}
{"text":"This must be the third Asian Legend I've reviewed on Yelp. For some reason, everyone I know loves this place so I keep coming back. The funny thing is, I now have been to every one of them, even though I haven't reviewed them. The one thing that all of them have in common are mixed babies...I guess that speaks for their customer-base too!

The five of us ordered a ton of food including:
1. steamed soup dumplings: typical as expected. Not the best, not the worst.
2. steamed green soup dumplings: loved it! I like the scallop and melon in there!
3. beef and onion roll: surprisingly tasty, which was above my expectations.
4. twice cooked pork with rice cake: AMAZING. I couldn't stop eating it. 
5. long beans: also AMAZING.
6. egg plants: didn't try
7. pan fried dumplings: didn't try

I had a really good time here and the place feels very pretty and spacious."}
{"text":"The metro square location is better, but this one is not too bad.
I'm not a huge fan of this chain to begin with, and I definitely have had better Asian food.

Last time I was here, a few days ago, we had
- \"hong yo chau shao\" (spicy wonton): waaay too watery
- \"fan twan\" (rice rolls): the filling was good, i like the radish
- \"yo tiau\" really small and dry
- shanghai noodles: meh, kinda bland
- shao long bao (soup dumplings): MEH

Nothing spectacular about this place. I really don't have much to say about it. It's okay, not too bad for shanghainese dimsum.

they also try to sell you their membership cards while you're eating, over and over again, which is kinda annoying"}
{"text":"Asian Legend has a nice selection of food.  However, they don't seem to specialize in any particular region of China's cuisine.  It's a case of \"jack of all trades, but master of none\".

People tell me their xiaolongbaos are great, but I disagree.  Ding Tai Fung's XLB's are far superior."}
{"text":"Ordered from Asian Legend via UberEATS last week. The food arrived hot and on time. While the food was decent, it was definitely nothing special. It is frustrating to notice the significant increase in price if you order rather than dine in. For example, the Schezuan Beef is $13.99 if you dine in, but $19.95 if you order via Uber. So not only is the price jacked by almost 50%, you also end up paying a delivery fee for some very mediocre food. Not sure who is responsible for hiking the price but either way it is a huge rip off."}
{"text":"Unlike other asian legend, this location is spacious. I was here in a late night around 8:30pm. The restaurant was not full. 

We got served very quickly, and food comes right after. The food is not average comparing with other locations. The food is not hot enough. We ordered a few dumplings, and snacks. The food portion is reasonable based on the price.

The overall experience was average."}
{"text":"The Shrimp and Egg Fried Rice is worth coming back for! Plus the Shrimp Dumplings are FTW!"}
{"text":"They have a very extensive menu which was great but a bit overwhelming. The servers were also not that helpful either. However, the food we had was excellent. We started with dumplings which were all great. Then we had mushu pork, crispy Szechuan chicken, beef flat noodle, beef and Chinese broccoli, and steamed snow pea greens. My favorite was the beef with Chinese broccoli. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Even though we ordered a lot the food, it still  came out very fast. 

The restaurant is very beautiful, the place was excellent and I definitely recommend it to everyone else.  

Dim sum was very good as well, can't turn down those soup dumplings..

Bathroom was very clean!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot and have their VIP card as I love spicy food and this place is one of the few places I have encountered that has decent quality Chinese food with quite a few well-made Sichuan dishes. 

Usually I come in a large group so we book a private room in the back of the restaurant which I like because the rest of the restaurant gets quite loud and busy. Although there is a corkage fee, you can bring your own wine which is nice. 

We usually get the Peking duck, a bunch of the appetizers (my favourite is their steamed soup bun which is pretty decent here even though its not a dim sum restaurant), some spicy Sichuan dishes and some seafood dishes. There's always a wide variety and I like most of the dishes that I've tried here. 

I've tried a couple of their soups and I thought they were all pretty good as well. I also like the sweet red bean soup they give you at the end of the meal. Overall, I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food but I always have a good experience here and I bring friends and family here all the time."}
{"text":"This place has worms in its veggie dish. The waitress did not only not apologize or refund dish, she was actually not concerned about the issue and hesistant to switch dish. This makes you question what its like inside the kitchen.... Do NOT come here"}
{"text":"A-Okay. 
Hainan chicken: wish they had the sauce out that this particular dish sometimes comes with
Dumplings: good
Shanghai rice cake: tasted fishy and was missing the flavor this dish usually has
Snowpeas: enjoyed
Scallion pancake: very thick

Appreciated that they had vinegar and soy sauce already out on the tables to dip one's dumplings. They also have a frequent customer card."}
{"text":"One of the more preferred Asian restaurants to go to for Shanghai food. The price and portion size makes the value pretty decent compared to a lot of places. I'd recommend getting th dumplings and noodles for sure."}
{"text":"I am honestly not sure what to make of this restaurant.  We ordered takeout so I can only comment on that.  They seemed insulted that we were ordering takeout instead of dining in.  The portions were SMALL and the quality was average.  The chow Mein got a good review from my friend but I could have done without it.  Honestly, I enjoy the Mandarin much more than this.  Pricey, small portions and just okay taste doesn't make me want to go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Asian Legend has all of my favorite Chinese dishes in one restaurant. Xiaolongbaos are perfect- the skin is thin and not thick so its filled with more protein than carbs. The XLBs are also super juicy and flavourful. Drool. Love their hot and spicy noodle soup- the soup is the perfect combination of hot, sour and spicy. The onion pancake with sliced beef- omg. Words can't explain how delicious it is- green onion pancake is heaven plus sliced beef.... heaven on earthhh. Beef noodle soup is great too, but if you don't eat it right away, the soup will absorb into the thick noodles. :( Everything is always fresh and service is attentive. Although the food is excellent and you'll probably have a difficult time choosing how many dishes to order, expect to suffer from a severe food coma after your Asian Legend feast... I wouldn't be surprised if all the dishes contain a high amount of MSG."}
{"text":"Duck 2 ways and the pan fried rice cake were phenomenal. The greens were slightly on the oily side, but that just meant more room for duck pancakes! Luckily we went with locals who have been many times before because you are supposed to just write down your order and I would've been totally clueless. I love it when I go to eat with people who just order all the good stuff so I don't have to make any decisions and just get to enjoy stuffing my face."}
{"text":"I really love their duck wrap. The wrap is very thin, which help you to taste more of the meat and the sauce, at the same time you won't feel oily. The vegetables (cucumber and green onions) help to refresh the taste. Overall quite awesome"}
{"text":"We passed by Asian Legend and decided to give it a try after coming across it many times at their other locations. The restaurant was decorated nicely, from the walls to the seating areas. We came by during dinner time but the place was barely half full and there was no one to seat us. 

However, when we did manage to be seated, we were quite surprised by the dishes we had ordered. We had ordered pork slices with tofu and green peppers and crispy beef. Both were kind of small for their portions but they were delicious! The beef dish was my favourite since it was sweet and salty with a hint of ginger.

We would love to come back and try other menu items since I've been eyeing on the soup dumplings and noodles."}
{"text":"Asian Legend still a solid 4 star experience for me after all these years. I have been coming for lunch on Saturdays quite often and I have yet have a bad experience. Everything is really consistent from the service which is excellent to the quality of the food. Staff here always polite, fast on their feet and offers really professional service that I have yet found in other Chinese restaurants.

Now they have a brand new lunch menu which offers their staples in smaller portion which is perfect if you are dining alone or as a table of 2 as you can order more to share.

My favourite dumplings is the Steamed Chicken Dumplings comes in an order of 4 or 6, as it is always juicy and has shitake mushrooms which is quite unique. Their noodle dish is always solid.

Worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Asian Legend is one of the most successful Northern Chinese Cuisine Franchise as you know you would get good service, decent food, nice decor no matter which location you visit.

Asian Legend at Thornhill Commerce Gate is A-OK.

Double Boiled Chicken Wonton Soup ($15.95)
- One of my favourite dish as it is like 2 different dishes in one: chicken and wonton soup

Shanghai Fried Noodle ($8.95)
- a little on the oily and salty side but my 2 dinner mates finished that with no complaints

Complimentary desserts at the end always a nice touch."}
{"text":"This Asian Legend closes at 11:30 pm on weekdays, but please don't come here at 11:00 pm and expect to be served, The kitchen closes way earlier and all the wait staffs are anxious to go home. 

Service can be amateurish and non attentive and the waiters feels too relax gossipping within themselves.

As a late night snack at 10:30ish, we decided to order something relatively light to share:

Steamed Soup Filled Dried Scallops and Luffa Dumplings ($6.95)
- A little overcooked but I always love how the dried scallops gave the soup a more savoury taste

Stir Fried Bitter Melon ($9.95)
- Bitter melon way overcooked resulted in a really mushy texture
- I do like the spiciness and it balanced out the bitterness

Chicken with 3 Cups of Sauces in Casserole ($10.95)
- The smell of fresh basil and other herbs made this dish a winner for the night
- Chicken is cooked just right with the meat still stay juicy and tender

I usually frequent the other Asian Legend locations but if you are in the area, this is not a bad choice. 

Parking can be quite challenging during dinner hours as the plaza has a lot of other restaurants and Sunny Supermarket utilizing the same parking lot!"}
{"text":"I was brought to Asian Legend by my Asian roommate and her family for Chinese New Year (my new favourite food holiday). As my roommate would say, \"If there are a lot of Chinese people inside, it's good\". Since this location in Chinatown is frequented by a lot of tourists, they weren't all Asian. But the food was SOOOO good.

This place isn't your typical Spadina greasy spoon. The décor is really classy and everything inside is so pretty! And the food. The food is really really good. Having grown up in Scarborough I consider myself to be somewhat of a Chinese food connoisseur and this place passed my stringent test (of food being delicious and not too greasy). I remember ordering about 8 dishes between the group of us and everything being amazing. In particular the Chinese Broccoli and their fried rice seemed to be far tastier than anything I had had elsewhere. 

I did see that their menu offered dim sum and was intrigued -- now that I know it's good, I will totally come back and try it!

This place has become a larger chain, I know there is one location at Leslie & Finch and a new one just opened at Brimley & Sheppard. Totally worth checking out if you love Chinese food but don't always want the plastic tablecloth atmosphere."}
{"text":"great Northen Chinese restaurant with authentic chinese foos. Curry lamp noodle was so.good"}
{"text":"As a regular on the Asian Food circuit, I was impressed with Asian Legend. We had the dumplings, deep-friend garlic Tofu, and the beef with chinese broccoli. Overall the food was fully capable of making me look like a pig as I scarfed it down in true dirtball form. 

They have another location up in North York which I haven't tried, but have also heard great things about. If you are in the vicinity and want Chinese, then definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Had an incredibly unpleasant experience at this location. The food is average at best. We ordered a few dishes - soup dumplings with ground pork (the best dish of our meal), pork buns (couldn't even finish this - was all dough, greasy and pork not BBQ pork), pan fried chicken dumplings (about the same as frozen grocery brands), shrimp and BBQ pork fried rice (OK), bok Choy with enoki mushrooms (OK), and shredded pork with Peking sauce and 6 pancakes (also OK). So we were likely not going to return based on the food alone since nothing stood out to us. But it was the service at the end that sealed the deal.

We had a voucher and we had only paid tip on what we paid. The server then got upset that we didn't pay tip based off the overall bill with voucher included, asked me \"Do you understand?\" Then did not give us our take out food so we had to sit there while she ranted about us in Chinese (but we understood it) to her fellow server. Felt very harassed and upset by this.  

The only thing this place I feel has got going for them is the interior."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Northern Chinese dim sum places... either I'm just really easily impressed because I have this sort of food so infrequently (maybe I'm just over the whole Cantonese-style dim sum thing?), or it's just that good. I have been here a number of times and I have always enjoyed the food here. This time, we got xiao long bao/soup dumplings, an egg/onion pancake thing, rice roll thing, spicy tofu, regular dumplings, and a bun that you dip into condensed milk. For the most part I liked everything except I could have done without the spicy tofu. The bun with condensed milk was really good, but so simple, it's like something you can just make at home yourself. Whatever they put into their dumplings was seriously addictive like crack though, like I couldn't stop eating them and just thinking about them now is making me salivate. The restaurant is also pretty nicely decorated as well, high ceilings, fairly roomy, etc. Great place to go to if you're getting tired of the typical Cantonese/HK dim sum fare and want to try something new and delicious!"}
{"text":"I went with some friends for Peking duck. I would say the service wasn't very good. The staff wasn't the nicest and the food was very mediocre."}
{"text":"Been to asian legend many times in the past and while their peking duck along with other small side dish were good, they really need to reconsider their noodles menu. I got the Beijing za jiang noodles and it was absolutely terrible. The sauce was extremely bland and watery, the noodles were of poor texture and overall just inaccurate. Please dont order this, me and my friend had one bite each before we gave up."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.

Their lunch menu is vast and has a lot of varieties compared to other ayce. I found service to be super fast and efficient. Waiters aren't rude and repeatedly come back to ask how you're doing. atmosphere is great. Food wise it's ok, fish is good for ayce. I find this place to be pretty busy all the time."}
{"text":"While the food here is nice, it is a little pricey. I had the rolled onion pancake with sliced beef which, while very, very oily and not exactly made traditionally, was quite delicious. I also had the beef noodle soup, and the breakdown is: noodles - okay, soup - meh, and beef - amazing. Not the best I've had, but okay for when you get a craving.

The decor is nice and the waitstaff are okay."}
{"text":"One thing I admire Asian Legend is how it can maintain the standard of its food at various locations consistent.  It pains me to say it is standard Asian Legend food here, because the standard of Asian Legend is above-average Northern Chinese food.  I have eaten so many dishes at Asian Legend that I must say all of them are authentic and delicious.  Any difference in opinion is due to different flavour preferences such as how spicy and how salty one likes.

The services we had this evening was okay.  The waitress was quick and effective in giving us water, food and the bill, but she didn't smile much.  

This location is one of the older locations.  Its seating area seems to be the smallest one in GTA, as the Chinatown location has a seating area in the basement.  The ambiance and interior decor is similar to the Commerce Gate location, but less pleasant than the one on Sheppard Avenue.

Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Ok. So, I've been to other Asian Legends before and I believe this was the worse experience. The food was very salty in a MSG-sort-of way. I am very surprised to see actual Chinese natives eat here. The food is not authentic Chinese cuisine. There are SO many better Chinese restaurants in the area.. I'm disappointed in myself for wasting $ here. To top it off, the waiter forgot to put our order in the system until we inquired about it. So, we ended up waiting 45 mins for our food. I know human errors happen, but no apology and no offer to compensate us for the inconvenience! I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a fair price. Cozy place. Service is good as well. High variety menu. The casserole (dont remember the reference number) and the beef with mushrooms (code 63) are delicious!! The mango pudding is very good as well, not too sweet, exactly as we like."}
{"text":"My actual rating for the restaurant is 3.5 stars. The ambiance here is a step above other Chinese restaurants and the service is decently quick. The food was a mixed bag. The beef pancake roll was great and so was the beef noodle soup but make sure that you ask them to make it spicy because they don't do it by default. The mooshu pork was decent, nothing outstanding though. The same could be said for their bok choy. The one dish I would not get it again is their dan dan noodles. It did not have pork and it was not spicy enough. It was pretty much ramen noodles and peanut sauce mixed together."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicer Chinese restaurants in the area in terms of service and atmosphere. We ordered the baby bok choy with enoki mushroom, pancake with beef (the ones wrapped in aluminum foil) and the pork pot stickers (wo-teep), Everything was pretty good! I especially liked the baby bok choy and enoki mushrooms since they do not skimp on the mushrooms at all. This is a great place if you want some northern chinese food. It gets really busy though so expect at least a short wait if you don't make reservations."}
{"text":"In spite of everything I've heard about Asian Legend, I was less-than-impressed with my experience here. I ate mango chicken with bok choy and pork. Pretty underwhelming considering our monster wait time. I was later told by friends that my experience was due largely to the fact that I didn't bring Asian friends. That doesn't make any G-D sense.

Obligatory Title Pun: LEGENDARY let down.

Menu readability: I honestly can't remember.

Need to mention: Cool decor and atmosphere. The only let down was the food.

What this place teaches me about myself: I need more Asian friends."}
{"text":"Asian Legend's food is not bad;  it ranges from good to mediocre. 

*****My favourite part of the meal was a dessert that I forget the name of. It was like a very light fluffy fried dough bun doughnut . Inside, it was a fluffy egg white. It's served warm and fluffy & then it shrinks a bit as it cools.

****^The scallion pancake with beef was very good, tasty and well textured.

***Jellyfish salad was okay, as were the two cold meat appetizers we tried (including drunken chicken).

**The xiao long bao were not great. There wasn't much juice/soup trapped inside the dumpling & the skin was too thick and chewy.

*^Fried stick was not crispy enough.

*^Fried Shanghai noodles were so-so. The texture was fine, but they were not very tasty.

Note: I used ^ to indicate a half-star and * for a full star. So, ***^ means 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"By no means am I an expert on Chinese cuisine.  But, in my opinion, this is a wonderful place.  The food is both authentic and accessible.

The peking duck here is superb.  With crispy skin and tender meat, the duck is perfect rolled up with some scallion and a little hoisin sauce.  

The sliced beef rolled in a scallion pancake is heaven -- make sure to try to get one with the pancake still warm!

The soup dumplings are full of fatty, porky goodness and explode with flavor.  

Go with someone who knows what to order, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was skeptical about going for dim sum given that it is typically not very veggie-friendly. But I must say I was pleasantly surprised! 

I had the steamed veggie dumplings - they are much larger than I expected as well as flavourful and fresh! Would definitely order these again! I also tried the cantonese crispy noodles which were a good balance of crispy parts and saucy parts. Dessert was also great - shared a mango pudding which is more of a solid jello-like consistency than other places."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the most infuriating experience and have never been so insulted.  We ordered on the square sheet and had written the three digit order number for the noodle dish we had wished to order: beef stir-fry noodles.  The waiter brought back a very different noodle dish with which appeared to be a curry seafood vermicelli.  We then advised the waiter and without words spoke, an older man appeared to the table, displeased.  He then brought back the noodle in front of me and says I have to eat it because I did not specify the B at the end of the three digits.   So there I was, confronted with two Asian men at my table intimidating me to eat this noodle dish which I did not want.  After several firm NO's in both Chinese and English, they disappear with the dish and never return. We wait and no longer have the appetite to eat after being suffered with the traumatizing experience and leave without eating our main entree.

With their overpriced dishes and extremely poor customer service, we have plenty of restaurants to dine from and will never return."}
{"text":"If you love soupy dumplings and some delicious Chinese comfort food then Asian legend is the place to be.

They have a wide range of dishes to choose from and they are all good.  It really is an Asian legend."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on the 6th day of their opening. The restaurant is conveniently located in a plaza with many other stores, so there is plenty of parking. The interior is clean and modern with the a dark wooden decor. According to one of the waitresses, the restaurant at this location has been a work in progress for a year.

The restaurant has the same menu as all the other Asian Legend restaurants. We ordered the xiao long bao with ground pork, the pan-fried crispy pancake with egg, beef brisket noodle soup, and green beans with dried shrimp. The xiao long bao was tasty as usual. The soup inside was not overly hot. The pancake was also good. We've tried it without the egg at other locations and didn't notice much of a difference except that the non-egg version is obviously crispier. The beef brisket noodle soup was tasty as well. The soup is spicy, as indicated on the menu, and adds a nice flavor to both the noodles as well as the beef. The green beans were tasty as well, but I thought the dried shrimp was too salty.

The opening of Asian Legend in the Maple area is a welcome change as there is a lack of good Chinese food in the area. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this Asian Legend after experiencing better service at a different Asian Legend. Let's recount the failures:

1. The front door was locked. There was no way to get inside. Someone had to get a waiter's attention by knocking on the window for at least a minute.
2. We made a reservation for a particular time, explicitly stating \"quarter past ...\" and they still botched up the reservation time.
3. The fire alarm went off. I hope that they learned not to put customer tables in front of the fire exit. It's too easy for customers to accidentally trigger the alarm.
4. Waiters kept bringing us food meant for other tables.
5. We asked for more tea, and a waiter came by, was distracted by another waiter and discarded the tea pot down at an empty table.

Having said that, the food was good. It's the same quality you'd get at any other Asian Legend. Since this location is closer to home, I was hoping that this would be my go-to place for xiao long bao. But it looks like I'll have to drive a little further to get better service."}
{"text":"Having spent the past several years in Seattle, I haven't had good Chinese food in a long time. What was missing most were places to get xiao long bao. I would have to drive up to Vancouver BC to go to Lin's (before Din Tai Fung opened shop).

I was pleasantly surprised by the food quality at Asian Legend. We had the regular xiao long bao, and it was quite delicious. Flavorful soup with a generous portion of ground pork.

We also had the pan-fried pork dumplings, the pan-fried calzone with garlic, chives, shrimp, and egg, and the pan-fried green onion pancake. These were all perfectly pan-fried and delicious.

Finally, we had the chunky noodles in soup. Extremely delicious. The soup was mildly spicy and the beef was perfect. It reminded me of one of my favorite beef stew dishes.

All in all, I'm a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"If Yelp allowed for more than 5 stars, i would have given it. Asian Legend is the type of place where you're eyes will be hungrier than your stomach. EVERYTHING is good here - i have not tried a single thing that was less than delicious. This place is so good that i go there every time straight from the airport after landing in Toronto.

Try their beef noodle soup with la-mein and green onion pancake that's rolled with beef."}
{"text":"Hair in two dishes. 
Ambience ok.
Food is just ok nothing to write home about. Go next door to congee star!!
I won't come back"}
{"text":"A very typical Chinese restaurant with all the typical Chinese menu items. Do not order the peaking duck. The wraps were dry and the duck was mediocre and just as dry. It took us days to finish the rest of the chopped BBQ duck which we had to take home. Was also disappointed with the jellyfish appetizer which was so tough to chew we just left it, such a waste. The only thing I would recommend is the fried tofu which has a nice crispy texture and the 139B ho fun noodles with beef. I would only go here if I was really craving some comfort Chinese food that wasn't too far of a drive. Should also note that the interior is very clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"The photos on the menu vs. what arrives are very different. We ordered green onion pancakes,  soup dumplings with pork, hot and sour soup, sauteed green beans, and seafood with rice cakes. The onion pancakes were OK, not great, not awful. The hot and sour soup was not well flavored and had way too much starch thickener which showed up as gelatinous clumps. We usually love soups but we each had one bowl and then declined to take the rest home b/c the clumps became even more obvious when the soup cooled down. The green beans dish is described as being prepared with dried shrimp - I've had this many times before and this is a key ingredient for a complex saltiness, so ordered this, looking forward to seeing the little pieces of umami. This arrived with just some chili peppers and course chopped garlic -  and NOT one dried shrimp in the dish. The seafood with rice cakes was almost nothing but rice cakes and napa cabbage, with 6 small shrimps, 4 THIN thin slices of scallop, and 4 pieces of calamari. The soup dumplings were the last to arrive, almost when we thought they had forgotten it, and we were about to cancel and ask for the check. By then we were pretty resigned to this being a pretty awful dining experience. Surprisingly, the dumplings were the best thing, especially when eaten with the shredded ginger. While good, it was still not enough for us to return."}
{"text":"Food was not good. Service was awful. We called ahead to book a table since we have 2 babies. We were given a room when we arrived and we were quite impressed with the thoughtfulness of the service thinking that the room would be good for the baby. However, not long after we put in our order, 2 servers started arguing in front of our room and came in shortly and started yelling at us, asking who let us at this room and why we are in this room. \"This room has a minimum charge of $180, why would you be in this room? Are u ready to pay that?\" One of the server said. @asianlegend - please think!!! Customers will not sit themselves. Just because your people don't know what they are doing and gave us the room, doesn't mean you can yell at customers this way. By the way, your food was awful too!!!! None of your dish actually taste right for what they are supposed to be. Will never visit any of your location again!"}
{"text":"I came here last week, but before this, I hadn't visited Asian Legend in a few years. The quality has remained pretty consistent (above average). 

I don't remember what my friend ordered, but I got the mapo tofu lunch set. It came with a small bowl of soup, picked radish, rice, and iced tea. The tofu was a lot spicier than I expected, and I'm not the type of person who is good with spicy food, so I drank a lot of iced tea. It was delicious though! 

We were one of the first people there because we came as they opened. My friend tried calling for a server multiple times, but the waitress was too busy talking to another employee. We had to sit around until she noticed us. I took off a star for that.

Overall, it was a decent experience. I would return, but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I stopped over with my sister for some lunch.

SERVICE
Fairly good.  There was server when we needed one and a server checked in with us when we needed to be checked in.  

MENU
The menu had mostly Northern Chinese food style.  It was spicy and savoury.  We had the spicy tofu with pork and rice and some steam buns.  The menu also had variety of noodles shanghai style.  

PRICES
It was a lunch menu we had and besides the good sized servings there were other inclusions such as a corn soup.  Lunch under $10 per person.  

OVERALL
Good food, good enough to say that I would try their dinner menu soon.  This restaurant is a big chain and I would say its consistent to the other ones I have been too."}
{"text":"Asian Legend at Brimley and Sheppard used to be a Swiss Chalet, and you can definitely tell by the sloping roof. I think the restaurant did a great job transforming the space into the Chinese-style décor. I like this location a lot because it's so large and spacious.

Here's what I had on this particular visit:

Pan fried dumplings with pork: this was good, but I've had better ones before.

General Tso's Chicken: this resembles sweet and sour pork, except here we have deep fried chicken instead of pork. I ordered this after spotting it on the table next to ours, and the sauce was ridiculously addictive. 

Dan Dan spicy noodle in peanut sauce: the flavour wasn't very impressive and I wasn't a fan of the thick noodles.

Surimi with broccoli: this was pretty good, but again, not the best that I've had. I wish they included the uncooked egg yolk to add more creaminess to the egg whites. 

Ended the meal with complimentary green bean soup. All in all, I enjoy Asian Legend and I find it to be very reliable. You can always find something that you like here."}
{"text":"I was craving Peking Duck one day and decided to just go to Asian Legend to get it. It was awesome! The pancake was delicate and not overly doughy. I'm a fan of Asian Legend in general because the food usually taste good and it's not overly pricey!"}
{"text":"Two of us came here and just pigged out!

To start, we ordered the soup filled dumplings with pork. (These are hard to find downtown.)  Then we ordered a Peking Duck (relatively good value at around $40), ginger and green onion flavoured lobster, and fried rice.

The food here is good, the service is decent, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been there with a large group. They have separate seating downstairs which was ideal for this case. 

Food and service was good. The vegetarian eggplant dish was my favourite."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here since highschool days!  They have the best soups! I love ordering their fish maw crab soup or the hot and sour it is the best compared to other restaurants I've tried.  I love their pan fried onion wrap with beef! Their dumplings are great especially the little dragon dumpling or the green ones.  Service is fast but mediocre.  Prices affordable!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Chinese food. Always consistent. We have had spring rolls, fried squid, spicy beef, tofu, spicy beans and more on many occasions. Each time the food is terrific."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I don't know how much the meal cost, so I can't comment on the quality:price ratio 

We were a party of 7 for lunch on a Friday. The restaurant was fairly busy, but there were still a lot of empty seats. 

Service was great. The waiters refilled our teapots every few minutes and they took our empty plates away almost instantly. 

The food tasted nice. The soup filled xiaolongbao were indeed filled with soup and the skin didn't break. 

Everything was nicely flavoured and the portions were good. 

The decor is nice and clean. Nothing looks cheap or dingy. 

Not much to say. Just a nice meal in good company"}
{"text":"Another Chinese restaurant to explore.  Not your typical setting from Chinatown; this restaurant is pretty and elegant.  
We got there at the peak of dinner time.  Had to line up.  Quoted wait time was 20 minutes or so but we got seated soon after.  I think there were only 2 to 3 waitresses working.  One was literally jogging from table to table.
We ordered our food.  Normally soup would come first but other dishes came first.  The soup was served in the middle of the meal.  We didn't have bowls so we had to ask for it.  We had to scoop the soup ourselves.  At the end when we were leaving, I noticed another table got their soup first, and the waitress also scooped the soup into bowls for them.  
Still on the topic of soup, we ordered fish maw soup.  We found lots of slivers of ginger in it.  The rest of the dishes were ok.  
Was it legendary?  Was it a good, memorable experience?  Nah."}
{"text":"They have another location up in North York which I haven't tried, but I was impressed with Asian Legend. We had the dumplings, deep-friend garlic Tofu, and the beef with chinese broccoli. The food was fully capable of making me look like an oink oink as I woofed it down like there was no tomorrow."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday dinner with ten other people so we got to sit in one of the special rooms. The decor is great and is certainly an upgrade from the other Asian Legend locations. The pricing seems to be more expensive too. However, the food quality varied so much from dish to dish, it was hard for me to rate this place 3 stars. It was surprising that the Shanghainese dishes were so bad. The Cantonese and more westernized Chinese dishes were much better. Some dishes were too oily or had too much garlic in them. Taking in consideration the price and quality, I would rather go to ALA Kitchen for my Shanghainese food fix and another Cantonese restaurant for cheaper food."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Left within minutes of being seated regardless of the waitress telling us (a party of two) to sit after she cleaned the table, and then getting bumped out of it when we were first in line for a party of three. I'd give it a zero-star review if I could."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Asian Legend for many years, and I still enjoy every visit. As with every Chinese restaurant you have to know what to order - not everything is tops but much is. As we live close to Chinatown we can also compare Asian Legend with other restaurants in downtown. 

The soup dumplings are very nice and quite exclusive - haven't found them in a comparable quality elsewhere. The green onion pancake, the deep fried tofu, both very good and even that old standby, hot and sour soup was really good. The pot stickers are fine, but the har gow has a skin that is thicker than the ones at Sky Dragon. We had one chicken dish we enjoyed, but I don't remember the name."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. Super quick service. Best General Tao chicken I have ever had. Smoked duck is a must try. 
Although I have a feeling they use a lot of MSG cuz I was super thirsty when I got home."}
{"text":"Asian Legend was were we went for our first meal in Toronto and I was very impressed.  I kind of resisted the idea of going to Chinatown thinking that we would be disappointed since we're used to the caliber of Chinese food in the SGV.  I would say that Asian Legend is good enough to make it in the SGV.

The menu was huge so we had a little trouble deciding.  We finally narrowed it down to:
-Steamed Soup Dumpling with Pork, Luffa and Scallop (Very beautiful to look at but not enough soup inside and the flavor was average)
-House Special Crispy Chicken (The bf liked this a lot; I thought it was a little bland)
-Beef Noodle Soup (The noodles were ok, the soup was good and the beef was fabulous)
-Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef (Wow! This was so good. We ordered it to take it to go but ended up devouring the whole thing half way through the meal. It was definitely the best thing we got).

Four items cost about $45 w/ tax and tip. While it wasn't the cheapest Chinese meal ever, we were so satisfied."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon and the wait was not too long, around 15-20 minutes I believe. I really like their soup dumplings, we ate the pork ones this time but the crab meat ones are really good as well. The hot and sour soup was a bit too sour for my liking though. We also had the braised beef noodle soup but I was not able to take a picture of it before it was devoured haha! Out of all the locations they have, this one is particularly different because it kind of looks like a house or a chateau from the inside. Overall, this restaurant is a good place to eat if you're craving some northern Chinese cuisine with friends or family."}
{"text":"I eat/order from here since it is the most convenient in Vaughan. We need more Asian food in this area! I subscribe to their VIP to get 10% off. It is by no means exceptional Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great place in Chinatown. First this was a recommendation from a good taiwanese friend of mine who told me this is the place with good chinese.  Ended up going there with my girlfriend on saturday and we had a phenomenal dining experience.  

Our order was as follows: 
       - Pork Dumplings - these were delicious fresh and hot and juicy perfect dumpings.
       - Kung Pao Chicken - nice and spicy with good dose of vegetables and peanuts
       - Seafood Fried Rice.  - Nice and tasty fried rice with shrimp with my fav. hot sauce was delicious

TIPS : 
   1.  Waiters are knowledgeable and will discuss with you the best dishes make sure to ask for advice from them before u order
   2.  Have the Dumplings ; these were great dumplings

Decor : 5 stars (because it was in chinatown i was impressed with the decor)
Food : 5 Stars (BEST CHINESE I'VE HAD)
Value : 5 Stars (The dishes were about 10 bucks a plate for great food and good decor)
Service : 3 Stars ( This was the only downside the waiter needed to keep being reminded to get me water or a fork or hot sauce)

All in All a great dining experience...will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Typical Asian legend chain. The serving size is a bit small compared other chinese places. The service is good but not great. Overall the decor is always classic modern Chinese. My family comes this chain way too often. So for the food all I can say is it's good and sort of traditional. But flavour across the Asian legends are consistent. I'm happy to come back any time with family and friends :)"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm with an appetite for some fast & hot Chinese food.

Upon entering we were promptly greeted and allowed to pick our own table. The restaurant was pretty empty, with a few large groups of families and couples dining.
I love the decor as it's totally not what I expected to see inside. A large spacious dining room with high sloped silver lined ceilings and dark wood tables, much formal looking than what I would have thought.

We decided to order a few different to try 

Pan Fried Pork Dumplings (4pcs) - Crispy outside with juicy plump and flavourful pork  filling Pretty Good!

Green Onion Pancake (8pcs) - Golden crispy with a mild onion flavour 

Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef (4pcs) - Loved everything about this, the crispy pancake, tender beer, crunchy veg and juicy filling super flavourful

Shredded Chicken Fried Rice w/ egg - Lots of tender strips of chicken and fried egg simple but tasty & huge portion

Kung Pao Chicken - Large chunks of tender white meat chicken with red and green pepper It definitely packs some punch so be ware of the red chilis but very good none the less

Overall a very filling and delicious meal. Food came out fast, fresh, and steaming hot. I could drink there tea all day long and appreciated that they leave a mug on the table. Service was really good with our waitress checking up on us and making sure everything was ok. Huge portions, very affordable and you'll have enough left over to have for lunch the next day!"}
