{"text":"Ordered 3 large pizzas for a party and they were the best pizzas ever! Everyone loved them! The sausage was the best. Their pizza bagels are also a definite must!"}
{"text":"Great destination for stromboli and pepperoni rolls.  The pizza is a thicker style pan pizza.  I don't think their marinara sauce is consistently homemade but still, it tastes great."}
{"text":"Best pizza bagels outside of NYC. They're super cheap too! I normally don't like plain pizza or bagels, but the plain cheese pizza bagel served right from the oven is perfection. Their workers are always pleasant too and they keep the line moving during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"What's a Stromboli? It's like a Calzone. The only difference is that, um, well, I really don't know. The only thing that mattered is that when I tasted it, it was delicious! Frickaccio's is located at the southern wall of the West Side Market. They also sell pizza bagels, pizza and all sorts of Italian savory pastries."}
{"text":"One of my favorite foods: their pizza bagels! I actually run the facebook page because I loved it so much! See you guys at end of Aug to get my fix :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today.  My wife and I were wandering around the West side market and were a little hungry whenever we noticed this counter.  What really caught my attention about Frickaccio's were the pizza bagels (pizagle if you will) and all of the different toppings on them. I ended up ordering the original pizagle hot so that I could eat it right away.  The girls behind the counter were both nice and about 2 minutes after paying them my pizagle was ready.  I loved the idea of it but the end result was a bit underwhelming.  The cheese on it was good and crispy but I thought that it could have used a bit more sauce.  It also could have used a bit more time in the oven as the center was still a cold.

The bottom line for me is that I think I could have gotten something better in the West Side Market.  It's not that my pizagle was bad as it wasn't but for some reason I was expecting more out of it."}
{"text":"Love love love this pizza!  Tried it at West Side Market while shopping, now I go there just for the pizza!  I live in Chardon and hope and pray they open a shop out here!"}
{"text":"While doing research on 'must-eats' for Cleveland, I came across the West Side Market, specifically pizza bagels from Frickaccio's. 

The pizza bagels I'm used to eating are usually sliced in half, but not here. Instead, they just put some sauce and cheese on top of the bagel. It was not what I expected. I was kind of disappointed. I'm not sure if it was leftover from the night before but the bagel was chewy, and there was definitely not enough cheese. I also asked for a hot one, but the middle was still cold. I feel like I could make a better pizza bagel at home.

Maybe their other items are better? I don't think I would bet on that though."}
