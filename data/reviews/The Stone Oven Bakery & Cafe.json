{"text":"The food here is generally pretty good and the atmosphere is nice, however, many of their employees are arrogant and unprofessional. Their prices are also a bit ridiculous for what you get.   On our most recent visit, we had ordered a salad, a slice of pizza, two pastries, coffee, and a soda (all were readily available behind the counter).   We received our soda and coffee, along with a numbered card, and found a seat while we waited for the rest of our order to be brought out.   We waited 15 minutes for our fairly basic order, until I went up to the counter, numbered card in hand, and politely inquired how much longer it would be.   A dismissive employee greeted me with a rude \"What'd you order?\".   While telling her my order again, she cut me off mid-sentence and said, \"We'll have it out when it's ready. Go sit down and we'll have it right out.\"   A few minutes later, the food came out and it tasted all right, but there's no reason we should have had to wait 15+ minutes for food that was already sitting right behind the counter when we ordered it.   At a normal sit-down restaurant, 15 minutes would be acceptable, but this place should be the equivalent of a Panera with their serving times.   Also, it should be noted that on this recent visit, there was a guy who looked like the owner, walking around the restaurant. You would think the employees would be on their best behavior when he's around, but apparently not.   Overall, The Stone Oven's food is decent, but their service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Great choice for a quick pastry and coffee or meeting a friend for lunch. The line to order can be long for lunch. I suggest calling in advance for take-out."}
{"text":"Food was okay, little bland. When I ordered I asked the checker if something was gluten free. They didn't know and asked the chef, who also didn't know. Chefs should know there product. Service was rude. Fighting for a table and when you got one it was sticky along with the plates. 3/5"}
{"text":"This place has horrible service. A couple of women behind the desk are straight up rude or don't remember or care to try to understand your order. Poor service. Food is pretty good but not worth it if you want service."}
{"text":"This is NOT the Stone Oven on Lee Road. Similar food, smaller portions, not a very good vibe. Staff seems disinterested and not concerned about good service. If you are looking for the real deal, try the Stone Oven on Lee. Management at the Chagrin location didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"I love the Stone Oven at both Eton on Chagrin and on Lee Rd. They have great sandwiches, salads, and soups. They always have a vegetarian soup choice.  Their bread is amazing! They make the breads and pastries there. I always take a loaf of wheat bread home with me. My only complaint is I don't love the salad dressing they offer."}
{"text":"The gentleman who is the manager or owner is very nice... The staff however looks very unhappy, seems as if they would rather be anywhere else than there. I frequent this place for the quality of food but the service is also lacking, takes quite some time for an order to be ready, and again is never delivered with a smile. Unless it is by the manager/owner"}
{"text":"Although I would have to agree that most of the service was subpar, the food was great and relatively cheap. I didn't have any horrifying experiences with the employees, they just don't seem to care too much. There was one girl behind the counter who gave us our food, however, that was very friendly, which made me forget about the apathy of the other employees.   I chose the pick two option and had half a sandwich and a small salad. The salad was pretty big for being considered small and part of a pick two! $8 isn't bad, in my opinion, for something that tastes good and is larger sized than most places comparable. The store itself is pretty spacious and offers seating for bigger groups as well. Second time here and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is not doing so well on Yelp, while the other location on Lee Road seems to be doing just fine. If you've been to both locations, you'll quickly see the difference. While the desserts seem to be of the same caliber (I've only had desserts here, so I can't speak for the comparison of everything else), the service and atmosphere are seriously lacking. The wide, open space lends itself to a clean feeling, but the place was not actually clean at all when I was here. There were napkins strewn about, crumbs everywhere, and the staff was pacing behind the counter, looking bored and clearly not interested in the upkeep of the place. To add to that, the staff was also just plain unfriendly, and unfortunately it seems like everyone has had similar experiences with rude employees. I'm glad I live so close to the other location, so my opportunities to check this one out are very limited. I hope for the sake of the business, the owner considers a retraining day or overhaul of customer service employees."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever had from here to eat and drink and been great! The ONLY reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the attitude of the employees. There are two younger ladies that are very rude. Almost to the point where I have had to hold myself back from saying something to them about it. They never smile and are very impatient. If I didn't work in the area, I would never visit here again."}
{"text":"What a waste of time and money. Food was good, but the service was horrible. They would rather stand around and talk to each other rather than serve people. And talk about service with a smile? It is nonexistent. Don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not impressed and I was hoping I would be. If you advertise a smoked turkey sandwich for $8.45, shame on me for thinking it would be more than a folded- over SINGLE slice of Sara Lee turkey, a SINGLE piece of provolone, piece of lettuce and a smear of Honeycup brand honey mustard. I could stock all of that in my fridge at home. No creativity, no uniqueness, and an emaciated amount of ingredients. I love local and independents, but there is no excuse for lack of specialness in restaurant food.  If you are expecting your bread to be the differentiator, then have them all in stock. Don't tell me Asiago bread is not available and relegate me to 3 different varieties of Italian bread.  Sorry, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Service is poor for the most part. There are a couple nice happy people. Others are acrid with the expectation of tips which shouldn't be compulsory. But you only have to deal with them when you order and pay. There are no waitstaff.   With all that said....  The bread is outstanding. Jaina's salad is a favorite. So good. And the eggplant zucchini sandwich is delicious. I really couldn't recommend the food more.   The only reason I'm taking the time to write this review is because it's current star ranking is no where near the quality of the actual meal. And the owner seems really nice and friendly.   He needs to have a discussion with his front desk help or this place won't survive."}
{"text":"A younger, slim blonde cashier/server/etc. was kind of rude.  I was waiting on my iced coffee that she was making for me and looking toward her because I'd ordered a salad (over-priced) and was going to ask for a to go box in advance.  She turned to me and she said \"Um, is there a problem?\"  I replied \"No, I just need a box, I can tell.\"  She handed it to me saying nothing.  I also asked for a water and she just pointed at the water coolers in the cafe.    First time visit, and last.  Shouldn't have tipped her a dollar, as she was rude, and didn't serve anything really.  She served herself a bad review for this nice looking place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Horrible service from a cashier named Kevin. I am a regular and I will be taking my business elsewhere for lunch. After leaving there horrified by the way I was talked to, I went over to Taza and had fantastic food and even better service. Stone oven- Kevin and his employment should be reconsidered."}
{"text":"This is my go-to lunch spot in the area, but only because I love their house dressing. The salads are great, and while the sandwiches are decent, they are very small and could easily be made at home. The service is absolutely horrible and the employees are incredibly rude most of the time. Expect to be waiting a while if you go here during lunch. I would suggest calling ahead for carry out if you want to save time and avoid the rude employees."}
{"text":"The food and quality are good. However, they are so incredibly slow. I attempted to order lunch there today at 3 p.m. when there was literally two people in the whole restaurant and it took the cashier 5+ minutes to take the order of the lady in front of me. I ended up just walking out with no lunch. Really disappointing that they can't do things more efficiently. The speed has been an issue for a long time, so I don't know if any of the management plans to address it anytime soon."}
{"text":"We order  lunch  all the time from this place ,food is good service  is ok, this is not 5* restaurant  people.  But today  it was horrible  we ordered  to go and had to wait  25 min. After coming  home and start eating, I realized  chicken  is missing  from salad and another  salad had no dressing. Make sure to check  your  food  before  leaving."}
{"text":"They make their own bread and serve different kinds. It's a good place for breakfast, sandwiches, salads, pastries and of course, coffee. They are of good quality overall. The coffee on the boldness meter is somewhere in between Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks. I love the cafe au lait, salmon lox, scrambled egg sandwich for breakfast and the cookies.  Whenever I'm in Eton, I take this over the pseudo-starbucks at Barnes because the lines are shorter and it's a bit more unique. Secondly, there's more seating and the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed. Nothing overtly special, mind not blown, but a great straighforward place for a caffeine fix, breakfast, a snack, a chat or a meeting."}
{"text":"I rarely even write reviews as I often check out what others have to say. But I figured I should say something. I went in to The Stone Oven for the first time today on a whim. Well, the first thing I noticed from the cashier (she had on a green shirt) was probably one of the worst attitudes I've encountered for absolutely no reason. Not a hello, not a smile, nothing, just a blank \"I hate my job\"  stare. I thought this was strange but I ignored it at first because I was looking at their menu. When I did order, the attitude from her not only came back but she forgot to give me my drink- when I asked for it TWICE. When I did get my food, it was beyond horrible!!! Sandwich pretty much fell apart, chicken was cold, still no drink. At this point I just left my food and walked out. I'm extremely disappointed in this place as I was expecting a good meal, but instead I wasted around $10 on a subpar sandwich and put up with abysmal service. They should all be fired, and after reading these reviews, literally everyone said the same thing. Newsflash: get a job you like. A 4 year old could manage this place much better and hire better employees than the current ones working/in charge. Pathetic. You should take your money and time elsewhere, because you will be furious."}
{"text":"I have been to Stone Oven more times than I can count. However, this weekend was by far the worst experience. The customer service was absolutely horrible. The workers seemed lazy, disorganized and rude. I was being observant and noticed that almost every table had something wrong with their order. I ordered the Jaina's Salad, and they forgot the tabouli. My friend who I was with waited 10 minutes for her breakfast sandwich, only to realize that they lost the ticket for her order and then she had to wait another 5 minutes for them to make it. They didn't seem apologetic at all.  At the end of the day, the food quality is still good, but the customer service is the worst I've seen. I will absolutely be going to the Lee Rd store next time and every time in the future."}
{"text":"Food is passable but overpriced, coffee is not good and overpriced, the service is meh, and the atmosphere is not the best. The value for your food dollar here seems lower than comparable cafés, and definitely lower than other fast casual restaurants. Will likely never come here ever again. I suggest looking for other cafés nearby, or even eating at the Whole Foods down the street."}
{"text":"I frequent the Lee rd. location often, and that one is better in every sense. This location was messy and disorganized. The place was not busy and it still took over 15 minutes to get one salad. I ordered the Tanya's Tango (dressing tasted off, stale croutons) and 2 tea cookies. When the cashier repeated my order, she said \"and 3 tea cookies\". I told her that I only wanted 2, and she informed me that it was 3/$1. That was fine with me, so I ordered the third. When I got my receipt, I was charged $1.45 for 3? Huh. Staff seemed like they didn't care. A very low selection. The prices are also higher here than at the Lee rd original location."}
{"text":"I wasn't always a fan of stone oven - because I kept getting the same sandwich which ... wasn't a show stopper.    Now that I've branched out, and tried their salads, soups, and the curry chicken salad (hightly recommend), it's become one of my go-to \"i forgot to pack lunch\" spots to grab some grub.    Not to shabby for a coffee/dessert date either - gentlemen take note!"}
{"text":"The Stone Oven is a great local alternative to the Panera Breads of the world. The Eton location is a popular lunch spot during the week, so sometimes it can be hard to get a table. I love all the homemade options. They have some of the best multigrain bread around town. I enjoyed their Italian Chicken soup recently. Hope they continue to branch out to the West side."}
{"text":"I legit feel that the food is worth trying here. In general, I find that Stone Oven has refreshing options for sandwiches and salads. I love the chicken curry sandwich with a side of couscous - its been a staple for me ever since I discovered their location on Lee Road during graduate school. They always have super fresh bread options, if you're into trying fancy new breads. Also, totally random, but their coffee options are awesome. My favorite is the mint hot chocolate.  Could the restaurant be a little cleaner, like other Yelpers state? Sure. But I think the kids who work here do the best they can. Earlier this week, I stopped in for a late lunch at 3pm, and it was a revolving, bustling door of patrons come and going, particularly young people. That's tough to keep up with.  Overall, Stone Oven has solid wi-fi, plenty of seating, and fairly fast service. If you're craving a really great sandwich and need a place to do a little work/business, Stone Oven will do the trick in a pinch when you're cruising the suburbs."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch.  I had smoked turkey sandwich (good). Others had scrambled eggs with vegetables (good).  Coffee was good. Service was adequate. Pleasant place"}
{"text":"I took my assistant out for lunch, and wanting to venture outside our regular bubble but still be close enough to get back to work within a reasonable time frame, we chose The Stone Oven.  She chose the Mediterranean salad, I the Asian Chicken salad, and both were quite good.  The place is busy at lunchtime, and I appreciated it when one of the employees offered to take our plates when we were finished eating (especially since I was unsure about where to deposit them).  I have eaten here in the past a couple of times, and each time had a good experience.  While the menu is not terribly adventurous, our food was fresh and tasty, and on a future visit, I will likely order another salad.  Service wasn't of the knock-your-socks-off variety, but it was certainly sufficient for what we needed.  The pastries all look great;  we shared a Russian tea biscuit for dessert (and I went back this past Saturday morning to get another one as my consolation prize for working on a Saturday morning)."}
{"text":"I'm here more than twice a week because how yummy the salad is to me.  Service not the best.  Workers not the happiest but food is work trying... Breakfast and lunch is amazing.  Steph's favorite is my ultimate favorite.  Always check your food before you leave if your carrying out."}
{"text":"I can't figure out why someone would have an issue with this place. The staff couldn't be nicer, the coffee is good, the line gets long but moves right along, prices are good, and the sourdough bread is the best toast you'll find. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Bad service will beat great food every time, and it could be the best in town. At least to me. I've had the best salad there and the dressing was very unique, however it was the cashier the one with the acne that rubbed me the wrong way. Apparently she thought it was super funny to keep laughing at me for whatever reason. I've heard very negative things about this place from other people before coming here and still gave it a chance but I see why and it's definitely the people that work here. Bums. Never again. Will settle for average food with great service elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like the stone oven for take out lunch sandwiches. Their selection is small but tasty. The sandwiches are priced right and the sides that they have available are unique and not just the bag of chips. They bakery selection is again small, and they only offer a few soups, and although they run out of items often, the quality is why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I will echo the thoughts of the other reviewers. Food=great! Service=not great. I have been to this location, no exaggeration, about 2 dozen times since moving here 1 yr & 1/2 ago. BUT now I usually avoid it and will drive 20 min out of my way in the wrong direction just to go to the Lee Rd location. Service is usually the least important aspect to me (taste will trump anything) but this place is the exception."}
{"text":"The food here is good.  The service is often terrible and the one girl that works here always has an attitude and is a Debbie-downer.  Management need to focus on service, or business will suffer.  I am the only person in my office that still likes to come here.     Update - they seem to have eliminated the employees with attitudes.   The service is much better these days.   Food is still good.  If only they could figure out how to consistently portion the almost $10 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I've experienced. I came in with a group of 5. After twenty minutes of waiting, we found that 2/5 orders were forgotten. The apparent indifference of the staff didn't help the experience."}
{"text":"I love Stone Oven and most of my friends are regulars here -  and think it's great! I think that we take for granted the consistently good food and service. Great bread and pastries for purchase also.  I have no idea how anyone could give a negative review - the food is well prepared, great options for everyone. It is also a hidden gem for breakfast! Locally owned and the owner is always around making sure things are great."}
{"text":"Don't no why the star rating is so low- this place is great! I've been coming here for years and I love it. The honey mustard turkey sandwich and the Mediterranean salad are so good! Worth coming here for a nice and quick lunch."}
