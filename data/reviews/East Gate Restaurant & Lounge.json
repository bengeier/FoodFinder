{"text":"I wouldn't eat here if somebody paid me a million dollars. They have been shut down many many times for health violations that range from storing raw meat over cooked meat, rats, rotten food near good food. It's just revolting."}
{"text":"If you guys could only read chinese...this place has the best deal on peking duck in the city! For $30 you get a 3 course peking duck meal - duck wraps, then duck soup, then fried duck rice. Then they throw in a free fried fish too! After that, if you still have room, you can also order for $5 more, lettuce wraps. Such a good price and you get so much food. It tastes just as good as any place in Chinatown."}
