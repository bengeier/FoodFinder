{"text":"Pour résumer notre expérience: Nous sommes arrivés, on nous a dit de nous asseoir, nous nous sommes assis, nous avons attendu,nous avons attendu, nous avons attendu, nous sommes partis.
Et il n'y avait pratiquement personne dans le restaurant."}
{"text":"N'y allez pas pour un brunch ! Vu la file à l'universel, on s'est dit qu'on allait tenter... Mauvais choix ! On a prix les ufs bénédictins (saumon et jambon) : les ufs étaient froids, présentation dans un ramequin avec le pain à côté donc débrouille toi.. Et le goût pas terrible nonplus... Je ne suis pas cuisinier et pourtant je peux faire mieux.. Les smoothies étaient moyens : le mien a la fraise passait encore mais celui à la mangue était vraiment mauvais ! Bref, dommage car le cadre est sympa et la serveuse a fait son possible... Finalement, préférez attendre un peu a l'universel, ça vaudra plus le coup !"}
{"text":"I just wandered in on opening night and was really pleased with this cozy little resto with a distinct Plateau neighbourhood feel. It's right across St-Denis from the Sherbrooke metro so you don't have a long walk to get there.

The menu is limited to a selection of around a dozen types of poutine and several varieties of burgers. Soup and dessert, beer and coffees are also available.

The basic formula is a choice of small or large poutine which includes a side-salad of baby greens with a very tasty dressing. I selected a seafood poutine with a calvados flambé. It was a really nice change from the ubiquitous brown gravy and the small portion was still a generous size filled with scallops, squid, shrimp and mussels.

Staff was friendly and welcoming. They played a nice mix of quiet background music and offered copies of graphic novels at each table as well as board games to pass the time with friends. There were no \"opening night\" kinks at all so this place is only bound to get better.

I'll be back next time to try a burger and different choice of poutine!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure...I am a burger snob.  I had a Buenos Aires burger that is in my top 3 ever...anywhere...US and Canada.  The service was impeccable, what a great place to stop in for a quick lunch and beer."}
{"text":"I currently live nearby this place and after weeks of walking by I decided to give it a try. I was sadly disappointed in the poutine I got. Even if it tasted above average (in my opinion it's not) they give you half the amount for twice as much compared to competition a few blocks a way. To top it off the cashier asked if I \"wanted change\" when I handed her a 10.. Normally I don't tip the cashier when I order TAKEOUT... In this case I did, she seemed to have really wanted it... On the inside it was rather roomy with dim lighting and high seats. For a place with the the word poutine it truly fell short of my expectations.. Obviously there could be some amazing items on the menu but I'm not investing my time and $$ trying to find them after a first impression like that.."}
{"text":"Their poutine was extremely good but we had to wait forever to place the order, get the food, and pay for it. There was only one waitress in the entire restaurant. She was rly nice but seemed lil busy to bother. I felt bad that she had to run everywhere for everyone's food. Their card machine was not working at the moment that I had to get the money out frm atm :( Bring extra cash with u just in case. Their service was lil annoying but I'll def go back for their poutine in the future."}
{"text":"We stayed at hotel de institute and were fooled by the cute outdoor atmosphere at hippi poutine across the street. 

First of all we waited over 50 minutes after we had ordered. The waiter subsequently got our order confused with the other table. The sangria tasted like watered down apple juice and we questioned the alcoholic content. The lettuce in the salad arrived unwashed with dirt (and it wasn't pepper). We had the osheaga music festival to attend so we didn't have time to sit and wait. If you're hungry and want something within the hour do not come here."}
{"text":"I got the veggie poutine with tofu instead of cheese. I had to seat myself (I waited to be seated for two mins), order at the cash, and pick up water/food at the cash, service is non-existent (unless you want to add 20+ mins to your wait). The poutine was very salty and covered in oil but I guess it's typical? The thin cut of the fries made them a fun to eat. The \"lemonade\" was quite watered down and tasted more of water than  I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner last weekend as the place we had set our minds on was closing (it was around 8pm). We were in Montreal for the weekend, so anywhere that offered poutine was game. 

Walked in; no one at the hostess stand to seat us, so we waited about five minutes then proceeded to seat ourselves on the patio. The waiter came over a few minutes later with menus (inclusive of different poutine dishes and burgers, mainly). We finally placed our order and still did not have the glasses of water we asked for... I don't think we got them until our meals came... we could have asked the waiter again but he was no where to be found. 

For dinner, we had a burger, veggie burger, and pulled pork poutine. Everything was just okay, nothing to write home about. I think it would have been better if we had a better experience with the staff before the meals came. Long story short, this is probably a place for locals who've learned to love it, not tourists."}
{"text":"Je suis pas difficile dans la vie. C'est assez simple. Poutine, burger, café. C'est pas mal mon bonheur. Bonus: c'est à côté d'où je travail. Alors quand J'oublie mon lunch c'est quand même Nice. Reste à voir si c'est rapide (j'écris en attendant ma bouffe)"}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant- stopped for lunch and was delighted with the service and the wonderful homemade meal. I had one of the vegetarian poutine's which was delicious. I was surprised and delighted to see that it was accompanied by a lovely fresh salad. Would definitely recommend stopping here for a meal!"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, great central location, tasty poutine and burgers (but not superb), decently priced (but not dirt cheap). friendly staff. I will be back."}
{"text":"They tried yet failed spectacularly. I was walking in the neighborhood and was really in the mood for some poutine so I went to this place. The poutine gravy was homemade by someone who doesn't know how to cook. The gravy was watery and lack any taste. The sweet potato fries were overlooked and burned. The cracker with the soup was not crispy at all. The cleanliness of the place was barely above acceptable. The price was high for absolutely nothing. After this meal I had nothing more than regret, disappointment and anger. Seriously if you just want some poutine, go down a few blocks, there are better options."}
{"text":"Poutines place that's  great for a small meet and greet with friends and family. Next to a park if you want to take stroll.

It's different than the late night drunk food vibe for smokes or banquise. 

Their vegetarian poutines are quite tasty, and their fries are crispy when served fresh. Would recommend to come in person."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine just small portions. The decor was different with comic books on the tables and games to play while you eat. 

Great experience."}
{"text":"Choix de poutine varié.
Nous avons essayé la poutine Montréal: 3/5
Excellente frite style julienne
Service rapide et efficace. 
Bref, endroit qui dépanne lorsque vous avez envi d'une poutine....autre que chez LaFleur ;)"}
{"text":"Le Pire Poutine et fast-food que j'ai goûté. La service était un whatever. Les serveuses m'ont ignoré et se sont parlé durant une dizaine de minutes lorsque je suis allé demander pour la salle de bain. Il y a en fait un menu de combo sur le tableau, mais à cause que j'étais dans un coin, j'en ai pas vu. La serveuse aurait dû m'expliquer en avance. 
Par la suite, la Poutine était degueulasse à cause de frites froides et de sauce beaucoup trop salée et huileux. Les frites sont trempés dans l'huile est je suis même pas capable de distinguer ce que j'ai mangé. Une  expérience incroyable."}
{"text":"We chanced about Hippi Poutine as we lived essentially around the corner from it. It is a good poutine stop but to be honest, we've had better. The vegetarian burger on the other hand was quite good. I would say if you're looking for Poutine in the area - I'm sure there are others that are better but this isn't bad!"}
{"text":"Very lackluster. If you want a different take on poutine, I guess you should go here (I think this joint is owned by French people). I had their basic poutine (just fries, gravy and cheese). First off, their gravy is housemade and their fries are cut julienne style inhouse. That sounded appetizing at first but after tasting it, it is quite disappointing. The gravy is not hot enough so the cheese does not melt. There is only a few pieces so the cheese to fries ratio is all wrong. And finally, the gravy tastes very weird. Not at all the kind of gravy you have with poutine.. maybe turkey or something. 
Also it is overpriced. I took their \"tapas poutine\" because it was the only decently priced thing for one person (5$ for a snack sized portion). 

The ambiance of the place looked cool but the service needs improvement. I thought this place would be more welcoming given its name and theme. Will not be returning which is unfortunate given their location."}
{"text":"Tres lent; le serveur a refuse de nous donner de l'eau \"because there were a lot of people there\" dans le restaurant; et nous avons attendu tres longtemps pour nos dejeuners.  Qualite moyenne."}
{"text":"Paid $22 for two small poutines. Fries are bad. Generally tastes cheap. So not worth the price."}
{"text":"As poutine gets, the joint is excellent. Many choices, swift service, an IPA on tap, even truly English-speaking waters."}
{"text":"As a visiting American, I wanted to try the quintessential poutine, which I believed to be duck confit, cheese curd, gravy on fries.  I was disappointed.  I ordered the duck and mushroom poutine.  The cheese curd appeared to be of good quality, but the duck was not confit, it actually tasted exactly like Turkey thigh meat, so I do doubt that it was actually duck at all.  I wouldn't go back, although the waitress was very nice and friend, and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere.

I am officially not a fan of poutine.  I will stick with the New York late night classic, Disco Fries:  cheese fries with a side of gravy."}
{"text":"This its probably the worst experience I've had in a resto in ages. Slow and indifferent service, 15 minutes before water, the server mixed up our order then blamed us - the poutine was mushy - it seemed like it had been sitting a while. I'm reserved with my grades but this place was literally the worst."}
{"text":"Délicieux burgers, ambiance originale et sympa, je recommande , et compte bien y retourner!"}
{"text":"Having to wait through painfully slow poor service is not worth the poutine here. I suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"//Vibe\\
We came on a weekday, early evening before the dinner crowd. Maybe two tables at the time. It's a narrow bistro with dim and intimate decor. Not pretentious, very comfortable vibe.The tables and booths run along the narrow corridor with games and books on the side. The outside terrace is also narrow in a similar vein.

Extra drinks menu along the top edge of walls on the inside in French. Laminated paper menus both in French and English, with a good amount of choices (as in plenty but not overwhelming). But mostly limited to burgers and poutine, as the name of the restaurant implies.

//Food\\
We chose this place to try poutine for the first time, so I can't comment on how it compares to standard poutine fare. We ordered take-out and our orders didn't come with salad, so I don't know if they forgot, or if they no longer do that. Overall, the flavors on the poutines that we ordered were not overwhelming, which was good for us. It wasn't bland, just not too salty or overpowering. The Pékin poutin's sweet and sour sauce was more akin to watery ketchup than an actual sweet and sour, which should be glaze-like. They use thinner cut fries, which makes them nice and crispy when ordering them outside of poutine.

We also had a Buenos Aires burger, which wasn't bad. It came on what looked like a ciabatta roll with plenty of fries on the side. My kid was a fan of the browned cheese, which is cheese that's sat on the griddle until it forms a crispy crust.

//Service\\
When we walked in, the server was busy at the register, so the chef actually took our order. Very friendly and helpful attitudes from the staff. The server made sure everything was correct before packing up our order to go."}
{"text":"It's not the best poutine I've had, but the location and atmosphere is nice.
The salad that comes with your poutine is a good idea and the terrace is small but cute, you have a view on rue St. Denis and Square St. Louis which is a plus.
The taste of the actual dish is not what a true poutine fan would expect, it's a bit bland actually. Apart from the taste, it's a cute little place to visit if you feel like going \"healthy\" poutine."}
{"text":"I only gave it 4 and not 5 stars since there are no kid meals But:
Such a cool place you can get some amazing burgers and Poutine ( for meat lovers, vegetarians and some vegan options..Yay). While you wait you can enjoy a lot of fun old-school games or children books so you are not only paying for the food. The prices are 9-14$ for a meal (with salad and fries). This is one of those places that you will leave with your belly full and a smile on your face"}
{"text":"The french fries were cooked perfectly the pulled pork melted in your mouth the cheese curd was fresh the small size was perfect The Fill Me Up and the blood waitress was very hot"}
{"text":"Hippi poutine was cute burger place where you can play fuse ball and clue while you can have lunch. Their lemonade was wonderful."}
