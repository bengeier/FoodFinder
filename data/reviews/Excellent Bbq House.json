{"text":"Excellent BBQ is a tad out of my way for Chinese BBQ.  It's a bit pricey and just not drive 20 minutes out of my way worthy.  Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with Excellent BBQ.  Indeed it is fairly Excellent, and if you're near by, it's probably an okay regular place.  My defining meat for all Chinese BBQ places is the roasted pork.  Do they find quality pigs and is the skin done just right?  That means not burnt, and not underdone or have been sitting there so long that it's rubbery.  It's got to be the consistency of potato chips.  Excellent BBQ, passed the piggy test, but just wasn't as flavourful with the other marinades with their soya chicken and roasted duck.  If I'm in the neighbourhood looking for a quick meal and feel like an assorted rice plate (a combo of any three meats), I'll pop by.  Other wise Genghis Khan... Party On!!"}
{"text":"Have bought roast pork and bbq duck from this stall in various occasions.  WHile more expensive than other food court bbq places, food is very good.  Best of all, owner and cashier are always so friendly.  Always service with a smile.  They definitely deserve more business."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ House is now only known as \"BBQ\". Are they not excellent anymore? From my experience today, I've definitely had better BBQ food in other places.  I ordered the #16 meal, which was chinese sausage with soy cuttlefish with rice. However I replaced rice with thick vermicelli noodle soup, since I'm not a fan of white rice. It was quickly made, despite the fact the broth was overflowing and I spilled a good amount in the tray.  The overall food was okay; nothing exciting to take away from. However for $7.99 + tax, it was a little bit on the expensive side, as you can easily fill your stomach for $5-6 with the options available in the food court.  If you strictly want BBQ food (or you wanna order some BBQ to take out) and you're in the area, then this place is pretty much the only place you can get BBQ unless you go to T&T. In terms of the eat-in options, I honestly was not too fond of them, and would pass for the other fast food stalls available."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is indeed excellent, I usually get the BBQ pork and roast duck with rice, always superb quality and flavour. It is a bit more expensive than most Cantonese BBQ plates but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Man I have a disease that just doesn't go away called \"Chinese BBQitis\"!  Every once awhile I get these hunger pangs and I feel the urge to satisfy that hunger with Chinese BBQ!  Today was in Metro Square food court for lunch and decided to try this place out.  I'm not sure if this place is the same as Excellent BBQ in Richmond Hill but the Chinese name is the same.  Ordered BBQ pork with soya sauce chicken on rice and comes with some veggies and house soup.  The chicken was really good and flavourful but the BBQ was a little dry and in really small pieces so not as enjoyable as I would like.  Service was good though and they seemed to have a steady stream of people lining up so always a good sign.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but its a good option if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Located in Metro Square, just west of Warden on the north side of Steeles.... Kiosk with many different selections and varieties of BBQ duck, roasted and BBQ pork, soups and veggies.... Been frequenting for nearly 10 years and am always impressed by the prompt and friendly service as well as the incredible flavours... Last visit was Mar 7/15... BBQ pork with rice and greens with a soya drink and a small bowl of broth... Excellent flavour and sated my voracious appetite for less than $10...."}
{"text":"You can find this little place nuzzled in the middle of the food court, hard not to spot with the BBQ hanging under the heat lamps.  As per usual the regular duck and roasted pork pretty standard finished work linner, that means lunch and dinner for the ones who needed help with that definition.  Duck was superb, it's as if they just sent the dog in the Nintendo game duck hunt to just retrieve it and bring it over to the kitchen... the pork was crispy and roasted to perfection juicy I'd say.  Would I come here again yes, would I recommend it to everyone yes, would I treat the broke guy who tagged along, probably, he is now woke to the excellent BBQ lifestyle."}
