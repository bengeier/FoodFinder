{"text":"The only reason The Real Jerk received two stars is because the soup  is tasty. If it wasn't I would give them 1 star for the UNACCEPTABLE service. I no longer live in Toronto and after a long day working on a film down the street I craved  Jamaican soup. I am Jamaican and can cook my own soup but after a 14 hour day I remembered The Real Jerk was now up the street. I just wanted take out! I was directed to the bar by the hostess and saw that someone else was waiting. We were not acknowledged or spoken to except the \" woman \" behind the bar yelling to the hostess to come take our order because her PAD was not working. This was after some time of just standing wondering if their was a policy I was not  aware of. A simple greeting, a hello please give me a moment something is wrong with my  pad and I cannot take your order. Nothing, we waited and waited. Then the young hostess  came over and I said the other customer was there first. She apologized for keeping us  waiting. STILL NOTHING FROM THE DISGRUNTLED BARTENDER, the \" woman \"  I said, I don't have a problem with having to wait but I do have a problem with attitude. Absolutely hate when my community, my fellow countrymen are tarnished with the  same brush as those who have bad manners. There is no reason to be rude in the  service industry, absolutely no excuse. We are the customer and a simple Hello would have gone a long way. Oh did I mention a kiss teeth! when I stated the entire  restaurant did not to be a part of the drama over a key PAD. My LAST Visit. #Unacceptable #badservice #giveJamaicansbadname"}
{"text":"Headed out to the Jerk last night for a bite with a girlfriend before a concert. My past experiences here have been incredibly slow service and so-so food. Maybe because of the recent eviction scare or maybe because they just found their groove again, last night was great! Service is still very much on Caribbean time so when they are busy, you might wait to place your order but once it's in, you are set! Drinks came fast once ordered, so did the food and...it was hot + DELICIOUS! The beef patty was perfect flaky crust with just the right seasoning for the meat, the banana fritters were sweet and not too oily, my lentil roti rocked! Even the rice was cooked well. Bravo to the Real Jerk for pulling it together and making me a big fan!"}
{"text":"I went there and the food is freshly cooked and very delicious! It's almost like eating my meals at home! You definitely get your monies worth!"}
{"text":"We had some friends joining us for dinner and we weren't in the mood to cook. So, we called to get take out for a group of 7 adults.  We ordered 2 whole jerk chickens, 4 orders of rice and peas, 3 chicken rotis, oxtail and chicken gravies and some coconut shrimp.  Our after tax price came to just under $100. I called ahead and asked for my food to be ready at 7:30 and it was coming out of the kitchen as I walked in the door. My car smelled so good... We ate 45 minutes later and the fod was still fresh and delicious.  The jerk chicken was moist and yummy. I would highly recommend them again for eat in or take out!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty and the prices were on par with other places. There is nothing overly special about the food but it is delicious. It has a great atmosphere and nice staff. The woman at the desk as you walk in could try harder to look like she wants to be there, but that's okay.  It is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Decided to give Caribbean Cuisine a try for the very first time which turned out to be an outstanding food experience for the soul! Their Oxtail was yummy and the Jerk Chicken was tasty with good flavoring (just spicy enough without being overpowering) but the meat was a little on the dry side. That aside, they have a nice atmosphere with good music playing (very fun - felt like I was in Jamaica myself). It was definetly an enjoyable meal, with great service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food. The service is a bit slow. Also, the hostesses are very rude. All my friends that live in the Riverdale area think the same. I am writing this in hopes that maybe they will change the staff to more personable employees."}
{"text":"I like the Real Jerk. There's nothing fancy about their meals - Just good portions and tasty options. We always order the banana fritters (they taste better than they look), Jerk Chicken with Shrimp (or Oxtail) combo plates and goat or chicken Rotis. I enjoy taking my out-of-town friends here, especially ones from my homeland of Down Under as we don't have carribbean food there!"}
{"text":"I really love the interior. Felt like sitting in a backyard somewhere in Jamaica. The food was nice, nothing fancy, and the service was ok. I liked the menu - easy to pick something (not more then 30 items on the menu).  I had the jerk chicken & oxtail combo. Good stuff!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place for several years. Before they moved to the new location, I heard microwaves buzzing in the kitchen...not cool. Now that they are at the new location things have truly fallen apart.   Firstly, they've lost the chic island feel. Now its a mismatch of colours on worn out furniture and cheap building materials (look at the bar)  My last and final experience there, my fish was partly frozen, the roti tasted rotten. As though the filling had been sitting out on the counter for days. The rum punch was truly the most vile concoction either one of us had tasted. You know it's bad when you can't finish a glass of alcohol.   Oh and can we talk about over priced!! No Sir this place has lost its cool. I've spoken to a few people who have decided to walk away as well for similar or worse experiences. Caribbean food is supposed to be cooked with heart and soul. Seems like the chef is in a coma (figuratively speaking).   Good bye Real Jerk. Let me know when restaurant makeover visits...or when your establishment has a pulse again."}
{"text":"This place is a family favourite of ours.  I have two kids of different ages and finding a common place that we can all agree on to dine at is difficult.  Although it is a hit/miss on service the food is always consistent and it makes up for it.  the portions are generous for the price.  The dumplings and meat pies are to die for.  We will definitely be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at The Real Jerk. My friends and I come out for Irie-Okee once in a while (which is always so much fun, great MC) and I often grab takeout. I have never been disappointed with the food, and I have had a lot of different items from their menu. I am currently addicted to the red pea soup (which is actually with red kidney beans and is vegetarian), which i pair with a fried dumpling.   Some nights they seem to struggle to keep up with the volume, as take-out gets busy. Calling ahead does help. Occasionally I have waited quite long but most times i get my takeout in 10-15min.   I do hope they work out some of the customer service issues they seem to be having, but you cant go wrong with their food!"}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken.  Rice and peas were good and the gravy on top was even better."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, and it lived up to its' expectations.  Last weekend I ordered ahead 2 mains and they were right on time.    Based on other Yelp reviews - thanks friends! - I ordered the 1/2 Jerk Chicken dinner. It was just spicy enough, and the rice and beans (which sounds pretty boring) were actually very tasty.  There was so much food it was my dinner the next day.  Total was $16.50, which isn't bad for 2 meals. My bf had the ribs and he loved it!  I'll come back to try some more dishes and test my spice tolerance."}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place.  We went on an \"Irie-Okee Thursday\" which basically means Karaoke, but not just any Karaoke. Karaoke where people who are singing are actually really really good. Normally at karaoke events I tend to sit back and cringe - this place makes you want to get up and sing and really join in.   Also. I'd never had Jamaican cuisine before. I'm from Australia and Jamaican restaurants are few and far between over there. I had the Jerk Chicken and am now thoroughly addicted. Since eating here I've been to various other Jamaican places around Toronto, but have yet to find one that's not only got such an awesome atmosphere, but also amazing food and ultra friendly service.   Thanks The Real Jerk!"}
{"text":"was a great spot when it was near Filly's. Still a great spot on the east side. Still waiting for them to let me hav the turbo hot sauce. the meat is always juicy and flavourful, and the homegirl shawankey is on point. i'll be back."}
{"text":"The Real Jerk is one of the top roti places in the city.  Being veggie, I highly recommend their lentil roti dinner.  It'll fill you up and leave you enough for a second meal or lunch treat.  The place isn't necessarily the fanciest or prettiest, but the staff is friendly and service is decent.  For meat eaters, the jerk chicken dinner comes highly recommended along with the combos that include jerk chicken along with jerk pork or ox tail.  Everything on the menu is tasty.  They also do take-out which has been a life saver many nights on the way home from work. If I order as I get on the streetcar at Queen and Yonge I arrive just as my food comes out of the kitchen. Golden!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken Roti Oxtail meal was very savoury and tender Jerk wings were a very nice treat  Server could not have been any friendlier!  Given the dearth of Jamaican options on the East End, the Real Jerk is an excellent option"}
{"text":"Went to the Real Jerk last night with my family; after being sat we waited 20 mins before anyone came to back to our table. There was no hello or any type of greeting, the sever dropped the water down and walked away. We could clearly see they were under staffed and overwhelmed , so we got up and left!  On our way out the hostess and the one server gave us attitude, and actually hit me with her tray. There were no apologies or inquires as to why we were leaving without having bought anything. We would have stayed, had the girls communicated with us and offered a little bit of kindness; it does go a long way, and would have most definitely helped in their situation.  This is not the first time I have come to The Real Jerk and the staff has been:  ((REAL JERKS !!))   Even when they had their location on Broadview there was always an attitude that came along side your meal.  I love the food, thats why I go back, but last night I was embarssed that I took my family there and embarrassed for the owner, that the employees working in that establishment fall under \"Rude Jamaican Gal\" stereotype behaviour.     The FOH seriously needs some training in customer service.  We come out to a restaurant not only for the food, but for the service, and the experience!  I really hope someone in management reads this pulls them together, and teaches them how to work with, and communicate with their guests efficiently, and politely, when under pressure."}
{"text":"Tried to have lunch here for the first time today.  I ordered jerk pork w/rice & peas, and waited. After half an hour, one of the servers brought a patty to my table on a little plate and said that there'd been a mix-up with my order.  Both servers apologized, and I ended up taking my food to go.  It was too much aggravation for me to go back, but aside from the rice being a little dry the food did end up being decent."}
{"text":"I used to be a frequent customer back in the queen and Broadview days.  We went there on Saturday,  there was only a few of us in the restaurant. Ordered 2 chicken roti and 1 jerk chicken at 415pm we didn't get out until 630 pm.  Chicken was dry and over cooked. Roti was good.  They really need to step their game up.  Customer service was absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"After hearing many good things about this place, I decided to try it out and I'm super glad I did because it is my new favourite TO GO place for Jamaican food. This review is a combination of my first visit +  many subsequent visits.   FOOD REVIEW:   *Curry chicken roti - Bigger portion than I expected, very flavourful in a very fresh roti shell  *Oxtail dinner - This is my FAVOURITE item on their menu. It takes longer than a regular entree to make but definitely worth waiting for. The oxtail is nice and tender without being mushy, and the sauce is really really well done.    *Jerk chicken - Spicier than expected but delicious nonetheless. When I can't decide if I want the oxtail or jerk chicken, I do the oxtail/jerk chicken combination dinner.   SERVICE REVIEW  You can get a seat pretty quickly as long as there is a hostess at the front. However, service is a bit slow overall but I didn't mind too much. It took about 10 minutes to get a glass of water but it's a good pace to eat at if you have some time and don't mind chatting with your friends until your server comes by."}
{"text":"Best priced Caribbean food in toronto. Check this place out before its gone!  The service was kinda slow but the food taste, quantity, and prices make up for everything."}
{"text":"Seems like ever since drake made a video here service seems to be getting slower and slower. If you are planning on eating here cancel any plans you may have after because you will be waiting an hour to a hour and a half at MINIMUM for your food. It's understandable there will be a wait for food as it gets busier but how long I waited last time I visited on a week day is ridiculous. I visit this establishment regularly and great service falls each time. Quick bite to eat on a Saturday, forget about it!"}
{"text":"I had the Jerk Chicken and Ox Tail dinner. The chicken was delicious but that Ox Tail was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Food is great, can't go wrong with the chicken roti! Don't come if you're in a rush... But worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing pork and pretty good jerk but let's be honest, we come for the drinks! Fresh fruit juices with an insane variety of rum. All love."}
{"text":"We ventured to the new location on a Thursday night.  I was looking forward to the chicken roti as I cannot resist a freshly made good roti.  My husband and his friend ordered the jerk pork dinner platters that came with rice & beans, coleslaw and fried plantains.   The chicken roti was very delicious with fresh tasting wrap.  My only comment would be that it was not as spicy as i normally like it to be. I drenched it with the hot sauce at the table but still wished it was hotter.  The jerk pork was also very delicious along with all the sides but this could also have been more spicy.  As the evening progressed, we found out that it was karaoke night.  There were a bunch of regulars that sing every thursday apparently. It was very lively and entertaining.   They have a large bar and the drinks were very reasonable.  Later at night they had a drink menu with drinks priced from $6-$7..all very reasonable.  We saw the other tables order Jerk wings that looked delish. I was tempted to reach over and grab a drumstick.  Overall the atmosphere was good - laid back, casual, and relaxing (the hockey game was playing on a tv in the back), the service was good - although they could have been more attentive to take drink orders, the food was authentically de-li-cious, and the bill was reasonable - $75 for 3 meals and 6 drinks.  I've had cheaper take out roti but given that there are not too many places like this one in our area, this place is pretty decent if you have a sudden urge for carribean food!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend had originally recommended this place to me, but it was the reviews of my fellow yelpers that gave me the courage to go and try. I say courage because it's not exactly in the nicest part of town, with a strip joint kiddie-korner to the restaurant. It was ok during the day, however, I would not feel so ok about going once the sun had set; no offense, but that's just the feel of the neighborhood I got.  Once inside the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and offered our choice from a selection of dirty and unsightly tables, which was promptly cleaned upon request. The restaurant definitely has a Carribean island feel, with the bright colors and the catchy music that just sends your inhibitions packing!! It was not long before my shoulders were shaking, my head was rocking, and my hips were doing the \"chair-dancing\" thing!! (while I sipped on my iced water...*winks*)  We place our orders for the quarter chicken ($9.75), white meat please, you have to pay an extra $0.50 cents for white meat ($10.25 total). It comes with 2 sides and the server asks, \"Peas & rice, and coleslaw?\" I looked at her bewildered, \"How did you know?\" she told me that was the \"usual.\" In addition, I decided to add to my order, a dumpling, having no idea what one was, solely based upon the recommendation of Todd V. He said I would be missing out if I didn't get it, and I didn't want to miss out!!  Service was fast and efficient. My friend's chicken came out burnt, which she brought to the server's attention, and it was promptly replaced.  Ok, the dumpling. It made my taste buds dance and dazzle like I've never imagined!! I definitely would've missed out! I devoured the bloody thing!  The meal was rustic perfection! The chicken was cooked to spicy jerk perfection, the coleslaw was yummy goodness, the rice and peas, topped with a nice gravy confused me. I, idiotically, kept searching for PEAS!! I even told my friend, there's no peas in mine, only beans!! (doh!)   The meal was awesome, and I had enough left over to wrap up for lunch the next day. Overall I recommend The Real Jerk! The chicken is great, oh, yeah, and don't forget a dumpling!"}
{"text":"Forget the decor, forget the customer service, let's get down to the why everyone is here. The Jerk!  With a name like this I was really excited to give this place a go. I've been eating Jerk since I can remember.  \"1991 - Mr Jerk @ Steeles & McCowan, MorningSide & Sheppard\"  We tried most of the appetizers, the best were peppered shrimp & the beef patties. Although the dumplings were nothing special, tearing a piece off and adding some patty or shrimp to it was excellent. Gave it that carribean dining experience.  The Red Pea soup was good, harty but I think they must have ran out of meat.  For the main courses, we straight to the Jerk and forgot about everything else. The Ox-Tail was excellent, stewed perfectly without all the meat fallen off the bone. The Ox-tail gravy was rich & flavorful and went good with the rice. The Jerk Pork was decent, they chopped them up in pieces for the combo dinner plate. It tasted more of over baked Jerk instead of BBQ or open flame. It was lacking the Jerk flavour (Beryl's still #1 for Jerk pork). The Fried chicken was definitely under par lacking flavour, dry & tasted like it was re-fried.  Food :decent Atmosphere: decent Customer Service: excellent  I would go back if I was in the area. But would think twice knowing the Burger Priest is down the street.  Till next time...  Herman"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a number of times in the past few months and never stopped in until last week.  I'm glad I did.   It's a small and friendly place.  I sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender (Genevieve?) and one or two regulars.  They have a huge rum selection (and apparently offer free rum tasting nights) and a few beers on tap. A very enjoyable wait while I perused the menu and had a pint.    I ended up ordering take out, going with the staff recommendation on the just finished cooking jerk pork.  I also had the chicken roti with curried potato and rice and peas.    The jerk pork was nicely seasoned, spiced enough to liven up your mouth without burning through your taste buds.  I had a little trickle of spice sweat on my brow which is just how I like it.   The chicken roti was good as well.  Hefty.  With the sides it was a lot of food so I managed to get a lunch out of it as well.   All in all, a great takeout or sit down option on Kingston Road."}
{"text":"Forget all the overpriced and overrated new wave of restaurants in this area. Real Jerk is still the best meal hands down. Friendly and fast service, great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This was my third time at the new location. Food was excellent until tonight. Don't know what the chef is doing. My takeout curry goat was full on bones. Three good pieces of meat. The rice n peas taste like they were yesterday's. Beef patties are dried out.  Asked for curry goat/jerk chicken white meat combo. Recieved dark meat. Called the restaurant. The lady that served me apologized, made note for the next time I come in. It was not her fault. It was on the ticket that the kitchen recieved. The Real Jerk has excellent customer service. Five stars for customer service. Food 2 stars tonight."}
{"text":"Food - Excellent.   Roti (chicken) was nice and large-portioned. The delicious ribs were plentiful for the indicated \"1/2 lb\" in the menu.  Oxtail was superb. The sauce over rice was great.  The cole slaw is more on the creamy style but fresh and tasty. My personal preference would be lighter.  Almost forgot - we had some pre dinner wings. At first I thought they tasted plain. Seconds into it I liked and loved them. There was a subtle \"hotness\" to them, but not super spicy.  Refreshments - Okay  I was surprised TRJ does not carry Mauby. Not even bottled Mauby Fizzz.  I had the usual Red Stripe beer.  Service - Excellent  Alway a suspense when going to any restaurant. This experience at TRJ on Gerrard was super. The server (didn't get her name) was relatively new (not from the previous location) was charming and attentive.   Parking - Crappy  Very small parking lot but not important to us.   Will be back again.   Sherman and family"}
{"text":"Hahaha, excellent food with funny name. My friend rosy snd I had wondful dinner in  this pkace, we just like it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place once. Overall, the food is great, jerk sauce, coleslaw and servers. However, when I got my jerk chicken the food portions were extremely small, I was disappointed because it's a bit pricey compared to other decent jerk places I've been to where portions are way bigger like sunrise and the jerk place at Gerard square. I really like the taste here but I hesitate to go due to feeling ripped off due to small portions of chicken. C'mon the real jerk please don't be stingy with your meat."}
{"text":"Hate to say it but really didnt live up to the hype. The goat  roti was basically bone shards and potato. The half chicken was good but not really worth $15. With the two above plus a basic garden salad and two patties was $35. Everyone was super friendly which makes saying this hard but it really isnt the best in the GTA"}
{"text":"First of all I just want to say that I've been to the real jerk back from when they were at the old location since the 80's. The staff is relatively nice most of the time, however I came and ordered an ox tail to go and it took way to long, I'm not sure what the problem was, but when the food finally arrived it was just dropped in front of me and the waitress didn't say a word to me. Was it that I did not tip her? Who knows.... But at 14$ + I didn't think it was a bit much. I was very disappointed with the meal, it didn't taste as good as it normally does, I find this a big problem,consistency is key. Also serving was smaller from takeout..."}
{"text":"Went there today with mom and gotta say its still as great as the old place. If not even better, the staff were soo nice and the food was AMAZING! Not to mention the music is always soo smoothing and makes you want to jam! The place looks great on the inside just needs to add a little attention to the outside! I defiantly plan on visiting the new restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe, food is really good. The dumplings and oxtail gravy is to die for. Jerk pork is good - can be dry sometimes, but usually juicy and always tender. I usually get a 1/2 pound and a patty for dinner (no need for the other sides). Get a side of the jerk sauce with whatever you're eating because it has a nice spice and great flavour."}
{"text":"Consistently great jerk chicken.  I eat here at least once every couple months and it never disappoints.  They definitely aren't afraid to use a little spice unlike a lot of other restaurants that tone it down.  Eating on premise is a treat with the music and friendly staff.  UberEats also arrives on time with big warm portions.  Love this place."}
{"text":"The service is very slow....  over 45 munites and the foods are not ready for us. Very bad service. The waitress just said that she will check our order but she never returned to tell us why the foods still not ready."}
{"text":"I got take-out after viewing an apartment in the area, thinking it would be cool to live so close to great food. And it smelled so good on my commute home by mouth kept watering... when I finally got home it was utterly delicious, if spicier than my inexperienced tastebuds were expecting.  I'm giving 5 stars for the great food, but have to mention I found the staff unwelcoming. I was very smiley and friendly, trying to picture myself living in this neighbourhood. But the waitress who directed me to the menu and bar couldn't be bothered to smile back and treated me kind of like a nuisance. I tipped anyways, but she was quite cold and dismissive in spite of there being only one couple in the restaurant to look after. I've always experienced amazing hospitality in any home or restaurant run/owned by folks from the West Indies and my Trinidadian friends are some of the friendliest people I've ever met. I think the only thing I'd ask management to improve upon is to remind servers how a smile and and a welcoming manner cost you very little energy and improve the customer's experience a lot.   As delicious as the food was, the prickly interaction with the waitress (who seemed to get more irritated with me the friendlier I tried to be) cast kind of a cloud over finally getting to taste the delicious smell when I got home. And she wasn't in a bad mood, since she laughed and talked with the other servers. It was just me with my big smile she seemed to have a problem with. If I end up moving to the area, I hope the servers are a bit more welcoming next time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but haven't sampled too much of the menu because I can't stop getting the quarter chicken dinner (jerk chicken, plantain, coleslaw, rice & beans). They make amazing jerk chicken with huge portions - never been disappointed with it. I've been with friends who have ordered the roti, patties, and also the jerk shrimp and have always heard rave reviews.   Ambiance is great - you almost feel like you're sitting in Jamaica. Music is also always great. I've sat in many times and always received excellent service - the only reason I knocked one star off because I've ordered takeout twice and both times it has been extremely slow.   There is a free parking lot right out from but it can get pretty full during busy times. Also - they do have wifi for customers."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and the music was on point. BUT the service was trash, it will take 30 minutes to get a beef patty at your table, you will have to get our own water at the bar if you are thristy, it will take about 2 hours to get your food, however the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Quite expensive for caribbean food. I've also had better. I went on a Sunday afternoon and the service was sooooooo slow. Fortunately our server was really nice."}
{"text":"Relax to some reggae and enjoy the laid-back vibes at this Caribbean resto at Queen and Broadview.  From delicious fried fritters to eight different kinds of roti, jerk chicken to steamed fish dinners, their menu is definitely worth the wait (did I mention how laid-back they are?!).  Engage the bartender and he might give you a vocabulary lesson (where else will you hear the word, \"flibbertigibbet?\")."}
{"text":"Came back here for about the millionth time, this time with some friends who have never been before.  Very pleased to share that they both enjoyed everything that we had ordered very much.  We started off with the usual dumplings with oxtail gravy and some cod fritters.  My friends both had the oxtail dinner, one of whom had the oxtail and fried chicken combo.  Again, they both liked them very much!    I decided to try something new this time around so I ordered the JA Stew Chicken which was absolutely delicious.  Was served with dark meat which was also very tender so no doubt this has been stewing for a very long time.  5/5.  Service as usual was wonderful.  I'd like to add that one of my friends is Jamaican so for her to absolutely love the place is a huge compliment.  She's not one to also eat out often but after she had one bite of everything, she kept saying that she'll keep coming back until she has everything on the menu. Again, huge compliment coming from someone born and raised in JA and who has a mom who can cook up a storm with the JA classics."}
{"text":"Have been getting take out from here for years (even at the old location) and always really enjoyed the jerk pork dinner with their amazing home made hot sauce.   What is causing me to leave a review after all these years is the service I received after having a bad experience.  I had purchased 2 jerk pork dinners for take out with oxtail gravy on the rice and when I got them home I had found that all of the meat was REALLY fatty and inedible.   After brining it back to the restaurant to explain they immediately took responsibility and thanked me for brining it to their attention. Not only did they replace the food but they also made sure that the new order was up to standard.   The food had me coming back for years, the customer service will have me coming back for many more."}
{"text":"Authentic Jamaican food in a colourful and lively atmosphere. Really personable staff makes for a chill experience. The only knock I have against them is discovering that they were out of beef paties after we ordered and paid for them. I still can't figure out how this place, of all places, runs out of paties!"}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken dinners, that's all I know.  Ordered three times here all great. Hearty and flavorful good portions, unpretentious. Not a place I would really hang to dine so takeout is the thing.  I would avoid the other RJ location on Kingston road unless it's much improved, had some horrible bland food there once or twice though just one time it was good."}
{"text":"Had jerk chicken takeout here 2-3 times, once was fantastic & another time was an absolute disaster - bland dry garlicky chicken with no real spice flavor.  Maybe somebody screwed up but it discouraged me from ever wanting to go back. Try the Gerrard St. location which I have found totally consistent."}
{"text":"When I walked in the real jerk I loved the vibe it reflected! The service was friendly and prompt and the place was very colourful! We ordered jerk chicken and ox tail, compared to other jerk restaurants the food they served was just okay, found the chicken dry . It was a big serving for one person; it came with a side of rice and beans and salad, but I still thought it was pricey -$18   Also ordered banana Frits, it was my first time trying them, they were just okay too, wouldn't order them again though.   Would I return? I doubt, I can definitely find better jerk chicken spots   The stars given are purely for the vibe and service and not food"}
{"text":"Expect the food to arrive on island time...I order two pieces of chicken and took almost an hour."}
{"text":"The food is terrible and the restaurant is very dirty..... disgusting Washroom and the sticky tables. avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"I eat curry on average once a week. I frequent many different Roti  shops. Typically I like to order Curry Goat on Rice and peas. The flavour here is very average but OK. However the portion of goat you receive it seems when you take a order to go seems to contain an abnormal high amount of bone and very little meat. I noticed this the very first time I got an order of Curry Goat on Rice and Peas from them. It is happened at least three times since then as I do not have control over where my lunch comes from when I'm at work. At work our employer buys our lunch and tells us where they're going. When I am going out myself the real jerk would be the last choice for good Value for your money. I'm downloading a picture of the quantity of bone you can expect in a small order of Curried Goat on Rice and peas to go."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We got our drinks and food in no time. The jerk chicken, plantains, ribs, and chicken curry was amazing! The patties were good (chicken & beef) but I wish they had a spicy option (I'm used to a little heat). At the end, the wait for the check was a little long but overall this was delicious and a great experience."}
{"text":"Whenever I see the great country of Canada on a map, I shed two tears...  One tear for my ex-boyfriend who lives in Toronto without me, and one tear for the Real Jerk which I will probably never go to again.  This was my first experience with Caribbean food, and that was all it took for me to be HOOKED was a chickpea roti.  HOOKED!!!  Honestly, it became like crack for me.  The interior of the Real Jerk is really fun!  It's colorful and lively, the staff is incredibly friendly, the prices are GREAT, and the food is just straight up ridiculous.  Some of my fondest memories are of drinking a Red Stripe here while chowing down on a Roti with MF.  If you Canadians are on the fence about coming here, stop wondering and GO.  Pour a bottle of Red Stripe for me, the fallen one who will never get to go back again!!!  *sob*"}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is amazing amazing amazing, and has incredible flavor.  Veggie options are pretty good, but lack in flavor; we had to douce the roti with hot sauce.  Did I forgot to say that the jerk chicken is amazing?  I wish I could have some right now."}
{"text":"I went to The Real Jerk Flor de cana rum tasting on Tuesday, I love their new rum bar, I am now a big fan of the Flor de Can 12 year old rum. The ambiance is also great and atmosphere was great for a relaxing Tuesday evening . Hoping they will offer some late night dance space on the weekends. We had Jerk Chicken, Shrimp Rundown and Oxtail. It was delightful. Service is much improved plus the manager made the rounds to check to see if you were enjoying the evening"}
{"text":"So I'll admit it. I came here because it was the restaurant in Rihanna's video. I mean I just couldn't be soooo close and not give them a try.   If I were just rating on the food they would deserve all 5 stars. I mean hands down this food is absolutely amazing. I ordered a beef patty, and the curry and jerk chicken plate with rice and beans and salad.  But here's where they lost the stars...they are slooooooooow and service could use some work. My goodness.   First we ordered drinks, then played the waiting game for the drinks and then straws...finally I gave up and went to the bar for straws and the crappy attitude that the lady gave me was ridiculous. If service ain't your thing...that's fine. Just don't...you know....work in service.   But let's get back to the meal, next we ordered apps a few beef patties and plantains. And then we waited and waited again. When they finally arrived I devoured it before I could take a pic. I was starving.   Then we finally ordered food everyone for something different and we mixed up the sides so we could try everything.   Cue the waiting music.......  ONE HOUR later our food arrived. This was after our server stopped by the table many times to say our order was \"the next out the kitchen\". Ugh.  When it arrived we had the wrong sides. I ordered salad and ended up with cole slaw but I was too hungry to send it back. I don't recommend the slaw but all the rest of the sides I sampled were pretty tasty.   So if you're going to give this place expect delicious food...a long wait and good luck with the service."}
{"text":"A great place to check out if you're wanting Jamaican food - Servers were nice. Getting the food took awhile so if you're in a rush, consider other options. Wish they had more vegan options on the menu."}
{"text":"Missed dearly and glad it has re-opened, I've never been more excited about a re-opening.  Long established as Toronto's best. A lease problem caused them to close at the former location, that seems to have been a blessing with this fabulous new location. The best Jerk Chicken and other spicy treats. It is better then ever if that is possible. I Had the jerk chicken of course and it was moist and amazing.  I do have to say, it seems a bit over priced for what it is, but it is the best.  The food is good value but the BPA (poison) plastic takeout dishes scares the hell out of me. , they use plastic and everyone should know that hot food and plastic isn't good. BPA (poison)  from the plastic releases into the food. BPA (poison)  may be the number one cause of breast cancer and many other hormone disorders.  I think it is important to start talking about BPA (poison) in our reviews. Wake up people; refuse plastic containers for your hot food. Hot or cold; plastic and food don't mix."}
{"text":"This place is everything the original Real Jerk isn't. Very small and intimate and a great place to stop for a quick fix with out all he formality of the original on Gerrard.  Food is as good, the service top notch and equally friendly, and with great hours.  I've only been to this location on Kingston Road once but I am a fan of the Real Jerk for the past 25 years. Tonight I had the usual, my favorite the jerk chicken. My friend Stanley had the chicken soup. Both were amazing. If you've passed this location but never gone in, stop and try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner from the Real Jerk, so we go here all the time. We love this place.  Food is excellent, large portioned and fast. Service is friendly and laid back. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. If you like rum, this is the place with a HUGE rum list. Try the Jamaican Mule (Dark & Stormy)... my favourite. The roti is great and the jerk chicken has just the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place out as Drake and Rihanna gave it some recent buzz in the news.  Fitting how we went there for Valentine's Day to find this place has lost its heart and soul.  The wait was beyond slow and our meals were all brought out at different times. I understand that Toronto was under an extreme cold alert but didn't think that my dinner was too.  Not sure what the big blob was on the rice... was told it was gravy but it looked like mud.  The place is in utter darkness to mask how rundown the restaurant really is.   Their location before was run much better.  As for this location.... it should be called the The Real Dive."}
{"text":"So glad my friends and I squeezed this into our Toronto schedule. The food was delicious. We had jerk chicken, cod fritters, plantains, stew chicken, dumplings with gravy, jerk chicken salad. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food here is pricey but mostly good. What I would recommend is for management to re-orient their workers about how to offer good customer service. A bad or smirky Attitude doesn't help with customer retention. Other than that, it's a nice little cozy place to sit and enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"I went here twice a  bunch of years back - before they moved.  Food was bland. Presentation was terrible.    Service was friendly.  A few years ago - I went on the Real Jerk cruise - still same bad food.  I don't know how they stay in business.  I pass the new location daily - but I am still not tempted to ever go back there again.  There are so many other places to get great West Indian food.  I even gave away the Real Jerk cookbook I had been given as a gift."}
{"text":"Amazing jerk pork - must try! Also curry chicken is super flavourful, even if you get it extra spicy."}
{"text":"The oxtail and rice and peas were delicious. I like it spicy but the handy real jerk pepper sauce did the trick. The cod fish fritters were an ideal comfort snack. My meal was the right proportion. The waiter service was very charming. Very attentive to our needs. If you are a rum drinker, the Real Jerk has big selection of Caribbean rums to choose from"}
{"text":"So salty, so good!  Really enjoyed the jerk chicken dinner that came with a generous pile of rice and peas and coleslaw.  Definitely addictive - definitely not something to have regularly.  The wings and ribs were loaded with salt as well, though tasty in tiny quantities.  Very casual and lighthearted atmosphere, with sticky table tops and a general sense of grime.  I would come here again if I'm in the neighbourhood just to get my once-in-a-very-long-while jerk chicken goodness."}
{"text":"SLOW food takeout. Unless you order AT LEAST 1 HOUR in advance, avoid. This only applies to the Gerrard Street location.   If you are in a hurry or hungry to the point where you can't wait, avoid coming here as you'll be in for a long wait.   Keep in mind, this is one review...but apparently there has been a trend on kitchen slowness at this location.   Came here for takeout with a friend as we were planning to take the food home rather than dine in.   It was a fairly busy evening, with quite a few tables of people at the restaurant, so we anticipated a wait.   We ordered at the bar, nothing too out if the ordinary, the jerk chicken and roti, and were told by the bartender that we'd have to wait for 15 to 20 minutes. Fine. Not bad.   30 minutes rolls by and we're getting a little impatient. We follow up with the bartender and server and they said that the 2 guys before us are still waiting for their order and would be served first.   45 minutes rolls by and the guys who ordered before us FINALLY get their order. EXCEPT their order was WRONG and something was missing. I ask the guys who ordered before us, how long they were waiting, and they said OVER AN HOUR.   At this point I was like WTF. I end up going to the bartender, who admitted the kitchen staff have been extremely slow as of late and orders that would take 15 minutes regularly were taking over 40 minutes. Would have been extremely helpful IF he told us that before we ordered!!!  We ended up asking for a refund, which the bartender was more than happy to oblige to, and left.   This experience left an incredibly poor taste impression as I was really looking forward to trying this place.   All in all, if you've got plenty of time to kill and willing to wait over an hour to get your food, come here by all means. Otherwise, try one of the other many Jerk restaurants around Toronto."}
{"text":"the owner of the establishment was so rude to me and such a jerk that we left and I had to give 1 star.  If you want good food and good service go to Simone's on Danforth and pape. The owner doesn't insult you there."}
{"text":"I took my client there for lunch. He got a lunch special. I asked about the pasta dish I knew about from years ago. She said: sure no prob! When I got the bill I almost died. $17.50!!!! Highway robbery."}
{"text":"I used to drive by this place all the time on my way to Gerrard Square but never tried it in all the years. It took a Drake music video to finally get me to give this spot a try and I'm glad I did. The parking lot is small, the day I went there was also a private function so I ended up parking on the street but no big deal. It also opens at 1 PM on weekends, I attribute this to island vibes; but find me a great Caribbean/Jamaican spot that sticks by their timing :D   When you walk in, it's a big spot but slightly cold as they crank the AC. We sat down and had some cheerful conversation with the waiter who was friendly and humorous. For 2 people, we ordered the Chicken Roti & Jerk Chicken/Oxtail combo. They were absolutely perfect, they had the right amount of spice, seasoning, and tenderness to it. I'm upset I hadn't come here sooner. It is a little pricey for the dish as our bill came out to $37 after tax, but you cannot deny the quality. I would recommend this spot to try, but the price range for this won't necessarily make me a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Hands down. Charismatic servers too! I recommend the roti and goat, the coleslaw and the jerk chicken"}
{"text":"Excellent design and excellent food. Came here for dinner and had Oxtails w/ rice and peas and a beef patty. All the food was good and the food came out fast as well. I definitely recommend this place if you are in/visiting the Toronto area."}
{"text":"4 stars for food and a 0 for service.  Looking forward to Jamaican food was ruined by horrible service.  Just pray to Bob Marley that you don't get Odessa as your server. If you do, be ready for her to forget all about you.  As you wait and wait and wait for the delicious oxtail stew, you say to yourself that it will be worth the wait. And when she finally remembers that she has more than 1 table, you will finally get the very delicious food. And hope you bring your own bottled water since she is nowhere to be found.  Customer service?  That's why you should eat and enjoy the food, but make sure to ask to be seated in another section."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time, (especially with all the media hype around its impending closure - www.savetherealjerk.com - sign the petition!), and I finally got my opportunity when a friend of mine organized a get-together at the famed Caribbean-themed hot spot.  When I walked into the restaurant I felt like I was transported to a tiki bar at a Jamaican resort. Friendly waiters, and a smiling bartender made me feel right at home.  I ordered a Jerk Chicken-Curry Goat Combo Plate, with a side of rice and peas, and coleslaw. The Chicken was juicy and tender, and the goat was spicy and succulent. The food was flavourful and tangy - I savoured each piece, gnawing and sucking every piece of meat off of the bone.  Not only was the food great, but the little restaurant had an amazing vibe. It was a Thursday night, and the start of a long weekend, so the owners organized a karaoke night, or what they liked to call \"irie-okie\". The house DJ invited guests to come to the front of the restaurant and belt out their favourite reggae vibes. The owner even grabbed the mic and entertained us with a song and a dance.  The Real Jerk is definitely a hidden gem, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll be around for years to come."}
{"text":"If you have any sort of allergies I would advise avoiding this place. I had been here a couple of years ago without any issues but my recent experience was not so great. I ordered a cocktail, the contents of which were listed on their drinks menu. When I got the cocktail I took a sip and my body instantly told me that something was not ok. I asked the server if the drink had a specific fruit in it, which she checked with the bartender and found out that it had been added in even though it wasn't listed as an ingredient on the drink list. I informed her I was allergic to this fruit and absolutely nothing was done about it. They did not apologize, didn't remake the drink, and they charged me for the drink. I spent the rest of the night with a headache and stomach pains.   TL;DR Ordered item included unlisted ingredients and staff didn't care that I was allergic to it"}
{"text":"The Real Jerk made headlines earlier this year when it fought against an eviction against condo developers.  This was a Twitter-worthy event, with an online petition at SaveTheRealJerk.com.  Located at the corner of Broadview and Queen, The Real Jerk is a cultural icon, a landmark, and a local favourite.  They've been around since 1984.  If you need proof, just look to their wall of fame with accolades from Now magazine, and Eye Weekly.  The restaurant interiors brought back scenes from the movie Cool Runnings were the locals gathered at a restaurant to watch the Jamaican bobsled team race off against all odds.  You definitely get a feel of \"The Island\" here.  Banners of Appleton Rum span across the ceilings with palm trees and a whole lot of colour.  I stopped by to grab some take-out en route home from work.  After perusing their menu online I decided on the Jerk Chicken + Oxtail Combo ($12.50) and the Ackee + Cod ($13.50).  Both come with a side of slaw.  My favourite of the two was definitely the jerk chicken and oxtail as the chicken was flavourful and tender.  The oxtail just melted off the bone with a few gelatinous parts.  This was the first time I had tried Ackee, which is the national fruit of Jamaica.  The fatty acids in Ackee make it a creamy fruit.  At a first glance, an inexperienced eater may mistaken it for scrambled eggs.  While texture-wise it is reminiscent of a smooth, scrambled egg - it has a slightly bitter finish to it.  I took them up on their suggestion of ordering a side of dumplings to go with.  The \"dumplings\" was a knotted \"donut\" which tasted exactly the same as the Chinese \"Ox Tongue Pastry\" () minus the sweet.  Hey - there are a lot of Chinese-Jamaicans after all?!  All their mains are served on a bed of spiced beans and rice and a side of slaw.  Their slaw embodied the a perfect balance of sweet, creamy and salty without being watery.   It was fresh and refreshing!  V E R D I C T  While The Real Jerk is by no means a pop-up restaurant, I'm glad I got to try it in its original location before its closing.  One main is probably enough to feed 2 people, and the food itself is comfort food at its best.  There is (limited) parking towards the rear of the building.    So check it out soon... because it'll be gone before you know it!"}
{"text":"Like most of the new fan, I heard about this place from the news.  Born and grown up in Asian, Jerk Chicken is something way beyond my knowledge of food. I can't tell which kind or taste is the REAL JERK. I had sweet ones, sweet and sour ones or some add A LOT herb in.   If the taste of The Real Jerk is THE REAL JERK, they I am a fan now.  Chicken is very marinated very well, very tasty, a little bit spicy, LOVE IT.  I tried the oxtail too. Fair, but still like the Chicken better.  Me and my friend arrive around 7ish, already see line ups there. We waited a bit to get what we ordered, so that make sure you order appetizer if you are hungry.  By the time we left, around 8ish, line is even longer. Such a popular place, really hope it will reopen soon."}
{"text":"Awesome authenticity for Jerk Chicken Deliciousness...  If you're looking for a chill place to kick back and escape the city-life, you feel for a moment like you've stepped somewhere tropical...  - Great, friendly and helpful staff - Comprehensive menu and selection - Great atmosphere for chill dining - Great prices for sizable meals - YUMMMMMMYYYYYY  Tip:  Obviously, don't go here and expect Mortons.  But come on, these local small business that thrive for authenticity is what we need to support, especially if they have good food and great service!  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I had the chicken roti - I liked it alot :) flavorful. I also couldn't get enough of their fried plantains. They accidentally gave us a second plate and then gave it to us on the house for the error. No complaints!  My friend had the oxtail dinner and he complained it was 80% bones. He said taste was good but disappointing that he paid for bones.  I'm rating this place based on my experience!"}
{"text":"Foods always as good as the service is mediocre...their oxtail is my absolute favourite!..."}
{"text":"I am dropping this to 1 star.  I got a chicken roti there - it was wildly expensive and there was no chicken in it.  The staff are just hanging out with friends at the bar... customer service is low.  We live very close... it is really too bad... will not be going back.  The Real Jerk must be paying exorbitant rent as I found their prices to be very high when compared to value for money in the neighbourhood and for the type of food on offer.   The unique flavours are undeniable and a good experience, but paying high prices while watching staff fawning over inner circle regulars, friends and family- kind of feels like you are subsidizing everybody else..,"}
{"text":"On a steamy hot summer day my friends took me to The Real Jerk to introduce me to Carribean food. Jerk, roti and patties were all consumed zealously.  But the thing I remember most fondly? The \"pine boo\" -  a drink consisting of pineapple juice and Malibu rum that I could not stop ordering everywhere we went thereafter."}
{"text":"I never had the chance to visit the original location before they closed down. When it was announced that they were re-opening in a new location, I had to check it out and see if it was worth the hype. A few visits later, it's safe to say that I'll be a regular!  I always start off with the dumplings and gravy. They're priced at $4 for two dumplings and gravy and is great for sharing. I remember my first visit, thinking they'd be similar to the Asian variety of a steamed dumpling filled with some sort of minced meat. We initially ordered 3 per person, but after our server explained what it was (fried dough with oxtail gravy), we were advised that one each would be sufficient.  As for the entrees, I usually go for the oxtail combo with either jerk chicken or jerk pork. The combos come with your choice of sides; rice and peas and (creamy-style) coleslaw are the default options. The chicken and pork have a nice char to it and a light kick. They bottle their own hot sauce, which I tend to add to my meal to give it a bit more of a kick. The oxtail is always the star of the meal. I salivate thinking about the tender goodness!  Each night I've come, there seems to have been a different event (rum tasting, karaoke). And as mentioned above, I've been here a few times now and anticipate that I'll be here every month or two."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and definitely was worth the wait! Had the jerk chicken and ox-tail combo. Ox-tail was incredible, next time I just want the ox-tail! Service was great and friendly. Would go back for sure on next trip back home!"}
{"text":"Love this place - great, relaxed vibe. Consistent food and friendly service. The food is ALWAYS good, no matter what I order off the menu and well worth the money spent. The Ackee and Codfish is a must have, as well as the oxtail gravy & dumplings. LOVE the jerk fish (warning - it is very spicy, but that's how I like it).   I have been here at least 10 times. Never left disappointed."}
{"text":"I've had the experience of this place before AND after Drake and I can honestly say Drake gave this restaurant an ego they have no place in having!Really only come here because tropical joes doesn't have beef roti anymore. But if you like chicken, tropical joes is just down the street at Gerrard square and much tastier! The service at this restaurant has gone down tremendously ever since the Drake and Rihanna music video. They think their shit don't stink now! The workers are extremely rude and need to work on their customer service skills. Also, how about you use the meat of the goat instead of the bone? Just a tip!"}
{"text":"Ate there on June 20, 2010.  This was my first time eating Carribean food. I told the waitress this and she recommended that I try the Chicken Roti.  I thought it was great. It's like a pot pie, pie crust + all sorts of chicken and vegetables.   The places was fairly clean, but they could use some newer chairs and tables, as they looks pretty beat up. The service was excellent and the waitress was pumped to make sure that  my first \"Carribean\" experience was a good one"}
{"text":"As my friend made the order to our super fun regular version \"Fat Albert\" waiter, he was definitely using his Superman Xray Vision to burn down my cup of Tea that I brought from outside.  He didn't say much until the end of our meal but it was pretty obvious as I'm sure I wasn't the one that caught his eye.   :(   The Jamaican theme rundown semi-clean atmosphere isn't the most relaxing place but did fine to give the idea of the food we were about to consume.  Before I begin, the most helpful part of my review would be that you should ASK for Hot Sauce from the kitchen that is superior to the condiment on the table.  Jerk Chicken/Oxtail Combo(w/Rice & Peas, Slaw $13.50) - Everything was definitely A-OK and similar to my past experiences in the GTA although the place I visit most doesn't have as much variety all at the same time as other places might be more of a small family style Hut scale than a full restaurant.  Goat Roti($6.99), I actually enjoy the tenderness of it along with a mild Curry Sauce that works for a non-adventurous spice eater like myself.  Others would definitely have to escalate the spice level up a few notches.  The Potatoes inside were nicely cooked and the Roti Wrap itself is standard from anywhere else.  Nothing out of the ordinary in comparison to many of our local Toronto selection of Jamaican/Caribbean restaurants.  A-OK rating fits best in this scenario."}
{"text":"You can smell the goodness before you even walk into the restaurant....jerk goodness.   The sleeper- fried coconut shrimp The awesomeness- goat roti The treat- jerk chicken with coleslaw The must- Jerk sauce on the side  this review would be longer but I'm cutting myself short due to hunger pangs...need the \"real\" jerk  check out my friend Louie B's review"}
{"text":"A friend took me, he loves the place. I had classic jerk chicken and everything, especially chicken, plantains and coleslaw was delicious!  Nice location, cool server, very relaxed on a Monday night!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I was craving jerk wings and these guys aren't even close. You get a tastier product at wing machine. However the service was good and the rum menu is an interesting twist.  I will not return. Unless of course i got overwhelming evidence of their jerk improving."}
{"text":"Best dumplings/oxtail gravy/jerk pork/chicken I've ever had. Their in house hot sauce is delicious! It's like a sweet and sour sauce but with a hotter pepper, habanero I guess, you can ask them yourself if you want to know. The food says it all!  Decor inside is really comfortable actually. Was at a 4-seater table and those big seats you slump into are great to sit back in after feasting."}
{"text":"The most disgusting Caribbean food I've ever had. I got the curry shrimp with the rice and peas and curry potatoes as my sides. The only good thing was that delivery was quick but other than that I didn't enjoy anything about this meal. The potatoes especially were so tasteless and seemed to have no seasoning whatsoever. The shrimp was also extremely bland but not as bad as the potatoes. One of my parents were born in Trinidad so I know a good curry when I taste one and this definitely wasn't it. I'll NEVER order from this over priced tasteless restaurant again."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday night, it wasn't busy we got a table right away. I ordered the oxtail and jerk chicken combo with rice & peas and coleslaw!!! It was soooo delicious I forgot to take a picture because I couldn't wait to eat !!!!  If you're ever in a Caribbean food mood then please go here, they will not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"This was a great choice for a post rock climbing meal and a solid 3.5 stars.  Also fun fact, Rhianna and Drake filmed the \"Work\" video here over the NBA all-start weekend in Toronto.  The service here was good given that there was a party of 20+ that were being served ahead of us.  The food, along with the decor, isn't fancy to look at but the taste of the food is great.  We started with some beef and chicken patties which were warm with flakey pastry.  We settled on splitting an order of jerk wings, goat roti, and the oxtail stew.  The jerk wings were definitely my favourite dish as they were well-sized and grilled nicely.  The spices and heat of the wings slowly built up and gives you that good ol' runny nose feeling.  The oxtail stew was very savoury and the oxtail just fell off the bone.  This probably would be better with a side of rice to help sop up all the yummy sauce.  Lastly, the goat roti was a larger portion than expected so I am glad that we were going to share it from the outset.  Just a reminder to anyone that it does have bones in it so chew carefully.  The meat was tender and the curry was just the right kick.  All in all, this was a satisfying experience and would come back for those jerk wings."}
{"text":"I have never been compelled to write a food review before, but my experience tonight was so aggravating that I felt I had to. Like many, I was so to see the original location close and quite excited to hear of this locations reopen. I went here with 8 friends for a birthday. The evening started out well with a friendly server, however after the orders were placed is when things started to deteriorate. Half an hour passed without any sign of our food. It soon became 45 mins until I finally asked someone about our food. A server came over to inform is that they were putting the ''finishing touches'' on our food. But it was another 10 minutes before the first plates arrived. Out of 8 people, only 3 meals arrived, almost all which were very cold. After another 10 minutes, 2 more plates arrived, leaving 3 people still without food. Getting a little restless, we confined to remain patient, but it took another 5 minutes for the last plates to arrive. At this time, the people who had received their meals first had already completely finished their food. There were no apologizes given as the staff pretended like everything was okay. When the food is amazing, it can sometimes justify the wait, however most of the food was cold and the jerk chicken which i had been so excited to try was very dry and tasteless. I was more than disappointed at this point. Wanting to just leave, we asked for our bills which had an automatic 18% service charge added to it. As a large group we expected it, but the server failed to mention it to us when we were paying so some people tipped on top. When I remarked to the server that I was a little upset about the experience not because of the service, but the food wait, she turned angry and replied ''what do you expect when you are in a busy restaurant?' I was taken back and did not want to bring up the fact that I currently manage a restaurant that feeds over 250 people at the same time with less than 15 wait for gourmet food. For a place I had such high hopes for, the real jerk ended up being a huge disappoint, as with 8 peoples' evening wrecked, it is safe to say I will never be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Caribbean dining experiences EVER. Went there for lunch and was seated in a great dining room with an authentic Jamaica restaurant feel. The waiter we had was so friendly and professional. I ordered the chicken roti and it was out of this world. It was so tasty and the rice was cooked perfectly. They also give you lots of food and they don't skimp on the meat. You will definitely not leave that place hungry. I was still kinda full come dinner time!"}
{"text":"alright mon pass me da ting ting and make sure tha jerk chicken is spicy, extra hot sauce! Rice and Peas and coleslaw on da side makes everyting aright - $12 Ok, so perhaps my Jamiacan accent isnt that good, but the real jerk is soooo good it makes you actually feel like you are Jamiacan! Fast take out service, friendly staff, great \"island feel\" makes this joint truly - Irie!!"}
{"text":"Lately I've been having a lot of cravings for Caribbean food and this place definitely satisfied them! I got to try some roti, jerk chicken and a plethora of appetizers. Everything here was tasty and cheap. Somebody recommended the dumplings so I tried them and I must say I was very disappointed. I'm not sure if this is common knowledge, but apparently Caribbean dumplings are nothing but fried dough...definitely tasty but not what I was expecting when recommended dumplings!  The staff is super laid back and friendly, maybe even a little too friendly. While here our food was waiting on the counter to be brought out for nearly 10 minutes while the waitress was chatting up some clear regulars. I enjoy chatty staff but not at the cost of cold food. If you're in Leslieville, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"For the most part, this place is good IMO. Sometimes at night the service can be a bit crappy, but I find it's always been good around lunch time. Waiters / waitresses have always been super friendly to us.  We usually have rotis as they're huge and delicious. Their cod fritters and fried bananas are great too. Prices are very reasonable and same goes with the drinks. Especially cod fritter portion is huge for $4.50.   This is by no means fine dining, but instead yummy comfort food in a relaxed environment. Show up looking like anything you feel like and you're fine. Rotis start from $8, salads start from $4. I'm baffled by other reviews that call this place over priced."}
{"text":"We headed over to judge authenticity... authentic enough but still takes American Express are our requirements.  They're really Jamaican we checked.    Our friend a Panamanian Caribbean professional was there to guide us.  Inside it's got the mural painted corrugated tin, Appleton Estate rum advertisement aesthetic.  The one thing this place is missing is some live music; would really fit the atmosphere and make higher energy.  The fried dumpling was had by the table with the consensus that it could be a bit sweeter.  The drinks were slow to come but hey we're on Island time so it doesn't matter.  We were more impressed by the meat entrees, the goat, oxtail and jerk chicken.  The oxtail was the highlight for me, succulent morsels of meat attached to the bone, like a better beef stew meat in a flavorful sauce.    Yeah, we'll be back for some jammin' and whatnot."}
{"text":"The key word is real!!! This authentic Caribbean spot is a must visit, not just because Drake and Rihanna shot the work video at the bar but because the jerk wings were tender and crispy fresh of the grill, the Jamrock Colada made me feel like I was in Ocho Rios and the Roti was Brooklyn good. Make sure when you are in Toronto you come by and ask for Shanique."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here waiting for $17 of takeout order for how long? ... for 40 minutes. Don't bother coming if you don't have a lifetime to wait here. Bartender says it takes 15-20 minutes for the food. Lol. Joker."}
{"text":"This is NOT authentic Caribbean food, I'm not entirely sure what this is to be honest. I'm not even Caribbean and I know this isn't what the food is supposed to look or taste like (my husband is Jamaican, in my defense, I've had my fair share of Caribbean cuisine).   Please, I would hate for someone who's never had Caribbean food to try this and think this is what it's supposed to be.   I ordered the red pea soup, gross, I think they use some kind of coconut milk base, which I don't mind, but there was NO flavor. The dumplings were way too soft. It was just a big no for me. I also got cod fish fritters, which was decent, except for the fact that I got a teaspoon amount of dipping sauce for 6 giant fritters.   My poor husband, he ordered the jerk chicken with rice & peas, coleslaw and oxtail gravy. As soon as he opened the container we both knew this was going to be a disaster.  First off, the chicken had NO SPICE OR FLAVOR. it looked like it was just boiled chicken, thrown on the grill for a couple mins (maybe a dash of salt and pepper to taste, THAT'S IT). The oxtail gravy was just gross. It had this tan, sandy color to it. Oxtail gravy is dark. It was gelatin like, it was awful.   My husband said, and I quote \"I want to just throw this across the room in anger\". He reminded me to write this review to save people from impending disappointment.   Maybe it was an off day? I don't know. But I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever eat here."}
{"text":"We were heading out for dinner on our last night in Toronto and just happened to remember this restaurant was in the neighborhood we were staying. Wouldn't think a Jamaican restaurant in Toronto would be as good as this. The ribs were great with a little bit of kick to them. Also their chicken and pork dinners each had the same great tastes and i would highly recommend. This is a must stop if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Today we waited several minutes in the cold with other patient customers for them to open at 2 pm, although we could see people inside eating the doors were locked. At 2 pm I knocked and was informed that CNN was conducting an interview and it would be another 30 minutes. It was -2C outside, Toronto in December. But still no consideration for paying customers although they would be happy to fill take out orders. I rate it two stars because the food can occasionally rise to four stars but treating clientele so thoughtlessly makes you think what else could go on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I grew up close to The Real Jerk's original location, mesmerized by its giant bright sunshine mural draping over the facade, a landmark of my neighbourhood. Ate there a few times. And then they got kicked out of their building, caught in an ugly real estate dispute; a blow to the Riverside and the city's Jamaican communities.  Eventually they found a new place to set up again in a dilapidated plaza in a corner of Gerrard and Carlaw. It's not Queen Street Riverside, and there's no giant sunshine, but close enough. The requisite and unavoidable big yellow signs sure brighten up the block.  The bar where the regulars always be found still commands the whole place, and there's an additional dining room fit for a private event. Washrooms are tiny (and likely kept as-is from the previous tenants-certainly not wheelchair-accessible either), and the hand dryers are old and loud as a lawn mower.  The happily pleasant staff seems to be a mix of new and old, and the dining rooms brighter than ever-a mix of simple classy and Jamaican vibe that makes this place a decent choice for a date or a fun dinner, with brand nostalgia covering everything from the tables to the walls. The menu is stripped down from their old place, but from what I heard, you can always get them to make something else if nostalgia strikes your palate.  I love their oxtail. It is blubbery tender, it is bloody delicious! I usually have it with the jerk chicken dinner combo; the chicken has a good tasty mix of spicy and sweet tang. Not mindblowing hot if that's what you are into though; my crazy chilihead friend insists it's not as hot as the stuff you can get further northwest in Little Jamaica.  {TTC: take the 72 or 506 to Gerrard/Carlaw. There's no way you can miss this place, or not notice the tiny plaza parking.}"}
{"text":"Came to this joint expecting serious spice after finding it on a list of spiciest restaurants in Toronto, and was disappointed when our server explained that everything was mild, served with hot sauce on the side. Real tasty sauce but not intense hot by any means, and sweet enough that to drench the meal in it would ruin the flavour of the food.   JERK CHICKEN they gave us white meat, which was quite dry. Since the white meat jerk was extra I thought they'd provide dark meat unless you requested otherwise. Not so.  CURRY GOAT was tasty.   RICE AND PEAS was, to my surprise, actually rice and beans- and it was amaaaaaaaazing.   FRIED PLANTAINS were so, so good. I preferred them to the BANANA FRITTERS which were more like little dumplings.   SHRIMP were firm and juicy and smothered in butter. Yum. I personally find it slightly creepy when they're served unpeeled with little legs, but thy were butterflied so it was easy to peel them.   Decently tasty food at a good price. Confused about the rave reviews, wouldn't go out of my way for it again."}
{"text":"Very good jerk chicken (all I've had). oh and patties also good (not the best). New location looks nice, much better signage."}
{"text":"We stopped in for take out the other day.  The food seems as good as the old location, but it's moved a littler more conveniently close to my house.  The decor looks familiar, much like the old place.  There's a big bar near the entrance.  I personally like oxtail, but their other items are also delish.  I also order the fried plantain, because i like it.  My bf ordered the jerk chicken and jerk pork option.  It's not as spicy as i remember it being but it was still tasty."}
{"text":"We were here the other day.    I was at another caribbean place recently, and this was definitely a kazillion times better!  We had coconut shrimp and the jerk wings (both yummy).  I really like their oxtail which I had with curry goat (also delicious).  My friends each had the chicken roti which they loved.  The decor is kitcshy - but the food is great and ther servers are all very nice."}
{"text":"Had chicken roti wrap from here twice and it tasted pretty good, but found a strand of hair in it both times. Wish they were more careful when making food. The food itself tasted pretty good, until of course I saw the hair and had to throw it all out. Until I have a better experience at this place, I can only give it 2 stars, based on the fact that I found hair every time I've had food from there.  At least if it was once, I understand, mistakes happen. But twice doesn't seem like a mistake.  Taste-wise though, it's a pretty nice restaurant."}
{"text":"The Chicken Roti we got at woodbine park at the Rib fest was good. The next day me and my husband got EXTREMELY sick when we woke up, this was the worst food poisoning ever. We called and left a message. But no one got back to us. A week later, my Client tells me the exact thing happened to her. I'm hoping it was just a bad batch of food and that it doesn't happen again to anyone as I hear great things about this place. I believe in second chances, so if/when we try again we'll let you know.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I find jerk pork is harder to come by than jerk chicken, and this place had it. Texture and taste was just like in Caribbean. The entree could have had more plantine."}
{"text":"The Real Jerk is pretty quintessential.  As I sat there, it became pretty apparent that they do a lot of business with take-away and delivery.  I got the feeling as well that some of the folks asking for take-out did not live in the area and were taking this tasty food to places further afield.  The flavours that come from the kitchen are spicy and rich with what I can only assume to be as authentic Island flavour as possible.  My experiences with food on actual Caribbean islands has led me to believe that if you can't make it to Jamaica, Trinidad, or any of the other fantastic ports of call, this place is probably your best bet.  The décor is very basic but decorative and has a very island-y theme.  The tables are decidedly easy to clean (you'll know why when it happens) and you'll probably be needing a surplus of napkins.  offers a small but adequate beer list.  The food is completely first rate and worth the drive in from wherever you are.  Oh, and if you leave without having a dumpling, you'll be losing out.  Huge."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some authentic Caribbean food and found myself at The Real Jerk. Very friendly staff, although they may disappear for a while on you. I was so happy to see they had fresh Sorrel. The food was...ok at best. I had the Jerk chicken/curry goat. The curry goat was more bone than meat, and the rice was a bit on the dry side. I've never been to a Caribbean spot that didn't offer veggies on the side. Here your choice is either a salad or coleslaw, that's it. The plantains were a joke. They literally had the texture of chips. I think a certain pop artist over-hyped this place."}
{"text":"Love their jerk chicken and oxtail rice with peas and coleslaw. For me it is the best jamaican place in the Toronto. The right amount of spicyness and full of flavour."}
{"text":"I ordered a take out roti, was handed a bag after a 10 minutes wait and left. When i got to my destination I found there were NO utensils or napkins in the bag. A caribbean roti dish is not finger food. I called the restaurant and was told 'they usually include napkins and utensils. No attempt to correct the situation or resolve it was made at all. When I asked for a manager I was told they were busy.  This is terrible service, i'm livid and they have lost repeat business from me.  This restaurant has been hyped up by a local musician who's an international star. This is not license for poor service that ended being a hassle to me, I picked up the take out because I was trying to make my afternoon easier, not more difficult."}
{"text":"Once you walk in you feel like you are in the Caribbean. Decent decor. Old furniture, but has a warm feeling (and no, i'm not from the islands).  Don't get me wrong, its a nice big place.  The chicken roti was a meal on its own. Big portion. Good taste.  Will go again and try other menu items for sure."}
{"text":"I've eaten here and picked up. First of all, I would say the food is pretty good. A little overpriced because Drake filmed his music video with Rihanna there. The food and service haven't changed. There is one particular waitress who is pretty rude and for some reason, people are scared to call her on it. If she's not there, you'll have a great time. If she is, good luck to you.  You can get better Jamaican food at Gerrard Square food court. Not only better quality but more food for less. I would recommend you stay away."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I came here initially because Rihanna and Drake performed Work here. However there were multiple issues. First and foremost the food took over an hour to arrive. The waiter kept forgetting orders and the amount of people at the table. He forgot one of my friend's whole order of Roti. And then he forgot my cousin's plantains. For my order however, I was told they couldn't add vegetables to my janga pasta which was already very similar to the Rasta pasta which does include vegetables, and that didn't make any sense. After being frustrated I proceeded to just get the janga pasta. When everyone's food came out I was then told that they do not have anymore janga pasta (might I add again that the food took over an hour to come). Still not done. Their menu has a host of cocktails, however I'm not a rum fan, or a sugary cocktail person. But at the bottom of the menu it says that there are other margarita and martini options available to just ask the waiter. When I asked the waiter said that the menu was misleading. Instead of being angry I asked for a margarita. After 30min I was then told that they have no more margaritas. Still not done! After all of this, majority of my party didn't even like the roti that they were given. I'm giving two stars because despite the horrible experience, the waiter did try to make it better for me. He gave me a different meal free of charge and was really trying to better my experience when he notice I was disappointed. All in all, I'm going to need them to get it together!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Lower Riverdale, the Real Jerk was a staple.....we'd walk down at least once a month (at that time they were at Queen/Broadview) and converted many a friend to the joys of the Jerk. We've both moved out of the old neighbourhood, but dining at the new location is like visiting an old friend....you know things are different but you hold on to the way it was. Anyways, we ventured down yesterday for lunch. The place was quiet when we arrived (around 12:15pm) but within 15 minutes it started to fill up.  I got my usual...Jerk Chicken (white meat) with coleslaw and rice and peas. A dumpling was thrown in for good measure.  Jerk Chicken - dry, dry, dry. Couldn't eat a piece without washing it down with a swig of Ting. It was a bit disappointing that it was so dry, but it was flavourful. I have a Jamaican friend whose jerk chicken has this place beat hands down.  Coleslaw - WTF...huge pieces of cabbage that were far too big to fit in my mouth. Come on, at least attempt to shred the cabbage. Rice & Peas - smothered with oxtail gravey. Holy hell it was good. Dumpling - I could make a meal out of these alone. Delicious.  Our waitress was fantastic...prompt, attentive, polite.  In a nutshell, I'll continue to go back as I haven't found any place better....if I did, I might not make the trek down anymore. Some friendships aren't made to last forever."}
{"text":"Yes great vibe. 40 minute and counting waiting for my lunch. It's not even busy today."}
{"text":"I have only had limited experience with Caribbean food, so this was a little bit of an adventure for me. Since the first time we have been back a few times because the food is great, and the service seems to be hit and miss but is good overall.  Being new to the world of jerked foods, I actually tried different things on every visit which is rare for me. When I find something I like I usually stick with it. The first time I had the 1/2 jerked chicken dinner which was quite nice, although not as spicy as I had hoped for. On my second time there I had the rib dinner which I was not that satisfied with. Not only was there much less meat, but the flavour just seemed off. The last time I was there I had the pork dinner which was the best of the three and I think that is what I am going to stick with.   Since we wanted a little something before the food comes (because it seems sometimes they can be quick and other times they can take forever), we felt adventurous and went with the fried banana's. I was expecting a dish like fried plantains that I got to experience in Costa Rica which were incredible, but this was nothing like it. Instead of a fried banana, it was battered and deep fried. After one bite we regretted ordering other food because they were incredible and could have eaten them as the entire meal!  Not having any other Caribbean food to compare it to, The Real Jerk has opened my eyes and given me a taste for jerked meat and has my eyes always wandering for other jerked chicken restaurants."}
{"text":"I admit that it's been about 22 years since I first ate at the \"Jerk\" until today. I was there when it opened back in the late 80's? -and it was a hot spot long before the neighbourhood had anything much to offer. You had to get there early and people waited outside for a table back in those days and it was worth it.   Like a little island vacation in the city, the personality of The Real Jerk transports you from your normal state of mind. The food is still authentic and the service is still laid back and friendly. I had the Jerk Chicken, because.. heck! -\"when in Rome...\" and ooooh! the spice. I felt the flavour absorb into the roof of my mouth and make it's way down my throat, er-- maybe that was just the heat of the flavour ;-) \"water please\" The big guy had the Shrimp Roti, a Jamaican Pattie and we shared the fried Plantain. Yum.  And I think I still have my \"Real Jerk\" tee shirt from all those years ago too. LoL.  Someone told me about the rejuvenation of this area and I just had to SEE it to believe it. WOW! it really has been a long time. As I walked east from Broadview along Queen, I was simply AMAZED at the changes. There are so many wonderful little shops and cafes now! OMG! We will have to come back for another exploratory walk here."}
{"text":"No, this is not a place that all the jerks hang out... so ladies don't be afraid.  The Real Jerk has Caribbean vibe all over it, thanks to its low key decor and interior along with good music. Waiter/waitress was helpful, friendly, and attentive. Jerk chicken was awesome,  oxtail was exceptional, coleslaw was delicious, and curry potato was pretty decent.  We went there to get some dinner after seeing some bands at the venue nearby. It was around midnight and there was Karaoke. Everybody looked like they had a great time watching people singing as well as participated. Order Red Stripe, get some jerk chicken, and relax.   As for us guys, the \"jerk\" chicken may not help you get the woman but you can get soul foodgasm instead. You must be a real jerk if you hate this place.  Just kidding. But how can you not like it?"}
{"text":"Very dirty restaurant. DO NOT!! Sit on their couches!! I got a rash from sitting on their couch. I got the jerk chicken. It was dry. The beef patty was old and hard. Customer service is horrible I told them my beef patty was hard and she sucked her teeth at me and brought me a microwaved beef patty. OVERPRICED!! You can get way better jerk though out the GTA for a more reasonable price. The only good thing about this place is the outside appearance of the restaurant but do not be fooled once inside it's all downhill from there."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was pretty good. The curry goat was well seasoned but the oxtail could have used a little more flavor. Service was good though. I imagine I would go back but I'd probably try a few other spots first."}
{"text":"Finally went back and had a vegetable roti with chickpeas. My companions had a potato roti and a vegetable entree plate (coleslaw not vegan). Super delicious and fresh.  Our server was fantastic (they all are) and had suggestions for the hot sauce and jerk sauce which I purchased. Staff are happy to answer any questions you may have as well.  Takeout is also pretty fast if you call ahead.  Note: While the building is all one level, the restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. There is a step from the parking lot/street to the entrance. Washrooms are on same floor but are very narrow with no grab bars. People who use canes may be able to manage okay, but those who use walkers (even folding ones) may find it challenging to use the washrooms if they need their devices for leverage as the stalls are too small to accommodate."}
{"text":"Service is always amazing, the staff are always smiling and happy while they're there.  The food is great, could be spicier though."}
{"text":"Ahh...missed this place! Last time I eat here was at their previous location on Queen St.  I ordered the same meal I ordered last time:  Chicken roti dinner (rice and peas /coleslaw), a side dumpling (soooo good) and a Champagne Cola.  All was delicious, only complaint was the rice seemed a little wet could have been more fluffy. All and all well worth the trip from Halifax."}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken, great rice and cole slaw, wonderful cod fritters with the zestiest sauce, and a cold Dragon Stout.......what could be better? And to boot, the servers were friendly and great to look at! Well done folks. This team is awesome."}
{"text":"Just reviewing this place makes my mouth water.  MMmmmmmm.  As a vegetarian it is my job to assure you that they have a good selection of vegetarian options - you won't feel left out if you come here for a meal.  I especially like the chickpea roti dinner.  It. Is. So. Good.    I'm sorry, this review is making me so hungry that I have to stop immediately.  EDIT: I'd like to add  that after I wrote this I badgered my husband (who was in bed watching a movie) to go get me a roti - and he flatly refused. The nerve!"}
{"text":"When driving mad hungry on Gerrard street, we noticed The Real Jerk restaurant ahead of us. I've heard of this restaurant before from Rihana's \"Work\" video so I was like might as well try it. As a Canadian born with Jamaican decent, I am very picky with eating Jamaican food outside my own household. Cautiously, we ordered the jerk chicken and oxtail platter with rice and peas and coleslaw. I must say, even thought the food doesn't taste as good as home, Although the food was surprisingly decent, it was not worth the price. As it was quite expensive for Jamaican food.  Overall I wouldn't go back, but not a terrible spot."}
{"text":"We went on a weekend afternoon, it was pretty quiet, only a few tables had people seated. (Google Maps said this was less busy than usual for the time.) The staff were nice and food was decent. Really chill vibe there. The menu is pretty extensive - probably too extensive. The chicken was a bit dry, but had amazing flavour - it felt like we were enjoying BBQ in the middle of summer but it was barely springtime  woohoo!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, there's better all over the city.  VERY salty.  The service is good and the portions are plentiful... it's just meh on flavour and overall quality.  Living off the name for sure."}
{"text":"Once a week I indulge in Caribbean food. If I could get it more often I definitely would but being from Calgary, my selections are few and far in between. So, when I am in Toronto which is fortunately quite often, I have Caribbean every day.   With that being said, I realize my feedback may be skewed simply because I am deprived of great Caribbean food in Calgary. Although there are some places, the much smaller market makes for less competition and therefore less standout places than what Toronto has. Regardless, I was immensely happy with everything I had here (curry goat and jerk chicken) and even took 3 patties to go (which I finished the same night). It's no frills (just watch Drake and Rihanna's Work video), but so are most of the best places in Jamaica so don't worry, everything irie."}
{"text":"Since this isn't too far from home and we had heard good things, we came here for an early dinner one day just after they opened their new location.  Overall, we were very impressed! Their beef and chicken patties were delicious (my boyfriend even bought 2 extras to take home after!) and the service was great. Our server was hilarious and the bartender seemed to be well liked by all of the other patrons.  We tried a few different things, including of course the jerk chicken. Very flavourful, although not too spicy. Their house-made hot sauce did help with that though. The rice and beans that came with the chicken were flavourful and filling.  Price wise - pretty standard, and it was definitely good value (ie BIG portions!)  We will be back."}
{"text":"Had a great meal. Wife and kids loved Jerk Wings and son loved curried chicken. Me, curried lentils. Also, kids fruit punch was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Ambiance: very casual, has music in the background.  Food: There were 3 of us: we ordered  chicken roti: very good pork jerk appetizer : extremely good: goat roti: below average, it came with large pieces of bone.   1/2 chicken jerk: very good Side of plantains We also had 3 Trinidadian beer and 2 New Castle beers.  The total cost was 100$ including tax and tip.  Service: the waiter was funny, and served us well, giving us updates on when we will get the food...."}
{"text":"Being from south Florida, aka Caribbean USA, I thought I knew Jamaican food. Apparently I have been deceived, as confirmed By our Jamaican dinner companion.   This is by far the most authentic Jamaican restaurant I have been to, which is shocking considering we are all the way in Canada! I discovered dishes I never knew excised. A couple highlights on the night:  - Dumplings with oxtail gravy. Insanely addictive. This is basically a funnel cake with dipping sauce. The ultimate challenge is to not stuff your face with so much of this that you can't eat the main entree. I failed  - Jerk Pork. Apparently everything and anything can be jerked, but this is my personal favorite. Sooooo much flavor.  - Red pea soup. This is the type of soup you crave on a cold rainy day. Dumplings, peas, carrots, cabbage....deliciousness !   I do have to warn that the wait for your food can be excessively long. This put a damper on the experience as a whole."}
{"text":"Used to go to the Real Jerk years ago when it was on Queen St. East. Used to be one of the best Jerk places in the city. Not anymore.  The good: The new location on gerrard is big and airy  The bad. Ordered the jerk chicken for lunch.Came Luke warm and dry as chalk (leftover from the night before would be my guess). My lunch companions had the same experience. Service was slow (standing around talking at the bar instead of efficiently serving customers). I'll probably try the Real jerk for dinner, but not anytime soon"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Different than the many other Caribbean places I've been to but in a good way, other than the prices which are definitely higher. The reason for the 3 stars is the terrible waitress we had. This was a few months back and she was definitely new, maybe even her first day so I don't exactly blame her but if she didn't know what she was doing then someone else should have been helping her. I was also not happy that they didn't have what I wanted on the menu. If it's on the menu, you should have it, period. I haven't been back since but I will try again as it may have only been a one time thing."}
{"text":"I watched this place move from their famous old Broadview location and  being built and open in this location, but somehow never tried it until now?  Service: the waitress who served us sounded like she had a bit of a \"whateverrr\" attitude, or just tired from working, but wasn't rude to complain about  Food: We ordered the Curry Goat Dinner, and a side of 1/4 Jerk Chicken (dark meat), and a side of Stew Chicken  Curry Goat Dinner - we ordered it with rice & peas, and curry potato. The portion was big, very filling, and tasted great. However, the goat meat could be a little more tender as it was somewhat chewy. Also, be mindful that some pieces may come with huge bones.  1/4 Jerk Chicken (dark meat) - it came with 3 pieces of meat, a pretty decent portion, and very well seasoned and a little bit hot  Stew Chicken - I've never had this before, but the flavour in this is STRONG with a little bit of smokiness. The meat of the chicken was stewed well where the meat easily falls off the bone. I ordered this as a side just to try, but I think this dish would be better with rice as it came with a lot of gravy."}
{"text":"(maybe 2.5 stars) Somewhat disappointed.  I was very excited to go here, following their grand opening at their new location. When we walked in, it looked like downtown Hong Kong. It was messy, chairs were scattered everywhere, tables were dirty; which were still not cleaned when we left. Our waiter had trouble with the ipad system to take orders. He was very nice, and was busy so he was running back and forth and I could not help notice that there were two ladies standing at the doors doing nothing (they seemed to have a care free attitude). The ledge where I was sitting, was also very dusty.    We ordered appetizers, but our meal came first. But, there was no utensils on our table! It took at least 5 minutes to hail the waiter, and by the utensils came, our food was cold.  The food, was good. The jerk chicken was very moist and had a lot of flavor. The rice and beans were good, along with the coleslaw. The Cod came fritters came after our meal, but they were still pretty good.  Overall, I could have had went on a bad day, because most of the reviews seem to be positive. Maybe, just maybe I might pay another visit."}
{"text":"Tourist Alert: Me and my boyfriend were in Toronto visiting and of course stopped by the real jerk on a Reference from a friend at work, work work. My boyfriend is Caribbean so this review is a conformation from him. He had the oxtail. He enjoyed it. He doesn't like meatless or fatty oxtail and I heard no complaints from this sit down. I had the jerk ribs. So good! Loved them. If you like ribs you'll def in enjoy. We both had rice and peas which were good also and the plantains were damn good also we had to fight over his last bite.   The environment was cute. Music was popping. Service was mediocre but hey, maybe just my day."}
{"text":"Four words... jerk chicken and ribs.   I hear these guys moved recently, but haven't had a moment to scope out their new digs. The location on Queen E was large and in charge with plenty of space for big groups. Their food was also large in charge, I'm talking enormous portions with tons of flavor! The jerk chicken was easily some of the best I've eaten, and while I don't know much about the spices or cooking process, I'll tell ya this tasted pretty darn authentic to me. The ribs had a great smoky BBQ flavor, but it wasn't quite as fall-off-the-bone as I would have liked. I did need to do a little work to pry that meat free.   My only beef (pun intended) is that for lunch, it's a bit costly. My combo plate was $13, add a drink and tip to that and you're walking out of there spending $20. At the same time though, I'm more than thrilled to give these local guys my dough. They have an extensive menu, the service was prompt, and I hope to internet search for their new home. (Can't imagine not being able to eat Real Jerk again!)"}
{"text":"The extra high ceilings, kitschy palm tree decorations, brilliantly coloured flag-like table cloths, and chilled out music make escaping the cold and into The Real Jerk a great relief. I won't go as far as likening the heavenly smelling haven to actually going to the sun destination itself, but the taste of the comfort food could figuratively transport you to Jamaica if you'd only be willing to eat with your eyes closed.   The appetizer of fried plantains were wonderfully sweet and mushy. My half rack of succulent ribs was much more than I could finish.  It's a cause, (but no fault), of my love for the plentiful sides of flavourful rice and creamy coleslaw. My dinner date's generously stuffed chicken roti was about the size of an infant and reportedly 'perfect'. He took our very friendly server's recommendation to try 'kola champagne' and loved it too.  Just as we were on our way out (to catch a concert at the Opera House next door), it was time for Irie-okee! Our server got all excited and even brought the book of songs to our table to try to convince us to go up (the \"stage\" is literally in the centre of the room, amongst all the tables, which makes for great access to the audience for serenades) and sing. Despite his passionate persuasion though, we had to leave. We did however promise to come back again with our friends, which we sincerely plan to do. So, what is everyone doing next Thursday?"}
{"text":"Maybe not the best Caribbean food on Toronto, but it's up there in overall quality. The kitchen in their new location is as good as it was at Queen & Broadview. Jerk Chicken, Oxtail and Goat roti were all as good as I remembered. Service seemed a bit slow and inattentive, but acceptable. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Came in to order to take out an hour before they closed for my moms birthday, took about 20-35 minutes kinda lost track but it was sort of long but totally worth it!  - 1 Shrimp Roti - 1 Chicken Roti - 1 1/2 Jerk chicken dinner - 2 Doubles.  The food was phenomenal and my mom and dad loved it. Will continue to come here."}
{"text":"I went for dinner last Saturday with a huge group of people. I will go back once more as I want to try more menu items.  I wasn't too hungry so I got 2 appetizers.   The jerk shrimp was good. The shrimp were not too big and not too small. They came on a wooden skewer with veggies. Nice and spicy. I will definitely order it again.  The cod fritters were good. Greasy but good.  I was disappointed with the cocktail. I can't remember the name of the cocktail but it had no alcohol in it at all. So if you are ordering a drink I suggest you get a beer, rum or wine."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. For all the hype surrounding this place I thought I was ordering some juicy and flavourful jerk chicken, but my jerk was bland and overcooked to the point of rubberyness. I had to chug water to wash it down. For  $14 my portion was mediocre. My friend ordered a vegetarian roti and found bones inside her dish some how.  Just do your self a favour and go to 1 of Allwyns two locations and enjoy some \"real jerk\". I would recommend the cocobread sandwich for  $4!"}
{"text":"As I have more times than I care to admit, I stopped by the Real Jerk tonight to pick up dinner.  As always, I got the chicken and chickpea roti, and, as always, with enough hot sauce, it was enjoyable.  So why only a three then?  My actual rating would be a solid 3.5.  Here's my rationale:  The food is okay, but nothing I'd rave about.  Since it's right around the corner from my place, I've tried a variety of things on the menu.  Most aren't complete disappointments, but the only thing I'd feel confident recommending to a friend is the roti because its quality seems to be the most consistent and for the price, it's reasonable.  I think the biggest issue I have with The Real Jerk is the service; not surprisingly the number of my take-out visits greatly outweigh the times I've eaten there.  I've had a few good servers there; don't get me wrong.  Unfortunately, I've had more that seem to be doing me a great favour to take my order or money.  And frankly that makes them well... a real, you know... jerk."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Girls at the front never take orders properly. Your chicken is dry! Jerk chicken fried chicken...doesn't matter, it's dry! Waitresses are full of attitude. Oxtail is hit or miss...inconsistent portions. I have yet to go into this store and they make any order properly."}
{"text":"After seeing this spot in Rihanna's \"Work\" video, my friends and I just had to give this spot a try while in Toronto. It was really great. The service was excellent, thanks Peachy! The food was great and the drinks were really good too. This was a great spot for a large group. Nice relaxed fun vibes and the food portions were large, but tasty."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, and second time for my husband. We ordered:  Rum Punch - you can smell the booze, but can only taste the fruit punch.  Jerk Chicken & Goat Curry Combo - the jerk chicken was juicy but missing some spice I would normally associate as \"jerk.\" The goat curry was delicious, juicy but bony. If you like eating with your hands and sucking on bones, this is what you need! I love it and will order the goat curry again. The side of curry potatoes and coleslaw were good.  Jerk Pork (Appetizer) - it was nicely charred, and the bites with the fat was awesome. It has a nice kick and had better jerk seasoning than the chicken.  I will come back if I'm craving some goat curry or jerk pork. I do want to try their roti next time!"}
{"text":"Dropped by with 3 friends because I was craving jerk chicken.  What we ordered: ting x 3 pepper shrimp 1/4 jerk chicken w/ rice and peas, and curry potato jerk pork w/ rice and peas, and coleslaw jerk oxtail and pork w/ rice and peas, and curry potato jerk chicken and pork w/ rice and peas, and curry potato  pepper shrimp: very flavourful but pricy for 8 pieces of shrimp. jerk chicken was good. dark meat is pretty juicy. but pretty small portion jerk pork was good. wasn't dry. wasn't full of fat. oxtail was tender. delicious.  portions of the sides were good but would have preferred slightly bigger portions when it came to the meats. you can taste the jerk but i prefer my jerk to be a bit stronger in taste. ok, that came out wrong. you know what i mean.  friendly staff but our server wasn't around enough being that it wasn't too busy there. albeit she did say she had a larger group in another room. we needed another moment to look at the menu, but it took a while for server to come back to take our order. she also forgot to bring us water twice but finally did the third time around. some of us were thirsty.  overall a pretty good. i'd come back. there are items on their menu that aren't on their website, such as pastas and more."}
{"text":"Happened to chance upon this place as we were looking for a place to have dinner on the way back from Home Depot at Gerard Square. The exterior decor is eye catching and this is easily the most spacious sit-in Jamaican restaurant I have been to. They have a full service bar on the right side as you walk in and a sit-in restaurant set up on the left. We got a seat by the window overlooking the Carlaw Avenue which was nice. We ordered the half jerk chicken dinner (comes in two large pieces of dark and white meat a piece) with a side of rice & peas and salad. Second order of fried chicken dinner with rice and curry potatoes. We also ordered a side of Ackee and Cod fish stew - apparently the national dish of Jamaica and came highly recommended by the server (who was very friendly and helpful). Jerk was lightly marinated and was not too spicy (maybe a good thing for a lot of Torontonians). The fried chicken stole the show - perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy & tender on the inside. I loved the Ackee and Cod Fish stew, the dish was very lightly salted and well stewed with jackfruit and onion. Will come here again for sure."}
{"text":"Food came an hour after we ordered.  Horrible customer service, no one at the restaurant got their food on time."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. I did not particularly like the original Real Jerk but this is like a quick trip to the Islands! Best beans and rice I've had in TO - and I've tried many Caribbean restaurants. Very good chicken roti with not to many chunks of potato. Lovely people, cozy atmosphere, We will be back - often!"}
{"text":"A fun place for good Caribbean food and drinks. A friend took us here during our Toronto trip and I loved the food and atmosphere. Oh, and check out this place in Rihanna's music video \"Work\" if you haven't seen it already."}
{"text":"Stepping inside The Real Jerk do makes me feel like I go through this travelling machines and I am somewhere in Jamaica!  All the green/yellow/black decoration, the dirty floorings, the sticky tables, the smiling waiter.  The Jerk Chicken here is really good. The chicken is tender and juicy even for white meat. The oxtail is quite tender too.. but the portions are really small for $13.50. The rice and peas/beans combination is quite good too.   The Curry Goat Roti ... I am not really crazy about lamb/goat... I found it taste pretty good too, not too lamby.. and a little or a lot of Hot Sauce will help! However the roti wrap taste like something from the Supermarket... I think I will skip the Roti and just have the Curry.  Why they hiding the Extra Spicy Hot Sauce in the Kitchen?? Next time for sure I am asking for that!  Waiter is nice and friendly with a million dollar smile, just like how they are in Jamaica!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed. Had an order of jerk wings, cod fritters, then I had the beef Roti. The food was all fantastic and came out fast. Washed it down with a boneshaker beer.  The real star of the show was our waiter Troy. Wicked awesome personality, cracks jokes, sense of humor, checks in but doesn't linger.. Quite possibly the best wait staff that I've ever had. Also, a shout out to the other waiter who took our plates even when it wasn't his table--sorry, didn't get his name.  Mind you it wasn't too busy this night, but I would visit again."}
{"text":"I've biked down carlaw a lot, and it's always been a bland sort of coloured building and after the real jerk moved in OMG COLOUR AHHHHHH. I can't get over how different the building looks.   Never having been to the previous location and googling about their crazy adventures of having to move, and most importantly since I had a serious chicken roti craving I order one for pickup. Everyone there was incredibly friendly. All smiles, asking how we are, servers going above and beyond, esspecially for a small pickup order, just doesn't happen so it was really nice to see and good to credit them for it.  $10 later and I had a HUGE roti. I weighed it at home. 1.3lbs. it was great. so great. demolished that thing. I can't really review them on much, but I definitely will return for more.   Rum tastings, beer on tap, awesome looking place. that's what you're paying the small premium for over a hole in the wall Jamaican joint."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some authentic Jamaican food & you're in the downtown area, come here. The owners definitely put time & thought into the environment & atmosphere of the restaurant, giving you a true Caribbean feel as soon as you step inside.  My top Jamaican dishes are Jerk Chicken & Oxtail. Luckily there was a combo with both, w/ rice & peas & coleslaw. It was amazing & the portion size left us FULL!  Will definitely be coming back, perfect way to end off the Caribana weekend   Did I mention this is where Drake & Rihanna shot the 'Work' music video?"}
{"text":"I had the stew chicken.  I don't know how it's made or what's in it ... But I want to pour the gravy all over everything I eat from now on.  Super satisfying."}
{"text":"Food is so good.  Service isn't.  So slow, and downright rude.  I'll try again when I visit Toronto.  Maybe it was a fluke."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences of my life!!!! The only reason I even gave it one star is because that's as low as it goes.   First off the place looked dirty and disgusting, like they just didn't give a rats arse about the place. The Windows looked like they hadn't been cleaned in years, and the furniture was worn out and ugly.   I don't consider myself a snob at all, I absolutely love quaint little \"hole in the wall\" places with mis-matched furniture and a cozy rustic feel. The Real Jerk has a cool vibe, I'll give it that much, and it seemed cozy at first, but after sitting there  a few minutes it just felt a bit unpleasant.  The food took a long time, and the waitress, though very sweet, didn't seem to know what she was doing.  Now, on to the food. You would expect that a Jamaican restaurant would make its own patties and that they would be amazing. Nnnnnnnope, I'd swear the ones we got came straight out of a box. They weren't terrible but they weren't great either.  My gf ordered a chicken roti which was actually quite good, wish I had ordered that. Instead I ordered the jerk pork. The first bite was promising but it went steeply down hill from there. Not only was most of it way over cooked but I actually bit into a big chunk of what seemed to be charcoal. I chugged my beer and water to try and get that awful burnt taste out of my mouth but to no avail. My meal AND my taste buds were ruined!   The only reason we went there was because of all the hype. But hype is all it is. NEVER going back there again! EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok. Just realized that the terrible review that I gave years back is no longer true. New location at Carlaw and Gerard is actually tasty.  I take it all back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat in the city. The atmosphere is so warm.  Even if you visit this place in the dead of winter, you feel like you are transported... even if just for the length of your meal. They are always playing good music, have their own brand of hot sauce and are always really friendly. One of the only places in the city, that I am familiar with, to have London Pride beer on tap. Everything is good, but the jerk chicken wings are my personal fave."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest restaurant in town, but it's nicely decorated - very hmmm.... Caribbean!!!  We ordered the jerk chicken wings and the ribs/oxtail platter.... The food was tasty!! Authentic, that's for sure!!! I also had their specialty drink which was some kind of chilled tea w/loads of ginger powder....   I'd recommend if you're into Jamaican and not high maintenance!!"}
{"text":"Loco C.- I totally agree with your review. I used to live beside the old location and quite honestly don't have a lot of good to say about it.  Few weeks ago I dined at the new location out of curiosity. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. But I know this place all too well and one good experience could be the only so I went back again last night. Much to my surprise our dinner was still REALLY REALLY GOOD. The dumplings and gravy are a definite must. The pepper shrimp and jerk shrimp, rice and pea with gravy and the chicken soup were all good. Echelons higher than before. Ironically the jerk chicken lacked flavour. Unfortunately the escovitch (fish) was good my first visit back and mediocre last night. Outside of that our experience (both) blew the old reputation outta the water. It really is worth going back to!"}
{"text":"As always, this place hits the spot. Enjoyed some tender fall off the bone oxtail. Especially good this time around. Addicted to their rice and peas and the gravy. Mmmm.... the gravy and rice.... can eat that all day everyday. The jerk chicken was a lil dry but still delicious. The coleslaw was also on point. To top it all off, iced ginger beer. The service was slow and they definitely need to do a facelift to the place, but I guess the food speaks for itself. Will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I attended several events at The Real Jerk.    A warm and welcoming atmosphere with excellent customer service.  They offer the best chicken wings ever!  An excellent place for hosting an event and they will work with your budget."}
