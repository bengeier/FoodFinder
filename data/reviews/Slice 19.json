{"text":"Had the Strip Steak and Vegetables....Absolutely fantastic!!! Excellent service, great food.  Very nice ambiance, will be regularly visiting this place. You have to try this place everything that I have eaten here has been terrific!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and generally I do like this place.  However last night was a bit disappointing with regards to thier delivery and lack of followup.  I placed an order at 825pm about 45m from closing.  I initially assumed that it was delivery since it was a Web order. However I wrong.  I understand that I could of misunderstood delivery from pickup.  But my disappointment is from complete lack of follow up if I might of forgotten my order.  It wasn't until 931pm after closing that I realized \"am I ever going to get my order\" I called them and was informed they were closed and I need to come pick up.  I informed them I was a delivery.  However apparently It was not known if my order was for pickup or delivery.  As I drove to pickup my order at 940pm.  I wondered why didn't anyone from their staff follow up as to make sure was I coming to pick up my order or did I want it delivered, if anything they could of notified me that their delivery drop offs stopped at 850pm.  I know this could of been my mistake on assuming delivery from get go.  However my disappointment lies with fact no attempt was made from their end to at least say your order is ready for pickup and that our business closes at 9pm.  \"Are you coming to pickup your order. I was probably the last order of the night.  It shouldn't of been to hard to take time for a phone call to just ensure I didn't forget my order or if there was some confusion on delivery or puckup."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would.    This restaurant is absolutely horrible.  The food generally isn't horrible, but the pizza is and there are some dishes that are just absolute junk.  Their portions are also barely anything and all of the food is way overpriced.  You get no value for your money.  The worst part is the service is always SLOW AS CAN BE.  Today we (2 people) dined in and our meals were delivered almost 15 minutes apart.  How does it take so long to make some tacos?  My drink (ice water) also sat empty for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile both waitresses leaned on the wall behind the bar, texting on their cell phones, not tending to any guests.  The owner and/or his staff clearly does NOT care!  The food ALWAYS takes forever to be delivered, but to have our meals delivered 15 minutes apart... come on!  Then the waitress doesn't even apologize for the ridiculous delay!  The restaurant wasn't even busy, but still you can't somehow figure out to ACT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY.  These people to not care about their guests.  To the owner, you need all new staff, or perhaps simply a manager who knows what s/he's doing.  Highly recommend AGAINST ever patronizing this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was slow though they're not busy. Took forever to get and serve our orders.  Server was not friendly and seems doesnt know what she is doing.   Food is below average.  Definitely Wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA ALERT:   We have previously had Slice 19's pizza in house and really enjoyed them. Last night we decided to order a couple Take & Bake 12\" Pizza's from Slice 19 (located in Tuscany Village @ Chimera Golf Club). Our order included a cheese pizza and 'The Tom' - Pepperoni, Sausage and Mushrooms. The pizzas come on a thin cooking sheet (just as other places) the crust however was nice and crispy on the bottom and sides after cooking, unlike other places. Cooking directions were right on and both pizzas were super delicious with the perfect amount of toppings. I'd have to say Slice 19's pizza is way better than Papa Murphys and can I mention better looking?! The ordering process was easy and the staff are friendly. If you haven't tried the pizza here I highly recommend it! They also have a full menu and delivery service if you just don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, delivery and food.   I would love to dine in great ambience (never have time)."}
{"text":"Hands down the most incompetent Cooks you will ever experience.. I ordered the breakfast sandwich when I go golfing all the time and I simply ask for the English muffin toasted and they cannot get it done ..who serves an English muffin raw"}
{"text":"Favorite golf course outdoor patio seating and dog friendly. More importantly, the staff is over-the-top friendly and efficient. Menu features a variety of quality items to please any palate. Flexible ordering options, take out and local delivery, too!"}
{"text":"Love the family atmosphere and amazing food! Lots of love, good food, and spirits at Slice 19!"}
{"text":"Kapri was amazing ! Called slice 19 and the guy must of been new took him 15 minutes to take one order down , and also he promised it would be here in 3o min which actually turned out to be 1 hour and 6 min to be exact! Long story short , I called back a nice lady name kapri answersed and I told her about my order that was over an hour late and she apologized to me even though it wasn't even her fault. what a great lady talking to her made my night better. Pizza was cold also and they forgot the ranch that I mentioned 3 times to the guy who answered the phone. I gave you guys 5 stars because Of Kapris customer service and just the way she handled the situation."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a pizza and chicken fingers. It was the worst pizza I have ever had. The dough was dry and it just didn't taste fresh. I honestly would have rather had a frozen pizza. I thought the chicken fingers would be safe since they are hard to screw up but they were very rubbery and hard to eat. I do not know if we just were unlucky or if it is always like this but I won't trying it again."}
{"text":"Love how Tuscany has a neighborhood restaurant! Free delivery to Tuscany residents. We love coming here for drinks, breakfast and to watch sports games. Food is really good, love the blue cheese steak salad. They have different events so check their website."}
{"text":"I ordered two cheesecake slices with strawberry topping, broasted chicken and 2 other sandwiches. I called to have them correct my order. The broasted chicken was to salty to eat. The cheesecakes were missing the topping. The gal Rachel who answered the phone couldn't resolve the dinner issue. I asked to speak to the manager. She put me on hold and said she would call her manager who had gone home. Nicole the manager told Rachel to tell me she was to busy and that she would call me tomorrow. I don't understand. We're talking about my families' dinner. Bottom line if they don't correct their customer service or their recipes, they'll ultimately go out of business. Who wants salty chicken or incomplete orders? In addition Rachel told me that they no longer baked their cheesecakes and that's why the slices were now small because the cheesecakes were brought baked and presliced. So they also changed the size of the cheesecakes to small and didn't adjust the price. They kept the old price $7.99  for their big cheesecake slices but deliver small size.  Update: 3/28  Reply to the Owner of Slice 19 email that he sent me. Please take note that I asked to speak to the manager. Your comment about using inappropriate language is very low of you sir. At no time, did I ever raise my voice or use inappropriate language. If this was done once, I'm sure it has happened before and will continue to happen. If you don't make  appropriate changes your bottom line will be hurt. That's your problem not mine. Why lash out at a customer? I keep getting blamed after you just stated the customer is always right? A little passive aggressive? At no point did Rachel offer to correct the error. All she kept saying was that the manager has left and she has no authority to fix it. How did I know the cheesecakes aren't made there anymore or the manager's name? Or that the manager was gone after 7:30pm? Obviously, your employee told me all that...."}
{"text":"Fabulous Chicken Salad Lettuce Wraps.  On the September Specials Menu.  I dine here at least twice a week.  Taco Tuesdays, All you can eat pasta pizza and salad on Wednesdays,  Happy Hours,  and the list goes on.  All the food is great,  wonderful service,  friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service and great menu for a golf course clubhouse with bar/restaurant! Good burger, good wings, good tomato soup, good grilled cheese!!  Great bar food/snacks and drink specials!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the Caesar salad and wings were decent but the pizza was awful. What a disappointment. Guess I'll never order from them again.   Also be careful I seen there delivery car speeding thru the community guess they were in a hurry to drop off there nasty pizza."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was concerned when I saw some of the reviews. We moved into Tuscany about 4 months ago and was delighted there was a bar/restaurant in the development.   We've had breakfast there about a dozen times and service has been fast and always accurate. We've never been disappointed!    Recently we tried the chicken and ordered on of the family packs. It was great as well. Chef Ivan has a number of specials that we want to check out next!  It's nice to have a local place so close, decent food, free delivery. Let's keep 'em busy!"}
{"text":"Pizza not so great. Crust is like dense bread. Live in Tuscany community & everytime we go in the servers are much more interested in the regulars at the bar. Other food is ok. Three stars for convenience."}
{"text":"We are new to Lake Las Vegas area and always looking for a \"casual bite to eat\" nearby since there isn't much between here and Green Valley or Galleria Mall area. Happened upon this restaurant in a neighboring golf course community. Sat outside on the nice patio in this perfect balmy weather and received great service. We shared a Greek salad (fresh, crisp, perfect dressing), a Chimera pizza (a little too much cheese, not enough sauce or oregano but overall pretty good), and chicken wings with two different sauces. Really good and crispy (no breading). The menu has quite a lot to choose from, so I could see coming here often and trying different things. Also love that they deliver for those evenings we just want to stay in! :)"}
{"text":"Another home run. Today I sampled the chicken salad lettuce wraps which were amazing!  For dinner I had the shrimp and steak (surf and turf) with mashed cauliflower in creamy garlic sauceAMAZING!  We are loving the September menu and the month has just begun."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent here but the view from their outside patio is phenomenal.  Love coming here.  They make great lattes for you coffee lovers and the breakfast sandwich is my favorite.  Also great for party's and family events."}
{"text":"The food is edible and the service is inconceivable. The running joke with my friends has always been that you need to call a half hour in advance to order breakfast before tee time. Today I decided to eat lunch at this place and it took one hour and twenty minutes from sitting down to finally getting our pizza. It's obvious that this place is ran by people who have never managed a restaurant before."}
{"text":"We have been there multiple times because we live in the community and this place always disappoints."}
{"text":"We ordered mozzarella sticks and pepperoni pizza for two. The price was decent and the food was surprisingly AMAZING! Best pizza I've had in a while. Free delivery because we were staying in Tuscany so that was a plus!!!. The only downside is the ordering process took 10 minutes on the phone. The girl was in training so I understand that but it seemed like she was kind of on her own! So the ordering part was a little tedious because I had to keep repeating myself and she wasn't sure how to do a lot of things. Wasn't a huge deal though! Great food."}
{"text":"Golf Club restaurant on the Chimera Golf course.  The clubhouse serves breakfast, lunch, dinner, and has a full bar.  I came here several times during a stay with a friend who lives in the neighborhood. I tried the pizza, pork quesidellas, and fish and chips. The fish and chips were very good. The menu has as assortment of appetizers, breakfast, pizzas, sandwiches, and entrees.  You can also purchase beer to go at the bar if you are hitting the green. Buy 5 beers and you get the 6th for free. They will even package it in ice for you.  The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the portions are small. Especially the breakfast. The breakfast is like a child's plate, most places pile on the hash browns but not this place. Two skinny strips of bacon, poor quality, and a tiny little scramble egg. But guess what? You get to pay an adult price for your Childs plate and you leave hungry still. Two thumbs down! They need to serve a breakfast like Black Bear does. You leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best services I've had. Thank you Nichole. When I asked for Italian beef sandwich with no bread which was amazing and a lot of meat, she actually paid attention and left the croutons off my salad - very few waitress listen to that. The burger david had was so large and he said awesome flavor. We will be back - excellent food, terrific service and your close to us. We will order for delivery as this works in our diet. Thank you!   Liked it so much we ordered dinner to be delivered Excellent no flour fried chicken and Cole slaw. Just so you know it rocked!!!"}
{"text":"As a tuscany homeowner and someone who has frequented slice 19 at least once per week since moving into this community I was blown away by how rude and bad of service I received this morning. the bartender ( short hair ) and a rude waitress didnt come to get our order, when I asked her a question she purposely walked away and shrugged, id expect this bad of service at a strip restaurant but not somewhere that we come to quite often. awesome chef, and frankie the waitress when there is the best, however if these are your new employees or what we can expect myself as well as the rest of the residents of this community will make sure not to return. If I was Tom Burke id look into who you had working this morning and make changes quickly before you lose the local community."}
{"text":"Pizza is awsome! It's  thin crust and has great flavor.  They have taco Tuesdays, special entrees on Wednesdays, build your own burger Thursdays....all of the food is good! Prices aren't bad either....definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I love ordering the grilled cheese and chips, today I ordered the chicken tenders. Not only did they come soggy but it took 50 minutes to get it delivered when I was told it was going to take 30 minutes. It's a hit or miss with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Go see Josh, he was super awesome and funny! This place is cute. We found a coupon from Craft Haus Brewery and decided to give it a shot, lots of drinks, good food options and super friendly service, quite and relaxed atmosphere. We'll be back for another night soon!"}
{"text":"we ordered dinner (online) at 6:30pm for delivery.  At 7:11 our bell rang.  My broasted chicken was perfect!!  My Greek salad (no onions, no meat) arrived as ordered & was a generous serving, crisp and tasty.   Husband  ordered artichoke/chicken panini  with fries.  The fries & sandwich were hot and yummy! Thank you to all involved!!"}
{"text":"If you were stuck playing golf here or a resident near by, I guess I'll see you coming back to eat more than once.  Ordered the pizza and we weren't sure what was thicker, the box it came in or the pizza. Well once we figured that sad one out, we dug into our wings that were mediocre to say the least.  What really surprised us was the Caesar Salad and the large order of fries were really good. So for the horrible pizza, very happy service and the really good Caesar Salad and fries I gave them a two.  Won't be coming back, even if they made the pizza thicker than the box. Once was enough for this place."}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst delivery experience.  The maple pecan salad was good.  The steak on top of the salad, however, was rubbery and below average. The broasted chicken was crispy and tasty.  The chocolate milkshake was creamy and still cold. The order arrived accurately. The delivery driver was friendly, although the order arrived ten minutes later than promised time."}
{"text":"OMG, the pizza is AMAZING!  It's like crack!   I want to go back to to Nevada this weekend just to order some more!  I love the restaurant/bar, too.  They just need to drop the prices a bit and I'd be there more often!"}
