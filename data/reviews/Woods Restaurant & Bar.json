{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing food. Canadian themed including music and ambiance. Toronto's best, by far."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  The duck was exceptional.  Only course I did not care for was dessert.  The dessert was so small it was practically one bite and was expensive.  Everything else was very enjoyable.  Service was also quite good."}
{"text":"Woods is not only (obviously) a suitable name given who owns the joint, but it's also a good reflection of the space's rustic Canadiana feel.  And now don't go letting the experiences at other self-proclaimed \"Canadian\" establishments inform the types of things you assume that means. Woods' doesn't communicate it's Canadian theme with folklorish Moose-heads, hung ice-skates or sports-game memorabilia.  Rather, Woods' interpretation is far more elegant and organic while staying true to the naturistic \"woods\" theme. There are dark wooden floors, a gorgeous wooden branch chandelier, beautiful rain-drop shaped lights, a wall resembling white rapids or sand, and booths with a birch tree pattern. They even have taken the time to serve their drinks with custom-made straws that resemble skinny birch-tree straws. With the natural light shining through the massive front and back windows, and the noise never exceeding a gentle buzz, Woods makes me feel comfortable, warm and welcome.  No one's telling me to come back in three hours because they don't take reservations. No one has to scream at anyone else because the music is too loud. No one has to shimmy into a communal table because they've packed us in like commercially raised cattle. Nope. It's clear that Woods has opted out of the current hipster-mecca trend and man, am I ever glad.   Service is also a pleasure, especially considering they're only one week in. From the moment we arrived, the adorably bubbly hostess greeted us with energy and smiles, starting the evening off on an immediate high.  Likewise, our server for the night was friendly, well prepped on food and drink offerings, and was able to confidently make recommendations. The service staff were also very attentive with water glasses and cutlery, and both drinks and food emerged at a comfortable well-spaced pace- in and out within an hour and 45 minutes.  Speaking of drinks, Woods' international wines list features about 16 selections by the glass ($10-19) and almost four times that by the bottle ($50-425). They also feature a handful of microbrews by draft or bottle, single malts, rye, grappa and 5 signature cocktails.  Over the course of the evening, we enjoyed a fresh Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand ($12), the Sparkling Ginger (Wise Special Blend Meets Bitter Ginger with Dry Proscecco, $10), and the Woods Caesar (Muddled Tomato, Crispy Onions, Bacon Salt and Deep-Fried Pickle, $10).  Two very different drinks, but both good in their own right. The former, of course, was much sweeter, while the latter was unmistakably savoury. It wasn't as spicy as I normally like my Caesars, but it had tremendous texture and flavour with the umami-packed rimmer and the crispy onions on top. And they must be reading my blog to know I'm obsessed with Deep-Fried Pickles- because the one that garnished my drink was totally spot on. Foodwise, Woods and Davis have compiled a menu that celebrates sustainable local ingredients without being too explicit with the Canadian theme. That is, you're not going to find maple syrup, bacon and game meat in every menu description.  Rather, the dishes offer a generous range of seasonal ingredients prepared using both Canadian and Mediterranean influences, and are presented in palatable portions with elegance and restraint. It was certainly a tough call to choose, but with a little help from our server, we opted for:  Wild Digby Scallops with Parsnip Puree, Roasted Heirloom Garlic, Green Alder, Corned Beef Cheek ($17)  One of the best scallop dishes I've had in years. They were beautifully seared and buttery  inside with a fresh delicate flavour that was perfectly complemented by the sweet puree and garlic, and the salty chew of the beef cheek. We literally scraped our plate clean.  Venison Carpaccio with Black Trumpets, Wild Leek, Corn Nuts, Seedlings ($16)  The venison was meltingly tender and flawlessly seasoned, with enough pleasant gaminess going on to complement the umami-rich trumpets. And with all of the delicate textures on the plate, I loved the supple pop and crunch of the corn nuts in every bite. Really a nice light starter for sharing.  Roasted Muscovy Duck Breast with Tatsoi, Shallot, Sourdough, Crispy Confit, Dried Cherries, Duck Egg Bernaise ($28)  I always feel like I'm playing with fire when I order duck breast, because so often I'm presented with super chewy overcooked meat. But this one was so tender I hardly needed to use my knife, contrasting nicely with the chewy sweet cherries, and the crunchy buttery sourdough croutons.  I also appreciated that the mild mustard kick of the tatsoi helped offset the richness of the duck egg bernaise. A really well composed dish.  Spaghetti and Meatballs Stuffed with Pecorino Fresco, in Tomato Sauce with Toasted Basil Breadcrumbs ($22) ......."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service make it hard not to enjoy yourself at Woods Restaurant but I was underwhelmed by the food.  My main was the black cod.  It seems a bit too acidic for my taste and I have definitely had better prepared black cod.  The desert (doughnuts with chocolate sauce) was a disappointment as was the \"New Fashioned\" cocktail which was nicely mixed but ultimately ruined by a glass full those little hollow ice cubes which rapidly turned it into a watery mess.  My appetizer (scallops) was excellent which has me second guessing myself a little and maybe interested in giving it another try.  I probably won't choose to go back myself but if someone else picks it for a night I would not feel bad going back."}
{"text":"3.5/5! This is a very nice place for those interested in fine dining in the downtown core. The decor is beautiful (hence the name \"woods\") and the food is great. I recommend the apple martini cocktail. As for food- I recommend the black cod. The others also enjoyed their dishes: spaghetti & meatballs and the lamb burger. The only downside is the price point. It is a bit on the pricier side for the type of food but if you are celebrating a special occasion or date night this is definitely a good spot!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Everyone was nice and friendly. The food was awesome and the service as on point. :) looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Very quiet and beautiful atmosphere. My friend and I had the lamb burger. It was perfectly cooked. The staff were also very nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant has nice decor and is in a good location. We were greeted by a warm friendly hostess who took our jackets and sat us promptly.  Our waitress was not super friendly. They gave us a delicious amuse bouche to start. My wife ordered the Bison Short Ribs and they were fall off the bone however lacked flavour so she had to ask for salt & pepper which for a nice restaurant is a no no. I had the duck breast that again lacked flavour but the accompanying croutons and puree helped.  At the end of the meal they gave us a complimentary cheese plate as well as a chocolate and small sample of ice wine. All in all it was an ok experience although because of the bland food we sadly will not be returning."}
{"text":"Lorne was amazing.  Food was even better.  Elk cooked to perfection. Great space.  I am very picky and will definetly be coming back."}
{"text":"We did a client dinner here a couple nights ago. It was really nice. The food was a bit slow to come out (and the kitchen is in the basement, bit weird to see servers come up from the basement with your food). However, the quality and taste were good, staff was professional, attentive (only one person ordered something with fries, they brought extra for the table) and pleasant. And, given everything we ordered and the size of our party, was not overly expensive."}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant in the St Lawrence Market area. The entrance was quite hidden, thought I was walking into another building. The restaurant advertise as proudly Canadian - only use ingredients from locals in Canada. The menu had a lot of variety. I was in between a few items but end of selecting the ROASTED MUSCOVY DUCK BREAST with crispy confit, dried cherries and duck egg béarnaise. The sauce was sour and sweet from the dried cherries. The duck confit was really crispy and the duck breast itself was very tender. The dish was quite delicious.  We ended up sharing a dessert - RASPBERRY 'MACARONNADE' - Mascarpone Mousse, Basil Ice Cream, Macaroon, Raspberry Tuile, Textures Of raspberry, salted pine nuts. It was a raspberry mousse in a jar with basil ice cream on the side. They advertise on the menu that there is macaroon, didn't see one, maybe it is mixed in the mousse.  The service was great. Great atmosphere for catching up with friend, not too noisy."}
{"text":"I visited in Dec. 2013 with 3 other friends for our annual Christmas dinner.   The Woods Restaurant and Bar is an up-scale restaurant featuring many Canadian classics showcasing local ingredients all prepared beautifully. The food is crafted by Chef Bruce Woods and Chef Anthony Davis with menu items that include seared Quebec foie gras, Lake Huron pickeral, and wild Digby scallops.  The location of Woods is on Colbourne St, just off of King Station. Inside, there was a Canadian themed décor with a stunning large tree bark chandelier, large mirrors and dim lighting which provided a cozy, yet classy ambience.  We were seated at the back of the restaurant, which seemed to have less lighting than the rest of the restaurant. My friend had trouble seeing the menu clearly and had to bring out her flash-light to view the menu. I had to use flash on my camera for all my food pictures, so I hope my pictures will do the food justice.  Food:   I started off with the prime steak tartare for the appetizer which was accompanied with onion chips. The raw egg created a smooth consistency when mixed with the steak.  It was simple, delicious and fresh. The Dijon and shallots was not overpowering. Only thing was, the portion was a little small for me and I wanted more of it! Good thing the main course made up for the small appetizer.  For the main, I ordered one of their daily specials, which was the pappardelle (freshly made in-house) with wine braised venison, chestnuts and topped with a bit of goat Gouda and lots of shavings of black truffles. It was my first time having black truffles and it did not disappoint. The combination of ingredients created a rich, flavourful, hearty and delicious dish. It really hit the spot! I highly recommend this dish and I would go back for more.  My friends all enjoyed their meal as well. They ordered the tuna tartare (also a daily special), roasted Muscovy duck breast, yellowfish tuna and Pacific cod.   My friend mentioned the cod had a nice sear, yet the meat was tender and flavourful.  The drinks were well mixed, and accompanied my meal wonderfully. I ordered the cognac martini, red wine (I think it was with Ironwood Shiraz), and a bloody Caesar (I order a Caesar at almost every restaurant I go to!) The straws were cute, as they resembled the trunk of birch trees.  After dinner, I asked to see their private room.  To my surprise, I was greeted by the Chef/owner, Bruce Woods.  He was such a pleasure to meet as he was friendly, approachable and informative. The private room was gorgeous and was consistent with the décor of the restaurant and would be perfect for a special occasion. It seats about 14 people comfortably. Now, I need an occasion to book this room! Sorry, I forgot to take a picture.  Overall:   It is worth going to Woods Restaurant.  I enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. If I had to make one suggestion, it would be to make the portions a tad bigger, especially for big eaters like me."}
{"text":"We had a large group from my work come here for a holiday lunch so we had a prix fixe menu which contained items from their regular menu. My meal consisted of the organic Ontario green salad, Pacific black cod and cinnamon sugar donuts for dessert.   The service was very professional and classy, but didn't feel stuffy like some fancier restaurants. The atmosphere was bright and shabby chic.   Most importantly the food was delicious! The cod melted in my mouth! The donut serving was huge. It was too much for me to finish and I have a big appetite. The other options were chicken cordon bleu and the lamb burger. Nobody had a bad thing to say about their meal.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriends birthday. Service was terribly slow.  Food was ok. Small portions. I found the duck ($28) too salty. Steak ($35) was excellent.  When I mentioned it was his birthday to the waiter he responded 'Ya' then walked away  he later handed us the desert menus. I asked for the bill from another waiter and told him about the experience and he brought us doughnuts and desert drinks to make up for it. Desert was really good.    Overall, food ok (not worth spending the $ for a return) and service super slow but they tried to fix in the end."}
{"text":"I liked this place without loving it. I came here with work and we were placed in a private room. This part was great - music choice (jazzy) was excellent and the service he was terrific.  The food was only ok though. We have a fixed menu with items chosen from the main menu. The best part for me as the beef tartare - normally I prefer my tartare with ground beef rather than cubes but it was still delicious, especially because the wasabi flavour mixed with the home made sour and cream chips terrifically.  For my main I had the tuna. It came seared and served on a bed of potatoes. There was nothing wrong with it per se, only there was nothing special about the presentation and the potatoes were just kind of ordinary (I've had hash browns at brunch that were better). In short, I'd i had been paying for this meal myself I'd have called it overpriced.  For dessert we had a choice of raspberry flavoured moose with basil ice cream or mini donuts. I give credit for the basil ice cream - I didn't like the taste of it personally but withers did and I admire the ambition. The mini donuts were dry.  In short, Woods is a nice place to eat. The food is good but not spectacular given other choices nearby. ten years ago this place would have been considered great for Toronto standards but given the other options I would say it is simply good."}
{"text":"Mediocre and uninspired dishes made only worse by the size of the portions and high price tag, should rank Woods as your top 10 to skip while in Toronto. My first Yellowfin Tuna was served so well-done that it no longer resembled fish; how this even left the kitchen is beyond me, as they seemed to think I was crazy for not liking it this way. The second attempt, while cooked properly, had zero flavour and the sides (poignantly touted on the menu) were no where to be found. I paid $30 for two meagre slices of tuna that could have been a sashimi appetizer at your local sushi joint.   My girlfriend got served cod despite ordering duck, and aside from the over cooked duck breast she eventually received, her plate was bare aside from a few butter drenched croutons.   Highly disappointing and ridiculously overpriced for pub fare."}
{"text":"This restaurant was exactly what I wanted for a romantic birthday dinner with my boyfriend. The wait staff were exceptional and didn't miss a detail or a beat. We were offered free sparkling to start the night and a extra dessert with a lovely bday message. Food was all excellent and the additional amuse Bouche was delightful. When it was time to leave they offered us our coats and escorted us through the back alley way and in the back door to Pravda where we were served a free vodka cocktail. Live DJ, bongo and saxophone players mingled with the crowd. When we left we were pleased to see we didn't have to wait in the long line up that was formed. Perfect night!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday on September 27th, and I couldn't be happier with the resto pick. There was a group of 8 of us aged 25 and up. This place is so chique, everything impressed me. The food was fantastic, on top of it all.They have this great private room in the basement that was very cute. They gave me the front table under that fantastic/artsy twig chandelier and the girls loved it.  Pros - Everything! - Wait Staff was so friendly and great with recommendations - Drinks, seasonal and wine was very tasty - Food, all of it was savory - Interior decor was so cool and swanky. I loved being in there - Neighborhood is also pretty cool too and good for parking (St. Lawrence Market area) - walking distance to good bars too.   Cons - portions are on the small side  Keep up the good work guys, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Do I have an option to give zero or negative stars? We had one terrible server who would make condescending remarks every time we had a request. If you don't enjoy working with people or with food, get a job with revenue Canada!   The steak looked like it was M&M meat shops and the server left me with only a butter knife to cut the beef jerky....I mean steak that I ordered until I was almost finished eating my steak. When we received the bill, it was full of errors, and it got very tense trying to fix the error that was double billed on the servers end.   If you have a large group of 15+ people, highly recommend that you're better off getting better service at Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"After seeing Toronto Life put Woods on their top 10, I had pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, the best thing I can say about the restaurant is that I loved the decor. The service started off well with drinks and then our server disappeared for so long we eventually had to summon her over to place our order. Subsequent drink orders took a long time.  I started with oysters which were the tiniest ones I've ever seen. Then I had the scallops and the cod. I found the scallops under seasoned and the cod quite salty. One person has the smoked fish which they didn't like at all. Some of my party had the steak which they said was good. Desserts were just ok.  I expected a lot more from Woods. Can't say I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went for a celebratory dinner - service and food were very good. We started with cocktails, following with a nice red wine. Both of us had appetizers and mains - neither I nor my sister had any complaints. Food was flavourful, well presented and I don't think either one of us had anything left on our plates. I highly recommend Woods!"}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant is so beautiful! It's all dark (but not I-can't-read-the-menu-dark), modern, and love the woodsy-Canadiana theme going on with the signature glass and modern artwork. I loved the bar area, and thought to myself, if ever I was in the area and wanted to pop by for drinks, this would be it.  Unbeknownst to me, this used to be Colborne Lane. I never had the opp to try Chef Aprile's restaurant, but my fiancé (who I was with tonight) said it was an amazing experience. The space didn't really change, in fact, he thought I was bringing him back to the restaurant!  I was seated first towards the back of the restaurant - table by the wall. There are some nice corner tables for two for a truly romantic dinner. But, here at woods, the tables are spaced just right so you're not hearing your diners conversation.  Our server (didn't get his name) immediately came and asked if I wanted tap water (so no pressure to say no to bottled and feel cheapo - one star just for that!) He recommended a great Pinot Noir from Cali (La Crema) and the night started from there. I had the Foie gras (yum) and my SO had the Beet salad. For mains, he ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu (which is the restaurant's most popular dish) and I had the Cod. The chicken was really good and had the awesome crispy skin.  For desserts, we tried the Pavlova (my fave) and also had some type of chocolate cheesecake (a bit too rich for me, but I generally don't like cheesecake).  As the night progressed, all the tables were filled, so reservations recommended for a Sat. night. Again, this is a perfect date night place.  Great service. Great food. Great ambiance - a solid 4 stars in my books!"}
{"text":"Food, service, and ambience all deserve top marks. Pleasant surprise and underrated gem in Toronto. Easily a top 5 TO restaurant.  Only drawback: Lighting. Incredibly dark, and immediately noticeable. Easy to change to improve dining experience.  Service: Impeccable. They were there for us every step of the way, whenever we needed/wanted them. Our server was professional & friendly.  Raw oysters: my parents said some of the best in the city. Salmon tartare: Downside was that I wish had more. Wagyu beef carpaccio: A nice mild richness. Very good. Flatiron: Typically, not a cut I like, but they did this very nicely. Cod: Large and very very good. Pickerel: Typically, not a fish I like, but very good.  Beer on tap! We'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"I love the minimal scandinavian interior (and green accent pieces). The staff was fantastic - very welcoming.  Food was quite good (scallops, tuna tartar, carpaccio and spaghetti), but it didn't blow me away. The table favourite was the carpaccio.  The portion sizes on the mains was on the small side - particularly the heirloom vegetable dish, which was a joke. We thought they had made a mistake. We complained to our waiter and he handled it very well.  Because the service was so good, I'd give it another shot in a few weeks once they've settled in."}
{"text":"Best steak tartare I ever had. I was deeply impressed. Must try. I loved the atmosphere and servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"So happy we chose this place for lunch!  We were in Toronto for college spring vacation.  We wanted an upscale meal and decided here.  First off, there is a free coat check and free wifi.  Complimentary bread to start off, while we decided our appetizer and entrees.  We ordered the Steak Tartare to start, then the Haldimand Dry Aged Prime Flatiron and the Roasted Cauliflower Ravioli as our entrees.  Oh yeah, the cocktails were $10.  The food came out at a reasonable time.  The flatiron steak was... incredible.  Even the sauteed mushrooms and spinach.  There were also frites too, and we asked for ketchup.  They had housemade ketchup which isn't your classic American ketchup.  It had a slight tart flavor which reminded me of tamarind, still great tasting nonetheless.  My french cognac martini was nice too.  There was also complimentary chocolate truffles.  I haven't gotten to mention our servers, Michael and Ivan.  They had no hesitation in recommending the best bars, museums, or tourist sites.  Awesome service. This was the best meal I had in Toronto.  My bill came out to be about $45 CAD, not including tip."}
{"text":"Our group of four last night was very pleased with the meal and the service.    My meal consisted of beautifully prepared and supremely fresh Digby scallops, followed by a turbot special, and a sumptuous pavlova for dessert.    So much attention to detail with tastes, textures, and temperature.    Very reasonably priced wine list.  Exquisite service.  Can you believe that the chef here helps clear plates and fold napkins?  Such a pleasure to be in a restaurant that greets its customers warmly and sincerely and wishes them a pleasant goodnight on their way out.    Urbane, tasteful decor.  One drawback: no soft surfaces in the restaurant, so voices can boom and echo.  But not as loud as one may expect.  Will definitely return and explore Chef Bruce's other creations!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience at Woods Restaurant last night.  The restaurant space is beautiful. Located in a historic post-war building in the St. Lawrence Market area of downtown Toronto.  The server was professional and very attentive to everyone's needs; never an empty glass and allowed us as much time as we needed throughout the night.  I knew when I previewed the menu online that it would be fantastic and I will say that I was not disappointed! I chose the wild digby scallops to start, and the halibut as my main. Both dishes were prepared perfectly and the visual presentation beautiful.  The wine menu offered a good selection of wines, and the price ranges very reasonable.  For dessert, I had the carrot cake- which although a little dry- the flavor was good, and presentation beautiful.   I would highly recommend Woods to anyone and I will return again in the future!   Thank you Woods!"}
{"text":"Perhaps my expectations were too high. I read about Woods on a list of the top ten Toronto new restaurants of 2014; I was really excited to try it out.   My boyfriend and I liked the atmosphere. It's Rustic Chic. Distressed wood, modern lights. The tables are a comfortable distance apart. The music was a bit on the loud side, but we were sitting under a speaker.   The service was just okay. Our server took our order for appetizers and we told her we needed another minute. She didn't come back for ten minutes and we were surprised to learn she hadn't punched in our appetizers during that time.  The menu was a bit confused. Are these fancy tiny portions or is this comfort food?   We had: The steak tartar - nice and spicy. I didn't love that it came with sour cream and onion chips.   French onion soup - Good broth. Not to cheesy, which I like, but I don't know if it would appeal to most.   The Spaghetti and meatballs - This was very tasty. Pure comfort food--I don't know how well it jived with the other dishes on the menu. Also, I don't think it was worth the $22 price tag.   Yellow fin tuna - This was not nearly tasty enough to justify the tiny portion. It came on top of a mashed sweet potato patty, which was nothing special. The tuna itself was fine, a bit on the bland side. Nothing stood out about this dish.    My boyfriend and I both agreed Woods was nothing special and we don't think we would return. Had I not read hype about it, I still would not have been impressed."}
{"text":"An easy solid 4 stars.  I stopped by here for lunch on a weekday and was surprisingly greeted by an almost empty restaurant.  Only 1 server on deck for several tables.  Being the old colborne lane, I suppose there were some expectations.  The food here is excellent.  I was recommended the organic beet salad to start, which was a fresh and healthy suggestion to some of the other options.  The dressing did not overpower the sweetness of the purple and orange beets.  My colleague had the digby scallops which were small, but meaty.  Went with the roasted muscovy duck breast as my main.  Absolutely delicious.  The bernaise type sauce it comes with is a clash of flavours and went amazing with the duck.  The breast itself was generous and cooked perfectly and juicy.  There are also a number of seafood items on the menu that look to be worth trying if I return.  The cocktails are only $10.  I had the new fashioned and woods boulevardier.  The new fashioned is a great twist on the old fashioned while the boulevardier is more of a sweet cocktail (vermouth).  I definitely recommend the new fashioned.  Service was good but on the slow side - evidenced by one waiter who was waiting tables, running food and also the bartender.  He was polite and I don't blame him, but our cocktails took 15 minutes to arrive.  I'd return to The Woods.  It's expensive, but a great spot for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a hidden gem, intimate and perfect for a romantic dinner. The interior is a mix of industrial rustic styling, both warm and interesting.   We went in to have a sample meal in order to decide if we were going to host our wedding at Woods.  We were particularly interested in trying this Canadian themed menu and came with high expectations.  Head Chef Carlos De Veyra took exceptional care of us giving a sampler meal that both surprised and delighted us. Each course that appeared was more beautiful than the last, and each bite was more tasty.   The service from entrance to exit was seamless and well executed. We are beyond thrilled to be hosting our upcoming nuptials at Woods and expect our guests will be wowed by this memorable find."}
{"text":"Old Town has needed a little rejuvenation when it comes to quality restaurants for some time, and Bruce Woods (formerly of Modus) has answered that calling.  Woods makes the transition from chef to restauranteur seem effortless as he leaves no detail behind.  I'm sure having Anthony Davis (formerly of Sidecar) in the kitchen also puts his mind at ease.  WOODS is located in the former Colborne Lane space. High ceilings, exposed brick and large windows make the space inviting.  A white, rippled wall serves as the backdrop to the bar which leads into the dining room with tree-themed banquettes.  The focal point, an elaborate green, \"branch\" chandelier brings life and colour to the space as quiet lounge music plays in the background to allow for gentle conversation.  The menu exemplifies farm-to-table and is a \"greatest hits\" compilation from both Woods and Davis' prior stints.  Even the water is sourced locally from Caledon, Ontario.  Familiar items such as wild Digby scallops served with corned beef cheeks,  parsnip purée, maple-mustard vinaigrette + lemon balm showcase Davis' mastery in the kitchen.  The blank dishes serve as a canvas for the beautifully plated dishes such as the melt-in-your-mouth Québec Foie Gras with purple potato, bacon, + Saskatoon berry compote.  Those looking for a lighter option can seek comforts in the Yellowfin Tuna served atop a bed of crunchy wheat berry + green olive salad, sundried tomato + English pea purée.  Do save some room for dessert as the Raspberry \"Macaronnade\" is simply luscious.  A light and airy Mascarpone mousse is interlaced in raspberry and served with a side of refreshing basil ice cream.  Davis definitely has fun in the kitchen as he presents raspberries in various textures (gel + tuille).  The wine list is a refined selection of local and imported pours with amarones, barolos and chardonnays.  The beer list is comprised of Canadian microbrews.  While this is a tree-themed restaurant you'll be glad to know that nothing is forbidden, though I believe gluttony is mentioned in Dante's Inferno - at least I'll die happy!  *Please note that all posts contained in the #FoodForFodor series contain my own opinions and does not represent and is in no way affiliated with the views of Fodor's.

{"text":"Great dining experience at Woods. Would definitely visit again  Food: 4.5/5 loved the food here. Most memorable dishes were deconstructed s'mores and scallop appetizer. I got the bison rib for main (I found it a bit too salty. But it was fall off the bone and soo tender)  Service: 5/5 The staff were friendly and attentive. Giving us refills on our bread (lol I was starving). Made excellent menu recommendations. Was knowledgable of ingredients / addressed our allergy concerns confidently   Ambiance: 5/5 Wicked \"woods\" decor. Beautiful tree root chandelier. Gorgeous tree cross section tables. Cool bathrooms.   Reservations: 5/5 easy! Made reservations via open table.. it was a big raptors game night so it was quite empty. Got complimentary Rockefeller oysters (amazing !!), not sure if it was correlated to open table reso"}
{"text":"Finally made reservations at this adorable, smaller restaurant, hidden amongst the plethora options.   It has a cute, fair size bar to sit at and grab drinks and appetizers, or, depending on the day, you can grab a table without reservations.   The McManis Pinot Noir is always a solid choice by the glass and I had the duck breast as my entree. It was very well prepared and tasty.   My friend had the lamb burger and also provided good reviews.   I'd definitely return to try the steak, or the cod. They both sounded very appealing! :)"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow a first. We had to wait about 20 mins past our reservation time to get a table. However, it was nothing but fantastic after that. Great meal, great service, and a hearty wine list. The staff went above and beyond to make sure it was a great night."}
{"text":"Came here for a networking session and dinner, not really knowing what to expect.  I cannot say enough good things about the service here. I was helped with my coat and bag as soon as I got here, and handed a glass of wine (always a good thing in my books). During dinner, drinks were constantly flowing, and the servers left us to our conversations but were always helpful if we needed anything.  For food, I decided on the Ontario Green Salad for my starter, the mushroom risotto for my main, and the Woods Smores dessert. The dressing for the salad was an ice wine vinaigrette, very Canadian and very creative. The risotto was pretty good (although I would have ordered the cordon bleu if I had read other Yelp reviews haha), but I have to give a shout out to the S'mores dessert, which was truly a chocolate-lover's dream. Although I thought it would have been more authentic to its name if it had more of a fire-roasted taste, I definitely enjoyed it thoroughly.  Thanks Woods for the great first visit, I will be saving up my money to be back!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy restaurant. Great place to catch up over food and drinks. You can actually hear the person talk since the music stays subtly in the background.  It's definitely a place where you would impress your date/guest with.   The servers are knowledgeable of their menus and drinks.

{"text":"Everything about Woods--the succulent food, the ambience, and the attentive staff--helped make my first date with a gorgeous man that much more spectacular.   Our server Jarda (Jerry) was unbelievably friendly, went through the entire menu to highlight all gluten-free options succinctly, and served our food promptly with care. These small series of kind gestures added to an incredible overall experience and soon-to-be returning customer.  Highly recommend the \"wild digby scallops,\" organic Ontario green salad,\" and \"Pacific Halibut\" and fried kale."}
{"text":"Sexy, post-industrial room. Charming staff. Generous charcuterie platter, intriguing duck confit. Go ahead and try an Ontario wine."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, waiter was very nice and knowledgable. I had the smoked elk carpaccio, very good. For desert I tried the semifreddo, wow and the presentation was amazing. My first impression of Woods was very positive, I would go back for another meal and explore the menu."}
{"text":"Great upscale casual date night place. Started with the Elk Carpaccio, entrées were NY striploin and duck, finished with the Woods S'more. We both loved everything. Portions were exactly right, service was phenomenal, ambiance was perfect. One of the best parts was knowing that the restaurant uses local sustainable food and has some excellent local wine choices. I would definitely come back (if I wasn't just here for the weekend)."}
{"text":"The Manhattan's  are delicious. Made with honey and a local rye whiskey. The steak tartar was above average - hand made chips with a quail egg. Could have used more lemon and seasoning though. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the corn salsa was amazing. Steak was exceptional and the duck was to die for. Everything local!!! The staff were well trained but inexperienced. A little attitude from one of the young ladies didn't put me off though. The dessert was the highlight of this meal. Order the pavlova and the turnovers. You will not be disappointed. This restaurant features Chef Bruce Woods along with a couple investors. They created a nice ambiance in a great location. Staff informed me Bruce is no longer a part of the kitchen as of days ago (March 17/2014). His wife, the pastry chef is on maternity leave. The food is still good but who knows for how long. I recommend this restaurant for the desserts alone. They were truly incredible."}
{"text":"Romantic setting, great service, good food, really, really, really small portions."}
{"text":"Had a great time for our anniversary dinner; the staff were courteous, attentive, and offered great advice on the dishes. The food was terrific - we had the steak frites, tuna carpaccio, and a charcuterie spread along with drinks and everything was fresh and amazing. The setting was perfect for a date and the fact that the surrounding neighbourhood was surprisingly very quiet for a downtown location just made it that much better. Would definitely recommend it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is an upscale establishment with an attitude to match. We went here for dinner and the service was both inattentive and condescending. All the tables around us got much better service. I guess if you're the type of person who doesn't look like they're going to tip well you don't get quality service. Had to try to flag waiters repeatedly before they noticed us. I made a point to tip 17% but they didn't even deserve a quarter of that.   If you wanna spend 150 bucks to be looked down upon, this is the spot to go.  Sad as the food was quite good."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 on this one.   Went for our anniversary dinner on a Friday night. Took an early seating because I was jet lagged. Was surprised at how dead the place was given the downtown location.  They haven't changed the look too much since the previous restaurant but definitely freshened it up. Cool space with exposed wood and high ceilings.   Overall we had a great experience and I would recommend as an option for work dinners or similar. Still something was not quite confident or killing it about this one. As a result I have to say I am struggling to agree with Toronto Life on its pick for Top 10.   Pros: - great service. From start to finish the whole team was amazing. The owner was there and on top of the room, his team cared and went out of their way - loved some of the small touches. The menus we nicely bound in cork imprinted leather, the nod to Canadian wines & local produce, the truffles to end the meal were off the hook - the beet salad was delish and a few of our other dishes showed creativity   Cons:  - slightly lame crowd. Even as we were leaving at 8 there was no buzz on a Friday night.  Extra surprising given the Pravda connection - did not like the spaghetti at all. Under salted and mushy. Also the spinach on the side of our steak was not well executed."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I found this restaurant!  I was looking for a nice restaurant to celebrate my anniversary while I was in Toronto.  After a long stressful day, I was able to unwind with a nice bottle of wine and excellent meal.  Our waiter Loren was awesome!   He gave excellent recommendations on the wine and helped guide me in my selection of my entree.  As a visitor to Toronto, I asked about things to do in the area.  Loren gave us some great tips and places to visit too.  I am so glad that I've been able to dine here!  The artisanal charcuterie was so goo!  Excellent selection of meats   The watermelon salad was so refreshing.  The lamb chops and chicken cordon bleu were so good.   If you have room for dessert, order the the donuts and chocolate sauce!  Will be back next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience! From the food, to the service! So welcoming and engaging! What a lovely experience!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this restaurant.  I was brought here for my birthday dinner after our happy-hour drink at Pravda Vodka Bar.  What a coincident, both places are running by the same owner.  It is a very cozy restaurant.  The server was kind enough to bring us to a corner table at the back, so we could quietly enjoy our dinner.  However, I would say that was possibly the darkest corner in the whole restaurant.  Reading my menu was not fun.  It was also too dark to even take a nice picture.  It is my only complain about the whole experience.  Besides, this place has good food and good service.  The restaurant was even nice enough to give us two glasses of complimentary champagne once we sat down as my birthday celebration:)   The cake was nicely decorated with a birthday candle (so at least I could take a photo of my cake lol).  The nanaimo bar cheesecake was very special and yummy!"}
{"text":"Great presentation, decor and service but for the price I would have expected more balanced dishes. The duck was served on a bed of something deep fried and there was no sauce or complementary flavors of any sort. One could barely taste the dried cherries. My boyfriend had the steak which was decent but the sauce and accompanying veg were somewhat pedestrian. I probably wouldn't come back. Service was really amazing though! Congrats to the front of house staff!"}
{"text":"A gem of a find and one of my new favourite restaurant in Toronto! Woods is a intimate and beautifully decorated tucked away on a small street. Service was top notch and the food beautifully presented and utterly delicious. Every dish we ordered was tasteful and well prepared. We were served two kinds of bread with whipped butter. My friend and I shared the diver scallop appetizer. For our mains, my friend ordered the seared tuna and I ordered the duck breast. Note that the restaurant will take its time to serve your order, I consider this a positive. There is no rush to eat and leave and instead leaves you feeling relaxed and there to   enjoy the dining experience. It's a wonderful place for date night and with dinner with friends and colleagues alike. I will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy woods theme decor. \"Mostly farm-to-table\" cooking. Two pieces of housemade bread to start & I had a glass of the California Pinot Noir.  I enjoyed the Scallops as my starter - 2 large scallops, seared a little rare, great with the salsa verde. The tuna tartare was a bit mushy and didn't have much taste.   For main, I enjoyed the Duck Breast - great flavour, but on the rare side. Great pairing with the dried cherries and crispy shallot. The steak, ordered medium rare, was a little tough and dry on the edges, but juicier in the middle. The brussels sprouts and mushrooms were great; the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside!  There was a survey going on at the time we went which gave us 2 x $40 vouchers... so needless to say this was a great deal & meal!"}
{"text":"I found the place overrated, the food underwhelming and overpriced, and the portions small. In fact, the scallops that we were most excited to try seem to have gone from 3 for $17 down to 2 for $17. They were tasty but hardly worth it. The steak was thin and fine. No complaints or real praise. The pickerel was sort of nice but bland and unmemorable. Desserts looked good but they didn't have the Maple Cheesecake that is on their online menu, so we skipped it."}
{"text":"I was completely amazed at the dinner my boyfriend and I had here last night. Everything was impeccable - from the wine, to the appetizer, to the main dish, to the phenomenal service and the extremely relaxing ambiance. We started with the green salad which had the freshest greens I have had in a long time. The ice wine vinaigrette was perfectly balanced with the cheese and pecans. For the main dishes, I had the pumpkin ravioli and my boyfriend had the short ribs. Both were cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious.   The server was extremely friendly and was by far the best server I have had in a long time. He brought us little bite size appetizers on the house and while I was the only one who ordered the salad, he brought my boyfriend a small taster as well so he wouldn't be left out. He also found out we had been icee one tasting earlier in the day, and brought us out a sampler (also on the house) at the end of our meal. I have never been so impressed with a restaurant. If you want a meal of a life time, I highly recommend coming to Woods."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and  crowd is mixed. We had a reservation for 8 PM on a Thursday night. We arrived 10 minutes before and the hostess told us that our reservation was for 8:15 which was not true because i booked it and said 8 PM. She said we can only sit in the lounge area where we can only have drinks, no appetizers. This was a completely wasted birthday dinner. It was 8:23 PM we decided to leave since there was no signs of that table being available. When the hostess realized that we are leaving she said she can offer us crackers!?!? :) Anyways the manager was there and saw the whole thing, didn't say anything seemed he didn't care. Food might be good, I can't say but service was horrible. It on of those cool, fancy looking places that you go in but the staff is cold and arrogant and you just want to get up and leave."}
{"text":"We went for a late dinner after a show at the nearby Sony Centre. The service was very good and attentive. The atmosphere was cool and romantic. We had the Cordon Bleu and the Spaghetti and Meatballs. I would highly recommend the spaghetti and meatballs, the only thing holding me back from 5 stars was the Cordon Bleu which was a little bland. For dessert we had the nanaimo cheesecake which was excellent. I would definitely recommend Woods for a nice dinner date."}
{"text":"For months, I've been craving a good duck breast: one of my favorite dishes (tragically, unavailable back home in Phoenix, AZ). Woods did far more than simply satisfy that craving. They provided me with the perfect dining experience. The restaurant is tucked away on a side street that doesn't see much foot traffic. This makes it a bit more difficult to find, but also contributes to its mystique. When I arrived, I was warmly greeted by a very attractive hostess, who also served as my waitress. She sat me in a location which gave me a perfect view of the interesting, and tasteful, contemporary decor. Being a Monday night, it wasn't at all busy; but the service was spectacular: I had both the hostess and another waiter taking care of me, ensuring that I had all that I wanted, and more. Having decided my selection in advance (I did quite a bit of Yelp research trying to find the ultimate Toronto duck), I ordered right away. \"No appetizer needed\" I said, \"I'm just here for the duck.\" Well, they brought me a small complementary appetizer anyway: a small cube of watermelon with goat cheese, arugula, and something else I can't recall. It was most refreshing. Although I must admit that the duck was not the best I've ever had -- an honor which goes to a spectacular corner pub in Nancy, a small town in northeastern France -- it was a close second. The staff tempted me with dessert, but I rejected the temptation, being only in the mood for espresso. The chef clearly doesn't accept rejection well: yet again, they brought out a small complementary dish, this time it was a chocolate truffle with walnuts, presented on a beautiful stone slate.I left the restaurant completely blown away. I will certainly return to Woods the next time I'm Toronto: their combination of flavor and aesthetics has set a new standard."}
{"text":"I booked the downstairs private party room for my husband's 30th birthday. We were greeted promptly and escorted down by a friendly front desk staff (good start!). Our waitress came down to offer us drinks and show us the menu (still good!). Then things started to go downhill. It took forever for our waitress to come to take our drink and food orders. Then it was a long time for our food to arrive (50 minutes). My husband is allergic to nuts we tend to avoid them (call me crazy, but I like to kiss my husband and not kill him). So when I saw my dish contained nuts so I asked them to leave them off and explained why. It came with nuts and they had to remake it, which meant I was the only one not eating for another 20 minutes. I called ahead to ensure that the one vegetarian in our group would have options as their menu is meat-heavy and they said they \"had a separate menu for vegetarian guests\". They didn't. They only offered one modified (lame) pasta dish. Everyone agreed the food was ho-hum at best, which made me feel like a not-so-good wife for booking there in the first place. The dinner went so far over the allotted time that I had to leave my guests to get to SPiN so we wouldn't lose our reservation (FYI - SPiN was awesome; see my review for details). We ended the night at Tallboys Craft Beer House (also awesome; see my review for additional info). Thank goodness for SPiN and Tallboys or I would've blown my lovely husband's 30th birthday bash. Toronto is full of great restos at all price points that offer thoughtful food and stellar service - give this place a pass and take your hard-earned dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant hidden in the bustle and hustle of downtown. The decor is wood-themed and gives a bit of countryside vibe. It is spacious and great for group dinners.  Came here with a group of friends on a weekend and we were seated towards the back of the restaurant. The servers were friendly and attentive. Only half the table ordered appetizers and they brought extra salad for the rest of the table. We were impressed. Overall everyone enjoyed the food and will definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"I want to love every inch of Woods, but i just can't bring myself to it. Only because i went in with expectations.  When you've got Bruce Wood (Modus), Robin Singh (Pravda) and Anthony Davis (Sidecar), you're expectations are to be blown away. When you take over Colborne Lane's old spot, the pressure is intensified.  Overall, the food was great, the drinks were excellent and the service was extremely warm.The place pretty much looks exactly like Colborne Lane did, just minus the regal elegance and replaced with rustic chic.  The service staff are all extremely well picked - Robin's presence and service knowledge resonates in his staff. As a week old new restaurant, you slightly feel the awkwardness of servers getting to know their space, but that will soon subside. In terms of food, almost everything i had tasted great. The drink list, wine list and cocktail list is excellent as well. I was delighted to see 18 year glen on the menu only for $16 a shot. Such great value there in the drinks.   So why doesn't this place have that wow factor yet. At the price point they are targeting, here are a few of my observations:  - Food isn't very seasonal at all despite it's promise to be exactly that. - They have to work a bit on their protein in the main dishes. I had the duck and the dry aged ribeye. Both were great in flavour, but tough/chewy in texture. The duck's fat was clearly rendered too fast, drying it out slightly and the aged rib eye, well that should just sing for itself so i'm not quite sure what happened there. And i know Anthony Davis knows how to work with duck, so i suspect this might just be opening glitches.  - Appetizers are stellar. I had the tuna, the scallops and the venison capraccio. While all of them highlighted the protein really well, the rest of the plate was a little confusing (with the exception of the tuna). For example, the carpaccio has spicy cajun corn nuggets on it that overwhelms all flavours in the dish. Doesn't belong but the carpaccio itself was very well prepared.  - Desserts really didn't have any wow factor. I hope they fix this soon. Mousse, brownie, pecan tart, etc. I want to see something new and innovative from Bruce Wood personally, not just fresh takes on old classics.  - The furniture is extremely uncomfortable. Looks great, but those chairs need to go.   I'll be back -  I want to give this place a couple of months before i consider it again. In the meantime, i expect this place will only get better. They have an A-team.    Best thing about the meal: Braised lettuce. Genius."}
{"text":"Really disappointing service. Arrived early for a reservation to have a drink and my group waited far to long to order drinks, be served, then seated at a table over 30 minutes after our reservation time. Staff seemed out of it throughout the night and didn't acknowledge this odd behaviour.  Food was excellent but I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First and foremost the service is simply FIRST RATE.  I haven't had such good service in such a long time I almost forgot what it was like.  The food was excellent and the prices were reasonable.  I am not sure what else you would ask for.  Great spot for quiet financial district lunch."}
{"text":"My friend and had a wonderful lunch at Woods Restaurant at the end of March.  We loved the elegant yet earthy decor and the attention to detail.  It made for a very pleasant dining experience.        We shared the scallops and foie gras to start.  The scallop portion was on the small side (3 on a plate) but they were delicious.  The foie gras was amazing!  Some of the best I've ever had and the portion size was surprisingly generous.    My friend had the roasted Muscovy duck breast and I had the Pacific Cod.  Both were excellent - perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.    We had a little room left for dessert so we ordered the Pavlova (a work of art on a plate - I posted a picture) and the maple tart which was so rich we couldn't finish.    We will most definitely be back to Woods."}
{"text":"I heard great things about Woods Restaurant so I was very excited to try this place. When we got there around 6 pm the place was pretty empty. We're thinking it's because it's early. Nope, the entire night the place was pretty much empty. I seriously do not know why!!  Our server was amazing I think he might be a chef on the side. The way he was describing each item on the menu it's like he was cooking it himself. We ended up going with his recommendation, the best duck I've ever had, ever! We started off with the charcuterie board with had a mixture of different smoked meat, some crackers, and duck pate. So yummy. They gave us complimentary bruschetta but it taste way better than normal bruschetta and more flavourful. Our duck was perfectly cooked at medium rare on a bed of leaves and small croutons with fried duck meat. Every slice was tender and flavourful and melted in your mouth. Amazing!!  We had the woods donuts with chocolate sauce for dessert, so good. My friend had the woods s'mores. Amazing! They gave us some complimentary mint infused marshmallows. Also complimentary Pinot Grigio wine and they even offered to pay for our first round at the Pravda Vodka lounge down the street which they apparently own!  I really can't stop raving about the food and can't wait to come back again. The service was above and amazing. There were 2 servers always there to explain what the items were. They change our cutlery after every course! All in all Woods exceeded my expectations and then some. Seriously not sure why this place is not packed. Even the price is reasonable for what you get. If I can give this restaurant a 10 star out of 5 I would. Thank you Woods Restaurant for going above and beyond for your customers and making our dining experience an amazing one:) I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Clean and stylish decor.  Professional staff.  Delicious dishes.  It's not the hardiest of portioning, but really how much duck can one mow down?  Especially after charcuterie apps and an anti-gout salad. We had a private room in a surprisingly cozy basement cavern ... And streamed the money fight boxing, and cast to their big screen.  I must say we rocked very well on this fine evening."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day and was really impressed! I had the organic beet salad to start, which was made with a variety of types and textures of beets with feta cheese - it was a nice twist on the old, overdone beet salad. He had the charcuterie board and really enjoyed it as well... until I told him he was eating fatty duck liver, that is. After that revelation he avoided the foie gras. Good thing I didn't tell him what the head cheese really was!   For our entrees I had the pickerel with wild rice risotto and kale. The flavours were fantastic! I really liked the addition of plump dried fruit to the plate. He had the chicken cordon bleu and gave it rave reviews.   The maple sugar pie with nutmeg ice cream was easily the best part of the meal - we demolished it in less than 2 minutes! The cinnamon sugar donuts with chocolate dipping sauce paled in comparison, but were still good.  Also of note is the restaurant's decor, which consists of wood floors, exposed brick walls, and chic black and white accents. It gives it a moody but relaxed atmosphere - perfect for a special date night!"}
{"text":"I was here for a good friend's birthday in August 2014.   I only had drinks and apps but the experience was great.  It's a refined venue with a great ambiance, superb service and organic decor.  I had the steak tartar and it was amazing!  It comes with potato chips and a raw egg on top of the steak tartar.  I absolutely love steak tartar and the one they serve here is beyond par!    The wine by glass here is a little underwhelming when it comes to chardonnay but I preferred the local offering ($10) better than the European ($15) option.  The service and ambiance was amazing and I would definitely recommend this venue for a date or any intimate gathering."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to come to Woods Restaurant (@woodstoronto) since AKS event here and I had change our reservation several time due to our schedule. We finally made it there the day before Ben's birthday this past Friday. Somehow they have been following me on twitter and learn about his bday, Chef Bruce Woods (formally Brasaii, Centro & Modus) kindly greeted us with Sparkling Wine as we sat down.   With a quick one-month renovation from the former Colborne Lane space, the high ceiling, exposed brick with wooden theme throughout the space. The space was very inviting especially with the large windows that bring in some natural light. Very elegant and yet has an organic feel to it   The wine list range from local to imports and are all very reasonably priced form $10-15 a glass and most bottles from $40-75 while some pricier ones like a $380 Tuscan Red is also available. While the beer list are mostly local Canadian microbrews.  Cabernet Sauvignon 2008 Crew (Ontario) $65 We originally wanted to go with a safe one from Tawse that we had before but our server suggested this one saying that it's one of his favorite. I am surprise that he notice that we wanted something local and suggest an Ontario wine to us. Never heard of this winery before but love the strong robust flavor of this wine with a rather chewy tannis finish. Loved it so much that we are tempted to go to the winery one day.  Yes, I know it's a boring picture of a piece of bread but I just wanted to mention that they made their this sour dough bread in house and it was so good that I think I had at least 3 slices.    Seared Quebec Foie Gras $19 ~ Purple potato puree, lobster mushrooms, bacon crispy confit, Saskatoon Compote ~  I can never resist ordering foie gras each time I see it on the menu and this was no exception.  ~ Not only was it cook perfectly but doesn't it look so pretty with the purple potato puree, the greens on the blank white plate... it's like a piece of art work.   Venison Carpaccio $16 ~ Black Trumpets, Wild Leek, Corn Nuts, Seedlings ~  We were pleasantly surprise at how tender this venison can be, it was perfectly seasoned with the right amount of gaminess to it which was further complimented by the trumpets and the crunchiness of the corn nuts.  ~ Ben is having a really tough time forgetting this =P  The most delicious Mini Hot Dog you can ever have.... perfect crispy casing, perfect flavor, perfect sweet relish and a perfect toasted soft pillowy roll. Thanks Chef for this amazing fun amuse.  Roasted Muscovy Duck Breast $28 ~ Tatsoi, shallot, sourdough croutons, crispy confit, dried cherries, duck egg béarnaise ~ This was cook so perfect, just how I like it since I do find it overcook and chewy in a lot of places.  ~ The duck itself was very lightly seasoned which work here so that I can taste the natural duck flavor which was further complimented by the tart cherries and slight mustard-y kick from the tatsoi.  Chicken Cordon Blue $26 ~ Prosciutto cotto, monforte paradiso, chicken jus, Jerusalem artichoke, roasted pepper & black olive salad  ~ Ben was so tempted to order the steak and chose this one instead since chicken tends to take more skills to cook than steak.  ~ This was no disappointment, although being all white chick breast meat it was tender and juicy with a thin crispy outer layer. ~  It was perfect with the intense chicken jus and the olives salad on the side.   Buckthorn Pavlova $11 ~ Buckthorn curd, milk chocolate ganache, black sesame ice cream  ~ What a cute presentation and thanks for doing this even though I didn't requested it (^_^) ~ Even though it was so pretty and we weren't sure if we should dig in, we eventually did after admiring it for a minute and everything on this dish (except for the candle) was so delicious.   Raspberry Macaronnade $11 ~ Mascarpone mousse, basil ice cream, macaroon, raspberry tuile, texture of raspberry, salted pine nuts ~ The smooth and light mousse was interlace with raspberry coulis was just a beauty in the Manson jar with all the raspberry seeds peeking through. ~ I also love how the use the jar lid to hold the ice cream but presentation aside, the basil ice cream can easily hold it's own ground and need I say extra bonus point from me since I love basil (yes, I love it so much that I can munch on it). ~ This is the perfect summer dessert, light and not overly sweet with a fresh outdoor airy feel to it.   Verdict : ~ Haven't had such a fantastic meal from start to finish for a long time. ~ Great friendly, attentive and knowledgeable service ~ Great tasting and Great presentations  ~ Great spacious settings, def no listening to next table conversation. ~  I already miss this place and hopefully I will go back soon."}
