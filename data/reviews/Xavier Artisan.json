{"text":"Cute cafe. Good coffee and sandwiches.  Good spot for a quick bite. Right in the middle of town.  They take credit cards."}
{"text":"Very cute little shop and friendly staff. Enjoyed the ice cream - as mentioned in the comments, they'll encourage you to try out different flavors to find the one you want."}
{"text":"Nice place in Old Montreal, came in for a drink/ some gelato/ and to buy maple butter. Drink and gelato (lemon basil) were ok, can't wait to crack open the jar of maple butter -  it looks very good and is well well priced."}
{"text":"I dropped in after visiting the Notre Dame a Basilica.the cafe Latte was tasty and the calm atmosphere was welcome. They have free wifi that is fast and easy to connect. The staff was friendly and greeted me with smiles. My croissant was warm and fluffy, not chewy. I highly recommend the place to rest your feet, enjoy life, and relax."}
{"text":"Café bien situé, en face de la Place d'Armes. Je viens très régulièrement, si ce n'est pour dire tous les jours car je travaille juste en face. Les cafés sont bons, et les sandwichs excellentes. Prix très abordables, frais du jour et assez copieuses. Cependant, si vous pouvez, évitez les heures de pointes telles que le matin à 9h ou durant l'heure de lunch car les employés ont encore du mal à s'organiser. Très souvent, ils oublient les commandes, ou trainent à servir. Faut être patients, à 2-3 reprises, on m'a offert une viennoiserie ou le café gratuit pour m'avoir fait patienter plus de 10min pour un café. Sinon, oui je suggère cette place, car ils ont de bons produits et c'est un bon environnement pour travailler. De plus, dernièrement ils distribuent beaucoup de coupons rabais à la sortie du métro et dans les environs du café pour attirer les clients. Le café régulier revient à 1$ et les cafés spéciaux à 1,75$ tax incluses."}
{"text":"Beau café situé dans le quartier du Vieux Port, donnant directement sur la Place d'Armes. Nous l'avons essayé par un jour de beau temps qui appelait le chaland a se reposer sur une terrasse a ne rien faire. Nous avons choisi Xavier car cela faisait de nombreuses fois que nous passions devant sans trouver une bonne excuse pour nous y arrêter. Donc beau temps oblige, nous avons décidé de l'essayer pour manger une glace en terrasse. Il faut rentrer pour commander et si vous souhaitez manger en terrasse ils vous preparerons un cabaret. Comme nous allions rester sur place, tout nous a été servi dans de vrais bols et tasses, pas de la vaisselle jetable, ce qui est tres appreciable et beaucoup plus ecolo ;)
Nous sommes arrivés en fin de journée et d'autres pesonnes avaient eu la même idée que nous et le rayon des glaces et sorbet avait été dévalisé. Comme c'est fait maison, il ne suffisait pas juste de reprendre un pot au fond du congélateur pour remplir la vitrine et nous avons donc choisi parmi les parfums restants. Citron et basilic et pamplemousse. Sorbets tres rafraichissants, servis sobrement dans une coupe blanche. J'ai egalement pris un thé servi dans un grand mug blanc. Et nous nous sommes posées sur la terrasse. La place d'Armes etait pleine et des artistes chantaient et faisaient de la musique ce qui a rajouté au charme de notre détente en teerrasse. Nous y avons passé un très agreable moment et je serai tentée de revenir pour le midi ou pour goûter l'une de leurs soupes ou salade qui avait l'air tres bonne.
Pour 2 boules de glace et un thé de taille moyenne nous en avons eu pour environ 10$. 
L'intérieur a l'air bien reposant aussi et les serveurs étaient vraiment sympa."}
{"text":"J'ai la chance d'avoir ce petit cafe dans l'immeuble ou je travail ! Je suis toujours heureux d'aller chercher mon cafe a cette endroit le matin, car il est excellent et le service est toujours parfait ! 

Vous devez absolument essayer le croissant au amande il est incroyable !"}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches with a gourmet twist paired with awesome service. I come here almost every day for a quick lunch ; they use high quality ingredients only!"}
{"text":"Ingredients are good quality, but the smoked meat sandwich really needs more meat, I felt I didn't get my money's worth; I'll try the chicken sandwich next time. 

I am giving them a second chance because I was a regular back when they were a little shop nearby, and because my usual place is closed for a few weeks. 

Service is still very good."}
{"text":"Tomber dessus par hasard. C'est une agréable surprise. Même si le choix de sandwich était faible vu l'heure qu'il était c'est tout à fait normale. Mon choix c'est tourné sur le BLT et la mais que vous dire je voudrais en manger un autre aujourd'hui tellement il était bon. Le pain croustillant mais vraiment pas bourratif. Le bacon pas gras. La tomate fraîche et la salade frisée c'est juste délicieux et la sauce je ne vous en parle même pas ! 
Pour accompagner je me suis laissée tenter par un brownie maison qui sent bon le chocolat et qui est vraiment fait maison. 
Le petit bémol et qui enlève un peu du charme c'est les tasses et les assiettes en plastique. Je sais moins de manuvre et tout mais vu le charme du local se serait juste parfait. 
Allez y vous ne serez pas desssus. La prochaine fois je teste la limonade maison."}
{"text":"Ehh? Three stars at best for this quick sandwich shop. Two sandwiches and a coffee for $20. seems a little steep but it is located in front of Notre Dame Cathedral. Sandwiches were pre-made, then toasted. My ham and cheese croissant was a little better than Dunkin Donuts, but not by much. We were rushing and in danger of getting hangry (hungry angry) so it was ok for a quick stop but would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Unassuming, quiet corner eatery in an historic inn on the Montreal waterfront.Friendly service, tasty food. Limited fare, but every choice is a hit. My selection was a grilled veggie sandwich with chevre on pumpernickel. Delicious! Pear-vanilla green tea hit the spot on a cold day. Free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Pretty place and lovely cafe right off of the Norte Dame Basilica. Had a chocolatine and it was filled with the perfect amount of chocolate."}
{"text":"They've set it up in a *very* pretty way. High ceilings, very clean, love the decor, service is good. But it's the sort of ambiance that lends itself better to lunch than a coffee - I got an iced tea (would recommend, btw, with the honey), but found the space rather too cold and still to be good for working. Location is lovely, of course!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Spring Hill Suites nearby....

Like a typical bloke.

The coffee at the Spring Hill Suites, was so bad it was almost undrinkable.

On my last moanin' in Montreal I walked on over to this Xavier place...  Because I saw from the day before they had croissant and pain au chocolat....  Which in Paris I love.  So I was hoping this joint was doing at least ayight...

Yeah so the next moanin' I went back, and everything was just fine...  Ordered a coffee with an extra expresso shot...  And had a croissant with almonds sprinkled on top with that almond sweet filling inside.  And it was quite delicious.  Not as good as Paris.  But close.

The rest of the stuff in there, I was not paying attention to, so I cannot comment on."}
{"text":"This cafe is steps away from Notre Dame. Literally sitting in my seat I could view the church across the street in front of me. Great location to take a break from the cold.

The chocolatine croissant was warmed up on request and heavenly. Latte was good. Service polite.

Wish they had more pastry selection as they were out of some items when we went."}
{"text":"Spacious cafe situated right at the entrance to Old Montreal. It's a great space to study or relax from a day of walking, but I was disappointed with the carrot cake that I had from here. It was cold and hard most likely from sitting the fridge, so maybe it would've been better at room temp. However the almond croissant was quite delicious. I wouldn't rule this place out, but there are definitely other places I would prioritize if I was visiting for a short amount of time."}
{"text":"Wow. First off, their prices are crap. There are better restaurants in the area for the price point. Honestly, I don't even get their 'artisan' name. The bread isn't even fresh. And slow as hell!!"}
{"text":"Xavier Artisan is a cute little place to pick up a croissant or bagel and some coffee.  The pre-made lemonade was weak but everything else was good.  The croissants were better than most of the ones you'd find in the USA but they're no match for the ones in Paris."}
{"text":"I went to cafe for coffee. Place is huge. Stuff is super nice. Coffee is great. Bakery is good too. Only minus they didn't have any desserts like cheesecake or coffee cakes. 
I also bought pint of  ice-cream to take home wich was quite expensive."}
{"text":"The coffee was very bad. The \"Batista?\" (Really just some bro) had no clue how to make coffee. Go to some small coffee shop in Mile End if you want real coffee. This is a pretentious over priced cafe for people who want to look like they have money. Also, an employee completely ignored us and served a group of other people first although we were there before hand. We were directly in front of the cash register, so rude bro!"}
{"text":"This cafe is literally up the street from Notre Dame - excellent location!  Grab a bite to eat and some tea/coffee and just relax while remembering the awesomeness of what you just saw in the church.

Clean and modern decor, this is a great spot to rest your feet before you head into Old Montreal.  Plenty of seating and the staff is friendly 

Grab a sandwich (they can heat it up for you), pastries and your beverage and just relax."}
{"text":"The pesto chicken sandwich I had was hot and reasonably fresh. It was nicely grilled and the spinach was nice. But it didn't really taste like anything, and at a price of $10, I expect more flavour. Definitely small value for the price. That said the $2 bagel and coffee is a great deal.

Nice atmosphere but not something to go out of your way for. Mainly just convenient for tourists, or someone seeking a coffee at a good price."}
{"text":"I found this place very pleasant. It's big and spacious, not too crowded so you can have a place seated. The decor is pleasant and the ambiance is calm in general. I took a fast  bit and a coffee before an important exam and was feeling relaxed.

They have mostly sandwiches and panninis but with tasty cheeses and warm, soups too. It's quite healthy overall. The coffee was good, not too strong, neutral but balanced. 

I tried the moka too after the exam :) it tasted like pure, good quality black cocoa"}
{"text":"I really liked everything about this place. The location is great, the decor is really cool and flows throughout. The coffee and food are also really solid. They have really good lattes and coffee options. The croissants and pastries are fresh and really excellent. They have a large selection of pre made food and fresh juices if you need to grab something to go. 

We stopped in here twice for breakfast pastries and coffee before exploring old Montreal and it was a great way to start our mornings. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place - was emptier and quieter than other places for lunch. 
Very quaint building, with friendly staff. 

The chicken avocado wrap was nice, hint of lime gave it more dimension. It still was a bit bland, but not unbearably so. 

Overall, this cafe was very nice."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop close to the basilica Notre Dame! Had an assortment of breakfast and lunch options! Xavier also had nice outdoor seating on the square!"}
{"text":"Très beau café aux airs vieillots dans Place d'Arme! Vous serez charmé par les baristas et leur service exceptionnel ! L'endroit est en majorité calme, avec des heures de pointes achalandées, mais peu de gens restent dans le café! Ca en fait une place de choix pour étudier dans un atmosphère tranquille avec de la musique de Crooners !!

Le café est délicieux aussi! Il est plutôt corsé donc ajouter du lait si vous l'aimez plus doux! L'ensemble des sandwiches sont bons et les viennoiseries sont un vrai délice! 

Un beau café qui en vaut le détour ! Et que dire du paysage alentour?! Le vieux-port, c'est comme être en voyage pendant un moment ou deux .."}
{"text":"Parfait pour un sandwich to-go vite fait et composé de bons ingrédients. Le service est courtois mais c'est un peu cher à mon goût ( mais comme c'est dans le vieux-mtl, c'est pas une surprise non plus)"}
{"text":"Nice place and good cafe.  It is spacious and I like the woody decoration. It is just in the Old town and you can see the Notre Dame Basilique through its windows."}
{"text":"Stayed at a friends place in old Montreal and needed a quick bite in the morning. Walked by this place and decided to give it a try.

The space is beautiful, that's for sure. The service was fast but not very friendly. 

I ordered le lox which was described as a bagel with homemade smoked salmon cream cheese, tomato and red onion for 5$ plus tax.

The cream cheese was very lacking in the smoked salmon department and they forgot to put the tomato and red onion. 

To add insult to injury, the bagel itself wasn't even a Montreal style bagel. It was small and could be described as a generic grocery store brand type bagel. Disappointing.

Tim Hortons would have been more satisfying and half the price to boot."}
{"text":"Excellent little place to grab lunch in Old Montréal. Really yummy sandwiches, really tasty coffee, definitely worth stopping by for both tourists and locals."}
{"text":"My friend and I was passing by their terrace and found they have ice cream for sale. We went in and tried some ice cream only. It is a spacious cafe and the decoration is a retro style.
Despite the price was not low, the portion was very generous. One scoop for 4$ and two for 7$.
One pint for 10$. The ice cream is house made and probably one of their specialty. However, it was too sweet for my taste.
Can't comment on the food since I only had the ice cream. The seating was comfy and there was WIFI. Very nice place to rest a little when you are visiting old port and the church."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim after a meeting next door. 

All the dudes who work here are mad cute, so that's a plus. 

Nice spacious dining area, lots of food options. My sandwich was ok- a little too greasy, and nothing special but they seem to have an extensive menu so I don't doubt that they have better options than what I had."}
{"text":"lovely cafe in Montreal old downtown. Morden decor and great latte. reasonable price for 2.75 latte or cappuchino"}
{"text":"What a nice little place. Amazing amazing ice cream (try the pistachio) and super nice staff that seem disappointed if you don't try a lot of different ice creams before you decide. Nice location in old Montreal but not yeccy-touristy. Great coffee too! A win"}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe, very good ingredients and good drinks. The coffee roast is a bit too much for me, otherwise a very cool place."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out , they have fresh orange juice for 3,50$ and many drinks availables , coffee, tea etc , gauffres etc , some food , many tables. Good service. Wifi"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.   It was very early in morning and I order a chocolate croissant.  The tea cake out and had 2 flies in it. I brought it back to them and to their credit they gave me a new tea and a chocolate muffin.  Overall ok."}
{"text":"Great cafe for coffee and baked goods. Nice setting with large tables and  friendly service."}
