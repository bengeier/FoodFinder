{"text":"just had lunch here today. delicious, very cheap! $12 lunch buffet. you do not help yourself, instead they serve you a platter with 3 veggie dishes and 3 meat. It may seem like you don't fill up your plate as much as a standard serve yourself buffet, but it is very filling, and the quality is way better than a serve yourself buffet.  Not greasy at all..this was superb! Delicious!  I recommend it if you're in the mood for indian,, and don't like the idea of traditional buffets. This is cleaner, and the food is sent to you perfectly, not dry or mixed all together like in normal buffets."}
{"text":"Hands down Best Indian food ever!!!!!  And I am a very picky eater, I have tried a lot of Indian places but this place has the best service ever. The owner welcomes you with such nice and warm smile. The chef asks you about the food. Me and my husband have tried everything on the menu and we have never been disappointed. It's our must do once a month place."}
{"text":"Come hungry! This place is family run, and you feel the love in the food. Plates aren't fancy but sure taste good. Order extra so you have leftovers to take home! And if you are new to Indian, just let them know and they are happy to make suggestions. If you want takeout, go for the buffet. They give you a variety of items and more than enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"Awesome food! LOVED THE BUTTER CHICKEN! You guys have to visit this small hidden gem near lakeshore! The guy or i must say most probably the owner of the restaurant was too sweet to us and was very much delighted to have us! Me n my best friend dropped by at this place unplanned! It was worth going! Recommended to everyone! Thumps up! :)"}
{"text":"Great spot! I came here with a friend yesterday and sat on the patio..  We ordered the mango beers and a papri chat appetizer to start. We absolutely loved the yogurt, tamarind sauce and the chip-like wafers it had!  We also ordered the chicken madras curry and loved the sauce. Perfect for dipping with the roti. Delicious! The waiter was knowledgable and the owner made us feel welcome.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, service excellent and price points very good. Try the tandoori fish,  tandoori shrimp with the garlic naan and you will feel that you have died and gone to heaven !"}
{"text":"Lovely Indian restaurant welcoming and friendly staff. Excellent service offered. We tried the dinner buffet it was so filling and delicious. Loved the butter chicken, Dal Makhani & Paneer Makhani dish. Great food & ambience will be back again."}
{"text":"I have been back a few times and I have to say they seem to have stepped up their game. The buffet was marginally better, but I have also ordered a few dishes a la carte and they have all been fantastic.  Their fresh naan is incredible, a worthy companion to any of their delicious dishes. We visited again this past week in the late evening and had some spectacular butter chicken and lamb curry dishes. They have also increased the size & quality of their masala chai.  Definitely have a stop by if you are craving some Indian food."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I went last night for the first time and didn't have a great experience.  Food - We ordered only off of the tandoori menu and everything was really really dry and overcooked. The flavors and spices were ok but I really wish they hadn't overcooked all of the meat  Service - The place was really busy so service wasn't that great and it took about 20 min to pay but I'm sure on a normal night it would be fine.  Overall, I'm usually ok with really bad service if the food is amazing. My experience last night had bad service and overcooked food so I'm not sure I'll come back for a while."}
{"text":"I came to this place wondering if the other reviews were a bit overhyped. I'm being a bit generous with the 5 stars but this place deserves it with the warm service and the kind words from the owner. Come here if you want a nice warm environment, please stay away if you're rude or condescending as the staff here are warm, kind and beautiful people.  Go for the buffet plate to get a taste of nearly everything."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner for the first time, and I was impressed. The waiter was friendly but not intrusive and the food was fantastic and they give you a decent portion, which my friend and I were able to enjoy for lunch the next day.  We ended up talking into the night, not realizing until later that it was past their closing time, and were apologetic about it, but nobody ever hinted or ushered us to leave.  Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Really average indian food that is overpriced.  I do not recommend eating here.  The wait staff made us order more food than was necessary and it tasted a few days old and not fresh.  It was a real disappointment."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident after deciding that we didn't want to wait 45 minutes in line for the new Mexican restaurant a few doors down. Greatest decision ever! We somehow got the stroller through the tiny aisle but they found us a comfortable table right at the back (suits us fine because we don't like our kids to bother other diners with the noise). Waitstaff was quick and courteous, the manager often coming by to check and see how things were. Butter chicken, beef korma and lamb biryani were cooked and spiced to perfection. I love when spicy actually means spicy. Naan was absolutely perfect and they even came by with extra ones free of charge. Bathrooms were the downfall unfortunately as there were paper towels all over the floor and no soap in the dispenser. Bathroom hadn't been cleaned for a few hours. The waiter also gave us the wrong bill but we sorted it out easily. The food makes up for everything else! Great for families, first dates, take out and a snack. Nice and close to the lake if you're game for a relaxing stroll afterwards. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing ..service is super...will visit again.  The ambiance is comfortable and the staff are great...but all this combined was a great experience."}
{"text":"My second time visiting was definitely not as good as the first. Service has gone down hill. The buffet is no longer a buffet so you should definitely change the name. Server had to be called on 2 occasions to refill water and to top it all off did not provide dessert that was part of the so called buffet also my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant so they were not busy at all. Sorry but wont be back"}
{"text":"Great value! Went in for the $15 \"buffet lunch\" - be aware it's not a traditional Indian buffet self serve. Instead it's more of a variety sampler platter. Came with 5 items (butter chicken, beef curry, Brussels sprouts etc) + nan, rice and salad. Great variety and everything was of decent quality. Food came quickly and the service we experienced was limited but good. Good value for lunch and good experience."}
{"text":"Dropped by on the weekend for lunch.   The buffet was just being put out.  They had a good selection of food, so much so that I really couldn't get a good amount of each on in one trip, so I had to go back for more.  Channa tasted a little firm (I was there early) but everything else was very flavourful.  They brought out fresh tandoori chicken and fresh naan bread directly to the table to ensure it stayed hot.  My only food critique was my mango lassi.  It looked a little pale.  There was a bigger mix of yogurt to mango therefore it was a little more bitter than I normally like (I'd prefer it a little sweeter)  The place was quiet.  Saturday at lunch and there was only 1 other table in use.  I'd definitely repeat and I would recommend it to others.  Service was friend and the food was good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quiet, laid back atmosphere in a elegant setting where you can delve into deep conversation with that special someone... This is not the restaurant for you.   My experience at Indian Cuisine By The Lake has been generally positive over the years. Really impressed with the quality of service and the speed. The owner usually comes by to introduce himself and check on his customers. This man runs a great business and even better restaurant. Little things like that add a lot of value and restaurants tend to overlook the small details. It's rare to have a genuine service like this.  One thing I learned about eating Indian cuisine that I thought I'd share is that it's better to pair their spicy and saucy dishes with an ice cold beer to help offset the strong tastes. I'm not a spice guy so this trick comes in handy every time."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to start writing some updated reviews for awhile and so I figured I would start with Indian Cuisine By The Lake, as they've gradually become my go to for Indian fare, and a place I'm damn proud to bring my out of town guests to.   Last year the Yelp community voted on their favourite restaurants and cuisines from all over the GTA and this spot won the people's choice award for favourite Indian restaurant. An honour well deserved in deed.  Even today as I brought a coworker by for lunch they continued to amaze me both with their service and food. My coworker is a strict vegan and the manager easily adapted some existing vegetarian menu items to be vegan friendly. In fact my colleague was considering naan when the manager advised us that the naan wasn't vegan as it contained traces of milk. He didn't need to say that but he went the extra mile to ensure my colleagues dietary restrictions were met.   For myself, ever the carnivore, I decided to steer away from my usual super spicy dishes and ordered their 1/2 tandoori chicken with a side of rice and naan. The chicken was AMAZING it came out on a cast iron skillet sizzling hotter than a chain restaurants fajita platter. The sizzle and steam lasted for a solid 10 minutes, and the chicken, oh my, a slight kick but juicy, with flavour penetrating deep into the chicken. Ive had tandoori chicken where the meat goes red, but when it is red right to the bone... You know you're in flavour country and they've put some pride and effort into their cooking.   Thanks to Danny and his team here, they've made a life long customer out of me.   Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"I must say that the Chicken Palak was the best I have had anywhere. The flavors were amazing and quality was spot on and very enjoyable. What really made me give it five stars was the fact that the service was outstanding and very accomodating. I asked for Gajar kaczmarek halfway, which was not on the menu and I didn't even know the proper name, but when I desired it to the owner, he said the can make it for me and they did. It was truly outstanding. I can highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My associate and I had a delicious meal of Fish Pakora, Aloo Tikki, Kahari Curry Lamb, and Jhinga Shrimp. Great, personal service plus a very nice conversation with the owner Danny. Great find on yelp."}
{"text":"Mmm, l did a delivery to this restaurant, the staff was great, very friendly, the atmosphere was formal, the owner gave some chickpea rice curry. to go. It was the best  i ever had. l guess it's all in the sauce. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I know my Indian food and this was by far the worst Indian food I've had in my entire life.   I ordered take-out from this place via just-eat.com. I ordered the Baingan Patiala (eggplant), the Shrimp Makhni, the garlic naan, and the gulab jamuns. The food came quickly enough, especially considering how far I live from the restaurant. When I opened the containers, what a disappointment. Immediately all I could smell was this overwhelming smell of cumin seeds. The eggplant dish was filled with them, it was clear that someone had accidentally poured an entire bag of cumin seeds into the dish. It was inedible. Every bite had 5-10 cumin seeds, it was almost as many cumin seeds as eggplant. Not only that, but the eggplant was extremely greasy and poorly cooked, clearly raw in several areas. The Shrimp Makhni was OK, nothing special. The shrimp was overcooked and it would have been nice if there were some vegetables in it, the sauce was also pretty bland. The naan was OK but for $3.50, all I got was two sad and thin pieces. Definitely not worth the price at all. The Gulab Jamuns were good.  I think it's going to be a while before I can even eat Indian food again after this experience. Stay away at all costs."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying something good, the food. In fact it's quite great. A medium spiciness that most people can enjoy. The curry goat and the butter chicken are borderline perfect and everything seems fresh but the food could be more hot so that it stays hot longer on your plate. But that's no biggy.  Now for the ugly side. The service. Our server was nice and sat us instantly. But neglected to ask us for our preferred drinks and offer us Specially naan which you could only order and can't find on the buffet. And instead of doing so he was organizing the table near us. After getting up and asking for the drinks and garlic naan, he serves my diet Coke and spills it, doesn't apologize and doesn't clean it up. Honestly I don't really care but I'm pretty sure the average person would and maybe he just didn't notice. Some people might find this unacceptable considering we were the only ones eating in the whole restaurant. Perhaps he didn't care for Grouponers.  I'm not going to greatly affect the restaurants rating because of one person so I'll give them a 4-star rating and I will be back to bring more people. And I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with my wife hoping for some delicious Indian cuisine. We were not disappointed.  The service was great, the food arrived quick and delicious. We were quite impressed all together. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is below average. Service is not great. If u are thinking of authentic Indian food then maybe you can give this a skip. They have patio seating outside but we chose to sit inside but the air con was not on. It was hot. We ordered for the Lakeside kebab platter. The chicken was under cooked and the taste was not great."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing customer service. The manager was very imformative and such a pleasure to have. Because Indian cuisine can be spicy, ensuring that customers had their glasses filled with water all the time was great! Definitely will be coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but nice food. The naan were delicious. Got the goat curry and it was well done as well. The service was fair and bathrooms relatively clean. Good Indian option in this area."}
{"text":"My quest to try all the restaurants at Lakeshore brought me here on a calm Wednesday evening.   The service started out great, with our server showing enthusiasm and giving us endless recommendations. However, once we had ordered, the service went downhill. Requests for drinks went unfulfilled, and there was way too long of a wait. The restaurant was nearly empty, and it took nearly 20 minutes for our appetizer to come out! After that long wait, it was at least another half hour before our main dishes arrived. The order fulfillment time here was just unacceptable.   As a redeeming factor though, the food was delicious. We had the Vegetarian Platter to start, which came with various appetizers including pakoras samosas. This was the real highlight of the meal - the pakoras, dipped in whatever sauce it came in, was delectable. I had the Karahi Chicken for my main course, which arrived in a deceivingly large bowl. There was nothing amazing about it, but it was satisfying enough for that night.   I would have given the restaurant 4 stars for the food, but the unacceptably long wait bumps it down to a 3. Food was great, though."}
{"text":"Rarely do I ever get worked up about a bad meal - this was unfortunately, one of the few occasions.   I ventured out here with my friend with an empty belly in search of a big meal. We came across Indian Cuisine by the lake, based on its great Yelp reviews.  Boy, you guys let me down.  They serve a lunch time thali as a buffet style option. I was excited to see what I would get, but the empty restaurant in the middle of the day on weekend should have been the first tipoff.   What we got was, dry, stale, watery, and improperly defrosted food. It was entirely unpalatable. They serve one of those telltale samosas from those frozen bags you get at the grocery store. It wasn't even properly reheated and cold on the inside.   The vegetable dish was sad remnants of the cheapest vegetables available served in a watery lumpy tomato sauce. My DC's 'tandoori' chicken was tough and hard as a rock. I believe you could have cracked a tooth on it.   I entered the restaurant famished - i exited famished with a lost appetite. Anyone who thinks this place is even worth 3 stars needs an education on Indian food, 'Indian Food 101'.   Lesson 1: Indian food should ALWAYS be fresh."}
{"text":"This restaurant couldn't pay me to give them a good review; the more I think about tonight's experience, the angrier I get.   My boyfriend was craving butter chicken, so we picked this place. It's very close to his place and it had great reviews; also sounded upscale and romantic.   Sure the decor is nicer than a lot of Indian places, but the buffet fails - an array of empty pans or half-full pans with sticky dry food - just disgusting. We were going to order a la carte, but when I compared the menu prices to the Sunday dinner buffet price ($16), the buffet sounded like a better deal. Plus, we were going to order butter chicken anyway, which was a part of the buffet. And from the looks of it, it seemed to me that they were the kind of restaurant to just dump the buffet food on the sit-down dishes.   So, I talked to our server and asked him to refill the buffet pans. He agreed and 20 mins later, some of the pans were filled. We started eating. Choices were slim - chana, 2 veggie dishes, a bad looking paneer dish, raita, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, goat meat, samosa, spring roll and onion pakora. I skipped the vegetarian stuff and the samosa-spring roll deal. Neither looked too good. I helped myself with some goat meat, rice, butter chicken, naan and raita.   Goat meat - fairly good, not warm.   Rice - really good.... but it takes a monkey to fail at rice  Butter Chicken - they refilled by dumping some boiled chicken in the butter chicken gravy. Results? Not good.   Naan - fresh.  Raita - good.   For $16 per person, this buffet really fails. Tandoori Flame offers triple the food for about $4 more. And the quality is a lot better.   It angers me because we spent about $40 for below-average food. And the butter chicken sucked balls.   Never coming back. And here's a tip, go elsewhere if you're looking for good Indian food."}
{"text":"We were lured to this charming looking spot with outdoor tables and umbrellas on the shady side of Lakeshore Road. We sat at the wooden patio and watched people strolling by.  The server was pleasant and the food was okay (not fantastic). We were fooled by the offer of a \"buffet\" because it was really a mixed platter. We were unable to view the food or to serve ourselves. When my partner asked for additional tandoori chicken, the server left with his plate and did not return. Apparently they do not permit second helpings but they don't tell you that either. When the server finally brought the bill, my partner asked if there were any desserts. \"Oh yes\" she said, \"rice pudding or gulab jamun\" (timbits  in sugar syrup). I asked for ice cream and was told that was not included in the buffet and would incur an extra charge.  Lots of off the cuff rules and we will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am no expert in Indian food, so I am reviewing from the perspective whether the food appeals to me, instead of whether the food is authentic.  We ordered some sorts of a meat platters that had butter chicken, curry goats, chickpeas, some types of vegetarian food, tantoori chicken drumstick, rice and naan.  All the food tasted rich and bold.  I found the vegetarian items more spicy than the meat items.  The butter chicken was good but The Host's was better.  The curry goat was delicious.  The tantoori chicken tasted good and not too dry.  The only thing I was sure that needed improvement was the naan.  It had a layer of crisp outside alright, but the inside was not that soft and moist.  The services was a bit slow.  We were in a rush, and the server said this entree only took 5 minutes to make.  It took approximately 20 minutes to arrive instead.  Overall, this restaurant was okay."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in port credit. Although their sign is a little misleading \"a la carte or buffet\" which made me hesitant to give them a full five star.  My experience was great though. Going in there for a lunch/dinner date with my girlfriend and we were not letdown with the quality of food.  We got the \"buffet thali\". Which we thought unlimited of food, but beware it is not. It's a platter with different choices which included butter chicken, balsamic rice, salad and other things that I don't remember served with naan.  Essentially it's a sampler for 15 dollars. We weren't so down on the failure of unlimited food, that platter was huge that we had trouble finishing the plate. The food was simply amazing! We love it so much! The meat was tender, the sauce were flavorful.  The ambience of this place is intimate, perfect for a nice cozy date. It wasn't to loud and can actually hear your partner speak. It was clean and didn't smell like food inside. Good sign.  The servers were polite and attended to our needs everytime. They were also nice enough to give us extra naan bread.  I would definitely recommend this place and hopefully everyone will have as much fun as I did. We shall be back again."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for the food here but extremely disappointed. The mango lassi was amazing but my vegetarian buffet was disgusting. The only things on my platter that didn't make me gag was the paneer and rice. I was so hungry after waiting 40 minutes for my food I had to force feed myself food and mask the flavors with naan. I'll stick to my regular Indian restaurant rotation for now on."}
{"text":"Some parts were great, some were not.  My friends ordered the dinner buffet and the portions were very good and filling. Some of it was good, like the curried chickpeas and butter chicken, but the samosas tasted bland and was most likely not fresh.   I got the vindaloo chicken. The sauce was great as it was a good amount of spice and the flavor reallt shines through, but the portion was quite small for the price. The naan was very disappointing, a quarter of it was BURNT. And in regards to the actual tastiness...well I've had better ones from Costco.   The service was pretty bad though. Our server really did not want to be there. Tough luck for us because the owner seems sweet."}
{"text":"Food is incredible and the owner Danny is amazing.  Best Indian in Toronto  We go there a lot and will keep returning!"}
{"text":"It doesn't stand out in any spectacular way, except for the naan bread that was probably the best I've had. But the main thing about this place is the lunch platter for $13 that I could barely finish. And the dinner platter was only a few bucks more. Amazing deal. If you're planning on ordering anything else, it is quite over-priced."}
{"text":"Indian Cuisine by the Lake is advertised as an Indian restaurant with a lunch and dinner buffet.  There is no buffet. There is no salad bar. Perhaps, this misunderstanding is due to the staff's poor understanding of English (and also apparent inability to explain that the buffet is not a buffet).  The 'buffet' is actually a thali platter. You get one serving of the thali platter. There is a lot of food on the platter, but it's not a buffet. Please don't call it a buffet and don't let yourself come here thinking there will be a hot buffet for the hungry.  The thali platter though is still a reasonably good deal for the hungry. At $14 for lunch, it came with a variety of dishes and also came with rice and na'an (which normally cost extra with a dish). So if you came here and are reading this review because you're expecting to get the 'buffet', this will probably be the most satisfying choice for you still.  The butter chicken was.... interesting to say the least. I think of it as very creamy, but others described it as 'tastes like processed cheese'. The fresh fruit on the \"lunch buffet\" was a pleasant surprise. The na'an we had was fine.  The credit card machine was down, so we had to fill in credit card information on slips of paper."}
{"text":"I went here a week ago with family. First off this place is tiny, has a very cramped feel to it, employees were having a hard time squeezing between chairs to get to the kitchen in the back. Our server was very nice. Service was pretty slow despite there being a max of 10-12 people in the restaurant, I think there were a total of 4-5 employees working that I could see. We all had the $16 dinner \"buffet\", it's not actually a buffet it's basically a platter of different varieties on one big plate that has unlimited refills, including naan bread and dessert. Took awhile to get to us after we ordered, and when it came it wasn't that hot. The food was pretty good but I had expected the butter chicken to be better, it was way too salty. When we were paying for the food I asked the owner if I could give some constructive criticism that would benefit his business, he agreed and I let him know about the butter chicken. He told his chef in front of me and looked a bit offended, he explained it was a new chef and it was his first day. The owner had a bit of an attitude, would not recommend going here there are much better places for Indian food out there."}
{"text":"Have you ever seen eat love pray? Because the way Julia Roberts feels when she hops off that plane in all those different countries but specifically when she is in India. I could really taste the traditional spices the way Julia Roberts explained in the movie. I just wanted to bend down right there and pray my rectum right off. You can sure say I ate loved and prayed at this place. Definitely going back xoxoxoxoxoxo"}
{"text":"Another awesome spot in Port Credit.  Stopped in on a Saturday night. No wait and the food was excellent. Had the Shahi Paneer and a great Fish Tikka cooked in a tandoor oven and served sizzling. Love eating in this part of town.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food close to me and close to the lake.  The buffet platter was delicious and allowed us to try a little bit of everything. I suggest going there when the patio is open during the summer"}
{"text":"Just had a beer and vegetable samosas here and it was suuuuper delicious! The owner was also very friendly. We had a lovely time here! Totally recommend it"}
{"text":"it was great! very delicious professional Indian food with very warm and respectful stuff in the restaurant. I enjoyed with friends. We ordered 3 different meals and all were great!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is located at a very beautiful location. Inside area is a bit cramped but the food was good. My friends and I had ordered vegetable biryani, chicken seekh wrap, butter chicken wrap and everything for just $27 usd. Wow we were shocked because that's pretty reasonable! Sorry I was too hungry so I don't have any pictures to post"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to go here ever since the first time I saw it, as it's open patio made it unique to the rest of the other indian restaurants in Mississauga. I made a reservation but was not needed as there were quite a few available tables, which did eventually fill up around half an hour later.  I love ordering a thali when available, however their thali's are different since you can't choose the curries and so it's basically a chefs choice concept. So my brother got the vegetarian thali and a mango lassi while I decided to not risk it and opted for the half tandoori chicken and a roti.  I immediately noticed that this restaurant is quite pricey compared to the other indian restaurants I have been to, such as Bombay Bhel and Gurus, whereby a thali there would usually cost around $13 but here is was $16. The mango lassi was $5, which I considered pretty pricey too. My only complain on the service was that because we were sitting at the patio they did not notice our empty glasses and failed to refill them until asked. The food arrived after not too long. My chicken came in a sizzling hot plate and was quite delicious, especially with the tamarind and yogurt sauces they provided for the table.  The thali came with around 4 curries, rice, naan, a mini samosa, and a onion fritter. This thali also differed in that it did not come with a dessert.  According to my brother this thali was made more for those who cannot handle the authentic and traditional heavily spiced indian meal, and more for those that just want that slight indian food taste. This wasn't a bad thing, it just means that for an authentic spicy indian meal this may not be the best choice.  The ambiance totally amped up the experience and I would definitely go again, but not as a regular choice due to it's high prices."}
{"text":"Well, hello *dal*lllllling!   Indian Cuisine By The Lake is simply divine. We were greeted by the kind owner and when he learned that I was vegan, he told me that his daughter is vegan, so he could easily accommodate my dietary needs. I'm not used to that in most Indian restaurants, where you have to be gheefully aware of butter sneaking its way into most curries. He even offered to make up a buffet plate for me (note: not a typical Indian buffet where it's out in front of you, but personally, I think it's better that way, so that the food is fresher and not likely tainted by all that human handling). I opted for the yellow Dal, which is on point, especially when mixed in with some of that tasty Basmati rice. I had asked for it extra spicy and they delivered!  Other stuff: they have beer & wine, though I didn't partake, and had the weather been nicer, sitting out on their front patio would have been a must."}
{"text":"I haven't ate here but im extremely disappointed because they did false advertising when i called and asked if they were a buffet and they said yes; only to be told they are NOT AN OPEN BUFFET after we drove here for 35 minutes. They give you a mixed platter and call it a buffet. Very unpleasant, deceitful and u professional."}
{"text":"this should actually be 3.5 stars. a large group of us came here for dinner. As someone who has been eating Indian food my entire life, I've been to many many Indian restaurants.    Resto: It's a smaller venue but still comfortable. There are benches along the wall towards the back. It looks modern and clean inside. The buffet is in the middle of the restaurant which can get a bit crammed if you are walking from the front to the back, passing the buffet line. This is the only reason i would deduct any stars. The washrooms are individual bathrooms. It looks like they are making a patio out front for the summer which would be nice.   Service: wonderful! We were a big group with a newborn baby. They were more than accommodating to us when even more ppl showed up. They moved their freezer out of the way so that we would have enough space. Our waters were always refilled and the manager came by several times to make sure we were happy. He was very friendly and explained to us the different curries they make, how he uses red wine in one of them, and invited us back. The new mom was a bit hot and they just turned the fan on above the table which cooled us right down.   Food: The buffet was a good spread, served hot, and a great combination of food to satisfy everyone at the table. The rice is served warm in a rice cooker which is nice. The naan was served in baskets and was very warm.  i took off a half star  here b/c: the rice didn't have peas (i love rice and peas with curry), the garlic naan didn't have chunks of garlic (more like a garlic oil, versus paste - again the paste is my preference) and the curries weren't spicy to me at all. I can understand why they didn't make the curry spicy, but to me curry is slightly spicy with some heat. However that being said, the curry was very palatable to everyone at the table and suited everyone's tastes. everyone loved their meals and we left stuffed. So if you are going to venture out and try indian food that's flavourful but are scared about how spicy it could be,  this is a very good suggestion in the area.  They also serve Tusker beer which balanced out the food perfectly. I remember having this beer when i was in Kenya, and it pairs very well with curry. The buffet included (but not limited to) goat curry, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, chickpea curry, somosas, paneer,  chicken curry, cucumber salad, raita, papadums, etc ect. honestly too many things for me to recall. it also comes with 4 basic flavours of ice-cream.   I took a take out menu and will likely return for lunch in a few weeks. If you are in the area this is a great choice for Indian food. i didn't try their Lassi which is somewhat of a sin for me to have indian food without a lassi, but i will try it next time. They have mango kulfi on the menu as well but i didn't try it this time."}
{"text":"Wow... I'm not sure what I should say in here.  Almost 20 buck /person.  Is this buffet or thali. If buffet how we can get another dish? I don't see hot table in there. I see the prep table in kitchen and I don't think we can go to pick up more dish there. Is not safe if we go there,  also the customer is not employees of that restaurant who can in an out of that kitchen. The food is cold.  Not warm at all.  And the end after eat there my son feels not good his tummy. We don't think we will coming back."}

{"text":"Very quant place  to enjoy some yummy Indian food. The location is fabulous and couples can enjoy an intimate romantic walk along the Port Credit strip. I will mention that I have never done the buffet deal and have always ordered a la carte. The quality of food is better plus they offer so many more dishes if you don't do the buffet. Great place to grab a quick bite and the staff is super friendly."}
