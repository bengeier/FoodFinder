{"text":"My finace and I are devastated that we recently moved out of the delivery area for Spadina Garden. Best Chinese delivery in the city bar none.  Get the crispy ginger beef and the spicy peanut chicken plus a white rice. I could eat it at least weekly. Maybe their dishes are too saucy but it's Canadian Chinese food, that's how they do. Scrape some off or let the steamed rice soak it up.  We often got the Singapore noodles as well which were standard but tasty, had a nice curry flavour going on.  It's not cheap but we would always get at least 2 meals out of it so it's justifiable.  If you're in the delivery area - please take advantage for my sake."}
{"text":"In my opinion one of the best Chinese restaurants in the city.  Yes, the service can be a little slow, but the food more than makes up for it.  Try the spicy peanut beef and you'll understand why..."}
{"text":"Since this place is a half a block from our hotel, we thought we'd try it out.  We ordered two beers and an order of the szechuan chicken. Since this place has mixed reviews, we thought we'd try it out and order more food if we like it.  I spoke with the very friendly server and told him we liked spicy food and most places don't have spicy food. He claimed their food was very spicy and very good and we would be very happy with it.  The chicken dish came and my wife and I had a bit each. Very little spice and the sauce was boring. Tasted like basic soy sauce. We stopped eating and asked for the check.  We got the check and were charged for the full dish we didn't eat. No offer to reduce the bill or fix the dish. We probably shouldn' t have left a tip, but we did.  Would go back. They might have good dishes, but the one we had wasn't one of them."}
{"text":"I've been dying to eat here ever since a friend recommended this place to me, and after reading so many great reviews I had high expectations.  Did I really eat at the same place you all did though? My family and I agree that the food we had was overly salty, underwhelming, and one dimensional. We ordered the crispy chili tofu, the sizzling beef plate, Szechuan eggplant, the house special fried rice and Cantonese chow mein. Sadly no dish really stood out and based on what I ate I'm not compelled at all to try anything else on the menu.  On the up side, the service was pretty good. The staff was personable and very friendly, and the food took no time to get to our table. I only wish that the food was as good as the service. I will not be returning to dine here."}
{"text":"This is westernized Chinese food. This isn't real Chinese food. I had the black bean beef dish with wonton soup and it was terrible even for a westernized Chinese food place. Wontons tasted like they were from a frozen pack. The beef was super over cooked and the black bean sauce was like some weird watered down version of the sauce.  Keep in mind that I'm a Chinese guy writing this review.   I've been to westernized Chinese places which I've liked but this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"pretty good and consistent food. breaded chicken is mostly chicken not flour like alot of other places.  Friendly staff and servers. so many menu items to pick from, i'm slowly working my way through. haven't had anything i did not like!  This isn't a chinese originality contest. just appreciate the food."}
{"text":"Everything was swimming in oil. We all were quite hungry but could not finish even a quarter of our dish since it was quite disgusting, frankly."}
{"text":"I've visited the restaurant four times in the last 6 months.  Each time I've been there the food was very good.  Spicy peanut chicken is very good with good ginger flavor and some spiciness to it.  Honey garlic shrimp was pretty good as well.   To me it seems like a pretty decent place to go.  Service can be a hit or a miss, depending on how busy the place gets.  Once I had to flag waiters throughout the meal...  My only complaint is that the food seems very Americanized. Food was a bit too sweet which was glazed or covered in sauce.  I need to find an authentic dish at the place to really see if they are a 4 star or a 5 star resto."}
{"text":"Pre fried chicken, fish etc.  Wonton soup came out within 30 seconds. Wontons were tasteless with really thick skins. Argh...   Service is non existent. Seems to be the norm in Toronto."}
{"text":"My friend took me there last night because he said that he went often so I said sure why not.  We ordered 4 dishes, fried dumplings, crispy chilli chicken, spicy shrimp and stir fried Chinese broccoli.    The fried dumplings came out burned and the skin was too thick.  The filling was all right but compared to so many others that can make dumplings, this should be a no brainer.    Spicy shrimp with vegetables was very disappointing.  Sauce was thick and shrimp was soft and not very fresh.  Definitely pass on this as well.    Crispy chilli chicken was all right and was likely the only good thing we had last night.  It is essentially deep fried chicken with stir fired onions and chilli sauce.  Nothing spectacular but better than the previous two dishes.  Stir fried Chinese broccoli with garlic was also fine.  There isn't much to mess up with this dish so I didn't expect much either.    Overall, this is a step up from your stereotypical chicken balls and sweet and sour sauce with hot and spicy soup.  In a city like Toronto, that is not saying much.  I will not be going back or recommending this to anyone.  To be fair, service was good and the place was nice but food is really nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place used to be quite good but the quality of the food seems to have gone down lately. The last few times I have ordered food from here, it does not taste fresh and some of the vegetables in the noodle dish we usually order tasted spoiled/rotten. Also, many of the dishes we ordered were drenched in oil. The past few times we have eaten here, gave a few of my family members an upset stomach. The servers are often standoffish/rude."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. The man on the phone was extremely rude... We thought, oh well, maybe an excellent and busy downtown restaurant doesn't need polite service to do well, so we stayed hopeful. We were wrong to stay optimistic. It was awful. Hands down worst Chinese food we've have ever eaten, and we've eaten at our share of cheap dives... And this place wasn't even cheap. Three words--bland, gelatinous, greasy. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We have used Spadina Gardens for work functions for years.  They have become increasingly indifferent and rude and thus today was our last order.  Apparently $200.00 is not sufficient enough of an order to warrrant politeness and good customer service.  The delivery fellow called to let me know that he had arrived in front of our bldg and to meet him downstairs.  It takes me five minutes to get from the 16th floor to the street.  In five minutes he called me twice to yell at me to hurry.  When I arrived I told him that I did not appreciate being yelled at.  He replied that lunchtime is busy and they don't have time to wait.   I replied that Toronto has many other caterers and take outs who will be happy to wait five minutes for a $200 order or better yet are willing to deliver to the office door.  He shrugged and said 'go ahead'.  No apology and no effort at good customer service equals lost customers."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Hakka food.  Spicy is quite spicy though so beware!"}
{"text":"Never ever again. I used to go there a lot  for the ginger beef. Other dishes were always decent. Today though, the ginger beef was just ok, the Chinese broccoli was cold and gray. The spicy beef noodle soup was inedible and my kids couldn't eat the Cantonese chow mein. How can you possibly screw up Cantonese chow mein. Seriously??"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant based on Yelp reviews and was overall pleased.  Menu: Ginger Beef - highly recommend, gotta love spice though! Peanut Chicken - recommend Chicken Balls - recommend House Special Rice - bland, tasted better with soya sauce Vegi Spring Rolls - blah, pass.  I opted for delivery. The gentleman taking my order was very pleasant and the food arrived uber fast.  Lastly - make sure to request fortune cookies. They didn't include them, and what's Chinese food without the fun little fortunes? :)"}
{"text":"Well, this restaurant really deserves 5 star rating! The first time I walked into this place was back in 1998 and since then I've been a regular visitor. If you happen to be in downtown Toronto, don't miss Spadina Garden and their delicious and authentic Szechuan food. BTW, crispy ginger beef rocks!!!!"}
{"text":"this is your standard, generic Chinese food restaurant. I'm giving it better than one star cause it won't make you ill, but it's definitely not deserving of a recommendation. have been twice (co-workers' insistence) and the second time was marginally better, as I tried the spicy peanut tofu which was pretty good. I don't eat the meat dishes so i can't comment on those, but I do eat shrimp. the seafood dishes were also nothing great, just bland stuff that all tastes the same."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but their food place stinks, and food isn't as good as it was at all! So sad."}
{"text":"Great food for great prices. Watch out for the spice and outstanding portion size. Very casual and good service."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and I have never been unsatisfied with this place. Every time I go here I always get something different because it's all good and there is SO MUCH to choose from.   They have something for everyone. They have all the classics, like beef and broccoli, shrimp fried rice, and shanghai noodles. They also have things for the adventurous eater like Spicy Squid, and more.  Like a lot of Asian restaurants, everything comes out in huge amounts. Personally I get bored of my meal pretty fast if I get a whole plate to myself. So whenever I go here we eat family style. We all get one thing we like off the menu, order rice for each and just share. Therefore you never get bored of your food. This makes it great if you are going in a group.   A few years ago now, they renovated this place (which it really needed). Now this place looks like the food and serves you get. Even if you see a line up, you aren't waiting for long for a table.   This is a great place. You can't go wrong going here."}
{"text":"Went to Spadina Gardens for a quick lunch during the week. It was fairly packed, even though it was after 1pm. Service was quick - our order was taken and food arrived in less than 10 minutes.   I had a stir fry shrimp dish. It was alright - a bit too much sauce and not a decent shrimp to veggie ratio. Nothing to write home about, but it was a decent meal for the price paid. I would go back here. If you are looking for traditional authentic food, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was slow. We sat down to order but it took them a while to get to our order. They even went to the only other group in the restaurant and took their order first! We were there first, WTF...  Luckily the service was redeemed by the how quickly the food was served. It was great stuff, I liked the sauces and the steamed flower buns were tasty. I think most of the items can be asked for in a vegetarian version or something.  Unfortunately, the service was bad at the end. We had to flag someone down even though it was clear that we had finished (empty dishes everywhere).  Then I had to wait some more and finally had to get up to go to the counter to pay."}
{"text":"The house noodle is a must to order!!! Heavenly tasty!! The spicy level is nothing for my standard, I wish I could have suicide hot!!!"}
{"text":"We just order from Spadina Garden for delivery for the first time. The site was well managed.   First, the person receiving the order, overcharge us by a little bit and they actually hand written the receipt very sloppily instead of using a computer. Now this is what we order, 1. BBQ pork peking duck style, 2. snow pea with black mushroom, and 3 seafood treasure.   As a Chinese person myself, I have to say that this was one of the worse tasting place I have ever had.   There was no taste and bland with snow pea with black mushroom, and it look like they put too much ginger (did not see an ginger). This was the worse dish.   The seafood treasure, at $17, uses cheap seafood ingredient at the Chinese supermarket, plus they just simply stir-fry it with little or no cooking specialty . Taste was pretty bland, definitely overprice.   The BBQ pork was probably a bit below average. The sauce were not well mix and the quality of pork was poor.   To sum it up, it was one of the worse experience I have had, and I will definitely not go again."}
{"text":"\"This is the best chinese restaurant in Toronto!\" - Caucasian customer  These words will forever be immortalized in my cerebellum if I ever see or dine in this restaurant again. Whether it's a good thing or not is strongly debatable because individual tastes are subjective and I respect that.  But when someone of another ethnicity has to tell you what foods are the best from your culture (I'm Chinese if you couldn't tell by my last name ;P), you can't help but feel a bit offended or you begin to reflect on whether you're cultured enough.  This is like me giving Micheal Jordan basketball tips.  Sure, maybe that's on the extreme end but I certainly feel like I'm in tune with my heritage enough to know what good Chinese food is and unfortunately, this is NOT the best.  Decor/Location: It reminds me a lot of spring rolls with it's leather seating and pretty serving plates and utensils.  I appreciate it when a restaurant puts effort into decor and ambiance.  Afterall, sometimes the atmosphere can offset the food tasting experience from being bad to mediocre. The success of this restaurant is primarily due to it's location.  It's one of the few restaurants of this type in the area before you have to trek to Spadina.  So for all the business/condo people in that vicinity who want Chinese, this is probably the go to restaurant.  Food: I think a lot of people like this restaurant because of it's high level of spiciness and flavour in their foods.  Szechuan and Hunan foods are typically like that.  The dishes we ordered were all pretty spicy but nothing really stuck out in my mind. I must note though that the food was a bit too oily. I expect a certain degree of oiliness with this type of food but there was too much on some of the dishes.  Service: Service was just fine but we did initially get forks and knives. Grrr, do I not look Chinese?  Do I look like I don't know how to use chopsticks?  Again, this was another scenario that made me question whether I was exuding my heritage.  Perhaps I need to walk into restaurants speaking Cantonese to really nail it home (though I have a bad accent).  You can really tell that this is not a restaurant catered strictly for Asians but to multi-culturalism. This is how all restaurants should be and probably if the more authentic restaurants in china town or markham were like this, it would attract more non-asians.  Though, when restaurants try to open their doors to different ethnicities, they sometimes become too immersed in the diversifying, that they lose sight of what's most important, the authenticity of their food.  That's why \"hole-in-the-wall\" type restaurants work.  Management is only concerned with cooking good food and it's as simple as that. But the harsh reality is that money is king and if expanding restaurants, using cheaper ingredients, or changing up the menu gets more money, restaurants will go in that direction.  Though, I think this restaurant was definitely more oriented to non-asians than anything because i didn't see one comrade inside.  Overall: The reason why I gave this review 3 stars was because I have had better Szechuan and Hunan at restaurants that are uptown. (Hot Spicy Spicy, Hunan Garden). These restaurants feel like places that care only about food.  Sure, the decor is crappier but it feels original and less of a franchise.  I will try to review those when I have time. I also want to make it clear that this is NOT the best Chinese in Toronto once again.  There are few people that I believe are permitted to make such statements on Best of Toronto topics and BlogTO.com is one of them in my opinion.  Sure, they miss some hidden gems here and there but they make a valiant effort in summarizing their findings and allowing foodies to really explore what's out there.   One more thing, if you aren't in the category that allows you to say the best in Toronto, you're forbidden from saying best in the world, unless you've been around the world (my pet peeve statement). =P  Good day"}
{"text":"My first review is NOT for this restaurant but rather for Garden restaurant which has a green sign and also serves Szechuan and Hunan food, the photos show another restaurant with a similar name right down the street from this place, so I thought I was reviewing the correct place for the 4 stars (4 stars is for the place down the road closer to greyhouund, with a green sign with a similar name). Negative stars for this place which is closer to the Eaton Center with a red and black sign.  Anyways, I actually came to this Spadina Gardens a few weeks ago to compare to the place I like down the road, and the food here was HORRIBLE. I love Hunan and Szechaun food, but I like tasty food above all even if it is not \"authentic\".   We ordered Hunan beef, Szechaun Eggplant and Chinese broccoli with beef and steamed rice. Firstly, and the most revolting of all is that the beef is RED, not from chilli peppers but from food coloring. Why the heck do they dye the beef RED? It is disgusting and makes me wonder if something is wrong with the beef! Secondly, I can actually taste the food coloring which leave a bitterish taste in my mouth. Also all the beef dishes were slightly sweet , not in a good way. The food was also super greasy. All the beef dishes were inedible to me, I seriously wanted to throw up after tasting 1 piece of beef from here. The eggplant dish was alright, so I basically ate eggplant with rice, it was at least a normal color, but greasy as well.  The service was not great, the waiter had to be reminded to bring us our steamed rice 3 times, also they can not be flagged down when needed. The bill came up to about $60 and it was probably one of the worst meals I have ever had.  I wonder if this place is getting ok reviews because other people based on the pictures think that they are reviewing the decent place down the road."}
{"text":"I came for take-out based on the great reviews.  I found that the food was too heavy, saucy and deep fried.  It was totally swimming in grease.  The take-out bag was full of oil and coated my kitchen table in oil when I took the take-out containers and put them on my table. I prefer lighter cuisine with less grease.  Their vegetable spring rolls weren't great - they were far too greasy for me.  The fried rice was barely edible and tasted strange to me.  I'm not saying that the food isn't any good - I think it just wasn't to my taste.  I do like a good thai basil chicken, red curry chicken - but those dishes are much lighter than this cuisine.    I'll have to keep search for my ideal Chinese take-out place."}
{"text":"They don't offer authentic Chinese food, but they use similar ingredients. I don't like the food here, but it's an option if you are not picky about food or you grow up with sweet dishes."}
{"text":"Loved it. Awesome Chilli Chicken (got the white meat) and even better spicy calamari with black bean sauce. Even friendly service and good prices.   I consider this to be a hidden gem. May go back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"Always recommend this place to clients and friends when in town. It's excellent food. Consistently excellent which is rare for Chinese food in Toronto. The ginger beef is incredible. It's clean inside with great service."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant chinois de style sichuanaise. On pourrait penser que ce restaurant est à l'écart du Chinatown, perdu même, mais il se trouve en fait sur les vestiges de l'ancien Chinatown détruit par la ville de Toronto pour construire la nouvelle mairie.   La cuisine y est excellente, le service parfaitement rôdé. Nous recommandons les 'steamed dumplings' ou raviolis chinois passés à la vapeur, ils y sont particulièrement excellents. Le restaurant est très propre, bien éclairé et proche du centre-ville. C'est tout gagnant."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Consistently delicious. Chili chicken is my favorite as well as wonton soup but everything is good. Spicy and wonderful."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Spadina Garden Cuisine: Chinese Location: Downtown of Toronto Address: 114 Dundas St W Price Range: $10-15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  *Specialize in Szechuan Dishes *Lunch menu with rice and soup *Delivery over $25 within the district  Spadina Garden is located at a convenient location- nice and clean inside the restaurant. It gets very busy during lunch time, make sure to beat the lunch crowd. I liked this place because they give you chopsticks AND fork even before you ask for it (I realize they usually give you fork). Their tea is strong and flavorful.  You get a choice of soup with their special lunch menu that comes with a bowl of rice. You can get Wonton or Sweet & Sour Soup- I chose Wonton soup and it came with 2 wontons (I took the picture after eating one). Broth was nicely seasoned but a little too salty and the wonton skins were a bit on the thick side.  Ordered: SPICY BEEF NOODLE SOUP (regular menu) This noodle soup is spicy with lots of flavor. BE AWARE it's quite spicy and the soup is very thick so don't wear white when you are eating this. There were 5 big pieces of brisket on top, all the meat was very tender with just right amount of fat. Veggies balance out the richness of this soup and the noodles were chewy.  Ordered: HOUSE STIR FRIED NOODLE (regular menu) This is a really big dish for lunch so keep that in mind. Generous amount of noodles were stir fried with pieces of chicken, bbq pork, bean sprout and carrot. This was good with some hot sauce.  Ordered: SZECHUAN FISH (lunch menu) This dish comes with 4 pieces of deep fried fish and onions topped off with spicy-soy based szechuan sauce. The portions are kind of small for this specific dish but the combination of flavors were mouth-watering. I would get this again for sure.  Ordered: GENERAL TSO CHICKEN (lunch menu) I usually never order such a food-court like Chinese food at authentic restaurants, but I was craving for something like this for awhile. You def need some rice to accompany this dish because it comes with lots of sauce. It's a bit on the spicy side even with the sweet sauce on top. For some reason, this dish wasn't very hot when it arrived on the table.  SUMMARY: I think this is my favorite Chinese restaurant so far. I like spicy food and Szechuan flavors really hit the spot for me. Make sure to prepare yourself for some spicy goodness when ou visit this place!  *chomp chomp*"}
{"text":"Years ago I found this place through a friends recommendation, and after being a regular to this place for years, have no hesitation recommending to others this great place.  We only use take-out/delivery, so I can't really speak much to the sit down area. When I've been inside though, its been full of people and clean, so I'm assuming that is well taken care of.  The two things we consistently get off the menu is the Spicy Ginger Beef and the Peanut Chicken.  The Spicy Ginger Beef is exceptional. It was a wonderful fusion of flavor, texture, heat, and sweetness. If you wish, you can ask for the item to be less hot. Personally, I have no problem with the regular strength.  The Peanut Chicken is very satisfying as well. The chicken is nicely coated in a savory sauce, and accompanied with peanuts and green pepper pieces, which provides a nice mosaic of taste and texture.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Finally a meeting of the minds.  I love this restaurant and now my husband loves it too.  My husband liked the Cantonese chow mein.  He said it was the best he has had from all the restaurants we have been too.  I thought the beef chow mein was better than the chicken.  But my husband liked both the beef and the chicken.  Again the spicy peanut chicken was awesome.  And the food tasted as back in the day.  I did not have to salt my dish.        This restaurant is spicy so if you love spice u will love this restaurant.  If you don't like spice like my husband, you may want to ask them to dial down the spice - it will still be good."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre, and I recommend this place for lunch.  They have lunch specials and each item comes with complimentary soup (wonton or hot and sour). The hot and sour soup is indeed hot and sour! I've tried their assorted vegetables, which was average. My favorite item was the spicy shrimp with peanuts. The sauce is NOT spicy at all, but was very sweet and it went well with the peanuts. The Szechuan fish is also good! Overall, the service is really quick, but I wouldn't highly recommend this place if you want original Chinese food. The flavoring is definitely catered to foreigners and their 'spicy' menu is not spicy at all. But you can ask for hot sauce on the side.  Usually some Chinese food is made too salty, but the flavoring here wasn't too strong. The plus is that the restaurant itself is pretty clean!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place after reading good reviews both here and elsewhere.  I tried the ginger beef, a noodle dish I can't remember the name of (had shrimp in it), and a chicken dish.  Nothing was bad per se but I found everything to be rather one-note in terms of flavour.  I also got the impression that virtually everything was deep fried, then doused in a oily and spicy (albeit moderately tasty) sauce.  Overall, I felt this was a bit of a letdown."}
{"text":"This place is quite popular as there was quite a bit of crowd even during mid week. We came here for a birthday dinner (birthday person's choice not mine) as they apparently make a few dishes that are well liked.  We could have gone the set menu route as they do have those and they cover anywhere from 1 to 10 people. The combos seemed OK as there was sure to be something that wouldn't be offensive and you can cap your expense. We ordered the following Chicken Corn (decent and is more inline with what one expects it to taste)  Spring Roll (a big portion was piping hot and well like by some) Chicken with Cashew nuts (OK not as light as I would like but does the trick) Fried Chicken ball with sweet and sour sauce (Mostly batter and sweet and sour sauce wasn't good as well, I would say food court level) Chicken Manchurian (poor not what I expected as a dish synonymous to draw attention with the sizzling platter was served on a plate taste was poor as well and didn't have kick and sweet contrast that one expects) Tofu with Mixed Vegetables (OK, Tofu had a clean taste) Vegetable fried rice (meh) Shrimp with Hot Chilli (the best dish we ordered IMO we ordered it hot still it had a mid level kick) I felt bloated after the meal. Expected I suppose. This is your run of a mill place and is caters more to the western palate. Prices are reasonable.  I would say 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I went to this place for dinner on a weekday. The place is not fancy but not a diner style either. It was pretty busy. The service was prompt ...not overly friendly yet attentive. We ordered deep fried wontons for aps. 10 pcs for about $4. Really good. For mains, we got spicy peanut chicken w/ rice ($10 ish) and hakka style house noodes with chiken, pork and shrimp ($9 ish). The food was awesome. The peanut chicken was just spicy enough. It has a hint of sweetness which was not something I expected. The noodles were good too. One thing that I really liked was that the food arrived very quickly...and when you are starving this is a huge plus! I am full but can still go eat a bit of the peanut chicken! One thing I thought I'd bring up is that if you are against food colour, you might wanna give your food order a bit of thought. Give this place a try..."}
{"text":"We were seated right away at 9:00 on a Friday night. I knew I liked it from the minute I saw that Evan William's Black Label was $6 vs the $5 for all the standard whiskeys. Our spring roles came out and just tasted like greasy cabbage. We couldn't tell which was veggie and which was shrimp. That's why I dropped one star. The crispy ginger beef was fantastic along with the pot stickers (maybe they were wantons, I always mix those two up) and fried rice.   The lady was sweet and silly. She even offered to create a phony receipt to hide the liquor once she realized I was using an expense account (which is why I added the star back from the spring roll misgivings). But she said that after we were all done and I was within our policy (which is why I took that star away again). I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch. I have never been for dinner. Their crispy ginger beef is delicious, along with many other dishes.  Their services is fast. The food is consistent. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Terrible food- taste and quality wise. Gave my wife and I a tummy ache. Never going back. We love trying authentic and hole in the wall kinda places but this restaurant is definitely not one we will go back to."}
{"text":"So sad about this closure. Where will I get cashew chicken with Szechuan sauce now?? Ugh!!  it's not your regular cashew chicken. It had a brown sauce and only celery, water chestnut and cashews with chicken. I'm so saddened. They made it the best since Young Lok that was in village by the grande a looooong time ago. If somebody knows where I can get this dish please help meeee!!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Spadina Garden when it was on Spadina near College. They never disappoint. Wonderful flavours, friendly, speedy courteous service, unpretentious and well-deserving of its popularity. Try every version of the hot spicy peanut dish that you can (chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu). Don't forget to ask for water."}
{"text":"I go in person and order for home delivery and this place is in my top 10. The Beef Fried Noodles are AMAZING! Service is fast and efficient, wait staff is friendly and helpful. Clean , fresh and consistently good food."}
{"text":"On vacation in Toronto, I was craving Chinese food. I'd walked by Spadina Garden a few times this week and decided to step inside and give it a try.  Immediately the guy at the front is trying to push the spicy peanut chicken on me, but i'm not a big fan of peanuts in my meals, so I turn it down. I ask a few questions about other things on the menu, just to see if they're prepared differently from what I'm used to in the bay area. I decide at first go to with the Szechuan chicken, but they tell me its only prepared with green peppers and celery. I like a little more vegetables in my stir fry, so I go with the chicken and garlic sauce with mixed vegetables, and the Singapore noodles. Again, he asks me if I want the peanut chicken. No.  We make a little conversation, I mention that I'm visiting from California. \"Oh, you should really try the peanut chicken.\" WHAT??? Not being funny, but please send me a comment if you know what peanuts have to do with California, because I really don't have any idea.  Anyway, 4 minutes later my food is ready. (4 minutes, really?) The sauce on the stir fry is thick and bleh, the vegetables are over cooked (in 4 minutes???), and the chicken tastes like it was boiled and then added to the stir fry at the last minute. The Singapore noodles were okay, but nothing special.  I'll probably visit Toronto again, but highly doubt I'll be coming to this restaurant again. However if I do, I think I'll have the peanut chicken. I think he was trying to tell me something, I just didn't listen..."}
{"text":"Hot, hot, hot!     The food that is...  We went for the Szechuan dinner for 2 plus an order of Curry Beef just to round out the selection.    All were very good - the peanut chicken was definitely my favorite with the fried rice a close second.   Normally I'd put the rice in the afterthought category but this was darn good.  The food is definitely not for the faint of heart - if you don't like spicy, you don't want to say \"ok\" when they ask if you want it hot!"}
{"text":"We just ordered delivery from Spadina Garden based on some of the reviews here. The reviews themselves were mixed, but I liked their menu offerings when I checked them out on line. We ordered:  Mandarin Pancake Vegetable Spring Rolls Crispy Ginger Beef Cantonese Chow Mein Crispy Duck  First of all, the spring rolls were absolutely disgusting. I mean, how can you fuck up a spring roll? Really. They had the most odd flavour-- as though they had been fried in rancid oil or something. I threw most of mine out.  Ginger Beef was basically just some flour dredged beef thrown in the deep fryer and covered in a red spicy sauce that was so sweet that it overtook any ginger flavour that might have been lurking.  Cantonese Chow Mein was very weak. Again--- some gloopy red sauce, soft wimpy noodles and overall the most disappointing Chow Mein I've tasted.  Crispy Duck. Ok, it was crispy but it was dry and chewy like shoe leather and wood shavings. I question how old this duck actually was (both in freshness and age).  The Mandarin pancake was ok.   Do yourself a favour and don't order food from Spadina Garden, unless you're really drunk and It's the only place left to eat on earth. We wasted over $60 + tip and are now sad and regretful. I'm sure post-digestion regret will be equally as painful."}
{"text":"I come here because my friends like the food here.  Me?  Not so much.  There are much better options for spicy Chinese food.  The menu here is over-salted, over-sauced, and lacking in any subtly that make good Chinese food (Northern, Hakka, Cantonese, Shanghai, anything!!) really shine.  The word that comes to mind is 'heavy-handed'.  The portions are decent, the service friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing!  What a great meal!  I liked the Szechuan influence.  We had the string beans, which were slightly spicy, but not too spicy, along with a shrimp and mixed vegetable.  Everything arrived quickly, was fresh and tasty, the service was great, can't believe how cheap the meal was!  The decor is upscale, but it is also comfy at the same time - you can go either way. Would definitely come back again - this place is on my top 10 for Chinese in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I am not proud of writing this review. I do however think that this needs to be brought to the attention of the internet as it poses a real and distinct health and safety issue.  Last night my girlfriend and I went to Spadina Garden. They have previously provided a good rendition of the classic (in Calgary) Crispy Ginger Beef. Along with the beef we got Spicy Peanut Chicken and House Noodles. As it was a lot of food we decided to take the leftovers home. The next day I went to reheat the left over food that was placed by the waitress into a take out container, tide up in a bag and handed to me. I opened the bag, dumped the food onto a big plate and nuked it for a min or so. I then dug in. There is something classic about leftover Chinese food and I was enjoying it. I scooped up a chunk of beef and some of the sauce and took a nice big bite. I was faced with the beef, ginger sauce and a questionable tough piece of something. Then it hit me, the unmistakable flavour of a cigarette butt. I spit it out and dissected the mystery item. It was in fact the reminiscent of a disgusting habit. There was a f*****g cigarette butt in my food. I swashed what was about a half bottle of mouthwash, brushed my teeth several times and called the restaurant.  Now in most customer service oriented industries when face with a customer who just ate a contaminated dish the proprietor of the establishment should meet this with concern and compassion this was not the case with the owner. He called me a liar and hung up. I called back, explained it was a health concern and that it needs to be taken seriously. He told me I must have put the butt in the food and it didn't come from him. I asked him how I opened a sealed container that was in a bag and put a butt in there when I don't smoke. He asked me how I got home and said someone must have flicked it in there. The probability of someone coming up to me on the street, open the bag, flicked a butt in there and tied it all back up without me noticing was impossible.  To that he said he didn't have time and hung up. I called back again and spoke with a female employee (May). She was sympathetic and fairly professional about the entire event. She offered me a free Ginger Beef, great thanks. I went on to explain the health implication of serving contaminated food. She then offered me a free meal for two and accidents happen. I figured I was getting nowhere. I thanked her and ended the conversation.  The lesson here is simple, don't eat here.  Not only is it obvious that they don't take food safety seriously but they don't take customer service seriously. So unless you feel like getting mediocre food that is prepped with questionable food handling and an owner that doesn't really care then this is the joint for you."}
{"text":"Has anyone writing these reviews ever been to a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles or even Vancouver BC?    I grew up on the east coast and was subjected to many years of poor quality Chinese food.  I mean real crap.  At one point I even thought that \"Crab Rangoon\" was an actual dish.  First of all, what the fuck is a Rangoon!? Second of all, show me a Chinese person who eats cream cheese!  This place tastes quite a bit like the Chinese restaurants I grew up with in Washington DC and in Florida.  The food is bland, over-sauced and generally not interesting.  I didn't know any better until I spent some time in LA.  The Chinese food is AMAZING there.  Have you seen how many Chinese people there are in LA?  Since then my barometer for good ethnic food is simply to make sure there is a high quantity of THOSE (you people!) flavour of people in the area.  It's pretty much worked my entire life since then.    Want good Indian food? Take your burgundy minivan to Brampton.  Craving poutine? Go to Montreal.  Is there any good Mexican food here? SEE ANY MEXICANS?????  So where the hell is my good Chinese food in Toronto?"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Chinese takeout restaurant for a long time and I had high hopes with Spadina Garden.   We ordered for take out and it was OK.   Spicy peanut beef - was really good and flavorful... salty but would be great on white rice.   Spring rolls - were disgusting. They smelt and tasted like cow manure and were very greasy.   Sweet and sour chicken balls - these were pretty good.   House special fried noodles - Not bad but I've had better noodle dished from other restaurants. Seemed over cooked but that could be because it sat for a while before we were able to pick it up.   I think that the gross spring rolls set the precedent for the meal and if they were better the whole experience would have been alot better.   We may have just ordered the wrong things as it seems like many people love this place."}
{"text":"Really fast and cheap place.  This place is really not for me, but if you are looking for a Chinese restaurant that offers really good food this is the place to be.  The sauces are a bit heavy so if you don't like sauces that have a lot of salt in it, I wouldn't recommend it.  Great service, the people are really nice and friendly. Always greeting you with a smile!  Spiciness is okay, but it's not what you except. At least for me since i'm a very big spice fan. It's a meh. But for it's prices, it's really great."}
{"text":"Convenient to my hotel, not far from Yonge/Dundas. Was seated immediately, our order was taken promptly and the food was delivered shortly thereafter. Everything was good. The orange beef was especially appealing. I will return."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Staff remember you and the food is awesomely good."}
{"text":"Facing the Canadian Tire store at the Eaton Centre and City Hall, this restaurant by Bay and Dundas Streets is in a busy intersection. Great appetizers and soups, but the dishes are flat and from my experience not traditional Chinese. Ordered Lo Mein and the noodles used where vermicelli, while at restaurants in New York and elsewhere use thicker noodles and have a lot more flavor. Beautiful dining room and kind service adds an extra star to this review, but will prefer to go to Chinatown for a more flavorful meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a good choice for Chinese food, if you are in this area or Toronto. Nice atmosphere and a really good menu selection, especially the Vegetarian offerings. The food is really good and reasonably priced.  My only complaints, which kept me from giving this place a 4-star rating are: 1- One of the dishes they sent us was not what we ordered, but it was not a big issue (similar item), and; 2 - They did not provide rice with the entries.  Other than my only 2 complaints, I would definitely eat here again (either lunch or dinner) if ever in this area of Toronto again."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good! Came here for lunch and was able to get a table right away.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and modern.  There was a whole page of lunch specials, all rice dishes.  Each meal comes with hot tea, soup (wonton or hot & sour), and small bowl of rice for $10-12.  The service was quick and friendly.  They brought out hot tea as soon as we sat down.  My friend ordered the Hunan Beef and that dish came out right away like it was already ready.  I ordered the Szechuan Fish lunch special $10 and it was delicious!  The fish was nicely breaded and covered in a red sauce.  As a matter of fact, as I looked around, all the meals seem to have the same red coloring/sauce.  I wish there was just a little more rice, but that's just me.  They have noodle dishes, but they are not part of the lunch special."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years - always awesome - try the Dry shredded beef and house special fried rice.   Busy at lunch time, so get there early!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here was great, they offer a large menu with a variety of different choices that will catwr to anyones preferences.   I ordered their chow mein noodles that had shrimp, beef, chicken and veggies all mixed into it. It was a good sized portion and quite flavourful as well. Also had an order of rhe szechuan chicken which was a little on the spicy side. It came with green bell peppers and celery added into the mix. The quality of the chicken was also good.  Also ordered a veggie springroll to start which was a very big size, larger than I had anticipated.   They provide complimentary tea for your meal, and the staff is friendly and attentive. Everything cost about $30 with tax and tip included."}
{"text":"Neither a garden, nor on Spadina, Spadina Garden is an average Chinese restaurant with a Szechuan twist.  I've eaten here many times over the years as it's a decent, consistent and clean Chinese restaurants.  Unfortunately, most of Toronto's best Chinese restaurants are in the suburbs, but we'll take what we can get.  Here are some of the dishes I've ordered:  1) Wonton in spicy peanut sauce - picture eating wontons covered in melted peanut butter with added spiciness.  I love peanut butter and spices so it was a no brainer for me.  It's not like the typical kind you usually find.  2) Spicy beef noodle soup - succulent and juicy beef brisket in a spicy oily broth.  The noodles are on the thicker side but are a bit soft.  They're not as al dente as other restaurants.    3) Spicy peanut chicken - really salty and not the biggest fan.  It is spicy though.  And there are peanuts.  4) Cantonese Chow Mein - the noodles weren't really all that crispy (which is the way I like 'em).  5) Szechuan Cabbage Pork Noodle Soup - pretty decent soup.  You have to know what to expect before ordering.  It's a pretty inoffensive noodle soup with medium-sized noodles, cabbage and pork.  The broth is salty (but not overly so) and it's clear.  it's a nice dish to have when it's cold out.  I'm also happy to report that the bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Would not call this Chinese food. The service and the environment are quite nice, however the dishes are over sauced and non of the ones we ordered really stood out. I would say that this is a heavily heavily westernized \"Chinese\" restaurant. If you're looking for a real fix of Chinese food, you should probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This to me has been an icon for over 15 years.  We even held a customer event at this venue several times as it was just that good.  Their value in the Chinese food chain is that they offer Hakka. Hakka is where the Chinese emigrated to India and used local spices in their tradition dishes.  Hakka Chicken Chow mein  and Manchurian Beef are the staples as well as traditional Chinese dishes.  So if you like Indian and Chinese and get confused then just be calm and have Hakka and your dining partners can have Hakka or have the usual Chinese fair.  I would add that for many the Hot and Sour soup is such a variable but I really enjoy there version of it and is highly recommended.  I brought my picky children here when they were tweens and enjoyed the traditional food and it has taken me a long time to get them into Hakka. Just order the singapore or curry noodles and they wont figure it out.  as usual skip the spring and egg rolls and save the money for an ice cream down the street or for a shared dish or too if you are a group  ?? (tsai5gien5) ?? (bai5bai5) (goodbye!)"}
{"text":"This is very good food. Terrific hot oil dumplings,  superb orange beef, shrimp (nice and fat) with ginger and scallions, and spicy peanut chicken. Leaves a full stomach and a pleasant burn in the mouth."}
{"text":"Fast and cheap, you get what you pay for. But if you're looking for good old Chinese fast food it's a great place!!   Don't expect much, this is not your Hugh end Chinese restaurant. Oh and request no MSG, you can taste the difference. I had a vegetarian tofu dish and I really enjoyed it. I wish the descriptions of the dishes were a little better but it was so cheap, I can't complain."}
{"text":"I see a lot of people on here praising Spadina Garden for their Crispy Ginger Beef. Granted, the beef is quite good, but I'm amazed that there is no love for their wonderful Ginger Chicken!  I fondly recall many late nights spent working nearby, rewarding myself with a take out order of the delicious dish.  Spadina Garden is a little pricey, but you pay a premium for good Chinese food outside of Chinatown. They have a huge delivery area, and orders always arrive well before the promised time.  Yes, the Crispy Ginger Beef is good, but so is the Ginger Chicken! If you're not a fan of spicy dishes, order the non-spicy version and save your tongue."}
{"text":"Spadina Garden came highly recommended by several friends. Unfortunately our experience did not live up to the hype.   We ordered spring rolls to start, followed by the house fried noodles (vegetable), orange chicken, spicy peanut chicken, crispy duck, and crispy chili chicken. All of the dishes, including the spring rolls, were swimming in oil to the point of being almost inedible.  The spicy peanut dish had a really nice flavour, and would have been great if not for the oil. On the positive side, the restaurant itself was clean and modern, and the service was very quick."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken cashew chicken, no 67 I believe... I'd get #67 if I were you. Fast, friendly.  Great food, bit pricey.  I think this was Roger Ebert's favourite Toronto restaurant... I think..."}
{"text":"A co-worker took me here a couple years ago b/c it was a cheap, quick and tasty place for lunch.  So when a couple of my friends wanted to meet up for lunch downtown I suggested this place.  It was easy to get a spot, which I was a bit surprised about b/c it was jam packed when I came with my co-worker.  I guess it was a bit on the later side of lunch.  It's a big space, so good for groups.    Service is quick and friendly, which is really good if you're on a time crunch.  At the same time though, you know that some of this stuff has to be pre-made to come out that quick.  Fortunately, I have never had an issue with something tasting try, cold or like it had been sitting out for a long time.  They must have a quick turnover.    Between the 3 of us, we ordered the lemon chicken, sweet and sour chicken and a tofu dish (the name escapes me).  Each dish came with steamed white rice, soup and tea.  We also ordered onion pancakes (a favorite of mine which I don't see too often!).  The portions were perfect for lunch.  There was barely anything left on our plates.  Everything tasted great, though I wish the onion pancakes were a bit more fluffy.    With tax and tip, it came to $15 each for us.  Not bad with the amount of food we had.  My 2 friends hadn't been there before and really enjoyed themselves.  1 had even said that this place was recommended by another friend.    I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever gone to a Chinese restaurant and liked everything I ordered besides Szechuan Gourmet...  This place is equal, if not better then Szechuan Gourmet ! MOST: you have to order the crispy Ginger beef! It's soo addictive, I could eat the whole dish myself! Every piece of beef was excellent and lots of flavour. Almost like candy I loved it so much! The vegetable spring rolls were a fare size, bigger then average Chinese joints and the plum sauce is your average tasting sauce, which I like. Some homemade sauces taste very strange if you're not used to them.  The sweet and sour chicken balls were ever so soft and the sauce didn't taste like pour ketchup either. That bugs me so much, I could just take a bottle of ketchup and pour it on myself! Spadina Garden has a nice tasting sauce. Vegetable fried noodles has no surprising veggies, but were a bit bland.. Could use a little more kick. The only thing I didn't like that I ordered was the general Tao's  chicken, only because the chicken was all dark meat. If you want white meat you have to ask for it, which I will do for next time. I will be coming back to Spandina Garden! PS DON'T FORGET TO ORDER THE CRISPY GINGER BEEF! (:"}
{"text":"Got take out from here and decided it may be one of the better take out options in Toronto, as least as far as Chinese food is concerned.   It's good for the following reasons  - the menu is extensive and well priced - the food is quite delicious - they accept credit card over the phone (cash only delivery sucks) - delivery was fast  Conclusion: Although this isn't your typical Chinatown dirty after hours find, the place seems to be legit clean and the food is good."}
{"text":"My coworkers from out of town come here every time they're downtown for a meeting and I tried it for the very first time today. Great price, great meal. Had the crispy ginger chicken. It was crispy, but not burnt and savoury - the perfect texture.  Really busy at lunch and they messed up our bills so just watch for that. No issues getting it sorted out however."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Spadina Garden for the first time tonight. Called our order in at 6:30pm (on a sunday night), the food didn't arrive until after 7:20pm. We ordered the crispy fried wonton appetizer, beef fried rice, general tso chicken, ginger beef, and mixed vegetable. When we opened the bag, the chicken and beef had leaked EVERYWHERE! Everything was covered in red sauce and it made a mess of our kitchen. Also, no sauce on the meat because it had all leaked out. Most of the items we ordered were tasty, but the wontons are NOT worth it. Very small and not that great.  I found it a bit pricey for what we got, as well, with a total of $58 for our order."}
{"text":"Been going to Spadina Gardens for years and have always enjoyed the food. A must try is the crispy ginger beef and the peanut spicy beef.  Family owned and run, always friendly and good service"}
{"text":"I  ordered a chilli chicken from here with hot and sour soup and a spicy noodle dish, not one of these dishes tasted the way they were supposed to and I was very disappointed with my food."}
{"text":"WOW...colour me Impressed. When my partner suggested lunch at Spadina Garden, I will admit I was a bit hesitant...as I thought it would be that bastardized American/Chinese crap. Well, I'll be the first to admit I was wrong. We arrived and the place was fairly packed, but the woman working the cash/hostess station was efficient and had everything laid out perfectly...so we were seated with no wait. Our waiter was out fairly quickly with Chinese tea, and promptly took our order. We settled on the lunch specials....2 wonton soups, 2 bowls of white rice and 1 order of Spicy Beef with Peanuts and 1 order of Chilli Chicken. The wonton was excellent...it came with 3 big wontons and was pretty salty (but that seems par for the course whenever I order wonton soup). The chilli chicken was good...not the best I've ever had, but not the worst either. The star of the show was the Spicy Beef with Peanuts....it was flavourful, spicy and deelish ! Despite our comment (when the food was brought out) that we wouldn't be able to eat it all...somehow we had none left when we finally stopped scarfing our food down. All in all...I was fairly impressed and would go back. Lunch, with the above items and 1 Diet Coke, tax in, came to $27."}
{"text":"We ordered the spicy peanut chicken randomly and it turned out to be really good. The other items here we ordered does not taste authentic like the double sautéed pork, and the red braised beef noodle soup, compared some of the other places I've been vs. similar dishes I had in China whilst travelling in those regions.  However, they were pretty good nevertheless in terms of the texture and the taste. The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Very happy with this place. Quaint place and great for lunch and shared meals.  Below is a list of dishes I tried. I recommend the Shrimp with Bean Sprouts as it is really nice and sweet offsetting the spicy dishes.  Shrimp with Bean Sprouts Beef with Black Bean Sause Hunan Beef Home Style Bean Curd Szechuan Fish  The bean curd could be nicer~"}
{"text":"The lunch special is one of the best deals in the area. Hot and sour soup is always a pleasure. For the main I like the spicy peanut chicken or the hot beef and vegetables -- the beef is always really tender and the veg includes some good leafy Chinese greens.  As well, I'm in their delivery area and order from them regularly. Portions are generous and delicious. The spicy chicken, General Tso, and garlic eggplant are always good."}
{"text":"Pretty meh Westernized Chinese with a servers who aren't very well-informed.  The hotel told me that they delivered numerous times in the past to their guests.  Apparently, the restaurant did not know this and passed the phone to 3 different people before confirming that they did deliver to Le Germain.  Anyhow, it took a good hour to deliver 3 dishes.  The food was pretty bland, too, although the chicken slices were tender and the cashews fresh.  We had the cashew chicken, moo shu chicken, and seaood tofu casserole.  Nothing amazing but it was slightly better than the typical US takeout restaurant.  The sauces were slightly bland but at least there wasn't a discernible amount of MSG."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, and not greasy like other Asian food I have tried. I had the pork fried dumplings which were great, vegetable fried rice which was fresh and so good, and the crispy ginger beef which was had to chew but tasty! Would try again!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years, it's staff at first may seem standoffish, but once you get to know them they can be quite entertaining!  Favourites are a MUST which are chicken corn soup, hunan beef, chili chicken, peanut tofu, and not for the faint of heart....shredded tofu (Very spicy!)"}
{"text":"Great food and seafood is good. Portions are ok. Spring rolls are great. I'm definitely a recurring client."}
{"text":"Terrible, over-priced, and very little service throughout your meal. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Toronto has some terrific Chinese food and Spadina Garden is right at the top. A spicy and Szechuan style of food if you're looking for something with a little kick but tons of flavor this is your place.   I often take out from this restaurant so cannot really comment on the service in the restaurant.   Take out is always hot and ready when I get there, there is a need to go over the order on the phone to ensure nothing has been missed though.  The Menu   * Don't miss the spicy peanut chicken and the crispy beef.   * As most everything is great I will say that for me the soups are the weakest thing on the menu"}
{"text":"A coworker suggested this place for dinner and drinks after work because Woo Buffet was suggested but there were some that was skeptical about the cleanliness of that restaurant.  I guess I was expecting your typical Asian restaurant servers with a \"who gives a shit\" attitude and was pleasantly surprised when our server was fluent in English and was able to recommend and give comments on what to order and whether to have the dishes saucy or dry.  The restaurant was decent looking inside, and the prices were very reasonable.  We got a few drinks they had a small to medium selection of wine and served mixed drinks as well.  The alcohol really helped to wash down the greasiness of all the dishes, otherwise it would've been too much.    It's quite a nice twist to the usual Chinese food that I always go for.  The spice is nice and not too overwhelming, everything was very flavourful and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chinese food, but this joint was amazing! We had the Spicy Peanut Chicken and were delighted. The best peanut sauce I've ever had anywhere! Loved it. Cant wait to go back. The setting is typical but the service is efficient."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Spadina Garden!! after have been going to so many other Chinese restaurants in the City, I can actually say this one is one of the best!   Food is great- every dish has been a 10/10!  Service- Quick, friendly & very polite (most staff actually speak very well english)  The only 2 downfalls I would say are the hours. I believe its Sundays that they don't open until 4pm... would be a nice spot to sometimes go to during lunch hour (1-2) and also parking in that area can be a hassle and quite expensive.  Besides that, the restaurant is fantastic! Nothing fancy but def a place to check out for some tasty chinese food!"}
{"text":"We loved this place!  It is clean, the food is great, and the service is fast and friendly.    The orange chicken was moist and light, with a very tasty orange sauce.  It tasted very orangy, unlike the so-called orange chicken from the mall food court.  The Szechuan scallops and the Szechuan tofu w/eggplant were both delicious as well.  We really liked the Szechuan sauce and the side of rice was very generous.  But the star of the meal was their delectable combination house fried noodles.  It was a ginormous platter of noodles, chockful of veggies, pork, chicken, and shrimp.  My petite 13 year old daughter inhaled the dish with minimal help from the rest of us, and proclaimed her desire to come back to Toronto for another delicious plate of Spadina Garden noodles.  Too bad this was our last dinner on this trip."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The decor is minimal and certainly not the reason to dine here, but I love the food.   Fried rice is great. The crispy child shrimp is awesome and the crispy ginger beef puts a smile on my face.  Those are my go to items but everything else I have had is great too.    I like family style restaurants so going with 8 to 10 people which is my usual outing with family, the price works out great."}
{"text":"Prior to my trip to Toronto this past weekend, I made sure to do my homework when it came to food. A Top 10 of Toronto site had this as one of the top 10 Hakka restaurants in town. I didn't know what Hakka food was, so I had to do some research, and to sum it up: Chinese with a mix of Indian.  The restaurant is on Dundas, a few blocks from the Dundas-Yonge Square, Toronto's version of Time's Square, so for those in downtown, its not a far trek.  Almost everyone highly recommends the Spicy Peanuts Chicken; I do as well! This sweet-spicy chicken dish was wonderful and worth getting again."}
{"text":"GET THE CRISPY BEEF AND GENERAL TAOS CHICKEN.  You will not be disappointed! I like this restaurant so much.  Very clean, staff is friendly and food is always fresh. You get your food super fast.  The fried banana dessert is yummy.   Prices are not cheap but the quality of food is outstanding."}
{"text":"This place has consistently delicious food. My favourites are chili chicken, spicy peanut chicken and ginger chicken, but their other dishes are good as well. If you go during lunch hours you get either a wonton or a hot and sour soup with your meal. If you're looking for a flavourful meal, this is the place.."}
{"text":"After trying the Spicy Peanut Chicken (Hunan dish) last night, I am now a fan of Spadina Garden.  When dining here, stick with the spicy Sichuan/Hunan dishes.    Their Sichuan Spicy Peanut Wontons (same thing as Szechuan Hot Oil Dumplings) are very good.  I'm a sucker for spicy peanut flavoured dishes.    One great thing about Spadina Garden is that it's in close proximity to Dudas Square, so you don't have to trek all the way to Chinatown for a good authentic Chinese meal."}
{"text":"Ahhh Spadina Garden. Which is nowhere close to Spadina. Or a garden, for that matter. The restaurant is actually at Bay & Dundas, on a stretch of a gazillion sketchy looking restaurants. It gets a lot of tourist business from the Eaton Centre because it looks like a typical Chinese restaurant you'd see anywhere in the world.  And it is a safe bet. They've got the plastic tablecloths, jasmine tea and sweet and sour pork. Their menu has comprehensible English descriptions, and nothing is too authentically Chinese to scare off the non-Asian tourists. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but it's just a safe place for people who are intimidated by real Chinatown joints.  Staff here are so friendly though -- I remember one of the older men working there who just couldn't stop smiling. Expect good service and good food, and I think they just wrapped up some renovations so check them out."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for a casual Friday night dinner. I ordered the crispy general tso. My friend got his food in record time and mine came about 10 minutes later with no apology or anything. Weird.   They seem more interested in getting people in and out rather than serving good food."}
{"text":"My Indian friend highly recommended this place to me.  I so wanted to give this place a good rating because the owner kept popping by and was extremely friendly and charismatic, but the food overall was not anything to write home about - I ordered the Tai Lo noodles in soup and my boyfriend ordered the beef in black bean sauce which came with rice and wonton soup.    As others have said, when you come here you are not coming for super authentic Chinese food - it's like going to Spring Rolls (which also happens to be down the street on Dundas).  Granted, I'm not an expert in Szechuan or Hunan food, but it was missing the \"wok air\" that I've come to expect from Cantonese food.  The soup was also very starchy and glutinous.  My boyfriend enjoyed his black been beef (he is not Chinese, however.... and he likes Spring Rolls.  Doh.)  Come here if you are in the neighbourhood and looking for friendly service and to fill in any stomach crevasses.  I may return again to try some spicy dishes."}
