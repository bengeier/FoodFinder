{"text":"The pho broth here is really tasty, very authentic and the owner is the sweetest woman. The food came out quickly and the meat portion was bigger than other places in town. Came here after trying another new pho place down the street that did not live up to the ratings. This place deserves better ratings!"}
{"text":"They have some of the best Phó I've ever had. I always get a sandwich with my soup. The owner is extremely nice and was very helpful.  I live on the other side of town and will drive from southpoint area to here just for the great food.  They are very cheap for superb food. A hidden gem indeed. If you are in the area and are wanting to try some authentic Vietnamese food I'd highly recommend this place.  Not to mention the price for the proportions of the food is crazy good. Huge bowl of Phó and a huge traditional Vietnamese sandwich for about 11 dollers."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese food-to-go restaurant is a remake of the Nhu Y Vietnamese Restaurant that closed down years ago. I was excited that the place is back but became disappointed after eating here.   This restaurant is located in the Greenland supermarket foodcourt. So it's convenient to grab a bite and then into the store to go grocery shopping.  The only reason why I like this restaurant is that they have authentic dishes that other Vietnamese restaurants do not sell. Their rice combos are great if you want a taste of different dishes but don't want the full order. I like the catfish and the pork with rice. Some of their appetizers are good too like the banh beo and banh bot loc. The grab and go food items on the counter tend to be a bit dry cause they have been left out. Some of those items also came from California so they aren't quiet fresh. I usually ask them to make me a new batch of those grab and go items to avoid spoiled foods.  If you are looking for quality Vietnamese food, I might suggest other restaurants. This place is best if you're looking for a fast food Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Located inside the Greenland Supermarket. In the food court to be exact.  Decided to get the brisket pho, Came in a medium size bowl. Portion of meat, noodle and broth was good. Taste was alright, but the meat was way overcoooked. Wasn't bad but didn't impress me either.  Couldn't help but put in mind how not so clean the kitchen looked. The cleanliness was definitely questionable.  I honestly don't know if I'd eat here again, only because of better choices around the area."}
{"text":"Order food from here almost weekly. The food is great and the  Pho is the best I have had here in town. The owner/employees are very friendly and nice.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Rounding up from 3.5 stars.  Got a banh mi dac biet. The bread, the most important part of any sandwich, is crusty on the outside and fluffy and soft on the inside. It wasn't TOO crusty to cut up the roof of my mouth, which is always nice. The different cuts of meat are fairly generous, thicker than Lee's that's for sure. A little light on the pate though, but I liked the fresh cucumber and the jalapenos actually had some heat.  Now it's $4 for a banh mi, which is more than what you'd find in Little Saigon in CA but would you rather have this $4 banh mi (which was enough to share with another as a mid day snack) or get a 6\" Subway (unsharable) for a dollar less? Answer is simple.  Kinh Do is still my favorite for banh mi in Vegas but if I'm on this side of Spring Mountain and want one, I'll come back to this Greenland Market food court for sure."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of the food courts back home where they serve lots of Asian cuisine, and it was a nice try.  We love cha giao and they have it on the meny for $4.95, so we orderd 2 and waited about 10 minutes for our food.  They come out hot and crispy, served only with romaine lettuce leaves, pickled carrot and radish, and their fish sauce.  It was pretty tasty and a great way to satisfy that cha giao craving on the cheap."}
{"text":"This place must be family owned because we feel nothing but love when we come!  Brought my son the first time and this time I brought my daughter. Staff very friendly and kind. They even remembered what I ordered last time because I forgot. Even though it's a 25min drive, I come to eat their delicious Vietnamese sandwiches. Meat is so tender not dry at all. Very filling and great prices. Always look forward to coming when I want to add a  little spice to my day."}
{"text":"I visited several PHO restaurants in Vegas and this place had best value and taste. Broth is good, plenty of vegis and meats. Now Im regular so they often give me extra. Very kind."}
{"text":"I use to eat that this places years ago. Good to see that they reopened. It's located in greenland.   Love me a good Banh  MI sandwich. ..    I'll be back"}
{"text":"Ha - Expression of joy surprise and triumph.   Ha - (Hawaiian) : Breath of life Ha - Name of the New owner of this Vietnamese spot that makes the tastiest, most delectable, mouthwatering, appetizing, tasty, flavorful, toothsome, palatable; succulent, luscious, scrumptious, delish, yummy, finger-licking, bowl slurping, tongue wiping, nummy, lip-smacking, melt-in-your-soul, broth I've ever had in any bowl of pho.  I usually douse it with sriracha and hoisin and yes I know, but screw you, it's my bowl and I can.  HOWEVER, this bowl of heaven was something impressive.  It needed NOTHING but my lips to slurp all this down.  Ha was kind enough to come over and explain the situation.  She comes by way of Seattle, has beautiful daughters that are all successful and grown, likes long walks on the beach and makes one god damn killer bowl of pho. cam on ban!"}
{"text":"This is a decent Vietnamese restaurant (located inside Greenland supermarket). The food is not bad, but it is best eaten THERE. My family and I have ordered to-go at this location and each and every time, they skimp out on the food (either putting very little or not including it at all! We ordered the com tam special and every time, the meat portion is half our palm size and they keep forgetting the egg AND even the fish sauce! When we've told them about it, we keep getting told they'll put more of that NEXT TIME! We don't want it next time! We should've gotten it when we ordered it! We've given this place several opportunities to redeem themselves because this place is near our home, but now we'd rather drive further out for better quality food and service."}
