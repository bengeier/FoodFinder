{"text":"Very disappointing. Went there for my wife's birthday dinner. Server was great. Everything started well & quickly went down hill. Her steak was on the well done side of med well and tough. She had ordered Medium. Incomplete order came out. When I asked about the other side it came out several minutes later undercooked. There are far better steak house choices in the area at this price range."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal last night! Great bartenders, great table service with Brad, our table of 4 all had steaks, all delicious! Sides of Brussel sprouts, mushrooms and a sweet potato were all great. We also had a fantastic and reasonably priced bottle of wine. Prices are really expensive though."}
{"text":"I'll give one star for the salad which was good, both our steaks were so gristly and fat there was no way we could chew them The very condescending waitress proceeded to tell us how they had to have fat to give them flavor, as if we had never had steak before. They were $30 steaks, at least an apology from the manager would have been nice. Will never go near the place again and will certainly tell everyone we know to avoid it. We are still seething over the treatment!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money, I had such high hopes for this place wood fired steaks. But nothing special OK service mediocre steaks. The only plus was watching the cooks add wood to the fire and very nice ambiance. Would I recommend or return nope."}
{"text":"I have been to Kosars several times. This is one of the most underrated restaurants in the city. Food is always excellent as is the service. Could be the best Prime Rib in the city I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Our experience was not a good one.  The salad bar was not good croutons were stale, there wasn't much to select not worth the $7. The cost is pricy for what you get as far as the steaks the plate was hot but my steak was cold. I did enjoy the Moscow Mule though!!"}
{"text":"My team from work thought that Kosar's Wood-Fire Grill would be a great place for our 2014 holiday gathering,
We think we made a great choice. They  are on the $$$$ side, but the menu choices and the service was great, and I love the salad bar"}
{"text":"Went for first time the other night. Kamen was our server   Excellent server, great job 
Opened with some if the best pretzel rolls I ever had.  Tender and hot
Order crab cakes. Good but not the best I have had.  Probably best in this area.

As for the two main dishes....excellent!
I had the ribeye and my wife had shrimp scampi with crab meat.
Tender, done right like I asked
Hers very good flavor.  

Overall. Great job"}
{"text":"Beautiful cozy decor but hostess was rude and  our waitress was befuddled.  She told us not to eat the round rolls if they got cold because they would be like rocks and when I tried to order a steak well done she said they only cooked rare to medium rare.  Really?  Also there are no salads on the menu but they do have a salad bar?  A very strange thing for a high end al a carte restaurant.  Food did come out promptly and was excellent.  Would probably go back but with much lower expectations. It is not the high end dining experience it is trying to be."}
{"text":"Good food, atmosphere, and service.  Maybe a little overpriced but not out of line for an upscale steakhouse and quality was good."}
{"text":"We enjoyed an amazing meal and 5-star service on a packed Friday night. Many thanks to our wonderful server Elaine for being so attentive and professional. We will definitely be back because of her."}
{"text":"First, let me start off by saying my wife and I are big Brown's fans and especially love Bernie Kosar.  We were anxious to try this new restaurant at the Hard Rock Rocksino that bears his name.  The decor was nice, especially liked walking around and looking at Kosar's memorabilia in the restaurant.  Now on to the food.  We started with the Ahi Tuna and also the Sausage Sampler appetizers.  The sausages were flavorful and we enjoyed them.  The Ahi was just ok.  Basically nothing to get too excited about.  We've had Ahi Tuna at a number of places over the years and this one was pretty bland.  For our main course my wife had the filet and I had the prime rib.  Both of these were solid.  Cooked to order and flavorful.  Prepare to pay extra for everything you would like to go along with your meal.  I wanted horseradish sauce with my prime rib ($3 for what would normally be included).  I also had a baked potato that was very large - for $8.  Fortunately I didn't have to pay extra for butter and sour cream to go with it.  My wife had mashed potatoes ($8) and a small cup of what was called brussels sprouts ($8) that was basically shredded brussels sprouts with some bacon and other stuff.  She was somewhat disappointed  with them.  She liked her mashed potatoes.  She had a glass of wine with her dinner which was priced similarly to other restaurants. When she asked the server for wine recommendations, the server told her she didn't really know anything about the wines available.  I was more in a beer mood, so our server showed me the beer list.  They were out of my first two choices, so I settled for my third choice.  Our server also said they had cocktails available, but no list because they were still working on it.  Our server was, however, friendly and polite.  When I asked what some of their more popular meal selections were, she said that it was \"basically a matter of personal preference.\"  I guess that's true, but my wife and I like hearing a new (to us) restaurant's popular items to get a feel for how we should order.  Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be returning to this restaurant.  Our total bill was over $130, for what I would consider a pretty average meal.  We are used to paying this kind of restaurant bill once or twice a month at other restaurants in Cleveland and Akron, but the quality of food here just doesn't equal what is available in those restaurants."}
{"text":"This was our fourth visit and our last. Our server was superb, but the food was horrible. Four of us had dinner and it was over $200.... I am happy to pay for food that is worth it...this was not. My husband's prime rib was a plate full of lard.....my halibut was mediocre at best. We could have used the rolls to break a window. The quality of food at Kosars has severely declined...too bad..."}
{"text":"We've been to Red, Fleming's and Morton's. This place is every bit as good any of them. Better prices and food was excellent."}
{"text":"I went with my father in-law.  We both had the prime rib special and enjoyed are meals."}
{"text":"Waited an hour on order for 2. Just pork chop and medium prime rib. The size of seating area far larger than cooking area can keep pace with. My prime rib was well done and for $25 with no side dish seemed unreasonable to rate any higher than 2 stars. Staff was friendly but experience (casino included) was ruined by long wait and underperforming kitchen. Won't be making it back."}
{"text":"My Mom, husband and myself had a great dinner on Friday, December 27th. Our server Brad was very attentive. We enjoyed the salad bar it had leaf lettuce with several toppings, cole slaw, pasta salad, brussel sprout salad, beef barley soup and fried dough with apple butter- this was a $6 add on to each entree and totally worth it.  We loved the pretzel bread served at the table with the trio of butters including mustard butter and caper butter. I had the scallops and the other two entrees were filet and ribeye- these were all very good. We ordered sides of potato gratin which was excellent and the 5 cheese mac which was dry and disappointing.  We tried three desserts; Creme brûlée (very tasty and huge in portion), cheesecake (only okay according to our cheesecake connoisseur and rather small) and the beignets with three dipping sauces (enough to share).  This restaurant is definitely worth visiting- best to request a booth table as the diners at the freestanding tables looked close to their neighbors. Good job Hard Rock and Bernie Kosar on this restaurant."}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place because of its location inside the Hard Rock Casino in the outskirts of Cleveland. Have been there several times including the evening of September 5th.  It is only above above average for a steak place.  There were three of us. We ordered two sides and three different entrees; shrimp linguini, small filet and lemon chicken.  The shrimp dish got the best review and chicken the worst. The steak was average therefore we give it 2 1/2 stars.  The two sides were the jumbo baked potato which was good and the string beans which were al dente to the max.  This place is very convenient if you want to dine and gamble and the service staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for the quality. Tuna steak and prime rib were good , but no better than you'd find at a decent chain restaurant. The vegetables that accompanied the entrees were wet and mushy. Bread and crab cake appetizer were very good. Mojito cocktail was the worst and most expensive I'd ever had. Service was somewhat slow. Not a bad experience, but certainly not worth the price. We had high hopes after looking at the menu online."}
{"text":"Overpriced food and bad service. My shrimp scampi was cold and my boyfriend's steak was under cooked and his potato was raw. The waitress had a bad attitude and was nowhere to be found. It was a tragedy just like Bernie kosar's career with the browns. Lol"}
{"text":"Good bye Mortons hello Kosars.   I had the best filet mignon that I've ever eaten at kosars.  In fact, the steak was so perfectly cooked that I went in the kitchen and shook the chefs hand. The service was excellent (thanks brad) and the food was fabulous.  Am definitely going back again."}
{"text":"The decor and presentation of the food was nice but the the taste of the food wasn't anything spectacular.  Paid a lot of money for an ok dinner and dessert."}
{"text":"Classy places usually don't have salad bars - I thought that was pretty lame. Food was really good, BUT EXPENSIVE. I had a filet (the larger one) with a topping, mashed potatoes and two beers - $80. Service was a bit slow, but we did have a party of eight, so I'll give them a break on that. Woman filling the water glasses appeared to be suffering from Bernie's \"diminishing skills\" - took her five tries to get everyone's water filled. Then she came back and said \"have you guys had enough bread? three baskets seems like enough.\" Mind you, we only had one basket of bread for the entire table. I must stress though, the food was really good - you could have cut my filet with a butter knife... but $80 seems a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Skip it! 

My husband and I came here tonight for a special occasion and while the server was great the food was anything but. 

The shrimp cocktail appetizer my hubbs got was his highlight and the cheesecake was his second. 

Both of us ordered the 6 oz filet - his came as ordered - mine was charred (I asked for medium plus but not medium well - this was dead/charcoal).  I would have taken up the offer to send it back but I wasn't even asked why I wasn't eating a filet. 

The carbonara Mac n Cheese was cheesy but bland - almost tasted like French onion soup (odd).  The sweet potato was good - the size of a football too. 

Bread service at the beginning was nice as well. 

Bill came and it was shown that my Hubbs had been served the wrong scotch and my steak (remember we both ordered the 6oz) for some reason mine - which I didn't eat more then 4 bites of and brought home for our dogs...was $38 instead of his $30!  

I would not go back - I would not send anyone there either.  Oh and when you have no bathroom in the establishment just only thru the video lottery terminals (swear to god that's exactly the terminology I was given when I asked lol) you don't make me want to spend $60+ per person again. 

Just like the real thing leaves something to be desired in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Decided to pop in while first time casino visit. Cute place ! The menu choice on the app side is small and a bit on the pricey side.  I chose the lobster mac & cheese $15 al carte ;( . Very small portion and seemed to be lobster bisque mixed with noodles and a little cheese but tasty just so little for so much.  I give them four stars for the vibe the taste and the service the price and quantity is more like 2-3 star."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. I had a special for the night of Grouper and Cajun Shrimp. It was SOOO GOOD. I also got the salad bar, which was pretty good, but the sea food chowder was the star from that. It was great! We also had lobster mac & cheese and a chocolate ganache. The ganache was TO DIE FOR. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the food. But when sitting at the bar I have had two bad experiences with one of the girls. We eat and drink at bar and the first time she refused to give us dessert because it was almost 10:00. Next time same girl refused to give us a basket of bread which we were happy to pay for. Just having drinks and wanted some bread with it. 
I asked for manager. He was very accommodating 

In my opinion this is a service business and they should bend over backwards to take care of you. This girl needs some better training. She is rude
I don't even want to go back there because of her. If she doesn't have the proper answer tell us she will check with management."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out for what we expected to be a high end, great steakhouse dinner. 
We were early for our reservation, so we sat at the bar. Seemed like a long wait to be acknowledged, but we finally got a drink. 
We were seated for dinner, in the middle of the restaurant; not the best 
place. But hey, it was a Saturday night and busy. And we had made our reservations that night. So, that could be attributed to our fault. 
We were attended to right away. But that was the end of that. The waitress disappeared for extremely long times. My prime rib, which she recommended, was cooked medium well or well done. I ordered medium. In a real steakhouse, this would have came out with a pink center. There was no pink in this one. The waitress checked on us after my taking my first bite. The first bite was well done, but I thought when I got into it  a little it would be cooked correctly. I had to ask another waiter twice to get her. Like I said earlier, she disappeared for extremely long lengths of time before checking on us. She finally came back, and I showed her my meat. She immediately said, \"You're right\" and whisked it away. My first piece of meat, although way overlooked was beautiful. The replacement piece, although cooked correctly, was full of fat. And had no flavor!  Similar to what you get in low end restaurants. My husband ordered the Delmonico steak. Although he ordered medium also; his meat was cooked correctly, but:  No flavor!
In closing, for a high end restaurant, the service was horrible and the food wasn't much better. Don't waste your money!!  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very attractive restaurant, upscale football theme. Friendly staff. The food was less than good. 

The Wild Alaskan Salmon ($25) way overcooked and burnt. 

The \"19\" steak ($43), the favorite on the menu, endorsed by Bernie Kosar. Basically this is the top recommended item on the menu. My boyfriend is the least pickiest eater I know and he said it tasted like a cigarette. I'm sorry, Kosar. Kitchen needs a little sprucing up."}
{"text":"From start to finish (which came 25 minutes later than it should have because of poor service), this was a miserable experience. If you are fortunate enough to make it into the restaurant without having been run over by a traffic jam of motorized scooters in the \"Rocksino,\" you will be seated in what appears to be an upscale steak house. But looks are deceiving. The \"upscale\" salad bar is filled with uninspiring basics, such as you might find at your local Ruby Tuesdays. I made the mistake of ordering Surf and Turf.  Little did I know at the time that, apropos of the restaurant's namesake, the \"Surf\" (judging from its size, the tail of a dwarf lobster) turned out to be the rubbery consistency of a football, and the \"Turf\" a nondescript, tasteless cut of beef, might just as well have been cut from the same dirt in which Bernie drew up his last, legendary touchdown pass to Michael Jackson (née Dyson, or was it the other way around). Not to be outdone by the poor quality food, the service was equally subpar. We waited interminably for each course, which, given how unappetizing the food turned out to be, might have been a blessing in disguise were it not for the fact that we had a concert to attend.

This was our first (and last) visit to Kosar's. Perhaps it may once have been a quality restaurant. But, at least as of recently, it had -- as someone once said -- suffered from diminished skills."}
{"text":"Never offered dessert... food was cold... lip stick stain on the wine glass... service was terrible... only two out of four of the sides were brought.... one steak was over cooked, then when they came to discuss the problem, they totally ignored the fact that the rest of our food was cold, blamed the steak being over cooked on the lighting and only took the steak off and ignored the fact that our food was cold."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had in a while. The best thing about the meal was the bread and pretzel rolls. Ordered filet and ribeye, came out cold and over cooked. Both were redone but came out barely warm. Manager tried everything she could to take care of us. Will give this place some time to get it together and give it another try as it has great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great meal, friendly service, price was well below what we thought. Had two meals, two appetizers, two sides, a bottle of wine, a beer and split a desert. $162. We thought we'd be at $200 easy. It's not a super quiet dinner, but you are in a Rocksino. Great spot for our anniversary. My steelers fan wife even liked the Browns decor."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I haven't reviewed Kosar's yet!!  First of all \"gamble - eat/drink - gamble\" is ALWAYS a great combination!

Kosar's is nestled in the far corner of the Rocksino in Northfield, Ohio.  Its swanky open bar area is an alert that one is entering hallowed ground.  Its serenity is surprising compared to the musical barrage of slots (though only steps away).  

My husband and I have dined here a handful of times.  Our first occasion was his birthday when he ran around the beautiful restaurant looking at memorabilia on the walls (sometimes glimpsing over a patron's head to read a Bernie Kosar stat or two).  I had to get clearance from casino security to bring him a wrapped gift box (a SWISS Army watch I had bought him) in order to bring it through the casino to present it to him at dinner.  THAT made my gift all the more special!

The steaks at Kosar's are TO DIE FOR!!!  The aged beef and presentation surpass any other area high-end grille.  We have had the strip, prime rib, filet and ribeye.  AMAZING and sweet and succulent and silky!  The sides are a la carte and are pricey but HUGE.  The mashed potatoes will definitely serve two people.

I do want to give a special mention to the bread assortment... it is SO lovely!  The bread basket reminds me of an assortment that I might be served in France.  

The service is excellent!  Servers seem to sense the needs of the patron and do not hover or interrupt conversations at the table.  They are there when needed and are extremely personable.

Our only regret is that we haven't seen Bernie in person on any of our visits.  That's okay though... we can just retire to the slots and hope for next time!!!"}
{"text":"Were in visiting my in laws from Arizona. My Mother in Law wanted to take us to Kosars for dinner. We had a reservation but still took forever to be seated. The waitress took forever to get to us. When she finally came, we ordered a bottle of wine. It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to show up with the wine. We asked her to repeat the specials and she acted annoyed for asking. We asked for bread and after 20 minutes, we had to ask someone else. He brought it right away. The waitress kept saying she needed to take care of people first who were going to the Kenny G concert. So we weren't attending the concert so that meant we had to wait. Everyone got the steak special and I got the Halibut. The steaks were very thin and small. No one ordered desert because we were tired of waiting. 
If all of that wasn't bad enough, hen got back to our hotel, I started to feel very sick. An hour and a half after we ate, I couldn't hold anything in. I hugged the toilet for an hour. My fish obviously wasn't handled right. The last thing I expected was to get any kind of food poisoning. Needless to say, none of us will be going back, EVER. I wish I would have read all of the horrible reviews before we went."}
{"text":"Went to make a reservation on OpenTable at two days out, no good times were available.  Checked back morning of, and suddenly the whole calendar opened up.   I'm left to wonder if there were mass cancellations or if they just save space for their slot VIPs. 

Pluses for:
Free parking.
A walk through the casino. 
Plenty of people watching. 

The restaurant hostess stand appeared to be in chaos.  When it became obvious no one greeted us, the manager came up and intervened.  We diverted to the bar for drinks.  

The bar looked classy and stylish, the seats have a pigskin finish as well as the menus.  Nice touch for a football themed restaurant.  Sadly, the entire bar area needed a good sweeping, there was crumbs all over the floor.  Missing was a bar cocktail menu.  Three months open and the bartenders are still waiting for one.  So I ask about signature drinks--nothing.  The response was that they are a full service bar and can make anything.  

One thing they apparently can't make is a good wine menu.  Honestly, this was largely a gas station selection of lower quality wines.  Hence why a typical bottle was only $25.

We checked back in to get a table as the hostess stand didn't call anyone out, nor did they have pagers.  We could have easily been forgotten at the bar. 

Our table was in the middle of the restaurant. Not the greatest location, but there was at least a little space between tables. The server introduced herself, but seemed cold and disengaged.  Maybe having a bad day, or just didn't want to be there.  I'm not asking for an entertainer, or a therapist, but some personality wouldn't hurt.

Back to when I first sat down, I noticed that the napkin was ripped.  I alerted the hostess and she went to grab another.  In poor form she threw it at a waiter like a Bernie pass to Webster Slaughter.  My wife was more ticked than I was, noting that someone had to manually fold the napkin and still had the nerve to put it out for dinner service.

Dinner service appeared to be like a football play on TV being run in slow motion replay.  No sense of urgency with anything, other than at the end trying to get rid of us. 

Kosar's menu is small. Your basic cuts of steak, 4-5 seafood dishes, very basic apps and a list of sides.  They offered bread, but neglected to give us pretzel bread, we only got the sesame roll. So I had to ask for pretzel bread. Very inconsistent.

We ordered a bottle of wine for the table, they delivered a chiller, but the wine bottle itself was stored warm.

Kosar's food was a big disappointment.  Their pretzel bread was soaked in butter, unmanageable with hands.  Forced to use a fork, the rib eye steak was poorly seasoned, devoid of taste, just not a good cut of meat. I felt robbed.  Their fries were completely inedible. Covered in seasoning so much so that they'd burn the tongue on impact.  The manager was nice enough to remove the fries from the bill.  Dessert was redeeming, but it takes a lot of work to mess up sweets.

For the guy coming here on a casino comp that dresses in blue jeans and a T-shirt treating a napkin as a bib (I saw two fancy this style) this has to be amazing. Much better than the strip steaks for $4 at their local bar.  For all others this is the Dawg Pound of fine dining.  Casino steakhouses in this country usually have a reputation for fine dining--lower the expectations at Kosar's and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here tonight before attending a show. Started with the crab cake appetizer, it was sweet and decadent. For dinner I got the 10 Oz prime beef and the hubby got the pork chop, with grilled asparagus & mac n cheese carbonara to share as sides. Everything was prepared good and piping hot to our liking. The bread basket and butter sampling was delicious too. Too full to try a dessert, maybe  next time. :-)  if we had one complaint it would be the service is on the slower side, so leave yourself plenty of time to enjoy dinner if attending a show at the velvet room."}
{"text":"Food, excellent. But it stops there. $43 for a steak and a serve yourself salad bar. Really.. Again, the food was good but come on now. No plates ready, to long for drinks to come, empty plates on table way to long. Really it was likely just our waitress. She was friendly but not very attentive. Not what I would expect when dropping almost $200 on a night out."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for my birthday on April 2, 2014.  The food itself was amazing.  The service is a little on the slow side but isn't so bad that we wouldn't be back.  We ordered the bacon wrapped scallops and the sausage platter for apps.  The scallops were cooked perfectly but $13 for 2 scallop is a little pricey.  The sausages were amazing as well but yet again $9 for 3 half pieces of sausage is little pricey.  Many people have mentioned how wonderful the salad bar is but I'm not sure what they saw in it.  It's a very small salad bar, that's it.  Of course I'm from Wooster, OH originally and know what a good soup and salad bar looks like since we frequented the Barn Restaurant(the Barn has a salad bar that is literally 3-4 times as big as Kosar's, for that matter the Buffet at the casino has a better salad bar).  The soup was amazing though I must admit.  I normally do not really care for mushrooms but the only soup was wild mushroom bisque and it was very flavorful.  My wife had the prime rib and I had the swordfish.  Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  Overall it was a good experience and we will return."}
{"text":"Not bad, not good. Just meh. Someone else wrote that most casino steakhouses are amazing, and I'd have to agree with that. I'd also agree that this is not one of those amazing casino steakhouses. Then again, this is Northfield, not Las Vegas. It IS your best bet for a good steak in the Northfield area...but don't go here expecting a high-end dining experience.

In my mind, salad bars don't belong in a place that markets itself as high-end, but maybe that's just me. Perhaps my expectations were too high.

The food, overall, was not bad...but the sound of the casino mixed with staring at a salad bar just prevented me from feeling like I was in a nice restaurant. It just doesn't have that special ambience. I might go here again if I were headed to see a show at Hard Rock Live or to play some slots...but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"We loved it!  I was very skeptical at first but it was great!!!  Best steak I have had in years!!  Love the wood fire grille.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and had the prime rib special, very good, cooked to perfection, excellent value and the waitress Tiffany was very good also, very attentive and professional."}
{"text":"While the pleasant waitstaff and contemporary decor were appreciated, the food suffers from some \"diminishing skills\" when compared to a very competitive group of steakhouses in the Greater Cleveland area.  The steak was a little rubbery and not at the quality level expected of a higher-end steakhouse.  The kitchen did, however, manage to accurately cook the steak at the requested \"medium rare plus\" (the \"plus\" is thrown in just as a test).  Surveying, but not partaking, in the salad bar ($7 with entree, $16 alone), the available options were pretty standard (albeit a little limited) but with some highlights like roasted carrots and anchovies.  As for sides, the Brussels Sprouts were bland and could have used more roasting; their taste saved only by the addition of bacon.  The Carbonara Mac & Cheese was decent, but (save for an unweildly gob of cheese placed on top of the dish) disappointing lacking in the cheesy decadence throughout that usually accompanies similar steakhouse offerings.  Food-wise, you would do much better for yourself at any of the higher-end steakhouses downtown or maybe even some a short 15-minutes away in Independence."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Kosar's last night.  From the minute we were greeted by the hostess and manager (loved them), our experience was top notch.  We were early so we had a seat at the bar.  The bartenders were incredibly nice and personable.  Our drinks were served quickly and were excellent.  The dinner menu had a very nice selection of steaks, seafood, and side dishes.  Dinner was excellent.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection.  They were quality cuts of meat, fresh and incredibly flavorful.  We ordered two sides, one macaroni and cheese and one lobster mac and cheese.  Both were very very good.  Our server, Brad, was personable, professional and very nice.  He was on top of everything, making sure that our cocktails were served quickly, wine was at the table, and meals were served hot.  Brad did an excellent job timing our entire dinner and he made our dining experience especially pleasurable.  In addition, before anyone complains about the cost of the side dishes or the menu prices, I have dined at hundreds of restaurants, and Kosar's is a quality restaurant for the money.  It is not cheap, but it is not unreasonable.  If you want a fine dining experience, coupled with quality food and service, make a reservation at Kosar's.  Congratulations Bernie for a fine restaurant and be sure to give your team a special thank you from a very satisfied group of four!  Thanks to you all!!!"}
{"text":"This is a new Steakhouse in the Northfield Hard Rock Rocksino complex.  It is the upscale restaurant, the only one that takes reservation.  It is available on OpenTable.  The motif is class, upscale.  The pigskin bound menus add a unique touch.  There is a nice wine list, containing everything from basic Ohio wines to high priced special items.  The menu has your basic steak and seafood offerings.  Prepare to pay extra for toppings and sides on your steaks.  The appetizer menu has some nice items and there is a salad bar that you can order as a side or an entree.  Items vary seasonally.
We went soon after opening, so maybe some of the experience will get worked out.  Service was friendly, but inconsistent.  Drinks were well mixed and strong.  The salad bar was nice, but no soups available when we were there.  The crabcakes we ordered were nice, but slightly burned.  The steaks were prepared to order and flavorful. Nice job there.  We did not have room to sample desserts.
So overall, this was a good to very good experience.  If you visit the Rocksino, this is a nice choice to eat.  Is it worth a special trip just for the dining experience?  Well, you can get a similar experience in many other locations, including chain steakhouses."}
{"text":"I came here for a nice dinner with friends and the night started off good with good bread and drinks but from then on out the night just went downhill. All of our steaks were either cold or room temperature. We didn't get 2 of the sides that we ordered. We also ordered a second bottle of wine and the waitress didn't inspect the glasses before pouring and poured our wine into a dirty glass. She took that glass away and got another but didn't get us a new bottle of wine since we lost the wine in the dirty glass. When we told the manager that that we weren't happy with the food and she proceeded to blame us on why the food was cold or cooked wrong. We weren't offered dessert menus and they took forever to finally get our bills. I definitely wouldn't come here again nor recommend spending money here. If you get cold meals, they won't compensate you at all for it and likelt blame you. They apparently feel that's an ok thing to serve cold food at a nice steakhouse."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great ambiance and incredible waiter ... Highly recommend Mark for ur waiter! Worth the money!"}
{"text":"Had a great night at the Hard Rock Rocksino and dinner at Kosar's steakhouse. The food was excellent. Had crab cakes appetizer. Best I've had anywhere. 
They have a soup and salad bar that is available with the meal, or AS a meal. We both added it to our entree.
She had  the smoked prime rib, and I got Osso Bucco. Didn't need a knife for either one. Fork tender and prepared to proper doneness. 

Great meal and very reasonable prices compared to other high end steakhouses I've been to. Be sure to give Kosar's a try if you're having a good night at the casino. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Small portions plus rude service and below average food to me means 1 and done
I really expected more and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went out for our 14 year anniversary. Service was great (thanks Tricia). 
So I had a review on here prior to this one and I gave this place 5 stars but I am taking back my 5 star review and giving it 3 stars for just the service we had because for me it was the best part.
  To start the night off we made reservations and we were seated at the exact time our reservations were made, made us extremely happy. 
  We ordered the sausage plate and I didn't care for any of the specialty sausages that were served and chicken sausage is something that I eat quite often. It could have been the flavor of the sausage that I didn't like. Hubby didn't like either but we brought it home and ended up throwing it away. 

   I added the salad bar with my steak checked it out before I ordered it because it's not a big salad bar but enough options for a good salad.
 ***if you get the hot bacon dressing make sure you use it on your salad and not as soup**** it is in the same container as the beef vegetable soup so I brought it back to the table to try and the waitress told me that's it's not soup but said its ok because people do that all the time. But it is a salad dressing. My bad... So salad bar was good I tried a little of everything and didn't like the watermelon radish tomato salad or the bean salad but everything else was fresh and delicious.
    So onto our steaks  I ordered the the 12 oz New York strip steak medium well and when they brought it out it had a lot of pink in the middle so I had to send it back. They didn't cook a new steak they threw this one back on the grill (32 dollar steak I can understand why) after the steak was thrown back on the grill they brought it back out and at this point it had the charred meat taste so I tried another bite and just wasn't happy with flavoring they use to cook the steak or the charred piece of meat. In the meantime I had tried my husbands steak that was cooked to perfection and delicious. 

So our waitress was more helpful in making my experience a success so they replaced my steak with a kosar 19 steak which came out perfectly cooked medium well but I would like to say if you are picky about seasoning on a steak either ask them to cook it without or don't get the steak. I read other reviews and it seems to be a big complaint about the seasoning. We also ordered 2 sides asparagus and a baked potato that the hubby and I split. Potato is huge and asparagus is definitely enough for 2 people to eat. 
   Being that it was our anniversary I told the waitress what we were celebrating they gave us a complimentary slice of carrot cake. The cake was delicious and I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and the cheesecake was definitely at the top of list for all time favorites for a piece of cheesecake.
    Overall the dining experience was awesome service was great quality of the food I will say was great but seasoning and cooking not so much...for the prices that they charge."}
{"text":"Interesting note, someone from there asked me for my info so that a manager could call me to discuss.
That was Monday night, it's now Thursday and NO CALL.
Guess they really don't care too much!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get an awesome meal/experience in Northfield! We were seated immediately on a Friday evening and our service was wonderful! It is on the expensive side but the food is delicious! I recommend the  Shrimp Scampi. I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"I would rate it three and three quarter stars. I will start with the positives since there were more of those than negatives. They took my GF and I as walk in last night; yep Valentine's Day, we waited in their lobby and warming up to their fireplace, 10 minutes we're seated in these huge leather chairs with a warm atmosphere. I got the 10 oz prime rib and she had the skirt steak; both cooked to our liking. We loved your endless bread basket by the way; we felt that and drinks alone would've sufficed. The negatives were it took too long to get our bill and you threw our steaks out when we wants D to box them up with our sides!  Who does that?  We will return, service and food were really good"}
{"text":"A strange little place, though it's not so little - it's massive, actually, with no windows because, you know... it's in a casino. We ended up here for my boyfriend's grandmother's 80th birthday.

I guess Kosar's is a surf & turf place, though \"wood-fired\" had me expecting something else (pizzas? I don't know). The menu is sort of small but expensive, with lots of big-ticket steak & seafood items. I'm not a huge meat person, so the appetizers appealed most to me, but I was a little embarrassed to go that route. The prices were so high that we joked that Bernie Kosar was trying to make all his money back via high-priced steaks.

If I had some compelling reason to end up here again, I wouldn't be upset, but I'm not going to schlep out to the casino for this restaurant. It has a nice vibe, friendly servers, good food (try the lobster mac & cheese!), but it's overpriced casino fare, plain & simple. I think people are just falling for it because it has a sort of quirky Cleveland twist."}
{"text":"Once again, the wine pairing dinner did not disappoint! Not only was the smoked sturgeon perfectly prepared, the pairing with the L'Ecole Merlot was quite surprisingly good. The steak entree was covered in a reduction sauce that hit a high note in my heart. Apparently it was wine butter shallot and what my guess was truffle; the head Chef explained that the Miso garlic rubbed beef was the earthy flavour not truffle.....brilliant!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at kosar's Wood-Fired Grill last night. I would have to say that I'm very disappointed in our experience. We had a good experience in the casino and and checked in with the initial greeter who was the young man in his 20s. He stated that reservations were necessary however we could have one of the available high top tables. We stated that we would be back after gambling a little bit. Upon coming back there was a rather large Caucasian woman at the greeting station. She met us with attitude and stated that we could not eat there unless we would sit at the bar instead. I informed her at the initial greeter who was very nice stated that we could have a high top table for our dinner. She stated that we could not even though there were a half a dozen high top tables opening available. We instead ate at the bar and we're served by some very very nice bartenders. We made the best of things but didn't let  the experience with the large Caucasian woman with the attitude who spent most of her time on her phone texting snarling with dirty looks at customers totally ruin our date night.   Maybe she was having a bad day or maybe the Rocksino staff management should consider thinning the herd and replacing the dead weight with people who care."}
{"text":"Kosars is amazingly awesome
 Our dinners were outstanding.  They dont skimp on the portions, especially the desserts!! This is our #1 go to Steak house!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our experience at Kosar's tonight.  The food was very good, the prices are average for an upscale steak house, the service could have been a little better.  All four of us had steak, I had filet which was cooked perfectly, au gratin potatoes with a creamy sauce that was amazing, and green beans.  Everyone at our table liked their food.  We were celebrating a birthday so we also had dessert, the cheesecake with raspberry sauce was the best I've ever had!  Yes you have to pay an extra $6.00 for the salad bar with your entre and you have to pay extra for your potato.  If you can't afford the \"extra's\", eat at the buffet.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the server could have been more attentive in refilling our drinks.  In my opinion this place is worth the money and we will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal for our Anniversary at Kosar's tonight. The bacon wrapped scallops were excellent, and the bone-in Ribeye was perfectly prepared and off the hook tender and tasty. The vodka martinis were great, and served with ice crystals the way I like them. Tricia, our server, was very friendly and attentive.

The ambiance was great, and the booths were extremely large, and allowed my wife and I to sit side by side."}
{"text":"Mother's Day a friend and I put in an order to go. I had ordered the lobster lettuce wraps. I did not think to check my order before leaving the restaurant. When I got home, there was ABSOLUTELY NO LOBSTER filling in my container. 
  I called and spoke with the rude manager, Jennifer. I was practically called a liar when I explained to her that my order was not completed and that I could not return for it to be corrected.
  Jennifer stated that she had spoken to the chef. I explained to her that I had NO REASON to lie and how disappointed I was with her handling or non-handling of my situation.
  That was not my first visit there but it will definitely be my last!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped last week to try out the steakhouse inside Hard Rock Rocksino and were immediately seated. 

I decided to go with the \"19\" a 14oz new york strip steak named after the famous Browns quarterback. The steak was cooked properly but had a weird sauce it was cooked in that took away from the flavor of the steak. However it was a great cut of meat. 

For dessert we tried the creme brulee. It was a large portion and seemed to have the sugar crystalized at the time of order.  

It is however a very pricey meal and a loud restaurant if you're sitting near the entrance due to the rocksino, which you wouldn't expect in a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"We went to a comedy show at the Hard Rock so decided to eat at Kosar's to start the night out.  It was a good decision because we were seated after just a short wait while the buffet had a line a mile long!  The waitress was good and there were other junior wait staff who check on us with more bread or brought our entree's out.  The prime rib was delicious and seemingly larger than expected.  My strip steak on the other hand was cooked medium when I ordered medium rare.  We shared a good portion of lobster mac and cheese which was delicious.  Also had the fried calamari with asian chili dipping sauce--pretty good!  there is a small but acceptable wine/beer selection but nothing great.  While there, we noticed there was a salad bar--would probably try that the next time to go with our steaks."}
{"text":"Bad greeting from the start.. service was not friendly.. food took forever steak was raw.. i relize some people like that im not one of them.. overpriced. . Not going back"}
{"text":"Went here with friends last night.. our waitress was exceptional..she was friendly and attentive but not over the top. Everyone got steaks but me..they all seemed to enjoy although one was medium when supposed to be medium rare. I just can't justify $50 for a steak. I got the shrimp scampi..was very yummy plus filling..comes with pasta and crab meat on top. Salad bar was decent and worth the $8 extra. The sides and desserts are HUGE so definitely share those! We had the back room and if you go with a larger crowd, ask for it! It was quiet and seats were amazingly comfortable!! It's definitely an \"occasion\" type place but we had a wonderful time...could have been the gambling and the company I was in but all in all a good experience!"}
{"text":"For an upscale restaurant this place really did not impress with the food.  The atmosphere and service were fine. Many of our entrées were not even matching the quality of an Applebee's with the prices being three or more times as much!"}
{"text":"I had one of the finest filets I've ever had in here. A great cut of meat cooked to perfection. The sides are enormous and done as well as the steaks. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Went last night with my wife and another couple. The service was great. The manager was great to. 
Now for the bad part the food. The stakes where awful very tough could not chew. There is no way they are using prime meat. More like choice at best. 
We where all very dissatisfied with all our meals. The staff was great nothing to complain about there. We will not be going back. No way."}
{"text":"A very beautiful restaurant in the Hardrock casino with a nice private room.  A group of us went for my brother's 21st birthday and we got great attention from our server and the drinks were nice and strong!.  Unfortunately, I was sick, so I couldn't really eat much and there wasn't a clear soup for me, but everyone else steaks, chops and appetizers looked amazing!  My fiance had the New York strip and it was cooked right to temperature.  The baked potato we had was the size of a football!!  Even the halibut special was gorgeous. 

I will defintely be back to actually eat the food and gamble!"}
{"text":"We had a table of 5 shortly after the restaurant opened. It took almost an hour for our food after ordering and once it came out 4 out of 5 dinners were sent back for being cold. Those entrees (not sides or salads) were removed from the check. For the price point, the total experience was highly disappointing.  The food, presentation, service and atmosphere were all lacking. I don't mind paying $40 for just the filet, but it came out in the middle of a white plate with absolutely no garnish/sauce/presentation. I also don't mind paying $8 for a side (similar to Morton's or Flemings) but the corn my husband ordered was only enough for him. At other upscale restaurants, the sides are shareable. In addition, I have never been to an upscale restaurant with a salad bar- yuck! I attribute the kinks in the kitchen to being new and will be worked out. But, unless the prices are lowered or the food/presentation/service is changed to meet the price point, we will not be back. Too many other restaurants in the Cleveland area to spend $200/couple at dinner and be more than satisfied!"}
{"text":"Update of previous review. I previously reviewed the Kosar Wood Fire Grill and my five star recommendation remains the same. The people there are fantastic: Jennifer, Nicole, and Mia always greet you with a smile and Brad the server does his utmost to make sure your meal is great!  Not mentioned before is Tony, one of the bartenders who is sociable and his love for his job and patrons really shows. Mia, although new to her job of bartending also does a great job serving her customers. As mentioned before the special restaurant offerings M-T are worth looking into. The people working at Kosar are a class act. I was in again recently and Jennifer and Brandon are doing an excellent job in managing the Kosar's restaurant. Not mentioned before Alexis who is wonderful as a hostess.  More people should come earlier in the week - the prices are great and often it is not crowded. Again ask for Brad or Tony, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I had one of the best steaks ever last Friday. There were six in our party and we all had great meals. The lobster tail was cooked perfectly too. 

This is a pricy place to eat, but the quality of food and service were on par with the price.

It is an upscale sport themed restaurant and all entrees are ala carte. There are several options for sides and they are all large enough to share. 

Again, food was excellent including the sides we all shared (mac&cheese, Brussels sprouts, garlic mashed potatoes). My only reason for not giving 5 stars is because it has a weird vibe being in the middle of a casino. For the price, I felt it should be more of a stand alone place with better dressed clientele."}
