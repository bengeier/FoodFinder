{"text":"This restaurant is an instant Montreal treasure. Their is no other restaurant in Montreal doing what they're doing. We started with the shrimp bisque with tequila foam served with tequila flambé tiger shrimp and greens followed by the magret de canard, chili and chocolate sauce with sesame seeds, Aztec rice and vegetables. Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Finally Montreal has some high end Mexican food! Came here for brunch and it blew my mind - mixing traditional brunch fare like waffles and eggs Benedict with a Mexican flare - jalapeño biscuits topped by chipotle infused hollandaise and crispy fried chorizo - amazing. Couple that with a cold coffee and horchata and I can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Lovely space, excellent food and very friendly service. The chef is originally from Mexico City and really knows his stuff---the grub is creative and beautifully presented. Definitely check this place out!"}
