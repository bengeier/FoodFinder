{"text":"If you can wait an hour for your sandwich and do not mind it being cold then this is the place for you. Yes, you can receive faster service if you get there a few minutes before they open or a few minutes before they close but again no guarantee ... take your chances .... To be fair, I only waited 45 minutes and didn't get my food. They do happily refund your money though."}
{"text":"The food was OK, mccallisters is better but I would go back.  It's the same type of atmosphere.  They were very busy but they took care of us."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch yesterday. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. The newks q pizza was divine. The staff definitely went out of their way to be nice."}
{"text":"Newk's Q is my personal favorite along with their HUGE salads. Great pimento grilled cheese and their soup selections are excellent. Love their desserts too."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service is incredibly slow. Waiting 35 minutes for an online order is unacceptable. The online app is pretty much A waste of time if you have to wait another 30+ minutes when you get there for your food to be ready."}
{"text":"I go here about once a week and spend about $1,500 a year eating here.  I wish they would bring back the soups that were good ....like chili. Love the sandwiches and salads. Table cleaners come by too often to take a plate or used napkins which interrupt table talk....would appreciate less interruptions."}
{"text":"Love the soups.  I LOVE soup!!!  If you are a soup lover, this a great place to go.  I love the pizzas and sandwiches, too!  One of the great things is the strawberry cake.  We split it amongst us and satisfies the dessert urge.  Another great thing is that have sweet tea made with Splenda.  Ah, lovely!  I think this is a great overall place to go and everyone will find something they like."}
{"text":"This a great place for lunch or dinner. The sandwiches are always pleaders and the salads are fresh and plentiful."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. Food is good but waiting 25 min for a sandwich is unacceptable."}
{"text":"After a so so first visit I took my wife for a quick lunch. Under pressure to order from a extensive menu, so we felt cheated that we might have ordered a better item. Food did arrive promptly but very average - salad was nothing more than a large bowl of romaine, dressing was pretty tasteless, sandwich was very inferior even to Jayson's.
Value for money I'd score less than 2 stars. Well below average experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, and it's one of the spots that I frequent the most!

This is the first Newk's in the Charlotte area, and I'm really glad its here.  It was started by the people who conceptualized McAllisters and you see many of the parallels in the business.  I work nearby so I go here quite often especially for lunch.  They don't serve spuds or deli sandwiches here, but they do serve very well prepared and very well priced food.  A fan favorite tends to the Newk's Q, which is a barbecue chicken sandwich with a very unique white barbecue sauce.  Very good.  Their soups are very tasty although I probably wouldn't get them in the warmer months, as they are pretty heavy.  The pizzas they serve are thin crust style, and are more than functional.  The ingredients they use are perfect.  Although, if you're in the mood for a pizza, a trip across the street to Brixx will probably net you a better pie.  

My personal favorite here is the Ultimate Salad.  The salad's they serve are gigantic and I sub out the honey mustard dressing (spicy) for the ranch which is one of the best I've had.  I also love their Royal sandwich which has salami and Roast Beef on it.  

Service here is counter service and can get pretty busy but it's well worth it and you can easily get through in an hour lunch.  

Try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is OK.  There's a decent variety.  Prices are OK.  Food is OK.  There's nothing really special but it's consistent and predictable.  It's not my first choice but it's a place we will go occasionally."}
{"text":"Been going there for a couple of years, always getting salads. It was close by and the food was pretty good. Not so any more. Over time it has gotten progressively worse. The salads have always had some brown lettuce but like I said it was close. Once it was so bad I asked for manager who could only offer me a free coupon which I declined. I wanted him to fix the problem. Well, this week was worst. Both of our salads were not edible. Nasty wet and brown lettuce. We ate only a bite or two and left never to return. Everyone has an off night but off nights are more the norm now."}
{"text":"Love the Newk's Q!
My work team frequents Newk's because it's delicious, affordable, and quick! We can be in and out on a Friday lunch in less than an hour. The staff is always friendly and we love that Newk's has the breadsticks and pickles out for snacking!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice.  First time food was acceptable.  Second time was this week, and the service was awful. My coffee was cold, and with plenty of staff standing around, no one would come see me when I motioned them over to explain. And when I went to find a person, they fixed hot coffee, but wouldn't bring it to me.  I had a guest and didn't like leaving the table over and over to solve simple service and food problems.  Will be quite awhile before I go back.  I could say more but will stop here."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Restaurant was very clean. Salads are fresh and taste fantastic (Greek and a favorite), although for the price I felt they could've had more in it. THE PIMIENTO MAC N CHEEZ W BACON IS TO DIE FOR!!! The chicken tortilla soup tastes more like a chicken chili and there wasn't any tortilla (see pic of soup that's not even filled all the way). The spicy chicken pizza had a great spicy aftertaste. We ordered to-go and didn't have any silverware or napkins when we opened it. There were a couple snafus with our experience but management did a great job trying to correct everything. I would go back. 
There's also alcohol on the menu! I didn't get anything but the selection looked good for fast casual  dining!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place but my family loves going there so I'll  always end up going.
Been there about seven times still haven't found something I really really like.
To me the place is a overpriced McAllister's"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. First time here. I had a Margherita pizza there and took some Chicken salad with grapes and pecans hoje with me The grapes are still fresh and crunchy. How do they do that? Awesome on both ends of the taste buds. I can't wait to go back and have the Vegetarian Club with mushrooms, peppers and goat cheese. Cool little dive."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The strawberry cake, I purchased to take home.  My husband loves strawberry cake and this did not disappoint.  Love getting a 32 oz drink as I drink a lot of unsweetened tea.  So glad this resturant opened another or in Rock Hill."}
{"text":"my choice: Toasted ham, cheese & bacon sandwich 
husband's choice: Tomato basil soup & Italian sub 
The food was hot, delivered quick and order was accurate.  We enjoyed the meal but wasn't something we would to visit often."}
{"text":"The Rea Rd. location went from a solid \"A\" experience for years to an \"F-\" will not return very fast.  We were told they are under new management, if that's true, the new management apparently missed out on a most of the things that made Newk's great....  Note we were there at 6:45pm on a Friday night.

1.  Cleanliness - The place was a mess,  multiple tables were not cleared, piled plates sitting on top of them, something you just never saw at Newk's, especially when there were only 5 tables in use in the entire place.  Food on the floor over by the drink station and under several of the tables that had already been bussed.  Nasty is not a word I would have ever imagined using to describe Newk's, but tonight it was pretty nasty.

2.  Sides Bar - Always a favorite, tonight as per #1 it was also a mess, food spread all over it, several of the sides were not adequately stocked.  Asked twice for more croutons (as did another customer) they were never refilled while we were there.  

3.  Drinks - They were out of Splenda Tea & Unsweet Tea.  The Root Beer was also out, we informed them of this (as did another customer), we were both told they would get someone to change it out, never happened through the duration of our meal.

4.  Food - One of the members of our party ordered a Club, his sandwich came out with nothing on it except bread, cheese and bacon, obviously had to send that back...  Two of us ordered salads with blue cheese dressing, both came out with the wrong dressing, had to send those back and b/c there was pretty much no staff in the dining room (something you never see at Newk's) had to go up and stand at the edge of the kitchen to try to get someone's attention to get the salads fixed.  I ordered the Spicy Shrimp Pizza, Newk's has always had the BEST spicy shrimp pizza, great flavor and a good spicy kick.  What I had tonight was not even close, I am convinced it didn't have the right sauce on it.  It had very little flavor and absolutely no spice at all.  Would have sent it back as well but by that time was just ready to be done and out of there.  Also the kids portion size for Mac & Cheese used to be reasonable, they have drastically reduced the portion size, all 3 kids left saying they were still hungry.  The steak on my wife's steak sandwich was totally dried out and looked burnt.

5.  Staff - in spite of all of the above, this may have been the biggest disappointment of the night.  Newk's staff was always great, there were always people buzzing around there, they were always attentive and they always kept the place looking sharp.  Aside from the young man that brought our food out who was courteous and at least seemed to be making an effort every other staff interaction we had was poor.  Person taking our order didn't seem to know where to find things in the system and there was no one up there to help her,, it took forever to place our order.  Dining room was basically void of staff which has never been the case.  Multiple requests to have them refill sides on the bar or fix drinks that were out went completely unaddressed,  meanwhile I watched staff members standing in the kitchen leaning up against the counter.  

Honestly we have been Newk's faithfuls for many years (our cabinet is full of their cups, in fact that was the only redeeming factor of tonight's meal, a new cup for the cabinet) however after the experience tonight I doubt we will go back unless we find that it has significantly improved.  Tonight was a huge disappointment in every aspect of what used to make this place great.  If this truly is the result of new management they better turn it around quickly or this location will be in trouble."}
{"text":"Overall good and consistent every time I have been there for a quick bite. The tea is very good and most every sandwich has been tasty. I did get the chicken Cobb salad which I found bland and not great. Other than that, it's a nice easy place to grab a sandwich."}
{"text":"This is probably our first bad experience here. They dropped my salmon on the floor. I greatly appreciate you not picking it up and using it anyway! However, I ordered the salmon Caesar salad but instead got the over cooked salmon soup!"}
{"text":"Good food, service is hit or miss. Servers are usually friendly. We have a hard time dining in because the place is freezing. Server told us that's the biggest complaint but there's nothing he can do about it. So bundle up!"}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout salad. Brown lettuce and slimy shrimp. The food just doesn't seem fresh or appetizing. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Newks has a great selection of sandwiches and salads. It is very fresh and the quality is very good. Great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The soups are by far my favorite, and I get one every single time I go! The lobster and crab bisque is TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service, nice ambience,
good variety of pizza, soup, sandwiches and salad.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I recommend the \"Italian\" sandwich. I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great customer service - a soup didn't make it into our to-go bag and the manager brought it to our house! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went by the 'Express' in their name and decided to order some food to take home in between getting some chores done. Called in an order, drove by 10 minutes later and picked up some hot food.

We ordered the spicy shrimp pizza and a sandwich, I forget which one exactly, but my wife and I loved both. I personally love the wood fried Spicy shrimp pizza @ Brixx and this one came pretty close to that.

I'll follow up with another review as this one's solely based on my to-go experience."}
{"text":"This  is a great little place to stop in for a quick bite if you are looking for soups, sandwiches, or pizzas.  I ordered a soup & half sandwich combo - and chose the chicken tortilla soup and pimento cheese w/tomato sandwich.  The soup came out hot and was very tasty.  The sandwich was quite tasty, but a little messy.  I thought prices were reasonable for what you get.  Since I am a fan of good soup, I will certainly be going back to check out some of their other soup offerings."}
{"text":"So so so upset. Usually love this place but the pizza tonight was horrible. They didn't listen to the order on the ticket and didn't make to specifications, the dough tasted way off, the tomato sauce was not the usual and tasted like it came directly out of a ragu jar, they put SO MUCH barbeque sauce on one it was like a river, and they put the wrong meat on one. Just so disappointed this time. They aren't cheap so I was just pissed. Disgusting. Lost quality."}
{"text":"FYI  - Yelpers just found out they are opening a location in Uptown soon :)"}
{"text":"Newk's sets the standard for a Sunday afternoon lunch. Plenty of choices for the culinarily comfortable eaters and those seeking a gratuitous amount of crudite. Very fast service, ample seating and plenty of vittles whiel waiting for your meal to arrive. 

One of my favorite aspects of Newk's is the fact they give you gigantic, plastic stadium cups each time you order a drink. It's a size fit for a neanderthal and is perfect for hot summer days at home. Fill it with ice water, a sports drink or to the brim with a margarita. Perfect for all boozy occasions. 

Of lesser importance to most, but high on my appreciation scale, are the packs of breadsticks. Basically long, skinny crackers that come 5-6 per pack. Grab a few of these and some banana peppers and you've got yourself a righteous snack. 

Plenty of salads, pizzas, sandwiches and stadard side items. I'm a fan of the Newk's Q, bbq sandwich-esque with chicken. The Bread isn't ideal, but the flavors are great. Newk's is always a solid choice and is never over the top or sub par. Just right, so to speak. 

Thanks for the snappy and always friendly service, Newk's! You've got fans in us!"}
{"text":"Not bad, I typically get soup or salad.  So far so good.  My kids get sandwiches and they love it.  Could use a few more vegetarian items on the menu."}
{"text":"One of their soups I tried, I think it was the chicken nacho soup or something like that, turned out to be one of the best soups I have had. 

The steak salad is also amazing, and everything else that was ordered was hot, fresh, flavourful, and filling. Good portion sizes indeed. 

I would consider this as sort of an upscale sandwich place. If you want something better than subway or even McAlister, come here. 

The staff was friendly and very warm. It took me a while to decide which soup I wanted and the waiter was very patient and even offered to get me two different samples so I could make an informed decision. I'm glad he did that for me because not only was it generous, but that was one of the best soups I have had!"}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to visit Newk's! But I've been missing out! I love the soups there, especially the Chicken Tortilla Soup. Newk's is a great place for consistent good food. In addition to the soup, their pizzas and sandwiches are great and I especially like their caramel cake! The have a ton of daily soups, so there is something for everyone. Newk's is now on our regular schedule!"}
{"text":"Very nice place for lunch. They have a varied menu with a condiment bar in the center of the restarunt that is well stocked and with free breadsticks.  I had a very good Margarita Pizza and my friend had a chicken sandwich don't remember which one but he said it was also very good. The place was clean and well staffed plus the men's room was very clean. I would recommend Newk's for lunch any time your in the area"}
{"text":"After reading many reviews on Newk's Express Cafe, I decided to take my family and check it out. I'm glad we did because from ease of ordering, customer service and food, it was a pleasant experience. The menu has many different selections from sandwiches to pizza. We decided to go with the pizza and we were not disappointed. They're the size of a personal pizza and they were delicious, from the thin flavored crust to the fresh ingredients; there were no complaints. We did have an issue with the pizzas not being made correctly but after informing management, they took care of it immediately with no issue. 

The customer service and wait staff are wonderful and very accommodating. I definitely agree with all the other rave reviews on Newk's Cafe. We will be making more trips over here in the future. I highly recommend Newk's and wish they were closer."}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of accolades for just have soups, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. Mind you, I only had the house salad and their vegetable soup but if that's all I have, it should make me want to come back for more....and it didn't. I've been wanting to try this place for a while and was not impressed. Their staff was very nice and accomodating but the food was not impressive. It shouldn't be too difficult to make a good vegetable soup and I'm not sure I've had many that I didn't like but theirs did not make me want to come back for more. It was almost too sweet and a little thick. I'm willing to go back and try other items on the menu but I'm not eager."}
{"text":"We have been really dissapointed recently. Have been going to Newks since they first opened. Recently, they almost never have croutons. The last visit I was overcharged . When I brought it to the attention of the cashier, she said twice... '\"what do you want me to do about it'. The manager did give me credit in the end.  Person that brings out food is very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this place is freezing! All the time! For months! Mid 60s. The people behind the register try to give a pathetic reason like one of the AC units is down so they have to crank up the air to keep the kitchen staff comfortable. Nonsense, because they've been giving this sorry excuse for a long time. Everyone is complaining - people sitting around shivering - even the young folks sitting outside say it's too cold. And the managers/owners seem like they couldn't care less about all their customers' comfort. Food quality has dropped as well. Not consistent at all. See ya."}
{"text":"First time trying this place,ordered a BBQ pizza,when I got it I right away said to myself wow this is some thin pizza and the crust looks a bit burnt,but after trying it it sure fooled me,it was Very good!! I would come here again for that pizza!"}
{"text":"Newks Blakney is the worst Newks I've ever been to. I ordered online hoping to have my order ready to go when I got there. I arrived 10 min after I ordered to an almost empty restaurant and had to sit down and wait 20 MINUTES until my food was brought out to me. Pitiful, I'll take my business to Panera where it's more friendly and efficient! I've never been to a more poorly run restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good all around place for a meal or snack.  Lots of variety and the service is spot on.

You order from a counter at the entrance.  Usually not a good sign to us, but they know how to work it at Newk's.  The menu is posted above the cashier/order takers and there is usually a crowd standing there trying to figure out what is available and what they want.  Suggest you grab a printed menu and study it before clogging up the counter.  The staff will answer your questions and place your orders.

Their slogan is, \"Choosing a favorite child is easier.\"  Cute and true.

Lots of soup choices and they offer four versions of mac & cheese.  My 98 year old dad has tried them all.  Also sandwiches, soups, salads, pizza and desserts are available and you can mostly customize what you order.  They regularly offer specials, \"features\" and \"pairings\" which you will see on the board.  Pairings are like soup and sandwich/soup and salad and features are whatever offering they have as a special deal.

You get a number, sit down, get served.  A central area has beverages and some condiments, including \"things\" to put on  your salads.  You will see.

Prices are reasonable and they can handle the lunch rushes well.  Kitchen keeps up with the orders."}
{"text":"Two of the last 3 times I've been in this area I've had Newks and it still has not disappointed. This time I had the shrimp op'boy and half a caesar salad. The po' boy was amazing, but a little small in my opinion.  The salad was, well, a caesar salad. Nothing special but still good. Newks is a very good (higher quality) alternative to any sandwich or quick service shops."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is tasty and reasonably priced. It can get busy so go during \"off\" times for a better experience. The staff has always been friendly when I've eaten here. My favorites are the chicken salad sandwich, the Newk's Q (ask for extra white bbq sauce on the side for extra yumminess!), and the pimento & bacon Mac and Cheese!"}
{"text":"Ran out of chicken on a Saturday; they were going tables after ordered to let people know. Didn't apologize, didn't offer a discount.  2 out of 3 of our orders were incorrect."}
{"text":"Food is good, but in this day and age, to not have options for gluten free pizza or bread, is a crime."}
{"text":"Easy lunch spot and great to bring the kids. One of the only places in the area with really yummy & large salad. Salad selection is very solid. 

Tried the pizza, it was thin crust...very thin and small. If you order one know that it's more of a personal size.

 I'd only recommend this place for salads & sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've gone to Newk's several times now. The first time I went it was good. Every time I've been since has been mediocre at best. The food quality is not worth the price. Do not get a pizza. They are always dry & burned. If you get a salad ask for the dressing on the side, if you don't your salad will be drowning in dressing. All of my salads have had bad lettuce in them. Make sure you check it before you eat it. The tea is awful. It's sour tasting by the end of the meal. 
The mac & cheese is pretty good. I haven't tried any sandwiches, some people seem to like them. The desserts look good but I haven't tried them either. I never see anyone eating one so I'd rather not waste my money. I don't know if the other location in Charlotte is like this one or not, but I'd recommend you go to another restaurant in the Blakeney area. This price and food quality are not worth it."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Newk's Q.  It's a nice place to chat with colleagues and friends, and has fast, amazing food.  Get yourself a Big Crispy too for good measure.  Overall I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is good and the owner is from New Orleans and they have ABITA beer!

{"text":"I would NOT recommend this restaurant to ANYONE! The manager and the staff are HORRIBLE and the manager has NO class! Won't return phone calls, won't address the REAL issues at hand and allows her staff, including her SON, to smoke illegal drugs on their breaks. No, I'm not a disgruntled ex-employee, but I am someone who knows what's going on at this place and I'm going to take it all the way to Corporate! This is why companies need to do a BETTER job of screening their employees and hiring managers and staff that are intelligent enough to handle business correctly! What's going on at this place is a joke and I would not recommend anyone go here and support this lack-of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've tryed a few things from this place and everything has just been \"ok\".  But the newks favorite is Really Good, like addicting good. I have this salad at least 3 times a week for lunch...  A blend of romaine lettuce, artichoke heart, pecans, feta cheese, crotons, grapes and chicken. Topped with a cherry or raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  One of the best salads I've ever had...with out that said I would have given only 2 stars"}
{"text":"After a lunch time expedition to Petsmart, I decided to drop into Newk's for lunch.  Things got off to a bit of an awkward start: I decided to get my meal to go, and therefore got in line at the to-go counter.  After I finished placing my order, however, the cashier handed me a number and said to find a table and someone would bring out my food.  I decided that I didn't mind, and I ended up eating in, but why have a dedicated to-go counter if you're not going to assume people in that line want, well, to go?

Fortunately, the food, regardless of whether I ate it in or out, was good.  My chicken pesto sandwich was pretty dang delicious, and the pasta salad side was good if unremarkable.

I'll will certainly visit Newk's again, since Lord knows I end up at Petsmart often enough..."}
{"text":"I'm struggling with what to say about Newk's. I want to give it 5 stars, but I can't. It's so hit or miss. It's in a good location in Blakeney, right next to Best Buy, and it doesn't have a lot of competition in it's category (fast casual). I would say McAllister's is a competitor; however, Newk's is owned by McAllister's. 

One of my favorite things on the menu is the Newk's Q. It's a warm sandwich with sliced chicken, cheese, bacon (which I don't get), and a white barbecue sauce which is quite good. When Newk's first opened, the sandwich was awesome. The chicken was fresh, all white, and delicious. As time went on, the sandwich kept getting worse and worse--the chicken would have brown edges that were unattractive, the amount of chicken was less, and there wasn't enough sauce. Then it got better again, back to where it started. Then it dropped off a bit. It's really a fantastic sandwich when it's at it's best, but that's not all of the time.The salads are very good for the most part, and the pizzas are okay--nothing to write home about. 

Service is very good. You place your order at the counter and they serve it to you and check on you sometimes, so it's minimalistic, but really no problems. Decor is nice, it almost has a California vibe, which is nice for a fast casual place. Overall, I would recommend Newk's because it's a probably one of the better fast casual places in the area (not a fan of McAllister's at all)."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places.  Great food and service. They give teachers free drink. Try the lemon cake.  Pepper jack Crawfish soup is one of the best!  They will let you sample soup of the day so just ask if can't decide."}
{"text":"Very good grilled chicken sandwich and loaded potato soup! I get the same meal every time and it doesn't disappoint! They have good cake too!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that this was not my first choice of restuarant tonight as ther e were 50+ minute waits, but it turned out well.  I order the margarita pizza and da boss and eldest offspring ordered a chicken salad of sorts and it was all good (5/5).  Simple order at the counter-give you a number set up, so easy enough (5/5).  Service was prompt too.  All around good night!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here often! My daughter loves the Mac and Cheese. The service is always really good and quick. The place is always clean!!!! One opportunity for improvement I think would be to do something with the doors... The doors to get in and out are very heavy... I've noticed other customers make comments about it as well."}
{"text":"Good, reliable food.  Fast polite service!"}
{"text":"Great sand which sand love the Newk's Q sauce. But also try the pimento cheese  Mac and cheese with bacon it's very good. They also always give large plastic take home cups, not sure how they can afford to but they do. We also love the pickle bar and breadsticks. Great place worth trying if near any and looking for something a little different."}
{"text":"We used to eat here almost every weekend. Loved the soups and the sandwiches - especially the chicken salad on the white bread. Now, the service is poor, and the food is not good. Last time we went, they were out of ice and unsweet tea. The Lobster bisque soup that used to be so delicious was way too salty and my chicken salad sandwich was very dry and they did not put cheese. Overall, a real disappointment. I guess that explains why at 1:15pm on a Sunday, it was only us and another couple. Also, the time before that we went, it had also went downhill, but we really wanted to give it another chance. Not again!  Not only was my experience poor, I emailed the company letting them know of our disappointment and that we had been loyal customers for years, but we did not get any response!  Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a full day of Christmas shopping for a hot soup and sandwich.
The yound lady at the cash register was very young and pleasant, but i think the conversation with 2 friends (co-workers??? questionable since they just sat on their ba-donk-a-donks the whole time I ate.) about her \"sorry\" paycheck of less than $300 (yes I know about what she made this last pay period as well as it is usually upwards around the $400 mark. yes all this I found out in the little time it took to ring up and pay for my order.

I placed my number card on the table stand, filled my self serve soda cup. place on my table and then adjourned to the very nice and clean restrooms to wash my hands.
my order can fairly quickly after sitting and observing the quirky decor, that is inviting and colorful as well. 

there is a large high table that has a array of condiments for your salad or sandwich or even your soups. Jalapenos, capers, banana peppers, croutons, sweet pickles, crackers, and even some bread sticks. hot sauces, cracked pepper are also available.

The soups change each day but the soup schedule is on the website as well as near the ordering register.

I choose the soup/sandwich combo. which was a half bowl of soup and any half sandwich. I went on a Saturday and being I am from Charleston SC I was immediately drawn to the \"Ultimate Crab\" soup, I also ordered the roast beef with provolone.

Well I was terribly disappointed with the soup! It looked very nice (picture of my bowl is posted here) but as I dug my soup spoon into my soup i noticed it contained a great deal of corn (not what I was expecting at all) but hey I place in my mouth and CHEW, I do taste some crab flavor but the crab meat escapes my sight, even as I dig through the bowl, to no avail I found NONE.  What was worse was the amount of pepper in this soup, I couldnt even finish my half a bowl because the more I forced down this not so pleasant soup, the more my mouth was on fire.  
So i give up! I notice another couple at the register studying the menu and soup schedule, then notice the same slender cashier I had go get a small solo serving cup of soup and offer it to the customers. Why didnt I think of that before hand of getting a sample to make my soup choice????

Now the plus was the roast beef sandwich! wow that was a great switch a roo from the soup I choked down. The beef was very tender, the bread was toasted perfectly, the leafy greens were crisp and chilled. and there was a pleasant tang of some sort from the condiments that were on it which I am not sure what it was but I enjoyed it.

NOW, I loved the inside, the staff seemed friendly, yet some a little too laid back and comfortable, but I felt a little ripped off for paying $10 for several bites of soup and 1/2 sandwich and my drink. But I will give them another try and next time taste test before I committ to a soup!

OH and although i did not partake they had some scrumptious looking desserts at the register and there is a open shelf cooler that has ready to go sandwiches etc for those who need to grab and run!"}
{"text":"I was out exploring around Ballantyne and decided to stop here for lunch because I heard so many good things about it.

Once in the restaurant, the ordering counter is right inside the door.  The menu is clear...sandwiches, pizza and salads.  Being new here the guy at the counter gave me a few suggestions.  I went with a greek salad with chicken.

Once you get your cup, you proceed to the drink station which is large for any restaurant.  There are 2 soda fountains and then about 6 tea dispensers in various forms.  Sweet, unsweet and and my favorite sweetened with Splenda (that got the 5th star just for that!).

Someone brought out the salad and it came in a funky shaped red bowl and the salad was HUGE!  The salad was fresh and great flavors with romaine, red onions, kalamata olives, grape tomatoes, pepperocinis, and of course chicken.  The dressing was light and the salad wasn't drenched in it.  

The only thing I didn't like about Newks is that I thought the tables were a little close together.  But overall, I think it's fantastic!  There needs to be more Newks around Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and start with the Newk's Q sandwich, then order a Newk's Q Pizza the next time. The pizza version isn't on the menu, but it's fabulous. The sweet tea isn't sweet enough for a real southerner, but it's the bare minimum of sweetness acceptable."}
{"text":"Meh. This place was a big disappointment. Place was filthy, apparently some kids destroyed the floor with their unwanted food. We should've left then. I ordered a club sandwich and hubby ordered margarita pizza. The sandwich had no flavor and they use that terrible shelf stable microwave bacon. Hubby said pizza was very average. This place is basically an overpriced Potbelly sandwich place. Skip this one."}
{"text":"3.5 Newk's is great. The food and service are consistently good and the restaurant is very kid friendly. That's definitely what keeps us going back for more. I love the Grissini breadsticks and the roasted garlic they offer. My favorite is the Ultimate Salad. It's really good and really addicting. My mom has had the Newk's salad and she loves it. It would be nice if their kids menu offered grilled chicken or steamed veggies. This is a great place to go when we want something easy and stress free with the kiddo."}
{"text":"Food is good and restaurant is clean. I like getting the combo where you can pick what you want. Lots of choices. There is also a pickle/pepper bar."}
{"text":"Its been a long time since I ate here I love this place. Service is always excellent an food rather sandwich, soup or pizza always great. On this visit I had the the club an potato soup an being its getting cold the soup was so good :) I had their pumpkin pie cake it was amazing . I'll be back for sure its its now freezing weather for more of that awesome soup an sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere. Food is always fresh. Great salads service is usually up to par."}
{"text":"Long line on a weekend lunch but there's lots of tables and seat yourself so they turnover fairly quickly. I typically only get the Newk's 'Q' white bbq chicken sandwich which has the best toasted hoagie bread to contain the chicken and other self-serve toppings like roasted garlic and peppers. Do yourself a favor and add those to the max since the choice of side is meh."}
{"text":"I tried the mac n cheese at the taste of charlotte this year and I just had to eat here.This was my first time eating here. I really enjoyed the shrimp po boy and the corn and crab soup. I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Got a roast beef sandwich. They toasted it even though no cheese on it and it was nasty. Also only 1 slice of roast beef. Total rip off and food quality was so bad!"}
{"text":"The Newk's Q, & the Crab Bisque are the bomb diggity. Super quick & convenient.

The packs of the of the breadsticks are addicting.

You can't really go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"I was here twice and both times I felt the food was average at best, and not worth the pricing. 

It's only pizza, sandwiches and salad and the trouble with that limited menu is there are dozens of places with a mile of here that offer better. 

I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy on my 2nd visit. 6 average sized shrimp, one leaf of wilted lettuce, and two thin slices of tomatoes for $8.95.  No thanks. For that price I can go to Johnny's Red Bowl and have a huge salad (enough for lunch) plus entree for the same price (including drinks!). 

When I asked the waitress what the white colored sauce was, being as I don't like heavily peppered sauces - she did not know. Worse, she giggled and was proud of her ignorance of what she was serving \"Why would you want to know?\" she said,  \"aren't mysteries so much more fun?\".  No ding-a-ling, mysterious are not fun especially when your stomach can't digest certain foods. 

Turns out it was a mustard-seed sauce which I felt didn't go with shrimp anyway. 

I find the prices between Blakeney and Ballantyne commons are higher than elsewhere due to the affluence in the area. If you want to pay double than go for it."}
{"text":"Why does everyone brag about this place?? Do I have to try it again, really? I ordered the pizza with shrimp and it was missing the cilantro that it was supposed to have come with. I wasn't thrilled with the menu so unless someone has a suggestion from me I won't be going back. Overall the taste of the pizza wasn't bad however it needs to be cooked a little bit more. I really have nothing else to say about this place. See ya."}
{"text":"I just love Newks.  Always great quality and fast friendly service. My favorite is veggie pizza...just order it! Amazing and my bestie had chicken salad sandwich yesterday and said best she ever had.  Soups are also rich and served at correct temp.  Salads fresh and tasty.   Could eat here multiple times a week!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, quick, hot sandwich!

I swung in late one morning for a quick to-go lunch. With plenty of choices, I opted for a hot chicken sandwich with pesto, goat cheese, red and yellow peppers. Hello, deliciousness!

Conveniently and neatly packaged, I was able to fuel up and drive to where I needed to go. Very happy with my to-go dining experience!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for lunch.  Their sandwiches, salads and pizza are really good.  Some of my personal favorites is the Black and Bleu salad, the BBQ chicken pizza and the Newks Favorite salad.  

The only down side is that the prices isn't as friendly as I would like them to be.  Other than that.... A great lunch spot indeed."}
{"text":"Seriously needs to rethink their phone etiquette. I called and was transferred a total of 4 times to place a catering order. Even got hung up on at one point. One girl even told me that I should go online to place the order.  HUH?! I called back and still didn't place my order.  Instead McAllister's got my business. Get your phone ordering and your caterers in check. And tell them to stop passing the buck."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not written a review before, because I have been coming to location for over a year. From the service to the food, Newk's delivers! I try to get there on Sundays, the best chicken tortilla soup around, and the toasted sandwiches are always fresh and good! Great place for lunch with friends and family."}
{"text":"\"No Soup for you\"?- Not here! 

They have great soup and sandwiches, the prices are reasonable and the staff was very friendly and genuinely seemed happy to be there, so was I.

I wish there was one by my office."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is a chain.  It's one of my new favorite restaurants...  The chicken salad is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"I eat here quite regularly, at least once or twice a month if not more as I work in Ballantyne. I often enjoy the pizza's in which my visit was made specifically for today. Upon ordering, I was told no pizza is available today. I asked why, since the pizza's are what, 25% of the menu items? The cashier glanced over my question and I again asked about the pizza out of curiosity. The cashier then told me \"they ran out of dough\".  Really??? Again, pizza is a large portion of your menu and you don't have any? (Insert eye roll here)"}
{"text":"Food: outstanding 
staffing: immature 
management: much to be desired 
Atmosphere: dated 

Dust on lighting fixtures and equipment. Dirty silverware received by myself and my companion. Dirt on my companions Togo cup. 
The number we received to mark our table was disgustingly sticky. Soda area looked like it has not been properly wiped down in a week."}
