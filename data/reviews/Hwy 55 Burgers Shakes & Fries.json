{"text":"Po boys are overflowing with shrimp, burgers are huge, ordered a double and didn't want expect it to be that big! Fries are fantastic. Custard and shakes are available for dessert. Service is great. Parents really liked it."}
{"text":"The pimento cheese burger was delicious. The children loved the cars their food arrived in. To top it off the strawberry cheesecake custard was wonderful. The atmosphere is spot on."}
{"text":"i love there hamburgers and wings, best chain hamburger on east coast. still trying to work up the nerve to try the hwy 55 challenge. staff is great."}
{"text":"I'm so torn bc I'm an original Andy's ( it will always be Andy's!!! ) so of course the food is great. However, at this new location my food was sub par. My burger was cold, bacon was hard, and my requests were ignored. I don't know if some of this has to do with the service bc everyone in there seemed very distracted. It was like in school when your teacher steps out for a minute and everyone goes crazy. Everyone was very nice but just bc you're nice doesn't mean it's quality service. I had to ask 3 times for my missing fries which I wanted crispy but just gave up on that, 3 times for a cup of hot sauce and wave down someone for refills. I know that might sound petty but wait staff is supposed to offer refills, right? When we were still eating someone came over and announced our total. I'll probably stick to the university location but thanks for the good food."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger, fries and a Pepsi....was so good! My first time here. Service was the best I've seen compared to other restaurants.
Jordan fixed my burger early so it was ready when I got the there!  Now that's excellent service! The gentleman cooking took the time to make sure the order just right. Definitely will go back and tell others."}
{"text":"Ehhhh not a big fan.  Burgers ok.  Not bad.  Nothing outstanding or bad about it.  Very average.  Good value for money. B"}
{"text":"We've ate here many times and it's great every time! Only once has our server been not great. I just chalk that up to it having been a Saturday and it looked pretty busy. 
I haven't had their milkshakes, but I have had their coke floats and love them every time! The onion rings are also delicious."}
{"text":"This would be a one-star review, except that their food and shakes are pretty good. Their service, however, was awful. My husband and I waited over 10 minutes for a waitress to come by and take our order, but no one ever did! We eventually got up and left, and no one even noticed. Lesson learned - if I want their food, I will order takeout."}
{"text":"Disappointed when I received my food.  The burger looked like half of it broke off--only filled up half of the bun.  And the bun was falling apart."}
{"text":"This was excellent. My burger was juicy, and the service is very quick and good. We were seated quickly, The French fries were my favorite, and following behind the burger, as I said was juicy. I can see myself going back!"}
{"text":"Good burgers but the shakes are amazing, if i ever want a banana shake i would go here."}
{"text":"First visit to a Hwy 55 Burger. This location is fairly new & the staff was over the top friendly. Ordered their steak sandwich which had lots of meat  but the sandwich appeared to be microwaved and it made the bread kinda funky.  Fries were tasteless & this was one of the few times I left more than half on the plate. I think it's an OK place for families - fun decor."}
{"text":"Most amazing grilled cheese sandwich and banana milkshake EVER!!! Staff is so friendly!!! Love it!!! First time here but definitely not the last!  :-)"}
{"text":"A very big pet peeve of mine is when a restaurant has dirty tables that have just been sitting there unattended. That was the very first thing I noticed when walking into Hwy 55. How hard is it to keep your tables clean? Especially when they aren't even busy. Also, the employees were carrying on conversations throughout the entire restaurant. Basically shouting at each other. It was very disruptive and made it hard to enjoy our dinner. Service is everything and since their service is lacking, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best customer service I've ever received from a Hwy 55/Andy's establishment. I will be returning. Food was fantastic as usual."}
{"text":"Yummy!  First experience and it was AMAZING!!  We loved it and look forward to going back.  I highly recommend HWY 55!"}
{"text":"First, let me say I love Andy's (now Hwy 55). I grew up in a town in Eastern NC where Andy's was the best burger spot in town. We ate there at least once a week and that's being modest. When my cousin told me that Andy's went through a franchise change and a location was opening on Charlotte, I was ecstatic.  Actually, I was more than ecstatic, I'm pretty sure I did a happy dance. That's probably where my happiness ended. The first visit was... meh. My onion rings were cold and my burger was just ok.  My experience was also lacking that charm I felt at the Andy's in my home town. They tried... believe me... they tried.  The next visit was a little more pleasant. My food was hot, my philly was delicious, but my waitress, whose name escapes me, was horrible.  Let me just say, I will not go out of my way to return here. If I'm in the area maybe, or I may just visit Applebees instead."}
{"text":"Burger was tasty. I just got a regular Andy size cheeseburger. Fianc√© got a specialty burger with chili and onion rings; it was messy but tasty.

Prices were reasonable. We both got burgers and fries and it cost $14. I'd go again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is filthy! I don't think they ever wipe down their menus and the stuff on the tables was very sticky. I don't think the franchisee reads any of these reviews or they would be making sure a thorough cleaning be done, if they care about their business at all. If the front area is this dirty I cannot imagine how dirty their kitchen is. Never going back. My husband said the bathroom was hot and gross. The food was ok, but I couldn't get past the filth."}
{"text":"The burgers are good but the fries were very soggy. The waitress kept coming back every 2 to 3 minutes asking if everything was ok. As soon as my friend and I sat down and the menu was handed to us, the waitress asked if were ready to order. Customer service was good but the food could be less soggy and greasy."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat down for 10 minutes and no one cane to take our order. Only two other tables had customers and 5 employees standing at the end of the counter talking. 
The floors had food under the tables, bathrooms were not clean. 
Just got up and walked out. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Very nice,very speedy service.cool atmosphere....nice waitstaff and crew,and the food is hot and served fast"}
{"text":"One word, slowwwww. I came here for lunch on working hours.
First off, this place is near the industrial/manufacturing area and other businesses, there's a big lunch crowd, we don't have 2 hours to eat lunch.
We waited over 5 minutes after was told to sit down for someone to notice and bring over the menu. There were 4 waitresses, and only 4 tables at the time. It should not take over 20 minutes to make a few burgers, that's unacceptable given there were 4 kitchen staffs. The buns were too thin and soggy, I'm always up for a greasy burger but it was just off. I'd rather pay a few more bucks and go down to five guys. My friend had to go and ask for the check, was told she'll bring it to our table but she forgot so we ended up having to just stand at the register. It was getting pack when we were leaving, if we waited over 20 minutes for our food with 4 tables, everyone else might have to wait an hour."}
{"text":"Delicious food at very reasonable prices. Great for this college area of town. MILKSHAKES are so good!"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. Seemed very clean and the staff was friendly. It didn't knock my socks off but was tasty still and great for a road trip meal."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go to Highway 55 for lunch and when we walked in there were two waitresses in the middle of lunch time. One waitress yelled at us to seat ourselves and then the other waitress came over after we waited 15 minutes without bringing us menus. The waitress was very rude and acted VERY uninterested in giving us service. After we order the waitress brought us our ticket and didn't come back until we were done with our food. We had to flag her down to order frozen custard and then she took our ticket and didn't bring it back. When we got our frozen custard it was half melted and the concrete we ordered was half full and filled the rest of the way with whipped cream. We had to go to the back counter to get a refill and when we were checking out it took the waitress 10 to ring our food up. I contacted corporate and they forward my email to the franchise manager and he said his policy is that they try to give you free food to get you to return but will not give you a refund when they are told you and your family are not returning. Manager was also very rude and was not interested in compromising with me on anything...."}
{"text":"Save your time, money and bypass this place. We have given this establishment multiple times to get it together and yesterday was our last time. We walked in, sat down and nobody ever came over to bring menus, get drinks, take order and worst of all, they were not even busy. Went to the register to grab somebody to come over and help us, totally ignored. We walked out and I have a call into the corporate office. Could be a great place but they NEVER have it together. Again, save your time, money and most of all, frustration."}
{"text":"Hello fellow Yelpers!

This was really good, great burger! Even Elvis was there...on the walls. The burger buns were soft & yummy. I was there with my lovely wife, her buns too are soft & yummy. Next time we're bringing the kids. 

I just know I'll be stepping on those cardboard car tray things on the floor as soon we return home from our next delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time, and it was the most terrible experience for my family and friends.

I had to ask for my drink a couple of times to get it. It got never refilled. Order took around 40 minutes to come out (we had a 1, 1 1/2, and 3 year old with us) so imagine how stressed we were since food wasn't being served on time. Placed wasn't full at all so I wasn't expecting to take that long. 

Finally food came and the order was wrong, it was missing all the toppings we ordered on 2 burgers (except for lettuce) (it was a simple order, nothing out of the ordinary)
I didn't even get a \"I am sorry\", I waited a few more minutes but decided not to eat. 

I was still charged for the rest of the food.


I will never go back there."}
{"text":"I don't know what the corporate office did with Marty and the staff, but boy have they ruined this store. The new staff is indiffrent, the manger knows nothing about customer service,  the employees and staff seem very unorganized
The food is not good. I will not be back,  EVER."}
{"text":"Not good at all, when describing your 4 dollar cheaper burger, probably not a good idea to compare it to a McDonald's burger.  Burger was extremely salty and inferior meat. Bacon seemed like it was deep fryed yesterday,  it was completely dried out, no flavor and for the 2 dollars they charged could've been subtitled for Bacos imitation bacon bits. The roll fell apart after two bites and the overall appearance when it was brought to my table was that a blind monkey put the toppings on it. Don't order it with tomatoes unless you enjoy super thick and under ripe. Not thrilled at all. If I'm going to spend 15 bucks on a burger fries and drink, I'll take my business somewhere else. Also the wa"}
{"text":"People at this place actually go out of their way to avoid serving you. I just finished lunch (smallest cheeseburger ever), and my friend and I were hoping for some frozen custard. Both waitresses refused to look at us or acknowledge us. When we checked out, we were not asked how our meal was or wished a nice day. Little things of common courtesy are missing. These are automatic for most places. Avoid avoid avoid."}
{"text":"Shakes were good.  Only me and my son here. 3 employees. 2 siding doing nothing.  Girl only one really working. Floors are filthy. Trash all around. On seats. On floors.  Floor needs to be buffed.  Looks horrible.  My call is bad Manager.Sadly the food was no better.  Chicken sandwich was frozen for sure. No taste.  My Philly cheese was ok. But need better rolls. Fries tasted of old oil and onion rings just ok.  I may stop back for a shake but no food for sure too bad concept would be nice but not really what they accomplished."}
{"text":"Overall was not impressed by the food or service.  There was one waitress working while another three were sitting at the bar when I came in, I sat and gave my drink order then had to change it since they only do Pepsi products.  The whole time I was in there I think I saw one of the other workers get up once to do something then sit right back down even when a couple more groups came in.  

I ordered the original special with fries, the food came out pretty fast and you can tell right off the bat it's the same kind of fries you'll get from Harris Teeter next door.  The burger was what I went in for and it was decent but nothing to make me want to go back.  It was pretty much the same burger you would get at Cookout and a little better than Hardees.  

For $10 including tip I want something a little better than this, I'll probably be sticking to other places for a burger and Davinci's for lunch/dinner in that strip."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not entirely worth the price. 2/5 times the waiter would forget our order, or never give us our paycheck. Based off of other locations I have visited, it deserves a better rating, because the prices are lower here than other locations, and you are served more food. I will still regularly visit, and I still recommend this location."}
{"text":"Slow service.  Loud music.  Mediocre food.  Order was fouled up but just wanted to eat and leave so I did not complain."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!! Came in with my family for dinner around 6:30pm food didn't come out until 7:20 .... It took 50 min to make two cheeseburgers and a hot dog .... Food didn't taste any better then McDonald's across the street !!!"}
{"text":"Empty restaurant. Server was nice enough.

I ordered shrimp sandwich for $5. The quality of shrimp was very bad. There was no vegetables or tomatoes. Just small fried shimp and a poor quality bun.
Ordered another chicken platter which was equally bad. Wondered why I decided to go to this place. Will never go back."}
{"text":"My food tasted horrible and I'm allergic to nuts I ask for and milkshake the person didn't clean the blender after she made the 1st milk shake with nuts."}
{"text":"We voiced our opinion to the manager who was waiting at checkout and asked how it was so this is purely for others that may be contemplating this place. The restaurant itself could be cute but it was messy and definitely could have used a good top to bottom cleaning.  The crew is rude. We asked for fries to be extra crunchy on 2 orders and that must have been so against the rules, they came out lukewarm. Refills are not a thing they do here as the waitress brought us our drinks and never checked on us, it wasn't busy at all! We made eye contact with a different waitress who was sitting with her boyfriend while he visited her....and she rolled her eyes at us. None of them wear name tags so its not like you can complain. Our waitress' hair was a mess and I am positive someone got some hair with their meal that day. Asking for extra mayo on the side is also like pulling teeth, we had 5 orders she brought out 2 containers of mayo...next time I will be sure I go to mcdonalds or chicfila as this food is really no better and the price is much higher."}
{"text":"LOVE the staff and atmosphere of the store. HATE the food. I don't mind paying $8.00 for a burger and fries, but when the burger is at most maybe a quarter pound of beef with a huge piece of dry lettuce on top and very hard fries, you I think you can get the picture. Its too bad because Im a 50s kind of guy and if it was good I would be here constantly, unfortunately that's not the case."}
{"text":"We ventured up to Harrisburg from the UC to see if we could beat the rush on a Friday night and check out the new sensation- based on previous drive bys and crowds on weekends we had seen- to hit the 'burg.  The manager was friendly, the staff was also working hard to be welcoming to all the folks coming in and out and the menu seemed appealing.  My first BIG recommendation is to avoid ANYTHING that has the John Boy and Billy sauce on it!!!  I got the John Boy and Billy's Burger- with that sauce- but the menu stated that it also had mustard, onions, chili and onion rings on it - I don't care for bacon- so I thought it would be good since I was unfamiliar with what was inside of those JB&B bottles. HUGE MISTAKE!!!!! The whole burger was COMPLETELY overpowered and slathered with that sauce, which to me, was a disgusting, terribly sweet tasting and totally detracting condiment on a burger. My \"chili\" was a dollop under the patty ( I literally had to look for it since I NEVER tasted it) and I was just dismayed at how gross a burger it was.  The onion rings were frozen so pretty tasteless as well. Upon reflection, I should have kept it simple and ate the Andy's Cheeseburger instead and I would recommend to all if you are going to eat here or any of the new locations coming into the UC and the rest of Charlotte to do the same.

The mister had the JB&B  Chicken sandwich, which wasn't slathered as badly in this sauce- we agreed we couldn't imagine having the chicken wings with this sauce on them- but he said the chicken, while appearing to be a nice, thick chicken breast, had absolutely no taste.  The frozen custard ( it's their dessert \"thing\")  of the day was blue raspberry and they kindly gave us a taste sample. It certainly helped sway me from having a chocolate malt as it just tasted sweet. The other option used for just about everything dessert is the vanilla custard which, in fairness, I didn't taste. After the disaster that was the cheeseburger I decided I had been disappointed enough for one evening.

Maybe the intent is to be like an old time soda shop or maybe it is inspired by Johnny Rocket's- which is far better in my opinion. Either way, how you cannot have something as simple as a cheeseburger be good is beyond me.  The two of us agreed we would have been better pleased had we 1) stayed at home and made our cheeseburger/chicken sandwich ourselves or 2) gone to Cook-Out or Steak & Shake. I think our whole bill was less than $14, so your taste buds/expectations may be different from mine and the prices don't make it cost prohibitive to try- just tread with caution. As for us, we came, we saw, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was great!! My husband had the pimento cheese burger and I ordered the shrimp po boy and both were fabulous. It was packed and the kitchen hustled to get food on our table. Our server was also great...waitress made sure that our drinks were re-filled and checked on us often. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For $9 (no fries) this burger better sing.  It don't.  Go to Five Guys, better and cheaper"}
{"text":"This is the best chicken cheese steak in the city. Ask for Demetrius to make your steak. He is from outside Philly.  I'm from Philly and have not a steak this good in a long time. Keep up the good work and don't change."}
{"text":"A franchise burger joint near Weddington's Town Hall, John Boy & Billy BBQ Bacon Burger and fries were good. Topped off with Malt with Mix-In's called a Concrete (I ordered Heath Bar in mine). YUMMY. And they have Diet De Pepper, too!"}
{"text":"This place is filthy!! My first visit here and should have walked out! Time was 2:32 so it was not during the lunch hour. We both asked waitress if there were any combo burger deals. She showed us on the menu that the only one was in the top of the menu. It was a small burger, fries and drink for $4.79. We ordered that and waited a while before food arrived. No drinks came, we politely waited until we couldn't any more and I go up and asked if we could get our drinks. She forgot. Continuing to look around as we ate and could not believe how dirty this place is. When we went to pay the cashier insisted she had to ring each item separately for a total of $8.77 for the combo. The waitress came to register and I said I asked you about price and you showed us on menu that it was $4.79 total for each combo. She said 'sorry'. We paid their price as not to cause a scene, but will NEVER return. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service! Great American food, good ice cream too! Tammy was very nice and the food was great! Andy size burger with chili and slaw.....the best."}
{"text":"The service is fast and friendly. The food is great. While the burgers are the best, the Philly Cheese Steak can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great food.  Can't wait to go back.  Better than 5 Guys and so less greasy.   Kids meals are fun too."}
{"text":"I picked up food tonight for my family. I had just a plain cheese burger and my mom had a pimento cheese one. Both were a bit dry and she did not have enough cheese to call it a pimento cheese burger. My dad got the John boy and Billy burger and enjoyed it very much, I think the sauce made it less dry. The fries were okay but the best part of the meal was onion rings, they were great."}
{"text":"We went early on a Thursday night and had a great experience. Service was fast, food was served quick and hot, restaurant and restrooms were clean. Burgers were fresh and juicy. Kids meal served in classic car tray was fun and the stickers kept my kid busy for a while! I was pleasantly full at the end of the meal! Next time I want to try the ice cream!"}
{"text":"I tried again, this time I was greeted and asked, dining in or dining out.  When I said dining out, immediately she took my order.  Everything was smoother, folks seemed to be operating more efficiently and they were pretty quick on filling the order.  The food was excellent .  The only caution, last time they were packed, this time over half the restaurant  was empty.  The service, the food was good so this means we will go back....."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the shakes other than that you might as well go to McDonald's. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"Since we have a friend who works at Hwy. 55, we decided to try it last night. I ordered the specialty burger for Charlotte Burger Week. Interesting combination of beef patty, ham, Swiss cheese, pineapple, onion rings and John Boy & Billy Grillin' Sauce. The burger was really good, as I've come to expect of this location. The French fries were what I consider to be done correctly, with the right amount of crispiness. A scoop of custard topped everything off. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"for the best damn cheesburger i have every had in damn near 50 years go to hwy 55l it's a beast!"}
{"text":"Food was good, a bit overpriced for what it is... problem was we waited for a half an hour for a burger, steak and cheese sub and fries. There were 5 waitresses and 2 grill cooks. They were not busy, 4 tables?? Next time I wait a half an hour for a burger and fries it will be because I am cooking it at home! On a good note, the Orange-aid is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This place just opened in town and it didn't disappoint. Great burgers, great cheesesteaks and awesome onion rings and fries. It's a great place to take the family, and a great selection of ice cream. It's a great throwback to the 1950s."}
{"text":"Shakes are great! That's it though. The burgers were gristly and inedible and the bun was soggy. When my husband told our server that he makes a better burger, he responded \"I know, everyone makes a better burger!\" Not good. Furthermore, the restaurant was not clean when we were there (10/7), the floors were filthy and our feet stuck to them while we sat in our booth. Never. Ever Again."}
{"text":"Great food so-so service & prices.    Great burgers  some of best around.  Service is good right in the door and food comes quick but then hard to get a follow up visit. They always appear understaffed.    Prices about 7-8 per person."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in for lunch on a Saturday. Upon walking in, you are time-warped to a fifties diner ala \"Happy Days\". It was a little busy but we were seated right away. 

We both ordered an Original combo Andy size. The burger was freshly made, juicy,  and flavorful. The fries are warm and crispy but you will need to salt to your taste. 

Save room for dessert. Their custard ice cream is made in store and is quite delicious. It comes with your choice of toppings and in cups, waffle cones and even shakes. 

Stop by for an inexpensive but still excellent meal. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"When this first opened we overlooked slow service, cleanliness concerns, and incorrect food as they were learning.  But realized after a few months that these problems continue.  So stopped going. I wish them luck as there are a lot of new places moving into the hood."}
{"text":"Visited Hwy 55 today and received great service.  Catta was our server and she was very attentive.  I had the shrimp burger and onion rings.  My daughter had kids meal hot dog and fries.  I also ordered a burger combo to go for my husband.  The service has improved since our last visit and we will return.  The lemonade was great as wel."}
{"text":"Ok with the good. They are family friendly, A LOT of friendly waitstaff, and with lots of seating. 
The bad is a bigger list. This is a more expensive Steak n Shake, with higher prices and average milkshakes. We were there with another family, so we had 2 waitresses. Unfortunately, the other family had their orders taken 15 minutes before our order was. So, we watched  them eat for 30 minutes before our food came out. We realized why there are so many people working there, to deliver the food. As the food is ordered, it is cooked and placed out in the ticket order. The manager was yelling at them to stay in line, in order, so the food could be given to the right person. All the burgers look the same, the staff can't tell the orders apart. You would think the ticket would be placed with the basket or something to help the delivery process. I ordered the grilled chicken with pepper and onions, with coleslaw, fries, and Texas toast. Well, the chicken was just same old grilled chicken, kind of bland, and with no peppers or onions. The coleslaw was good. The fries were no different than frozen fries that were fried. This meal cost just shy of $10. The rest of the family ordered burgers. My husband didn't even get his burger, they forgot the onion ring and bbq sauce. The one thing that was supposed to make it different than the cheeseburger he received. His chili cheese fries were fries with liquid cheese and canned chili, no different than 711.  So, then they ordered dessert, milkshakes. My husband asked what flavor ice cream they have, um only vanilla, but you can put whatever topping you want to flavor it up. Then, you are left with a milkshake with big chunks that were stuck in the straw. We pay and leave. Multiple people were immediately sick. The pain created after was not worth this food. 
Overall, the price and quality of the food was not good. I get it, it's burgers. But a place that specializes in burgers, we just expected more with less pain."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. Fast service. Clean dining room. Bacon was a disappointment, would rather of had strips instead of the crumbled bits I had on my burger. Gravy fries were delicious."}
{"text":"The fries were good, but the hamburger tasted like Jack in the box, the tea was sour, the health department grade is 90 and the 6.99 special somehow ended up being over 9.00 the restaurant was clean from what I could see the staff were nice."}
{"text":"This place has been packed and for good reason. They are great !!
I had a Chicken cordon bleu with Onion Rings and my daughter has a Bacon Burger with Fries, Both were very good.

For Desert I had a 2 scoop bowl of custard and my daughter has a waffle cone. All of the food was good and I felt was worth the price.

The service was a tad slow but the ladies working the tables were doing their best to keep up and I think they were doing a good job. The place is new so you got to give people some time to get everything 100%. It kills me when people leave bad reviews for a new place and they don't give the place a change to get everything in working order."}
{"text":"Shakes are amazing. Totally worth it. However the food in general I was not a fan of. My burgher was mediocre and lost my appetite after a couple of bites. I had a side of of gravy fries which is a neat idea although fries were \"crispy freezed\" which means they taste like they were frozen and possibly cooked too long. A cute place just the food doesn't compare to expectations."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Music was great. Place was filthy. I mean, stuff all over the floors, tables were dirty, booths not wiped down. I've never been to a restaurant that was that dirty. I don't know how they are still in business. It would be one thing if they just finished a lunch rush and were working to clean up but all of the staff were just standing around. Horrible. Never again. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"The service here is good but the food is kinda off to me. Everytime ive eaten at hwy 55, gives my stomach the grumbles. But the milkshakes are awesome and the atmosphere  definitely gives off a real dinner feel. The food here just isnt all that great to me though."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Highway 55 in Harrisburg NC and a child was working there.  She can't be more than 6 years old and she was wearing the same black pants and pink uniform shirt as the rest of the employees.   She came to our table and introduced herself as \"your waitress\" and took our drink orders.  She checked on us several times while we ate and upsold their products.  When I declined to order one of their shakes for dessert she took the folder feom her apron, selected my check from the several she had and lay it on my table.  I watched her press buttons on the touchscreen register to process my payment as an adult employee watched and supervised,  I guess.  My first act upon leaving the restaurant was to call the non emergency number for the police.  There was no answer so I called 911 and told them it wasn't an emergency but here's what is going on and can they send someone to remind these people that child labor is illegal.  They gave me the non emergency number for the sheriff department.  I called and reported the facts and asked again if they could send someone.  They gave me the number for the state OSHA complaint line that operates during business hours.  I guess I'll leave a message in case anyone cares."}
{"text":"A decent burger place.  The wait staff was nice and accommodating. I felt more attention could be given to the cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a very nice bacon cheese burger and fries with my wife. Fast service and clean establishment."}
{"text":"HWY 55 is a blast...from the past. From the retro 50's decor to the rock and roll on the 'jukebox', I was taken back quite a few years. And the burger...is it possible to wax rapsodic about a simple burger? Yes it is. Fresh beef and toppings, fresh off the grill, and just so good. Took me back to the tastes of the 50's and 60's before everything came frozen in a box. I'll be back and I'll  bring friends. HWY 55 is just plain GOOD."}
{"text":"On a business trip to the Charlotte area, we decided to stop in for a bite to eat. The ambiance is a cross between Happy Days & The Jetsons, very colorful, laid back fifty's look with a futuristic appeal. 
The young staff was pleasant, the chef/ gentlemen behind the grill was awesome, funny and made our burgers as instructed. 
The only problem, or not even a problem, just something that was uncomfortable. One of the young ladies who works there kept soliciting her Services as being a hair stylist to us  as we tried to sit and enjoy our meal. Thought that was inappropriate. Then the waitress, hovered over us as we were finishing, packing up. Hovered over us as we counted money from our wallets, purses to put in the Bill-Holder book. It was so uncomfortable. Not sure if she wanted to see the tip or was standing there because she was closing out her shift to leave. Whatever the case, both ladies were inappropriate. 
Great Burgers though."}
{"text":"Wow. Went here for he first time and the server was obviously new because we had to ask her for straws, forks, and for refills. I wanted an itemized receipt to scan into the app and was told they don't participate in the app rewards. Ok, so why again was there a sign at the front reading \"sign up for our app\" then? On top of that, we had to wait for the tater tots and they were over cooked. Gross. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Been sitting at the counter for 30 minutes, service is non existent, been to the one in Fort Mill and they are busy and can handle it, this place is over half empty and no food is coming out. Back to fort mill . 3 for food zero for staff"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about the Hwy. 55 chain recently and decided to stop on the way home from the beach. Very reasonably priced food- spent $23 on a family of 4 and left stuffed. (Can't pass up a good Hotdog Special!) Husband enjoyed the pimento cheese hamburger and fries. Great \"seat yourself\" restaurant with a casual atmosphere. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I thought they had amazing good and excellent customer service. And the tea was outstanding I will really enjoy going back soon just for the 50-60 theme"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Highway 55 today and were very disappointed. Our waitress kept coming back every 1/2 min to ask if we were ready to order even though we told her we needed a min. 

As we were placing our order the waitress asked us over and over to repeat what we wanted and she came back 6 min later to ask again what we wanted on our burger. When we got our food my husbands was wrong (wrong cheese and condiments) which we didn't bother sending back because what would be the point?! Also note that the regular burger that you pay 3.99 for is the size of a McDonalds hamburger and the patty doesn't even cover the whole bun they use.

Our waitress came back and asked us if everything was ok approximately every 1.5-2 min. Customer service is great but it is annoying to get constant interruptions when you are trying to talk and eat with your company. Of course when we were ready for our check the waitress was nowhere to be found and another waitress got our check for us. 

We wont be back"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far and this is definitely one of the best places for shakes!! If you're big on shakes and malts, I recommend it! I'm going to try out a burger next time for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I went into eat.  Plenty of wait staff.  1 pm on Friday.  After 10 minutes I left.  No one even said hello or gave me a menu.  Too bad. I would have liked to have tried iy"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here a number of times. Service has always been and my food was always hot.  Although I like to add a lot of toppings to my burger it's not messy and falls apart. Good thing the chef knows to add just enough. Certainly one of the best burger places around.  (Go Andy's)"}
{"text":"I've always heard great things about this chain, and was super excited to see that one came to Fort Mill. My friends and I decided to go tonight to give it a try ourselves. 

I really liked the 50s feel to the restaurant. It's a bright, cheerful place. Unfortunately, though, it took longer than I expected to find a clean table. While walking around the restaurant I noticed an abundance of food, napkins, and straw papers littering the floor. Truly, litter was everywhere and it was noticeable. There were lots of people working, but the place wasn't super busy. I wondered why one of the waitresses or the manager couldn't go around and sweep. That turned me off. Additionally, when the waitress brought us our menus, I couldn't help but notice there was some sort of dried sauce residue stuck on my menu. They needed to be wiped down.

The food, however, was good! I got a small bacon cheeseburger and fries. The burger was seasoned well and the fries were hot. My friends shared onion rings that were also tasty, just a little greasy.

We planned to get dessert, but the ladies were cleaning the ice cream machines, so we decided not to bother them. We entered the restaurant at 9, and I guess they started cleaning it since they close at 10.

The service was great. Our waitress was a young girl who was very sweet and willing to answer our questions.

All in all, it was a good place to get a burger. Prices are reasonable and service was nice, just wish they'd work on cleanliness in the dining room."}
{"text":"Good food. Generally quick service. Their shrimp is great as well as the custard. Always seems to be a friendly staff on hand and the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"So excited to review this place again. Fantastic customer service and food again was amazing.  Food was hot and plentiful again but the service was MUCH improved.  Highly recommend this for GREAT burgers in Indian Land!"}
{"text":"Given that they are very new, I'll just rate the food. They are clearly still working out the kinks on service, but everyone seems very eager and the manager was walking around talking to customers, so I'm sure the service will be fine in time. 

For me, the food is just okay. I have been twice now (once by choice, once by invite). The killer for me is that the name of the places includes fries - and yet the fries are utterly forgettable!  Standard frozen fries. Yuck. I tried a bite of a cheeseburger and it did seem tasty. The meat was juicy and tender. Other items around the table were just okay.

I'm not saying I won't ever come again. The food is completely okay. It's just not a place that seems like a new fav."}
{"text":"Great eastern chain spreading west."}
{"text":"LOVED it!  This location had been recommended by family, but exceeded expectations.  A perfect burger with a boatload of fries/onion rings and everything was DELICIOUS!  Service was great, greeted by several of the wait staff who worked as a team - not overly crowded but busy as this was lunchtime, but no delays from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my dad sat there 20 minutes before they walked up to take r order waitress too busy talking playing with her phone
Then tolk 20 more to get are food . it was cold
Food was ok not the best  probably won't be back"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here for a quick mother daughter date. We came on a Monday and to my surprise kids it eat free Monday thru Wednesday! I love positive surprises! The food was pretty good and their custard was too die for. Kids get a free cup with the kids meal. Great burger place and I will definitely bring my whole family back!"}
{"text":"Good burger and crinkle cut fries. The 50's vibe and a courteous staff add to the location. They need to dust some of the lights and clean a bit, but it's not bad."}
{"text":"Great place close to home for a decent burger that is way better than fast food.  The fries are excellent and if you dare order up a vanilla shake and dip your fries into it,  i swear you will be hooked.  I think that the prices are very reasonable and they have good specials. About my only complaint is that I think they should be open later. My one star ding is for the service which can definitely be improved upon.  The last time we were there it seemed to be mostly teenagers working and they really didn't seem to want to be there."}
{"text":"Their food and milk shakes are so gross here. The food is overly salty and awful - complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Wow, I was a little surprised by the reviews.  My wife and I really enjoyed the burger!  We are new to this Rea and had never eaten at one of these chain spots but we liked it.  Felt like a fresh smashed type burger with great texture and you could clearly tell it had been seasoned with salt and pepper just right.  Fries and onion rings were fresh and just right.

The place does seem like it could use freshening in the atmosphere.  fresh paint or maybe the original paint was just not done well.  layout is a little odd and service wasn't 5 star but we didn't feel it needed to be, just a fast slinging burger joint."}
{"text":"Great place to feed my family. My kid can be a picky eater but I can alway depend on bringing her here to eat more than just one item on the menu. Great food for a great price with great service all close to home."}
{"text":"Hwy 55 in Indian Land has really fresh and delicious foods.  Prepared to order.  Fast service.  Clean.
I loved my Swiss and mushroom burger with fries and gravy!!!  My family loved their food too.  Milkshakes and hot fudge sundaes were very good!  We will be back again and again.  Great service!  The manager checked on everyone to see if they were satisfied!  Nice touch and appreciated!"}
{"text":"I give 3 stars because of the cleanliness.  The tables were not cleaned well and the floors needed mopping.  The food was hot and fresh and the kids meal comes with a car which is dope."}
{"text":"I use to be in love with this place . And I use to work there but since it went under new management it went down hill . The food is so nasty and the way they treat their employees. They claim to very Christian but I got fired for being ungodly and for doing something they said was okay . And talking to the employees lately they tell me how they have been treated and I have never in my life seen or heard of someone treating"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Junk piled in window near register. We both had a Andy's Burger. Decent size and price, but NO flavor. They were gray and looked like they were steed. Very little grill crust. Fries had no flavor either. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Service was not good. Food was only average and way overpriced. I had to pay extra $$ for cheese on my burger. It doesn't come with fries. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We are new to the Charlotte area, Hwy 55 is across from our apartment so we thought we'd give it a try. The ambiance is like a run down 50's diner. Cute, but I wouldn't take a \"Tourist\" there. BUT!!!! The food was AMAZING!!!! I've had Shrimp Po' Boys before that were pretty good, but this one was incredible! Hubby got the John Boy & Billy Chicken Sandwich, he too enjoyed his. We were very skeptical when we walked in because it just seemed so out dated & a little frumpy, but I'm glad we braved it because the food was really good. Elizabeth, our server, was nice & very attentive. We will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"We came here on mother's day for lunch.  We were there early, so it was not crowded.  In fact, it was the manager and only one wait staff person at first, until a couple others arrived while we were there.

We both ordered a burger and some fries (could have easily split a side of fries).  Not much to say other they meh, it is just okay.  They are just burgers, nothing special and nothing great.  They are doable, but there are so many other better choices out there where there is outstanding flavor.

Service is fine, but a little annoying.  It seems as though they don't assign tables to the wait staff, instead it is a free for all, and it is a constant check in.  Yep, we are still good.

Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My third time here, and there are some serious management issues. First, the place was ice cold with the ac running full bore with it 50 degrees outside. We asked for it to be adjusted, but it never changed. We ordered the grilled chicken platters, which took an hour to arrive. The portions were small, the chicken bland, and the food was cold due to the above mentored ac issue. No explanation offered why the food took so long to arrive. For our trouble, we were offered a 10% discount, it should have been on the house. It may be a while before we go back. Maybe by then they'll have their act together."}
{"text":"I know that this location just opened so... I'll try to be a little easy on the negatives...


Let's start with the negatives:

1.Frazzled staff. I went on a weekday and got there right at 2pm, usually when the lunch rush is winding down.  The place had many employees but they all were running around all over the place and when I entered, I was asked to take a sit after I told them I'd be dining in. I sat for five minute as waitresses walked by me a hundred times before I had to get up and say \"Hey, can I get some service?\" They were really polite and apologetic. 

2. Over-priced. I spent $11.00 and change (plus $2.00 tip) on a chicken sandwich, gravy fries, and a soft drink.  The quality is maybe one step higher than fast food places and maybe one notch lower than franchise restaurants like TGIF or Chilies... yet, the price up there with Chilies. This is due to them offering only one combo for a burger, so if you want a burger and fries and not a chicken sandwhich (fried or grilled), it's way more expensive as there were no combo options (I asked). 

Really, that's all. 

Pros:

1. Atmosphere. It is clearly doing the 50s vibe, with the layout, decorations, colors, and oldies music playing.  It was relaxed, had plenty of space, and is overall a good place to go to lunch.  It was very clean, obviously since it just opened.  

2. Food. While overpriced due to no combo values, the food was good. I'll be trying more menu items as time goes by, just to get some variety. It's greasy, it's fattening, it's delicious.  My fried chicken sandwich was tasty and this being the first time I've had gravy fries, I am now a fan of them.  As I've said, I would say it's one notch higher than fast food like Zaxby's, a place I really like by the way, and about a notch lower than TGIFs, another place I really like, so this is a compliment."}
{"text":"This is one of the best or maybe the best burger dine in places ever. Very friendly staff I recommend this place 100%. Love it also like the 1950s style restaurant they have created. Will dine their again for sure."}
{"text":"Clean place, friendly staff.  Burgers greasy and tasteless, buns very flimsy.  Not great.  It was freezing cold in the restaurant.  We complained, as did the table next to us and the table behind us.  We were told the manager was the only one who had the key to the thermostat and he wasn't in.  We all ate our tasteless, greasy, disappointing food while we froze. Couldn't get out of there fast enough."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place.  Food was okay.  Service was friendly, but I was never offered a refill of my drink.  A place like this would be better off without servers and just let you order at the counter."}
{"text":"Great service. Waitress Amber was kind, friendly and always happy to serve. She even greeted us at the door! Shakes were delicious and fries were the best. 10/10."}
{"text":"I've always loved the 1950s style grills and this place delivered in that. Classic 1950s style burger patties with fries. A great lunch combo and I highly recommend this place for lunch. It's both quick and delicious."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner tonight at highway 55. The service was super fast and the wait staff beyond friendly. My kids absolutely loved that their food came out in cars and the milkshakes too!  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Fun and different. 
Great burgers very juicy and flavorful. Sweet tea was a little too sweet like syrup.
Onion rings were pretty good .
Waitress was a bit busy but doing what? Didn't stop by ask about our food or if need refills. Got up for refill and to ask for a condiment. Seemed all the waitresses congregated in the ice cream area.
Ever in the mood for a burger again yes will go back."}
{"text":"This place seemed like it would be good to eat at  what do old fashioned look about it  but My fries were cold cold cold and the burger was not that great"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that I visit from time 2 time. Food is usually decent. Tonight I visited this location, because I have been craving the Double Andy's Burger all week. I noticed a sign on the door stating that they will be closed for employee appreciation @ 8:30pm. I have no problem with that, the problem I have is that when I arrived it was approximately 8:15pm. I drove a little over 5 miles to get there, so I ended up going to Wendy's. I may call management tomorrow, after I sleep on this."}
{"text":"I hate that the service is so bad here. The food is good if your looking for a nice juicy burger. I didn't dine in but got a Togo order. The staff don't seem like they want to be there and they are not very attentive and I hate that I sounded so needy but when I picked up my to go order majority of the staff were standing around aimlessly until I had to wave someone down to let them know I was picking my order up. Placing my order over the phone was even a headache. When I got to paying for my order i asked for an itemized receipt and the girl gave me the most confused look on her face as if I asked for my money back. I would like to give them a try again but id hope to have a better experience."}
{"text":"I literally just pulled up to pick up my order and one of the waitresses is digging boogers out her nose with a napkin. I walked in and the two girls were sitting at the counter relaxing like they didn't have customers in the establishment. The SAME waitress that was digging at her nose put my food in bags. Plus side: One of the waitresses was really polite and got my lemonade. 


Ordered paid for and immediately put in the trash."}
{"text":"Not only was the Andy good but Andy, the cashier, was the absolute best. He was extremely patient and comical while I was deciding on what best to suit my palette for the evening. Can't say much for the young lady and the two older gentlemen that were working."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Three people working entire resteraunt (1 cook and 2 people hanging out with people at bar). Food was good, drinks remained empty entire time. Plan on a long trip. Too much going on for three people shop."}
{"text":"Welcome to Harrisburg! Loved eating at Andy's Burgers in Locust and now you are 5 minutes from me! Double cheeseburger with extra cheese please! Staff is always friendly even when they are slammed! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try Hwy 55 and I was very impressed!

When my co-workers and I walked in we were greeted with a warm \"hello\". Our waitress was a adorable! She was fast, fun and friendly! She gave us a quick rundown of the menu and offered some great suggestions. I opted for the meal deal which is a burger, fries AND a drink for only $7.99. What a deal - and you can make any modifications you want to your burger! 

When our food arrived it was hot and fresh. My burger was seasoned and the fries were nice and crunchy! Just like it should be! I'd absolutely return to this place and I HAVE to try one of their milkshakes."}
{"text":"I used to like this chain, but unfortunately this location has been a bust for us every time we visit. It's very slow service to start with, we have been there when we are the only customers and it's still painfully slow to order and get your food in a timely fashion. Once your food arrives you have to flag someone down for a drink refill. It's very apparent that it's poorly ran with little work ethics from its staff."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was fast. Our waitress Cato was AMAZING. We just stumbled across this place and so glad we came in. My teenage girls tried to do an actual photo shoot cause the decor was so adorable."}
{"text":"we been here several times, and the food and portions are awlays great! In fact, their philly cheese steak is much better than Hawthornes Pizza serves! Shakes and burgers are great! Glad to have this in Harrisburg!!"}
{"text":"Everything was great. Food came out fast. Friendly service great fries and delicious burgers with the softest sweet buns. Definitely will be going back. Their $6.99 combo is the best. You get a full meal with a little price tag. Comes with a drink fries and burgers. The shakes are a delicious dessert with a cherry on top."}
{"text":"New Owners! Totally revamped the place. Love the 50's feel. Excellent service by Kayleigh. Enjoyed the Po-Boy at reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Burger was delicious. The trimmings were all fresh and the size of the burger was perfect. 

The fries sucked. They were so plain and bland. Also the place could use a good all over wipe down and mopping. Although I understand the theme of the restaurant is to be diner style the overall appeal of the restaurant was lacking. 

So because of the burger I gave them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant, extremely nice owner,
Great Shrimp sandwich, Awesome onion rings and the batter they use has a lot of taste.
There custard they make everyday and the girls that work there put there on twist on different favors everyday. I will be back again and again...."}
{"text":"Good value for the money. We have had the same server the last 2 times. Taylor. She is very good and very polite and nice. She talks to the kids and checks in on us plenty.  We go for Harrisburg Elementary Spirit Night.  The food was great. Had the Cobb Salad tonight. Good portion."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place hoping for a local burger spot on our way to ATL, but turns out it's just a re-branded Andy's. Kind of a disappointment, but we needed to eat and keep driving. 

Staff was upbeat and full of personality. Not exactly the most \"helpful\" but they were friendly and quick. Wife ordered a philly cheese steak per waitress recommendation. It was HUGE, so definitely a plus. However, there was very little cheese on it and was seasoned with a lot of black pepper. She got fries which could have stood a few more mins in the fryer.

I ordered the Andy's Cheeseburger and it was fine I guess. It tasted a little funny, and while \"funny\" is probably not helpful for you to make a decision of whether or not to patron this establishment, I'm having a hard time coming up with a better adjective. Maybe that is enough to help you make a decision. In any case, we didn't get sick and I'm sure we got some level of nutrition. 

We did end the meal with a shared chocolate malt milkshake. The malt was mild, good for me, less for the wife. Initially it wasn't great, but by the end we rather enjoyed it. Surely this isn't the worst place to eat in Gastonia, but I'd keep looking if we had to do it over again."}
{"text":"Food is okay but the place is extremely slllooooowwwww and we were 1 of 3 tables.  Also, service was not good.  Waitress was very snappy and didn't have patience for someone new to the restaurant.  Not possible to enjoy a lunch with even two burger orders.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"As far as burger joints go, this is my favorite. I love their John boy and Billy burger, and the chili cheese fries! Their sweet tea is very sweet  (as it should be!) and their waitstaff is very friendly. They also have good custards, but I'm usually too full to have any. Large portions and good prices, delicious food = 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"*UPDATE* I have returned twice since the first two visits and I can honestly say the experience was completely different. The food was great and fresh, and the service was awesome and fast. Alisa was our server and did an outstanding job. The owner really cares about the experience his customers have and strives make it excellent. He came around to the tables and checked on the patrons personally. Very impressed!

*First review*
After my second visit I'm still not impressed. The staff is all very young and seem incapable of running a efficient restaurant. There were 6 tables seated and it took 5 minutes to get drinks and 20 minutes to get food after we placed our orders. The fries were fried too long and really crunchy. The shrimp burger I had was good though."}
{"text":"Another unimpressive restaurant in Harrisburg. Have given them numerous tries and have never been more than meh at best. Service leaves a lot to be desired as well. If I want a good cheap burger, our best option is Foster's at Concord Mills unfortunately. I really wish Hwy 55 were better."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight. The napkin dispenser on the table was absolutely filthy. I received my burger and after taking a bite, I thought I saw a mushroom, which I didn't order. I'm glad I pulled it out because it was an old, soggy jalapeno with a hair stuck to it. I showed the manager who gave ME an attitude and just took it out of my hand and stormed off. No apology. The waitress came over and said she was going to take it off my bill for me. Well of course you are because I'm not eating it. The manager must have passed me five more times and did nothing but give me dirty looks. I will definitely NOT be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Fries with gravy are fantastic. Clean and fast service. Waitresses seem to enjoy their work and are very attentive. Need larger place. It is quite often packed and you have to wait."}
{"text":"I managed to become \"Duke\" by checking in twice.  So, since I am Duke, you should at least give a listen to some constructive criticisms...It was a full house when I came in, so I guess that's the good news.

Take out order.  I was greeted warmly and served quickly, but the fun stops there.

I got a free hot dog through the rewards program somehow.  Cool.  However, this was the smallest hot dog I've ever eaten.  I don't know how you did it, but you managed to procure hot dog buns even smaller than the grocery store sells.  And the hot dog itself was just...a VERY plain old weenie hot dog.  It did not even appear to be grilled.  If I'm going to get a hot dog instead of a burger, at least try to impress me?  This one is OK for the kiddies, but adults expect an adult sized no kidding around baseball game hot dog.

I ordered onion rings instead of fries for a change.  These were literally dripping with grease.  Yuck.  Maybe shake them off a bit when they come out of the fryer?  Oh, and I counted five of them.  Let's see, $2.69/5=waytoomuchforagreasyonionring.

I ordered a shake.  To me, a shake should be a liquid drinkable through a straw.  This shake might make it through a straw tomorrow after it potentially melts, but today it is ice cream.  I appreciate the spoon, but are you seriously trying to be Wendy's?  A shake is a drink, not a dessert.  Get bigger straws.  Oh wait, It is finally melting, so now I have lukewarm chocolate soup.  MMmmmmmnot.  Lesson learned.

Someone tossed a couple of ketchups in my bag.  Thanks a lot for that.  Ingredients = High Fructose Corn Syrup?  I could forgive the off-brand if it were local or special in some way, but this is literally junk ketchup.  If you are going that route, than Heinz or Hunt's please.

So, despite the free dog, I was still at $7.  Whaaaaaaat?"}
{"text":"Just got a burger, fries, drink combo to go from here. The place was packed at 2pm on a Sunday, so you'd think it must be great. The place just opened very recently, so I think maybe all of these people might have been trying it out for the first time, like I was? I dunno. What I do know is that I won't go back there. A one-word review would simply be: flavorless. The burger had almost no flavor at all, except for the bacon, which I had to take off of the burger after one bite. They use a super smokey bacon that is very over-whelming. Not to mention, I'm pretty sure the bacon is pre-cooked and sitting in a pan on the flat-top for a few hours before you order it. Some of it was hard as a rock and some was greasy and transparent. Yuk. I couldn't eat it. The burger patty wasn't seasoned at all. Not even a pinch of salt and pepper. Probably the most bland burger I've ever had. After I took the bacon off, the only thing that added flavor was the onion, barely. They dice their onions, which I believe is burger-blasphemy. Burger onions should be sliced, not diced. But, hey, that's just like, my opinion, man. Their fries were not good, either. Again, flavorless. How can fries be flavorless, you ask? Well, for starters, they didn't have a grain of salt on them. Whatever oil they fry them in added no flavor, as well. They were also fragile. Wait, what? Fragile? WTF does that mean? It means when you pick a large one up, the heavier end of it kinda snaps in half. Weird, right? Very. I got a sweet tea with my order. Huge mistake, because it gave me diabetes. Okay, that's not exactly true, but I feel like I could have gone into diabetic ketoacidosis had I finished it. It could have been a mistake and someone sweetened it twice, but I've worked in restaurants before and that's amateur-hour stuff, if you ask me. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"First time visiting. Food was good. We ordered chicken philly, tenders basket, kids grilled cheese. Place was kinda gross, needs some deep cleaning. Ordered shakes, not impressed."}
{"text":"Always friendly service! Even as a vegetarian, I can find a few things to eat! The milkshakes are quite delicious as well. When my parents are visiting, they love to stop by this particular location, just for the friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, first the order was incorrect. Second, for this to be a 'burger place' they serve some of the smallest burger patties I have ever seen, even fast food burgers are larger. There is no way it is the 1/3 lb burger they claim. $20 later, still hungry."}
{"text":"Went last night and I will go back. Loved the music and the atmosphere there and the BLT was good and I also had the triple cheeseburger as well and it was great. I recommend getting the burgers andy's way."}
{"text":"Food ok. Not worth the wait. 3rd time I've been and had to wait each time just to order after being seated. Need to work on the services side of the store"}
{"text":"The food is good, the setup not so good.

As soon as you walk in there is an intimidating line. If you have a togo order you had better call it in other wise you will wait about 10 mins. It's cool atmosphere though. 

The chicken philly is good, I plan to try a burger when I go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, clean, nice waitress. Fast service. I had the Carolina classic with onion rings. French and hot! Delicious! Hubby had the pimento cheese burger and fries. Best pimento cheese burger he's ever had. Price was good too! Will be back!¬°"}
{"text":"Upon entering it was total chaos!  Staff was running around in nine directions at once. There was a really nice older gentleman at the door who got me a menu and asked if I was dine-in or takeout.  I told him takeout and he instructed me to get in line at the register.  I waited for 3-4 people to pay and was next in line when he asked me to sit at the bar to order instead.  My order was quickly taken and my food came up fast, I got a burger and a chicken sandwich and two shakes.  I then had to get back in line to pay which was quite frustrating since I had already waited in line once already!  By the time I got home, a less than one mile drive my chicken sandwich was a soggy mess wrapped around a dried out grilled chicken breast.  The fries were decent and the burger was just ok. It was very greasy and tasted like it was the lower quality than the cheapest stuff you can buy in the grocery store!  The only reason this place gets two stars is for the shakes!  The only saving grace!  Delicious shakes!  Yum!  Hopefully as this fledgling location will hit its stride soon but as of now, I give it a very poor rating. Such a waste..."}
{"text":"When I first heard that Hwy 55 was opening their doors right up the road from the house, I was eager to try them out, hoping that there would now be a delicious burger joint close by. Although I left with the thought that I'd \"probably\" be back again, I was a little displeased overall.

Going in, I will say I expected a retro Five Guys. Turns out this was more or less true, and has it simularities. The menu is pretty basic. Not much variety. 

Service could have been way better. Ordered a side of pickles for the burger, not a big deal I didn't get them. My buddy on the other hand, didn't get his fries with his meal and the waitress left the table without realizing anything was incorrect about the order. We all ordered the same thing too.

After ordering waters, the waitress said said our soft drinks would only cost $.40 extra becuase of the type of food order. We ordered the soft drinks, then charged the full soft drink cost.

Total bill came to $31 dollars for 3 people. Not quite the advertised menu prices if you ask me.

The up-side. Burgers were tasty. Not worth ~$10 pp though. Advice- get take out. Be specific with your order and don't take their word for it until your fully paid up."}
{"text":"Wonderful environment.
Super nice staff
Food is good
Prices are on the higher end"}
{"text":"Stopped by for an early dinner at about 4:30 on a Friday.  We were the only customers in the restaurant, so it was super quiet.

The floor was nasty.  Dirt foot traffic that honestly looked like it had been there for days.  There were 4 employees in the restaurant, 1 cook and 3 wait staff, though one was on break.....And with us being the only customers there was no reason someone wasn't moping the floor.  Worse than that were the condition of the menus.  The one my waitress handed me was filthy.  Obviously having been on the floor and stepped on, and looked moldy.  His menu wasn't much better, but it wasn't quite as bad as mine.  My husband made a comment to her about it and suggested that they should throw it away, but she shrugged and said it was just old.  She wasn't rude, just didn't seem to be concerned with the sanitation of her diner.

Those two things were enough, that I almost put a kibosh on the whole visit.  But my husband had his heart set on a burger so we stuck it out.  I'm glad we did.

We ordered the Andy's bacon cheeseburger and the Andy's Double Cheeseburger with Fries, and a Brownie Shake.

The food was good.  My husband enjoyed his double burger, though he commented that the meat was a bit bland.  They're griddle cooked, but didn't appear to be seasoned.  LOTS of cheese made up for it.  His was so big he had to cut it in half to work with it.

Very greasy, but that's expected, and didn't take away from either burger.

The fries were WONDERFUL.  Crispy crinkle cut fries that were perfectly fried and salty.  And the portion of fries was excellent.  Though, I'll note that the Ketchup that we had on our table was sour.....We grabbed a different bottle from another table, and it was just fine.  

The shake was OK.  I probably wouldn't order again.

All in all, we were very satisfied with the dinner.  The only thing that makes me rate it a 3, instead of a 4 was the cleanliness of the restaurant and the menus.

We'll go again.  Hopefully this feedback gets some attention to the cleanliness issue."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Literally one person serving and one person cooking!  Expect to wait forever!"}
{"text":"Hwy 55 reviews
  
       Good Burgers,  Good Crispy Fries,   Generous Portions of Everything, Perfect Onion Rings!"}
{"text":"Don't go in expecting decent service if manager/owner is not there. I usually call in an order everyday, today I go in with my 4yr and wait 5 minutes before getting  menu. Wait another 5 to sit and watch the waitresses debate about whose table it is. Needless to say I took my daughter and went to another restaurant. 2nd horrible experience so they will no longer have me or my co-workers patronage."}
{"text":"Wow, such picky picky reviews, chill out. I love this place, I get exactly what I expect for a great price. First, price, very inexpensive, about the same for my family as going to Subway, but service and burgers! All the servers and managers are always hustling. Food is good, it's a burger in a basket! Great tasting burgers made how you want them. One daughter likes to switch it up with a BLT, no problem, one kid likes the fried shrimp. All good here, I hope this place is here for a long, long time. Great addition to the area."}
{"text":"I walked in to place an order to go at about 1:15pm.  It didn't seem over crowded, but two of the waitresses seemed very confused and kept bumping into each other.  The waitress that seemed to have her head on straight asked one of them to ring up my order, but she only put my stub on the register, causing a delay when I had my food and shakes.  The burger was delicious, though heavy on the mayo, and the chocolate shakes were good, using their custard ice cream, milk and chocolate syrup, so not powdery at all.  I'd go there again all in all."}
{"text":"Love love love the theming of this restaurant. They seem to be spreading pretty fast around the area and that's okay. They have good cheap food and awesome decor. The staff here was very new and learning when I went but they did very good! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is nothing special. I can make better at home. Burger was small and smashed when I got it home. Fries tasted like nothing and were cold. I am just glad I didn't have to pay very much for this. Just disappointing."}
{"text":"I had been here before and got a burger but today I tried the chopped steak with onions and green peppers. I did not like it. The gravy on it was too thick. The slaw had no seasoning on it. I also ordered a bacon burger and fries. They left off the bacon and ketchup. I ordered a kids burger as well and it is supposed to come with either ice cream or a cardboard car. I told the cashier that I wanted the ice cream and she told me that her machine was down. I wasn't offered the car at all. I did not like her attitude at all and she was a young girl. She could see that I was unhappy and she didn't care. She should be trained a little more because she also did not charge me for the entire amount of my food and the manager called me back to fix it. It was not my fault that your CASHIER didn't put in the CORRECT AMOUNT to charge me."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new concept while waiting for our son to finish soccer practice. Upon arriving our server greeted us at the door holding the door open and told us about the popular items. This was our first time here being referred from a fellow Yelper. From there our experience fell down the toilet. We arrived and the place was completely empty. We should have noticed and now understand why. We noticed after our server took our order the cooks and manager were having a conversation with a young woman no customer talking about what extract words \"What s#$& are we doing this weekend\" Our server had to call twice \"order up\" before walking the ticket over to the cooks.  The food came out and was fresh and hot. Food and Ambience reminded us of Steak N Shake missing the positive professional vibe. While we were eating we noticed that the cook and manager left. We had finished our food and while waiting for our check two other customers came in. Our server left to go outside the backdrop (herd the door chime) to call the cooks and ran back in to start cooking the food, drop the fires, and make the shakes.  He first finished preparing the food and two to go orders and while ringing up last order the last customer to receive their order commented this happened the last time no one was here helping you, while the kids played in the back.  We finally were  tired of waiting 15 minutes after finishing and took the check to the counter to prevent him from doing any further running around. Needless to say we will not be back but it is concerning that staff running a good concept can ruin an image in a matter of 30 minutes. Note to owner you are going to have an open kitchen be sure the staff knows we can see and hear everything. Hire kids that have passion and care. Disappointed as I was a strong advocate for paying fast food employees more."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable, reasonably priced lunch. Walked in. Many tables open. Only awkwardness was not knowing if the place is seat yourself or order and sit like Five Guys. After walking up to a man we were told to sit wherever. Mom and I both had the Andy size bacon burger which was delicious. Cooked well, juicy... And best of all? Crispy bacon!! Yum! 

What I really loved was that things were ala carte so if you just want a burger you don't feel like you wasted money. Like Red Robin they charge $9.00 for a burger and never ending fries. One- I can't eat fries (or very big portions due to weight loss surgery) do HWy 55 is perfect for me.

Waitress was quick and friendly yet a bit intrusive (yes you can come to the table too many times!) but that is better than crappy service. I will definitely return.

Pro: no wait, quick service, great tasting, great prices.

Con: No direction when entering, waitress a bit annoying."}
{"text":"I got the bacon cheeseburger and I regretfully didn't get Andys size. The smaller size seem to get lost on the bun. My hubby got the the bbq and chili burger. He said it was really good. I got a side of onion rings they were pretty good. He got chili cheese fries and said they were good. My favorite part was the malted moose tracks shake. My least favorite part was the girl that rung us up. You want to talk about rude? We decided to get a rewards card because we enjoyed lunch a lot. We asked the girl how it works and she snatched it out of my husband's hand and wouldn't even show him. If the service was like what she gave we would not return."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when our area got a burger joint.  I love everything I have ever ordered.  The customer service is so welcoming each and every time entering the joint.  There are lots of younger people working in this place.  It's nice to see younger ones working hard.  The only complaint is have is everytime I go I have to wait so long for the food to be ready.  There milkshakes are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Closed ... gone  Sign on door says they're closed ...  been a good run but now it's over ... see ya"}
{"text":"Overpriced, and fries do not come with the meal. They advertise straight cut fries and serve crinkle cut fries. Server was appalled that I asked for a different hotdog bun when served a hotdog in a hamburger bun. Hotdog looks like a dogs red rocket. 1 out of 10"}
{"text":"Arguably one of the worst restaurants I've been to. The staff was nice enough but the atmosphere is the most lifeless, soulless attempt at a 50's diner. I got a BBQ burger and to say it was average would set the bar low. It came with the most generic, tasteless fries I've seen. To finish off my meal i got a vanilla custard with hot fudge, this was the only highlight, not great but not too bad either. With so many other better burger spots around the area at similar prices, you'd have to be nuts to go here."}
{"text":"Food that I received was good. But service horrible!
Food ordered was wrong and never got some of our food at all! If our server had paid attention to the food piling up on the server bar instead of playing with her phone we would have had a full meal. We walked away hungry and not happy!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great ambiance and really good food. 
6$ for burger, ff and a large drink. 
Definitely  recommended!"}
{"text":"Being our first time there and not having looked at any reviews we didn't know what to expect. We were both happy with the burgers we had for dinner. Defiantly much better than fast food and reminded me of what I make for myself at home. The fries were just OK The service was certainly fast enough and very professional despite their young ages. We enjoyed ourselves and will defiantly return. 
                                                                                                       SAM W"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever...my fianc√© got one burger to go and he's been inside 20 minutes and still hasn't been able to leave with his order...very disappointing..."}
{"text":"2nd time I've tried this restaurant....didn't get any better than the first time.  Really hate it too....it's the perfect spot for a good restaurant with decent food. The quality of the food products served is very low.  No taste to the meat and the fries are terrible. Sad."}
{"text":"Under new management & everything is WAY better. Great food & great service. A must when in Harrisburg!  Great burgers & cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Food was not correct, it was cold and the service was less than par."}
{"text":"The milkshakes were great (I had the pineapple, yum!) and the burgers in the smaller size were perfect for me, I tried the pimento cheese burger and fell in love. My husband and I ate for $19 including tip and left full and happy. The 50's music was cute and the decor was right on par with the theme."}
{"text":"The food came before our drinks, really slow service, the fries didn't come until we were close to leaving."}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes!!  Most are awesome!!  Great atmosphere and service....all are some the great qualities of the location on Steele Creek Rd in Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"Things here have gotten so much better with the new management. The food is back to being worthy of being called Andy's (parent company before name change), and the staff is friendly and helpful. Glad to see there's more life here again!"}
{"text":"Good food, good price. Only 2 stars because the place was far less then half capacity and burger and fries took over 20 minutes. Speed it up a bit."}
{"text":"I love this place, the staff is so friendly. The owner of the establishment is always friendly and welcomes you. The food is always fresh and hot....."}
{"text":"From a service perspective, they could give the staff some help.  The staff were younger & when not on their phones or laughing amongst themselves they found time to assist the patrons.  

The food was okay.  Standard burger & fries w/nothing seemingly to write home above.  A step above Wendy's & below Red Robin.  For a solid burger & fries, this is an a okay place."}
{"text":"My first time dining at a highway55. The food was good and I enjoyed the sweet tea. The wait staff is attentive. Definitely a family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in this new spot after work. I skipped lunch this day so my eyes were very big! The staff; friendly...the food; good. Your classic diner-style restaurant, they're just missing the stand alone building. If you're looking for a big juicy burger, this is the place. I need to return for a milkshake!"}
{"text":"Food fresh the hamburger was off the chain.... 
Shakes awesome 
Clean 
Upbeat fun music
Employee are very nice .....   

Krystal and Braxton are so awesome. Really went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Nice burger place that opened near our house. Love the upbeat atmosphere and the friendly staff. The old fashioned milk shakes are delicious, the burgers, however, could use improvement. I ordered a regular cheeseburger and it was a small little patty on a regular bun. Five Guys burgers are much better."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location I have a problem. I called about 9:25pm to place a to go order and was told they stop taking to go orders at 9:30pm so I couldn't place an order. When I got there I ordered a shrimp burger & chili cheese fries. I checked my order before I left to find that my chili cheese fries were just cheese fries. 

The time before that me & my sister ate in. It took our waitress forever to greet us and take our drink orders that I ended up going to the counter to let someone know.

The time before that I placed a to go order. When I got home my fries were soggy. 

I'm tired of giving them chance after chance to keep messing up, so from now on I'll be going to Hwy 55 Harrisburg."}
{"text":"I join the crowd who enjoy a simple burger, fries and beverage at Hwy 55.  This 1950s style restaurant is simple in design as to layout and menu. 

Their burgers are good, all beef and the buns fresh.  I like the double as it is more filling with out the extra bread carbs.  Fries are excellent, but I find that they are larded with salt.  I ask for no salt, get them fresh as burn your mouth hot and put on what salt I want.  Maybe you will also ask for no-salt fries and they will get the message to, literally, hold back on the salt pour.

They have custard as well as ice cream.  Custard has more egg in the cream and is much more rich and flavorful than regular ice cream.  It is hard to find in the southeast.  People from the upper east coast know custard and have grown to love it.  You will also, so give it a try.

Shakes are done well and for those of you that love super thick shakes they offer a \"concrete\" shake which is as close to solid as possible.  Multi flavors are available and there are also sundaes offered.

Back to food:  My favorite is the Jalapeno Jack sandwich.  It is a wonderfully rich cheese steak on a soft hoagie bun chock full of mushrooms, onions and jalapeno peppers.  Keep it over your basket to save your shirt or blouse as it is really juicy.  So flavorful.  I find it a tie with Jersey Mike's Big Kahuna cheese steak.  Different flavors but equally good productions.  You decide.

Service is excellent.  After school hours you have young high school waitresses, replete with pony tails and personality who help to set off the 1950s atmosphere.

Good food, good service and good prices.  Give yourself some good."}
{"text":"Listen- I'm not a clean freak. I love food trucks and greasy spoons.   A little \"seasoning\" doesn't freak me out. 

With that said, this place is just filthy. Not your \"Busy, Greasy, Good\" grime. I'm talking neglectful, dirty, never been cleaned stuff here. I'm not easily grossed out, but when it's obvious the table legs have been mopped AROUND forever with a dirty mop, down to dirt and hair all around the center post and legs, that's just disgusting. 

Having been in the restaurant business several times before, I watched the staff closely. It's obvious there's no management oversight. The cook and kitchen helper got in a minor food fight while I was there. The high school age server wiped off tables with a dry paper towel- not a bleach rag in sight. Fingerprints all over the windows. Thick, crusty dust under the computer monitors at the register. 

I will never return. Considering a tetanus shot. Blechhhhh"}
{"text":"This is my second favorite burger place. It's leagues above your run-of-the-mill  fastfood place. The decor centers around a 50's like diner. 

The chain used to be known as Andy's and nothing seems to be very different. The burgers are fresh and cooked to order and the bacon is real.  Although I do feel a mini heart attack every time I go but I just cant stay away.  

I wish there was more that I could say but you'll just have to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Man what a great burger! So much flavor in the meat! I loaded mine with lettuce tomatoes cheese mayo ketchup mustard grilled onions and jalape√±os!  Great place for a burger under 10 bucks!"}
{"text":"Two stars given because the food was tasty. Took quite a while for service, even longer for food. Watched a customer come in and not seeing anywhere to sit decided to clean off the seven empty tables that still had food baskets on them. She (the customer!) was doing a great job. Waitresses were nice, apologetic and trying to keep up. They were very short staffed."}
{"text":"The food is a decent value, but the service is terrible. Both times we've been there, the service is slow and the staff don't seem to care if we are there or not. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was below avarage, chili cheese fries are like the ones you buy at any gas station milk shakes are not made with real ice cream. The place looks nice but food is way overpriced for its quality. Will not come back"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here several times and it's one of our favorite places to eat. It's family friendly and the decor is adorable with a fun 50's theme. All of the servers we've had have been friendly and I'd rate the service as being really good. We have not had a variety of food there; we stick to burgers and fries. We've never been disappointed. The food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"First time at hwy 55!  Fun place to stop in. Hamburgs were really good and not greasy. Decorated retro and music to match that 50's vibe. 10 waitresses was a little overkill   We will return!"}
{"text":"Hamburgers are still awesome. Fries and onion rings were overdone and greasy. Service was slowest I have ever encountered. We were only people there at 6:30 pm. Should've told us something had changed."}
{"text":"This is just bland and fried food.  The staff is very sweet, but if you're looking for a really tasty burger, keep driving.  

It is a decent place for a shake, however, and would be popular with kids.  It's not expensive, and it's pretty fast service.  It's a local chain, but there's nothing really special here."}
{"text":"Friendly and Efficient with Good Fast Food

Frustrating visit to the Outlets but since it was lunch time, decided to try someplace I had not been to in the area. Used to like the Hwy 55 up our way but after 6 months, service dropped off and have not been back since.

Wanted to see what this one was like.  Walked up the door and one of the employees greeted me on the sidewalk, opened the door for me and took me by the arm and escorted me into the building. All of this while welcoming me. As soon as I was through the door a number of employees shouted out greeting as well.

I was made to feel at home and this is how the one up our way started out.  This location has been open a little over a year and they seemed to have maintained that enthusiasm.

Told to sit where ever I wanted so I chose a booth and sat down and a server was t here immediately to take my drink order and bring me my menu.

I initially thought about the current special of a two hot dog combo but decided instead on the John Boy and Billy Chicken Sandwich along with fries. I was given a choice of grilled or fried and since I'm trying to watch my diet, I chose the grilled. Note: Fries are a separate menu item and not served as part of the sandwich.

While I waited, I looked over the restaurant and it's a typical Hwy 55 or what used to be Andy's before re-branding.  50\"s theme with color of pink and light blue or should I say, Art Deco with vinyl records and other items from the time on the wall. The ladies wear pink shirts with the name Pink Ladies in a reference to Grease. Piped in music is more 60's that 50's but at this point in time, does not matter. Good through back.

The John Boy and Billy Chicken Sandwich is quite good and more than a mouthful. The Sauce on it tends to overwhelm the taste of the Chicken. Biggest distraction was the tomato which unfortunately was on the crispy side if you can believe that (under ripe) with little taste. Maybe as we get later into the season and we have more local produce, this problem will disappear.

Fries were pretty good. Nice an crisp and not raw in the inside like so many other places server them. This place does them right.

If you're in the Charlotte Premium Outlet area, this is a great place for lunch.  It's on the north side of I-485 while the mall is on the south side, if you exit the Mall to the north, you end up on Shopton Rd and the restaurant is on the right in a strip mall.  If you come out on Hwy 160, turn left and go over I-485 and the restaurant is on your left.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"I wish I would have seen the other reviews before we stopped here. This place is really unclean and offputting. It looks like it is being run by a bunch of teenagers without a clue. There is no food safety being practiced here. Nobody cares about service or about putting out good food product. No one is cleaning or washing anything. Some of the grime looks like it's been there quite a while. And this is not hidden grime either. It is everywhere and right in the open. I thought my burger tasted gross but my friend ate his. I will never be back here."}
{"text":"The burgers are good and fresh however it's annoying to have to pick from a small or large.

Love the hand squeezed lemonade and spun milkshakes. This is a great place to take the fam any night of the week."}
{"text":"Service is slow.  The food is fine, and the prices are reasonable.  The rewards program is run by a bunch of hacks that don't consider you the customer, Highway 55 is the customer and the rewards program operator's \"hands are tied.\"

The wait staff checks cell phones frequently, is slow, and doesn't always get your order correct.  This location is less organized than other locations I have been to.

I wrote too much about how awful Fivestars was and Yelp removed my review.  They also sent me a donotreply email."}
{"text":"Ok place for a quick bite. I had the BLT and chili cheese fries which were good. Generally lots of kids, but it's that kind of place. Burgers are always good here."}
{"text":"I am always conflicted when giving a poor review.  I know the establishment is doing their best, and I also know that yelpers count on honest feedback to make good choices.  Mt experience at Highway 55 was unfortunately very poor.  The service was slow, very slow, the burger was dry, and the tater tots tasted fishy from the shrimp sandwiches and overly salty.  Not the worst place in the world but if you don't have to go to this location I would recommend you eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time I went to this joint, I had a pretty decent cheeseburger. Today, I went in for lunch and after FIVE MINUTES of being ignored by the wait staff, I promptly left, never to return. I don't care HOW busy you are, this is YOUR BUSINESS! Shame. I work down the street and it would have been convenient for me to eat there, that is IF SOMEONE COULD POSSIBLY ACKNOWLEDGE ME! Unless you do not care about your reputation, acknowledge your patrons and speed up the service, period. No excuses."}
{"text":"I took my family and wife's parents here a few weeks ago, it was awful. The place was dirty, there was a large spill on the floor that the server warned us about but did not clean in the hour we were there. Service was slow, probably because the server was the only one in the building for the first 10-15 minutes we were there. Finally a male and female cook walk in from the back and start cooking. Kid's meals did not come in the toy boxed cars, as we told them they would. My son's hotdog was the most disgusting piece of food I think I've ever seen at a restaurant. The outside was bright red, the inside was almost white. We sent it back to get something else. The burgers were good, but the experience made me never want to come back, and we won't."}
{"text":"Just OK. They had a decent choice of cheese available for burgers, but they didn't have a lot of flavor. The fries were the same crinkle cut fries you can get at the grocery store -- nothing special. Staff today was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either.  Food was so so.  I'd rather have a Five Guys Burger if I'm going to pay for a specialty Burger.  The food was not good enough to tempt me back.  The service was also bad.  The waitress staff was busy talking instead of taking care of customers."}
{"text":"Not a fan. My advice is go for the plain fries because they are good, crunchy. The burgers are good just very small, so either get the double or get a cheese burger and laod on the toppongs as they don't charge extra for all the toppings. I think I'd give the interior a 5, but the food and drinks a 3. I didn't have a shake, maybe they are good and I might bring my son to test them out. He by the way, liked the food. As an adult, for the price, I'd choose Five Guys. 

I had onion rings, fries with chili and cheese, a single cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, mustard, ketchup, grilled onions and mushrooms with a lemonade.

Chili was too salty, cheese was probably cheese wiz - I ate the plain fries around the toppings. 

Onion rings would have been good if they were crispy, they weren't.

Lemonade was warm in the bottom of the cup, cold on top, and sickeningly sweet with a wierd lemon flavor. I couldn't drink it. The burger was perfectly cooked and juicy, the toppings made up for the small size, but they were also skimpy because the buns are small. I had to eat it with knife and fork, but it was a good burger. Again, I want a burger? I go to Dunwellz or Five Guys. 

Interior was fun, clean and open. Service was good and the girls were polite. 

As I said, my son ate the leftovers I brought home but it's not worth my time or money for a meal for myself."}
{"text":"So this place opened by my house and we thought we'd try it out, we sat down ordered food and waited about 45 min!! Other people that came after us already got their food and we were still waiting....so we get out food, the hot dog was colored red for some reason, it looked disturbing my kid didn't wanna eat it, I asked them why it's red and they said that's just how their hot dogs are!  I ordered shrim p boy and this bun was steamed for some reason it was so rubbery I couldn't even chew it! Lol like wth?! Who steams bread?? Bottom line, we left disappointed the food was nasty the meat is not good I think McDonald's across the street would've been a  better choice! Never again!"}
{"text":"$8.50 for double cheeseburger with no sides? The food is pretty good but I think it is overpriced."}
{"text":"Food is always very consistent to taste and amount... I like going there... Staff are always polite and fast.. Rarely have to ask for things before it's taken care of.. Overall feel of the atmosphere is very good... I remember when these were all Andy's ... Quality and service has stayed consistent over the years..."}
{"text":"Best service you could ask for at a restaurant, staff was super friendly and attentive. Highly recommended. Best milkshakes and cheesesteak you could ever want for as well. Hard to get to location, but worth the drive 100%."}
{"text":"This is a great burger fries and shake kinda place. Friendly staff. Great food. Will have to try the frozen custard or a shake at my next visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food served here. This is a great burger joint for food that tastes like your at a cookout. Yummy for your tummy."}
{"text":"Now that Five Guys is gone, this is my go to burger place in Gastonia. The burgers are really good- very fresh and with a lot of options. I particularly like the fact that you can get the John Boy and Billy grilling sauce on them. Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah!!

Good fries, good homemade frozen custard, and decent service. I understand it takes time to cook the burgers, but often we have to wait for refills, napkins, and to be seated. Still, you won't complain about your meal."}
{"text":"We decided to go here before a movie. I've had great meals at other locations; however, this one is absolutely disgusting. We walked in and were told to sit anywhere; however, every single open table was not bussed. There were people waiting around and doing nothing while it was so disgusting. They didn't offer to bus the table until after they took our drink order and came back and never wiped the table. The six dollar chicken tenders were the size of a chicken nugget. While I love Hwy 55, I will not be back. I wish my friend would have read Yelp first."}
{"text":"This 1st visit was great good service and good food. However my last two visits have been less than satisfactory. Service was so bad at the second visit that me and my friend received complimentary coupons. I decided everybody had an off day we will go back. Well this is the last time service has been slow had to ask twice for drinks and then they are out of food items . ( grocery store is across the parking lot) I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Family friendly and fun with great service and fantastic food!  Burgers and onion ring delivered with great service.  Perfect place to take the kids after a day at Carowinds.  We will be back."}
{"text":"When you're craving a burger, this is a fab spot to enjoy! Ambiance was fun & I loved the 50's music. I especially loved the custom toppings; various cheeses, veggies, condiments. Friendly and quick service. High recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Then sanitation rating is 90, which is a little concerning. The burger was only \"ok\" nothing terrific or memorable. It's hard to find a burger that has a lot of flavor in a restaurant. The toppings are what gives most of them flavor. The fries were only \"ok\" too. There's definitely nothing that makes this place stand out. You can get a meal from a fast food place that's just as good."}
{"text":"Same guy owned the one in Weddington. You can tell. They do not know how to hire and train a staff, I am guessing they have the same cleanliness issues as they did in Weddington. Too bad, the company should choose who represents them better, it is more than just having the money to open a restaurant. Save your money and go fast food."}

{"text":"I came here with a coworker for lunch. The service was pretty quick which I liked. Our server was polite and gave off a great positive attitude. When we got the bill we noticed that she had put everything on one ticket. She quickly separated the checks and it seemed liked she gave us both French fries on the house. Our food was cooked fast so we were able to eat and relax for the rest of our lunch break. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ate here for supper. We were confused when we first walked in on how to order/be seated. It is a sit wherever you can type place. I would say this is kinda like a Steak 'n Shake. We all ordered cheeseburgers and were satisfied. We did wait a long time for our food to come and our waitress gave us a free scoop of custard. Nothing was outstanding about the burgers. Fries were average. Custard was the best but they only have two flavors - vanilla and the special of the day.  It was a very cheap meal though! 3 cheeseburgers, 3 drinks, and 2 basket of fries for $22. Will probably come back because of the price!"}
{"text":"I enjoy what Hwy 55 has to offer compared to it's competitors. The price is reasonable & the food is always fresh. The Indian Land location accommodated my Hwy 55 challenge & we've had lunch here a few times with no complaints. Very friendly staff & clean establishment."}
{"text":"Came in with the hubby for dinner. Empty restaurant, but all the tables where dirty. I used a napkin and wiped it off. Server was nice enough. 

Hubby ordered a hotdog which is fire-hydrant red, she said it's a eastern NC thing. Okay, not for hubby who is a Armenian that eats all sorts of weird things, and he was disgusted by it. I ordered chicken tenders and a grill cheese. The grill cheese had 1 I repeat 1 slice of American cheese on it with big Texas toast style bread. Then the chicken tenders where seriously  weird, the texture the consistency everything. 

And when I told her I was disappointed with my food she took the grill cheese off my bill. After we paid she said \"our tenders are usually good, we ran out of tenders and had to buy them from Harris teeter\" !!!!!! Are you kidding me? These must have been bottom of the barrel quality. If she would have told me when I placed my order I would have choose something else. Not going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited this location regularly since we moved to Charlotte Area almost 3 years ago and each time it has actually been pretty good but with that said the last 3 or 4 months especially the Fort Mill location and South Carolina has gone downhill to waiting a long time to be seated or to get an order and the last couple times we got to take out the orders been messed up we get all the way home today and are fries are so done you can barely bite into them so with that said it's definitely started to go downhill compared to where it was when it first opened"}
{"text":"Note to Owner - you seem to be very responsive to the reviews but you don't seem to be doing anything to make your restaurant cleaner or better.  I live in the area and used to eat there, bring my grandkids and family, all the time to eat.  I always thought the food was good and the servers very nice.  But it is filthy and when I last visited for a cone, I stuck to the floor and mentioned it to the server, that the place was always dirty and he nervous laughed, like it didn't matter.  I have been in when people are standing around waiting - they can be cleaning.  I haven't been back since, but I want to - you're a neighbor and I want to support the local establishments, but not as long as it's dirty.  Forget about responding to the reviews and scrub it down and educate your workers how to work!"}
{"text":"I like the burgers, the fact that they have so much to put on them. It's like a more expensive version of Five guy burgers, just a little better. And the inside 50-60ish decor is really nice. It feels like being back in time. This place is a very chill family type place. I think kids will love it, the place screams fun. I Got there big chesse burger, they need to add some spice to the patties. I think they like to play it safe when it comes to flavor. I'm more into Home country cooking, where they use the kitchen sink. No average burger place for me."}
{"text":"When this first opened, we had a great dinner. We all got burgers and fries. The kids got milkshakes and they loved them. The Pimento cheese is really very good on the burgers. A couple of weeks later we got take out and unfortunately, they totally screwed up our order."}
{"text":"Service absolutely sucks!!! Went there a few weeks ago and everything started out fine. Then after my friend and I started eating we received no refill on our drinks till the meal was finished, we weren't checked at all during our meal, and the food wasn't the best quality. And to to it off our waitress had the worst attitude problem. I will not be going back, one time was enough for me."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit...busy lunch, got seated quickly..tea was good, wife had pimento cheeseburger with chili fries, all was real good, i had shrimp po boy...super good, and so overflowing with shrimp that i had to eat a bunch before i could pick it up!...and gravy fries were great, server did a good job also...we will be back"}
{"text":"Food was great. A lot of choices. The only thing that I did not like was the seating, I felt like it wasn't enough space for seating. I also didn't like that the cooks didn't have hair nets or hats on. But the food got 2 thumbs up from my family and I !"}
{"text":"After giving the new management two times to get it right... Its still lacking, severely. Went in again today, and some guy who just tries too hard asks aLOUD who has table two? The owner ( lady) said she would take it. Finally, the loud dude comes over with menus and came back to take our order. Food delivered, and we were on our own. While watching staff, they all seemed out of sync. Not even organized chaos.  Eventually, we had to go up to the bar to get refills ourselves. So much for the service side.... Now to the food.... It was just average. One of us ordered a bacon cheeseburger and the bacon was a twisted mound the size of a golf ball stuck under the bun. The buns were cold as if just out of a bag. The onion rings were really greasy as if the fryer oil wasn't hot enough.  Only one custard flavor and only one side of the machine had custard, which was dripping from the spout. Sure, this place may have changed, but not nearly enough. True restaurant experience is still amiss."}
{"text":"Sat down and waited 10 mins or more for a waitress to bring menus and take a drink order. Didn't even get an acknowledgement that we were even there.  Walked out!  Never again"}
{"text":"I like this place. The prices are excellent. The food is very good. Don't expect the best burgers you've or best hot dog. But you will get good burgers at a very reasonable price.

Their shakes, concrete, etc are all good. Sorry no picture of those. Maybe next time"}
{"text":"This was our first time going here! It was delicious! Much better than the reviews let on. We got the little cheeseburger and little pimento cheeseburger and they were awesome! We also got an order of crinkle cut fries and they were crispy yet soft in the center. We got two Death by chocolate concretes to go, and it was the perfect way to end the meal. Overall we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and good service. We had the Po Boy, Chicken Fingers, Andy's Cheeseburger, Fries, onion rings plus two milkshakes (Peanut Butter Cup and Cookie Dough). Food was served hot, waitress was friendly. This is not as good as Five Guys. You can avoid this restaurant unless you like Oldies music."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dining experience tonight until the waitress (who wasn't serving us) start to loudly complain about her co-workers and job 3' away from where we were eating. It was very unpleasant and it's no wonder her co-workers don't like her! I didn't like her after 30 seconds either.

That said, our waitress, Aubrie was very sweet to our son and very in tune with my family. The main cook took my son's order and started it early while my husband and I picked our dinner. They allowed my son to watch them cook and spoke so kindly with him. 

We will be back, but we will be sure to avoid to loud, annoying complainer who took away from a wonderful experience.  Time to find a new career!"}
{"text":"Service at Hwy 55's can be hit or miss in NC. We stopped here after a church service later at night, around 9. Not super  busy. Waitress was attentive at first, but her boyfriend was sitting at counter. In fact it took long to get our drinks as I noticed she had them poured but not delivered as she was talking to him. After about 25 mins of waiting for our meal we were told their was a mess up and that our food would be longer. Then another girl came by and said that our meal would be comped. The waitress failed to put our order in, yet the restuarant wasn't busy. Again, distracted. I really appreciated the restuarant stepping up to that without asking. That's a big statement I tipped the 2 cooks  as I could tell they had to cook longer to fulfill our meal. Not sure though who was the mgr on duty as they all seemed to be young, in high school, etc. It would have been good to hear from the mgr. Maybe we did, from the girl who told us the meal would be free?  Again, they did the right thing and i appreciate it, but better training is needed in this restuarant."}
{"text":"Service from Jordan was excellent! She was very friendly and attentive. Food was priced decent and hit the spot."}
{"text":"This place is beyond repulsive! It has only been open around two weeks, but it is filthy. There are utensils, napkins, forks, dirt and grease all over the floor. Their hood system is not working properly, so there is grease all in the air and a layer on the tables and booths. When we walked in there was no host, so we just sat down. Our waitress looked like she had not bathed in a week and had warts all over her hands. She brought us sweet tea, and it was very weak. My husband ordered a grilled cheese with bacon. When it came out the bacon was raw. He sent it back and would not order anything else. I had the shrimp platter with fries. Everything was so greasy and mushy it was not edible. My dad and brother both had hamburger steak. The gravy was so dark and thick it looked like chocolate pudding. They both scraped it off. The actual piece of hamburger steak was tiny and was not seasoned at all. When we walked in we noticed that the milk and whipped cream was sitting on the counter in the milk shake prep a area, and will still sitting out when we left. The machines that spin the milkshakes were also filthy. They had household laundry baskets on the floor in the kitchen for God only knows what. It was just odd. When we complained the manager never came over. The young kid at the counter took my husbands sandwich off the bill and gave us a discount. I would not go back to this place if it were the last place on earth. It's honestly that disgusting."}
{"text":"All you need to know is they have a 91.5 cleanliness rating..   Walked in to many open tables,  but none yet cleaned from previous customers.   Sat down at \"cleanest\" one,  and waited a while for them to even acknowledge us.   We had to ask her to clean the table.   Floors were dirty -  crumbs,  trash,  and also looked in need of serious moping.   Bathroom looked much like a travel stop truck bathroom.   Wallpaper pealing all over too.   Custard area disheveled and messy.   Could not bring myself to order that!   Food was VERY good though!!  Not sure we will go back,  given service and lack of cleanliness,  however."}
{"text":"I used to eat at hwy 55 a long time ago back home in Sanford . They were always great had great food and great staff . Me and my boyfriend just started coming to another location in Charlotte and the last few times have not been stellar . Currently sitting in here and eating and we had to send our burgers back because they were undercooked . We got our second burger but mine just didn't make the cut the second time around I guess it just wasn't meant to be haha . Leaving disappointed once again , sincerely angry customer ."}
{"text":"50's style restaurant, burgers fries and shakes. Good service, fair prices and good tasting food."}
{"text":"Not a good first experience. After entering and being greeted by one of the cooks I had to ask if my family should wait or be seated. I was told, through a forced smile, to sit where I like. Three of the four available tables were still dirty. After being seated, we waited 18 minutes before a friendly waitress (Alia I believe her name is-she earns a whole star by herself) asked if we'd been helped. After giving us menus and a couple minutes to look it over, our orders were placed and repeated back to us with, \"Your food will be ready in five minutes.\"

Twenty-five minutes later our baskets were placed before us: a small burger (regular size) and a blt, both with fries (which my wife is pretty sure were Ore-ida brand). The top bun of my burger was stale, about a third of it was chewy and my last bite I could bear was actually crunchy. I left the last third behind. My wife's blt was promised \"5 pieces of bacon,\" and that's what she got: five small pieces of bacon. Three on one half and two on the other, not even enough to cover the soggy bread. The lettuce was wilty.

The custard (described as \"premium ice cream made daily\") earns the other star.  This stuff is pretty amazing, and the only reason I'll go back. In fact, I watched one couple pop in and out with a milkshake each, ordered at the bar. I could tell they had been there's before!

If you don't love ice cream, this place is totally skipable. We had good interactions with our waitress, but the food was disappointing. I'd rather go to Cookout and take it home."}
{"text":"Friday March 9th 12:30. Stop by for burger and fries once again excellent service very fast very friendly. The whole crew seems to get along and have a lot of fun while they're working. And the young lady that's managing make sure she stops by at least once if not twice to check on you and how your food is I think that's a wonderful thing. Looking forward to my next visit there also I've been stopping by and getting the salads to go wonderful wonderful salad just the right size for lunch. Someone is looking at this from Highway 55 please thank your employees they're doing an outstanding job there's a lot to choose from in that area. But this is the place I like to go thank you"}
{"text":"This place serves fairly generic burger joint fare.  It is OK but nothing special to the food.  I assume that the marketing schtick is supposed to be the 50's diner theme but the manager/staff does nothing to help this along. They really seemed tired and sort of depressed, like they're just waiting to go out of business.  

I ate at the counter for a relatively late lunch (1pm).  One of the wait staff had all of her credit card receipts and other tickets from earlier in the day spread out on the counter.  I thought maybe she was finishing her shift but she didn't do anything with this mess while I was there. This seems a possible opportunity for credit card number theft?  

The counter where I sat had been cleared but not wiped down.  

Was told by my waitress when I asked about the burger sizes that the regular was 'the same as the kids meal', or I could \"Andy Size\" it which was \"a little bigger\".  The 'andy size' was not very big, can't imagine how small the regular must be.   

With multiple burger options in Fort Mill I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"94.5 sanitation score. Walked in and walked right back out. Empty restaurant and it's filthy."}
{"text":"I don't know what is going on today but this was a huge mistake for a lunch break. Place was packed and they had 2-3 servers trying to serve and run the register. Kind of a total mess."}
{"text":"Burger was great! I had a regular cheeseburger \"Andy sizes\". Fries could've been better, a little to soggy for me. Had a custard brownie, so delicious! Also, the lemonade is fresh squeezed, unbelievable. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awful! The food is so atrocious I don't know how they stay in business. It was so bad (got takeout with others at work) that I emailed their corporate customer service with receipt # and photo of gross food and they didn't respond (if they offered to replace I wouldn't go back, I just wanted them to know the crap this location serves). This place needs to close before someone gets sick. Avoid."}
{"text":"Went in for a bite to eat last night, everyone was so nice. The love the Philly cheese steak with fries yumminess."}
{"text":"Arrival: Andy's opens at 11:00 am.  At 11:00 one employee pulls up and opens the store.  

Greeting - \"As you can see, we are not ready yet, are you wanting to order food\".
After I advised that I WIlL be ordering FOOD the employee turned the fryers and grill on advising it would be approximately 7-10 minutes before they are hot enough.

Customer Service: He was polite and while ringing up my order apologies for the delay.  As I was leaving a second employee arrived to give the one man show some assistance.

Food: My order was ready at 11:17.
I always order the tasty shrimp burger and it was delicious, as usual.

Location: Perfect location if you are traveling on I-85 and want some good food.
I'm surprised there is no sign on I-85 alerting travelers of this location.

Overall: I will be back and I continue to be a satisfied customer.  I simply suggest management schedule someone to arrive prior to 11:00 so that customers do not have to wait."}
{"text":"Tasted like frozen burgers and mediocre shakes. Nothing to write home about. Service is slow. If you are driving by and wanting a burger, here you go. Don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up, 1 burger and 1 hot dog. 11:15  they had 10 employees and  5 customers. How do you get my order completely wrong? The burger had the toppings that belong on the dog and the dog had just a small amount of chili!
Customer service was just as dumb as this order!"}
{"text":"This place is relatively new so I was willing to overlook the fact that we were ignored for over 10 minutes after sitting down. After I inquired we saw  the servers discussing our table; evidently there was confusion about whose table it was. After ordering my coworker went to the restroom and upon returning a different server came over and asked her if she had found a cell phone in the restroom. She told her she had not. The burgers were good and the shake was good too. The bills for both of us were incorrect but since they were close to what we got we just paid them. Then we rose to leave and as we got close to the door a manager and another server blocked our exit. The manager said are you sure you didn't find a cell phone? My coworker said no. My coworker felt like she was being accused, and said I don't even have a purse. The manager replied, 'well, we keep pinging it and it comes up to your area' pointing at our table. My coworker assured her again that we didn't have her cell phone. It was very upsetting to be accused of stealing a cell phone when we were just trying to eat lunch. I phoned the store later in the afternoon and spoke to the manager and told her who I was and asked if she had found the phone. She said oh yes. She was flippant and uncaring about the way she had treated us. The entire staff was unprofessional. The food was good (not great) so I gave a star for that. We will not return or encourage others to visit."}
{"text":"Amazing custard was awesome me and my son loved it was smooth and creamy can't wait to try the floats next I'm thinking maybe a Sunday next"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  The food was really good and the server we had was very nice.  Here are the reasons I gave them only two stars.  First, for this type of restaurant there is need to have a server come to the table and take my order.  It would be much more effective to give your order at the register, pay for it and then be given a number to put on your table for someone to bring it out.  Second, the wait staff seemed to be all teenagers.  They were all nice, but it was obvious that they didn't have a lot of experience being waitresses.  The one adult in the place (manager maybe?) was in the back cooking the food and our waitress came out to our table way too often.  I just don't know if this type of restaurant needs waitresses, maybe just runners for food and put the soda station somewhere that the customers can get to so they can do their own refills.  

I was happy with my food and with a little bit of organization I think this place has a chance to be a decent burger joint.  It would have been nice if there were more booths and some separation between tables instead of one big open room with tables and chairs but this is just the way the restaurant was set up."}
{"text":"I have been to this location about 12 times now.  I really want to give them 3+ stars but due to areas where they are lacking, I cannot.  This is close to my home so I REALLY want them to work out the kinks because having a good burger place nearby would be awesome!
Pros - close to my home, reasonably priced, most of the staff are friendly, open until 9pm, food has potential to be good (meaning it is good sometimes and other times it is blah).
Cons - Burger buns are COLD (yuck), burgers do not appear to be seasoned, often receive cold fries, service is sketchy at times, interior colors are ugly but who cares if they can improve and have good food and service. 

-I usually get the burgers to go because they wrap them in foil and it warms the bun.
-I tried the crab cake po boy and it was close to the worst sandwich I ever had.....EVER!
-The hot dogs, not too bad as the chili is pretty good but I am not a fan of the dog itself.  
-Philly - this is a good sandwich if you get it to go (it warms the bun).
-Sometime the onion rings are good but lately overcooked yet really greasy like they were cooked and put back in the oil and oil is old!
-Fries are basic and really need some salt when they first exit the deep fryer.  1 of 4 times I get them they are COLD!
-I have had tomato on several sandwiches but they are not ripe so I remove them (must have a terrible supplier) and no longer order them.

Overall it is a great location with lots of potential.  I hope the owner will look into these issues and make some changes and work with the staff.  
The first week they had a server in there who was really good and was able to tend to 3 to 4 times the guest as the staff are now but sadly she has disappeared.  The rest could really learn from her!!!"}
{"text":"So this is my Third time at Hwy55 And im not please I find that the food is bland and the attitudes are worst. The experience is dreadful serious people everywhere love this place but i dont know why!"}
{"text":"Went the day before Thanksgiving just after lunchtime, around 1:00.  I took the 2 kids for milkshakes because they did well in school and Hwy 55 is known for their milkshakes.  While there I figured I'd have a Chicken Philly.
Place was still crowded for after lunch but we sat ourselves and were greeted quickly by a friendly server.  We ordered and the milkshakes came right out and the chicken philly wasn't far behind. 
The kids really liked the shakes, they were rich and creamy and put a smile on their face.  My Chicken Philly was great, I ordered it sans peppers but the bun was heated nicely and the flavors were all on target.  I have eaten at Hwy 55's (Formerly Andy's) all over NC and one of my favorite things are their fries.  Crinkle fries are awesome imo and a lot of places don't have them.  Here they do, just one problem today was that they sat a bit too long wherever they keep them and they were served to me lukewarm and they got cold while I ate them.  I didn't bring it up since I ate about half the order before they got that way.
Hwy 55 is a welcome addition to Indian Land.  Service was good and food was inexpensive and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was with a burger loving girlfriend, and asked her where would be a good burger place in her area to go to. She had heard about this place, and how one opened recently nearby. It took us a while to find it, probably since we were searching for \"Highway 55\" instead of \"Hwy 55\", but we made it! Located in a large shopping complex.

Very open and clean with a retro touch. We sat in a pink booth and I was salivating at the options. Their slogan of using fresh burgers, never frozen, reminded me of In n Out. I went for Andy's Bacon Cheeseburger and you can add a side (fries, gravy fries, chili cheese fries, onion rings, or a side salad) plus drink for just a few dollars more. I went with the chili cheese fries and soda, although I regret not trying a shake. You also have condiments to add on for free to your burger (i.e. chili, mayo, veggies, etc). 

Our food was served quickly, and one bite into that burger, and I was like WOW. It was super tasty, and I am craving one now as I think about it. The only con is the bun is soggy, would definitley help if they toasted it. Lots of flavor in this mouthful! The chili cheese fries were delicious as well, love how they use nacho cheese, and they were nice to give us a side of ranch. I was pretty hungry but even I couldn't finish all the fries. 

The big plus is the food is cheap! About $8 for the whole meal! I would definitley come back again!"}
{"text":"Took my kids here 9 & 4. They got the Burger and Chicken Fingers meals. They liked everything and have asked to go back.

Young/unprofessional staff"}

{"text":"My husband had fond memories of eating at a Highway 55 years ago so we made plans to stop by the one in Gastonia after church one day. Upon walking in my first impression was the floor is disgusting. It looked like someone splattered coke all over the floor and no one mopped it up. No one greeted us or spoke to us. I didnt know if we were supposed to order at the counter or seat ourselves and wait for a waitress? We ended up seating ourselves after awkwardly standing around for a minute . No one greeted us. No one said \"be with you in a few\" , not one word. For 15 minutes we sat there and no one came by our table. It was my husband and I and our 7 year old son. So we left and went to 5 guys and it was fantastic. Would not recommend Hwy 55 to anyone and will never be back."}
{"text":"This is a new location. I have only been to HWY 55 once and I loved it. This one? Terrible! I should have known it wouldn't go well when I ordered a coke or Pepsi only to be told they were out. 

We ordered appetizers and didn't have them come out until our meals were ready. Our meals sat ready to be delivered to us for almost ten minutes before they brought them to us. By then the food was cold. The kicker? It was dead. There were only two other tables filled. 

My daughter ordered a poutine and what she got I have no idea. It looked nothing like a poutine and it didn't have any gravy like the menu said.  I ordered a side of gravy with my fries and never got it. When I asked for it again that's when she told me that they didn't have Gravy. Which explained my daughter's poutine. So instead of telling us that to begin with she brought my daughter fries and cheese curds with no gravy. My son ordered the kids hot dog and it came back bright red. I have no idea what was in that bun but it sure wasn't a hot dog. 

I could go on but I'd rather not waste any more of my time. I will go back to another HWY 55 but it won't be this one and I highly recommend you look else where too."}
{"text":"I love smash burgers and really wanted to like this place. I have been 3 times in the last 5 months and ordered an Andy's double. The flavor of the burger is pretty good (even though it is so greasy it's running into a puddle in my basket) but every single time there is gristle all in my burger. 3/3 times I've been I've gotten 2+ bites of gristle and I just can't do it. It disgusts me so much I can't finish my burger. I won't be back. I don't mind giving you extra for good quality food but this is just way overpriced for what it is. Not to mention the place is pretty dirty and gross and the service is slow. There are plenty of other choices for a good burger."}
{"text":"First time customer, myself and a good friend were shopping in the area and decided on a late lunch (2pm) and we spotted this burger place close by. Do not even think of eating here. The smell when you walk in the door should be an indicator that cleanliness isn't their thing in spite of a 95.5 sanitation rating. There was one cook, and one waitress, that's it. 11 customers in the building and only two were eating. We were told to pick our own seat, the table we sat at needed wiping down again so we did it with water and napkins. The waitress was nice enough and took our drink order first, returning with the drinks within a minute or so stating \"I'll be back in a minute to take your order.\" 6 minutes later she took our orders, straight off the menu burgers, nothing special, with fries. While waiting I used the men's room. Don't recommend that one either. I've seen truck-stop johns that looked better. And I also found the source of a lot of the particular odor in the building. 

And this is where it gets sad, 27 minutes later our food arrived at our table with mine minus the fries, which she stated \"are on their way.\" 2 minutes later I got my fries. 29 minutes to get a complete burger and fries order at 2pm in the afternoon?

And this is sad because the burger was good, it should have been it was just cooked. The fries were equally tasty, also fresh. Which sucks when you think about it. Properly managed they might actually make  money, but we'll never step foot in this place again, or any of the other members of the chain. I'm amazed Johnboy and Billy would let a place run like this have their name associated with it.

So there you have it. You've been warned 'yo!"}
{"text":"Today I ate a chicken tender basket here and I must say I should have ate mcdonalds. The chicken looked like frozen fish sticks. I give it 0 stars"}
{"text":"Classic 50s style American food restaurant. They have a menu with burgers, fries, hot dogs and of course ice cream and shakes. It was fairly easy for me to find and a huge plus was that there was parking literally in front of the restaurant. Who doesn't love not having to take a long walk in the parking lot when you're starving?! I got a cheeseburger with American cheese, mustard chili, bacon and an onion ring. The fries were some of the best fries ever and I usually don't like fries nor do I finish them. These fries were good. The burger was good too. I'm not going to say how quickly I finished it but I got it to go and finished it before I got off the exit lol. Next time I'm going to try one of the ice cream sundaes or milkshakes. I was a little hesitant because I heard it was on the expensive side but the burger meal was around $10-$12. On my cheap days I hate when I pay $12 for a burger and I don't get a drink! Like seriously why?! Great place to try if you ever come across one."}
{"text":"Since my last review they've definitely improved their service...food is still great. And, we now get an itemized bill which makes me very happy!"}
{"text":"Great patties, decent fries. Onion rings are slightly above par for the course. Decor and ambience is great and retro, but the real prize is the frozen custard \"concretes\". They make vanilla custard daily along with a different flavor of the day each day. They have a board full of \"twist-ins\" to put mix in and make a truly unique and tasty dessert. You can also take vanilla or the flavor of the day by the pint or in scoops by themselves. Overall a good dive to kick back and enjoy some cheat meal food."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. My waitress very nice and personable. I would go back again."}
{"text":"The decor is fabulous and the staff is pleasant. We were served cold fries and the bacon on my husband's sandwich tasted funny so he didn't eat it. Luckily a sweet lady from the table next to us gave us a coupon and it made the price a little better. We were given hot fried but our sandwiches were already finished by then.
Maybe we will have better luck if we decide to try again."}
{"text":"So much improved
There is a really great waitress there -Sissy, she is so friendly and efficient, they were really busy today and short staffed but she managed to keep most people happy and full!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was FANTASTIC!  The food was very good for diner food and the ambience was wonderful.  I would definitely recommend this place if you want a 50's diner experience."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I have been in a while. Extremely dirty. Restrooms absolutely repulsive. Service slow, unattentive wait staff- couldn't even get our drink order correct. Watched wait staff pick items up off the floor then handle our food. Completely disorganized.  Just an absolute mess and the poorest service I've had at a restaurant in a long time."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our Philly cheesesteaks very much! Staff was very attentive, polite and pleasant. Felt like the kind of place where they'd get to know you and make you feel at home. Will definitely be back. Even the owner's young daughter was on her A game! Very well run!"}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers! They are large in size and have a seasoning I can't quite figure out. The wait staff are so sweet and attentive. Our favorite burger place hands down!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding in every way!! Best fresh Banana shake I've had in years!! Wonderful, crispy fries and fabulous burger.  We will be back here LOTS!!"}
{"text":"Our family comes here often.  The kids love the food and the prices are good.  Burgers and cheesesteaks are both good.  Bring back the Krinkle fries please.  We know it was a franchise wide move but please share the feedback with the main office.  The new fries are nowhere as good.  

Good ice cream and shakes as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! A large cup of ice made me happy but then the onion rings are delicious, the fries are phenomenal and the burger was too large for me to finish in one sitting! The burger was juicy and melted in my mouth! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Having been here several times, the service is disjointed and slow, the food is far from great, burgers are dry and severely over cooked, but the shakes and concretes are good. There's an attempt at a 50s style burger joint but they don't quite pull it off.  It works in a pinch but is not in my top 25 places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"I love the food however on many occasions my husband I witnessed disgusting habits from the cook, not changing gloves from raw burgers to plating cooked food, scratching his head with gloves then touching food...its just a matter of time before people get sick. On top of that if you truly look around at restaurant you'll notice how dirty the entire place is. It's no wonder their health grade is so low. Unless a new owner comes in and actually cares/cleans up the place and trains employees through servsafe we won't be back. It's a shame how the place is managed."}
{"text":"Let me say that I do not care for eating out of a basket. If you like plates this place may not be for you!  When we walked in there were tons of obese people so I assumed the food would be great! Big people like to eat! 

We weren't sure if we wre to sit down or wait. The staff looked at us but didn't say anything which was strike one for me. We sat at an open table and waited like 5 or so minutes to get menus and have our drink order taken.

Another 10 minutes we get our WATER and she takes our order. Another 20 minutes we get our food. It wasn't the best burger I have ever had but it certainly wasn't the worst. It was properly over cooked but the toppings seemed fresh.

The onion rings were subpar and the fries mediocre at best. However, the ketchup was fantastic. I am not being sarcastic at all that may have been the best ketchup I ever had. I wanted to take the bottle off the table but my purse wasn't big enough... Lucky them

We ordered some custard to cuz when in Rome right! My son got a vanilla cup that came with the kids meal and I ordered a concrete. It wasn't the solid concretes that I am use to from living out in Utah but damn it was good! 

Plus our bill was like 15 bucks you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger: Just worked on my lawn all day, super hungry, came here for the 1st time, and the burger did not disappoint. Get bacon... mm super crispy, patty is wrll done but still fresh and moist... friendly service, a little dirty floor, but hey, a good burger trumps all. What more can a hungry one ask for?"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Pimento cheeseburger was good. Fries are really bland. Also got a brownie sundae which is more than enough to share. Our server was a little obnoxious. She checked on our table every 5 minutes. She made us place our ice cream order before we were even close to finishing our burger and brought out the sundae immediately. So our ice cream was melting all over while we were rushing to eat the rest of our burger. Then she asked if we'd like our check together or separate before we had even tasted the sundae. We felt like we were being rushed the entire meal and practically pushed out the door.  And it wasn't busy at all! I don't want to say the servers name because I can tell that these are all young servers probably still learning. But I'm hoping management will talk to them about how to make their guests feel more welcome, and how off-putting it is to be rushed through a meal. I know this is a casual place but it is bad service to interrupt your guests every couple minutes to see if they are done."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now.  If it weren't for my last experience I would have likely given it 3 or 4 stars.  Bottom line - the staff needs to get it together.  The food is pretty good, and to me, a bit better than what you would maybe expect from a fast food restaurant.  

Where they fall short is their customer service and wait staff efficiency.  Our last visit couldn't have gone much worse.  We get there and there are a few tables of 5 or 6 guests but definitely not a packed house.  We sit down and hear the table next to us complaining to their waitress about incorrect orders.  We look over to another table and they tell us the service has never been so bad.  This should have been our cue to leave....but we stayed, unfortunately.  Our waitress was nice but didn't know their menu and would forget to bring us things we asked for (straw, spoon, water).  We ordered my son an ice cream with Reese's cups but it came out with Butterfinger.  Not a huge deal but we let them know to hopefully prevent them from doing it again.  I then ordered an ice cream for my wife an I with Reese's cups.  What do you think they put in the ice cream?  Butterfinger!  Again, not a huge deal but get it together people!  It was then time to checkout.  This should be easy, right?  First they charged me for a kids meal that was supposed to be free that day.  She didn't have the ability to override the order so she had to call her manager (I assume) who was also the cook.  He came over and took care of it.  I then had her go over everything on the order to make sure everything else was right.  Found another mistake with one of the items.  She didn't believe me until I had her pull out a menu and showed her.  

I wouldn't recommend going to this restaurant until they can prove they have what it takes to run a restaurant.  Right now they don't."}
{"text":"The shame about Highway 55 is that the food is pretty good for a burger and fry place.  The service unfortunately is consistently bad.  It goes from just ok to outright ridiculous.  I have waited on food for 40 minutes with hardly anyone there while and the servers talk at the cash register."}
{"text":"Burgers were hot & yummy- milkshake was delicious - super fast & great service - glad we found the joint"}
{"text":"Our first experience when Hwy 55 first opened left us so underwhelmed we haven't been back since.  However, we decided to give it another try since they're advertising new local owners.  I'm glad we did.  We had a much better experience.  Service was vastly improved and the food was very good.  The menu is very limited, so if you're not in the mood for a burger or dog, I'd suggest elsewhere.  The cheeseburgers are very good and prices are reasonable.  Decor is somewhat like a 50s diner.  I'm not totally sold on the decor, but I get it's their identity for the chain.  Can be very loud, but its very family friendly."}
{"text":"Two words:  don't bother.  Due to a supposed \"price increase\" prices have gone up exponentially, some things almost forty percent!  The food is poor quality and the servers CANNOT seem to get the orders right!  They also lied about not having things on their menu which, surprisingly, are STILL on the menu.  Go elsewhere.  You'll get better food at better prices.  We'll be going somewhere else in the future."}
{"text":"Well came in sat at the bar , even asked the waitress where to order and after 20 mins no one came to take our order, we finally decided to place our order to go and stand at register , we continued to be ignored , then when we finally got someone to take our order , we were interrupted several times for our server to handle other tasks and continue to delay our order, we felt like we were inconveniencing them to be there . When I asked what flavor ice cream they served , the waitress proceeded to throw a menu in my face and show me the topping and told me those were the flavor of ice cream. !?!? Horrible service,  attitudes and the floors need to be cleaned !!"}
{"text":"Since we are always looking to try new places, we were excited to give Hwy 55 a try!  After all, it's a burger restaurant AND they're in our backyard!    We knew that we were taking a chance with it being the day after they opened, but it was a pretty good experience!  We liked the menu, the prices were really good, and the service was 'ok\".   We had a teenage waitress and she had a bit of an attitude at the beginning, but then she warmed up a bit.  The managers kept checking on us and they were very friendly.  The restaurant was full to capacity, but the food came out quickly and the waitress was attentive.  There were a couple of small mishaps (the air conditioning unit started leaking from the ceiling and the computer went down during checkout).  No biggie...they handled both issues without a huge fuss and were very appreciative of everyone's patience.  Things will also happen, but how they are handled tells a lot about a staff...I was impressed.

The food:  There were 4 of us and this is what we ordered:  15yo son had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger with Onion Rings.  Husband has a Cheeseburger with Fries, my Mom had the Fried Shrimp Burger with fries, and I had  a small Cheeseburger with Gravy Fries.

The reasons why I'm giving only 3 stars comes down to this....this is a \"Burger and Fries\" restaurant and the menu is small so there is no reason why they should serve bland frozen french fries!  Secondly, the gravy on the Gravy Fries was from a can.  It was thick and salty and nearly inedible.  Scratch made gravy is so easy and so inexpensive that they really should consider it.  The burgers are quite good, my son loved the Onion Rings, and they have some great looking shakes and ice cream desserts.  The location is great and the decor is fun and friendly.  I think that they will do well, but I feel that they are doing themselves a huge disservice by using pre-made food items.  Based on the fries alone...I would be hard pressed to choose this \"Burger and Fries\" establishment over their competition. 

For those with a hearty appetite, they have the Big \"A\" Burger Challenge.  50oz of burger plus 4 trimmings on a bun, fries, and a 24oz drink.  Eat it all in less than 30  minutes and it's free.  If not, then it's $26.99!  There was a fireman taking the challenge while we were in there.  He came OH SO CLOSE, but didn't quite finish it.  His effort was really impressive though...he, literally, had only a few small bites left!"}
{"text":"We were excited to find something along the lines of South 21 in the Steele Creek area so we tried Highway 55.  It's trying to be a 50s theme diner offering hamburgers and hot dogs etc.  The food was ok, but the cooks and servers mishandled it to the point that the side dishes came out long before the burgers so they sat and by the time we got them they were no longer hot.  The burger was reasonable and had my onion rings been piping hot they'd have been much better.  The sweet tea was good and they offered a tiny spoon sample of a flavored custard... but as the waitress hands it to us she says \"I don't think we have enough to make you anything with this, but I just wanted you to taste it...\"   What?  How is that making a sale?  How is that helping the customer decide on a dessert?  Just an awkward interaction for no real purpose ...  it was odd.  There were no less that 6 employees standing towards the back talking and laughing... a tired sight at places like this.  They haven't been open very long so maybe they'll get better.  We'll give them a while and try it again."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Second time not much better than the first.  Food was above average, service a little slow but OK.  And I get it, it's a burgers and fries joint but no real healthy side options for kids (just fries and onion rings).

Docked one star for not having a changing table in men's or women's restrooms and for broken high chairs (strap buckle was broken).  Minor detail for some but huge pain in the rear end if you have small, squirmy children.  And I know the changing table issue may be a function of the landlord but still a real inconvenience.

Will we go back again?  Probably, but it won't ever be a top choice for us.  Maybe if we need to get something before or after grocery shopping."}
{"text":"OK, so I've been in a half dozen or so more times and lunch is good! Usually order online and pickup a sack full of goodnesses. Took a couple tries to figure out the app but I can generally manage to get a sandwich plus a beverage plus a side... :-\
Burgers are hot and juicy but try to keep it to lettuce, tomato, pickle, mustard, ketchup, and mayo unless you're OK with a huge dripping mess. Hot dogs are oddly red and hot and available with a variety of toppings including chili, onions, peppers, tomato, mustard, pickles...
I would like the fries better hotter and the shakes thinner but there's precious little I can do except turn up the heater in the little white truck and put the windows down."}
{"text":"Though I do not eat burgers all that often, I would love to have a great place nearby that has good ones. Unfortunately, Hwy 55 does not meet the bill.

Before heading in, I thought long and hard about the name. I mean, really: Are you saving that much by not using up those extra letters? It's been all the rage for years to drop a vowel here and there, but this is a little extreme - The missing \"igha\" is just strange. I get that the name is (likely) a tribute to the highway of the name that meanders through the state, but does spelling it thusly help at all? Sure, it's not an interstate, so I55 (or I-55) wouldn't make sense. And NC-55 wouldn't make sense outside of the state. But just \"hwy\"? Strange.

Anyway, on the inside, you get a nice feeling, that you are stepping back into an old-time diner or something. The colors are decent, and a somewhat open kitchen give it a nice feel. But the staff is just sad. I mean literally sad. They don't welcome you. They don't even seem like they want to be there. At least at CiCi's, they generally give a weak shout out that makes you marginally feel like you are welcome.

Sooner or later, someone will perhaps help you with your order. As you might expect, many of the items on the menu are burgers. They even offer a pimento cheese. Don't try it. Rather than a nice chunky pimento cheese, this is like cheese whiz. From a can. Down home cooking this is not. While they tout fresh, never frozen food, and perhaps some is, others are not - at least at this location. There are definitely better options to be had with a slight drive."}
{"text":"Very good service and good food. Me and my family love the crew. I also have a son that loves the Cars and the pictures on the wall"}
{"text":"4 stars mainly because of the burger, lemonade and service. The sides were okay, but the burger patties were particularly impressive"}
{"text":"Burger n shake shop that pretends to be like the good old days. But not so much. Nothing memorable here. Kids seem to be running the place. Is that real overran in the shakes or jello?"}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber eats. They had my order all wrong and they asked me to come to get the new order after I already paid Uber eats for delivery. No drink, nothing on my burgers and fries instead of tots.... $30 wasted"}
{"text":"We ate here other day, and enjoyed the diner ambience! Shakes are great? The burger was good, nothing extraordinary, fries were blah, and prices were equal to Five Guys or Smashburger, which we feel are expensive but actually cost the same as here.  Will skip in the Future for 5 guys."}
{"text":"Awesome food at affordable prices. I took the wife and kids here and we truly enjoyed it. The food came out quick and our server was excellent. My burger with pimiento cheese was delicious and the fries were fresh.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was very good. We got a mix of burgers, sandwiches, fries and shakes. Everything was perfect. Very friendly staff, clean restaurant and great prices!"}
{"text":"So I've been twice and here is the Low Down.  Their sanitation rating is 97.5.....so I would definitely eat here again since it is deemed safe.  That being said, the place feels a bit grimy.  The floors look sticky and worn...they could use a good polishing.  Everything you touch from the Ketchup bottles, to the table tent, to the napkin dispenser, to the table tops all have thr same \"sticky\" to them.  

As far as the food goes....it is pretty good.  Last time I had a Bacon Cheeseburger with fries.  It was really flavorful and scrumptious.  This time I tried the Cheesesteak and onion rings.  Visually is looked just \"OK\".   The flavor was slightly bland, so I had to salt it really well and put some sauce on it.  The textures, however, were fantastic.  The bread was super soft and not soggy....the steak, onion, pepper and mushrooms were cooked to perfection.   Only thing lacking was a little flavor. 

They have a really cool 1950s vibe in there with fun \"oldies\" playing.  

I particularly like the Elvis statue.

Would I go back?  It wouldn't be my first choice, but yes, I would go back."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but good - I'm not on a diet- I want something fried - I don't care about calories food.  I don't care for their icecream it's too thick as sweet for my tastes. They have some of the best hotdogs in charlotte with real chilli..yumm.  The lemonade and orange aid are fresh squeezed and can be addictive!"}
{"text":"This place is new in Harrisburg and I have to say that the only real good thing about this place is the desserts and the 1950's theme. I had a shake and it was probably one of the best shakes I had, and had it not been for the EXTREMELY salty burger and the dirty table, I probably would have gave this place at least 4 stars. Also even though I know they meant well, its not really in good taste for the server to come to the table every 5 seconds asking if everything is ok. I can understand once or twice,
But not that many times."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!!!! This place is absolutely filthy!!! Service and food were mediocre at best!!!"}
{"text":"What a great find in Harrisburg. 

We saw Hwy 55 one day while driving through Harrisburg so we stopped by to pick up a menu. Tonight we finally made it back and we loved it.

Hwy 55 is a salute to Americana and old 50's drive-thrus. Burgers, dogs, onion rings and custards are found on the menu. They also feature burgers recommended by customers as well as a having a 6 patty burger challenge. Eat it in 30 minutes and it's FREE. 

The burgers are awesome and juicy. Be sure to try the frozen custard....its really good. Service is fast and friendly. If you want a great hamburger Hwy 55 is the spot."}
{"text":"This place was not like what it used to be. I ordered their Pimento Cheeseburger, it was literally the size of McDonald's dollar burger. I thought I was at McDonald's for a second. Place was dirty, did not look like they do regular clean up. I remember when it was first opened and everything was great. Everything has gone downhill since then. I'd rather go eat McDonald's across the street."}
{"text":"The food was really good - the chicken sandwich I had was very tender but the reason I gave it a two is because everything was ala cart ; the sandwiches, fries, onion rings, drinks. It was $40 for my husband and I to have lunch and I think that's a little much for a burger.

Location is nice - 50s motif with big booth and their shakes looked awesome. Casual, large parking lot in Sun Valley area across from the high school"}
{"text":"Decent food, decent service.  Great for stopping in with my daughter for a quick bit.  She would give a 5 star review for the cool car they delivery the kids meals in."}
{"text":"Good hamburgers and crinkle fries! My favorite are the chili cheese fries. I got them to go the other night and they were double wrapped in foil in their own bag. 15 minutes later when I got home, they were still piping hot with ooey gooey cheese! And their John Boy and Billy burger is legit: huge and messy and oh so yummy! The hubby and I really like this place for to-go \"fast\" burgers at a pretty decent price; much better than going to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Restaurant was dirty, the tables, floor etc.  two people walked by the trash and saw it was full but didn't empty it.  The restaurant maybe had 5 guests, so it wasn't slammed.  The food wasn't that good, fries and hamburger were Lukewarm at best.  
Place is night and day compared to a chic fil a."}
{"text":"The burger was very good (Bacon Cheeseburger ) Andy size.  There was a nice amount of fries for the price. The caramel milk shake was very good. The waitress was very friendly but it took awhile to place our order. Burger was better than Five Guys."}
{"text":"I can only rate the burgers, since that is what the hubby and I had for dinner last night...and we were very pleased! The burgers reminded me of homemade, not fast food. We did enjoy the atmosphere and had decent service. It was a little bit of a wait, but nothing out of the ordinary. Wait staff extremely friendly and inviting. Will come back again for dessert... had way too much food to handle dessert on top of the burger/fries combo! Overall, we had a great experience."}
{"text":"Ok so we stopped in for lunch. We ordered a chicken cheese steak and fries and chicken strips. The food was ok. The chicken strips were cooked to my liking. Ate then with honey mustard. Yum! The chicken cheese steak was different. Kind of tasteless. It was definitely not the experience we were expecting. The fries advertised wasnt the type of fries we were given. So that was disappointing as well. We ate most of it...so im sure someone would like it. The customer service was fabulous! The place was clean and the bathrooms were clean as well. We might go back for chicken strips. Alot of people  were ordering burgers..too bad I don't eat beef. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick bite because it's close to our house. We were greeted when we came in and immediately seated. My husband and I ordered the same burger and I repeated mine as she asked what kind of cheese on a pimento burger. When they brought the meal mine had no burger when I told the girl her response was that's what you ordered. Nope I repeated my order twice which was a burger and they gave me the grilled cheese. We were in a rush so I just ate but no apology. My other issue is you can't be a burger and shake place without the shake. I guess the machine was down so couldn't order a shake. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"The food is alright. I had the shrimp po boy (which was huge) with onion rings. I liked the po boy, but the onion rings were meh. I also got a waffle cone with ice cream and the ice cream was already melting by the time it got to me. It was quite tragic."}
{"text":"Fun and simple old fashioned hand made burger. Prices are great, service sometimes slow, but a great value and a fun place."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here today for a little daddy/daughter meal and the waitress was great making her a vanilla frozen custard with Reese Cups, after her dinner.  I had a cheese steak sandwich that was really good too. Their burgers are pretty good, but I like a charbroiled taste better.  

Love the 50s style and the oldies music!  Reminds me of places my mom took me when I was little."}
{"text":"Disappointing, We sat in a half empty restaurant and no one even came to greet us for 10-15 min. Finally, some came over and then the drinks took forever. We finally got our order in and then the next wait. The meals came out a lot longer than we expected for what appears to be more of a fast food type restaurant. When the food arrived, one order was missing the cheese and the BBQ sauce that was suppose to be on the burger. Sent it back and 5 min later got the order right. Probalby not going back, for the $$ not worth it to us. Others may feel different, but better options in the area."}
{"text":"Hey - if you are looking for a good burger and fries, great, friendly service and a manager (or owner?) who appears to be involved and care in a cute, very clean atmosphere, this is a great stop.  We have gotten take out and ate in yesterday and will be back. It is just one step above fast food but they do take call in orders and wait on you and the food is good and cooked to order."}
{"text":"I came here on a trip to Charlotte. I ordered a hot dog as well as the shake of the month, which was pumpkin pie. The hot dog was ok, it was not overly cheap tasting like many other places are. It was definitely tasty enough to choose not have a few toppings on it. Very nice. The shake on the other hand, was amazing. Probably the best pumpkin shake I ever had. 

In addition to the good food. The service was also fantastic. The woman who rang me up took her time to make suggestions of the best items to get, and she was right on each count. In addition to that, she also had a lot to say about the great spots in the area. 

Great place, well priced food, and delicious shakes. I would definitely hit up this place for lunch if you are near one."}
{"text":"Please avoid this location at all cost! It is filthy, they have terrible customer service and the teen \"cooks\" literally eat while cooking. We waited 45 minutes for chicken tenders and a burger all while watching both of these kid cooks eat the fries off my child's tray. Disgusting"}
{"text":"No one greeted us at the entrance. Had to ask for a seat. Food came out one...by....one and slow. First person could have been done eating by the time the next persons came out. Tator tots tastes like old grease. Fries were blah. Burger was average. Steak sub was a steak um from food lion and small for $11! The ranch was kraft and sitting on the shelf. The waitress did not refill drinks. A disabled man finally went to the counter for a refill, and when Noone acknowledged him, he finally got his own drink. She also forgot the order mostly and was at the register COMBING HER WEAVE! Comb was in her apron. Flies in restaurant and in your face. Straws also turned our water pink.....probably shouldn't have done that. Hwy 55 to diarrhea hell."}
{"text":"I got a bacon cheeseburger and fries to go. I thought the fries were well seasoned and tasty. I liked the burger too. There was a good amount of bacon on there, which made it even better. 
I thought the restaurant itself was very cute. I will go back again with family."}
{"text":"The burger was really good! They made it a little sloppy I posted pictures above. Service was fast. It definitely gets you full and fat"}
{"text":"Went today (Sat 8/10).  Service was slow.  We had to ask twice for drink refills.  Had the small burger - meat had no taste (wife felt the same).  Also, the oldies music was way too loud.  Won't go back - mostly based on the service,"}
{"text":"Employee asleep in a booth near the restrooms....30m wait for burgers....charged incorrectly, supervisor stayed on personal call while refunding
Burger & tater tots were great....kudos to the line cook, he was the only one working"}
{"text":"Soooo, though this is not the reason why I YELP, it was a nice surprise that I got a message from the owner of HWY55 to offer me a second visit with my family to try them again and re-review. He let me know that they had more systems in place and got their general act together. We were glad for the opportunity cause I, believe it or not, don't like writing bad reviews! 

We got to the restaurant at dinner time (5ish). I approached the fellow who seemed to be in charge and indeed I was correct. It is a weird moment when you have to approach restaurant manager and introduce yourself as the guy who gave them a crappy write-up and are there for your free meal. He was endlessly cordial and friendly about it, making sure to mention that without folks talking straight in reviews, that they couldn't improve. I admired that attitude so things started out pretty well. 

So the first thing I noticed was that, service-wise, they were understaffed for the time of day. The young lady that was waiting tables was very pleasant though and handled the stress with dignity and a smile.  At the end of our meal there were more servers, so there may have been late arrivals or cal-outs. It could have been a bad situation but it seemed to be handled well enough. On the funny side, I don't know if the manager told her why we were there, but while taking our order she seemed a little nervous, though pleasant, and forgot to take my order after the rest of my family. No issues and she giggled when I mentioned it.

The food was definitely better this time though, again, did not blow my mind. We tried to order as close to the last time as possible to the original visit to get a generally true comparison. My wife got the pimento cheese sandwich which, again, was tasty but lacking the generous-ness of cheese portion spoken of on the menu. Still really good pimento cheese for real! My pimiento cheese burger was of proper size and was tasty. I got the chili cheese fries which were okey doke but fairly pedestrian. I make some pretty good chili but absolutely appreciate other chili, this was just run of the mill. My daughters kid-burger was cooked properly and she got all over it. The most telling moment of the meal was that my son (food critic or epic pain in the butt, I'm not always sure which) said this time that he wouldn't mind heading back some day. After his first reaction this was a big plus for the restaurant.

So, overall, a much better visit. Why, then, V-Dub, did you only give one more star then before? Well, person asking the question, I take my 4 star reviews pretty seriously. If I drop a 4 star, then it's a destination eatery. If there were and opportunity to give a half star rating then I would go that direction. HWY 55 is a proximity restaurant. If we are in the area and need some burger and fry action, we will stop in and get some grub. It does not come up in the conversation when deciding where to drive to for dinner. This is in no way a bad review. The fact that we will go back speaks volumes for this particular joint. The owner owned the problems and invited us back. The manager was very accommodating and the server was peasant despite being in the weeds. Consider this a 3.5 star rating. Worth a shot especially now that they seem to have systems in place. 

Note to owner: Need sugar caddies for those who drink unsweetened tea. They are pretty cheap and a nicer touch than the first waitress who brought my wife sugar in a coffee cup and the most recent time packs of equal (or something similar) dropped on the table (though nicely dropped on the table :) )"}
{"text":"Hwy 55 gives me a Moe's vibe. As soon as you walk in, everybody choruses with a \"Welcome to Hwy 55!\" I thought it was pretty cute. They're probably tired of doing it, but it's pretty fun to me.

I've been twice with the husband and we've only ever sat at the counter because it's just easier. I do like watching them prepare the food, though! I wanted to kidnap the lady running the kitchen the last time we went through. She was keeping those food times low and keeping everything in line in there. I need that type of organization in my kitchen! Oh, wait. It's just me, though. Never mind. Talking to myself might make me seem crazy. 

Anyway, let me start backward here. The custard. It's insane. They have these things called concretes that are basically like Blizzards, but better. You can get anything from the custard area blended into it. They've got a decent list of candy options and they also make special custards of the day. Both times I've been, I was offered a sample and it was rocking. Give it a shot.

Now, the food. The first time we came, I went straight for a burger and I was glad I did. You can tell the burgers are fresh and well seasoned. I got a pretty bare bones cheeseburger, but it was still fantastic. Juicy with a nice crisp on the outside. I really loved the fries that I had the first time. I think they were more of the fresh-cut ones, but they've switched to the crinkle ones now. The crinkle ones are decent, but I *loved* the first ones. The second meal for me was the Philly sandwich. It was filling, full of flavor and I really enjoyed the bread. I think they may have steamed it, so it was nice and soft. I hate having to try and tear through a piece of hard roll on a Philly, so this made my day! They even give you a knife and fork in case you need it. 

Overall, this is one of my favorite new places in the area and I'm really glad I don't have to break out the grill at my house for just one burger. I can just come on down to the Hwy!"}
{"text":"One star for clean, but it's new, one star for good food and one star for reasonable pricing. That's about it. A couple servers are nice and hard working: but the majority seem to be too immature to take their job seriously. Even when it's not busy, they take forever to greet, sit and serve. They'll stand around talking to one another and give snooty smirks to all their waiting customers. They don't seem to have any patients for kids either. Train or replace the staff and maybe the review would get better."}
{"text":"The food was ok for franchise. But service was excellent. I saw the owner manager working hard to make this place happen. All the employees were working hard and doing what they're suppose to be doing.  Giving the customer a great experience."}
{"text":"For a quick work lunch, this place is cool. It's essentially what would happen if Johnny Rockets and Steak n' Shake got together one night for drinks and one thing led to another... Hwy 55 would appear! Anyways, the staff is young, but relatively attentive. The burgers are pretty darn good! Big fluffy buns and you get a good amount for your money. It's somewhere I'll keep going whenever I feel like eating at somewhere out of the ordinary, and that's a good thing."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a few times in the past and I've had positive experiences overall. I was pleased with my last visit except for my server. While she was attentive, coming to my table a few times to ask if I needed anything, she was very cold and was not pleasant. No smiles and barely any eye contact. It really felt like I was being rushed. I have to say that the service here is hit or miss. The food was good, but I was not pleased with my concrete. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be served in a different container, but I can say that I was sure that I wasn't happy to be receiving a regular drink cup that was only half full. Between the service and the ice cream, I'll think twice before I come back to this location."}
{"text":"Good place for a burger.  The burgers are good, not the best.  Staff is excellent, ice cream bar is fun and my small child loves the kids burger that is delivered in a convertible car."}
{"text":"Just found this review that I mean to post in July 2015....
Tried this for takeout the other day; very similar to a Johnny Rockets.  Seemed a bit unorganized as to where to go once inside.  Ordered the Pimento Cheese burger and a grilled cheese.  It took 21 minutes for them to make; which was extremely excessive.  I watched during my wait and it appeared that orders for those dining in were made before the takeout orders.  I also observed that there were no \"adults\" working; just high school kids.  Not sure if there was a manager there in the back; but there certainly needs to be or this new place isn't going to make it.  Overheard customers complaining while I was waiting; so it wasn't just me.
Grilled cheese was very good and cheesy, but needed a couple minutes more on the griddle; bread was soggy.  The Pimento cheese burger - I didn't even eat a quarter of.  The burger patty was broken and crumbly; bacon curled up in a clump; pimento cheese hadn't been thoroughly mixed and was clumped on one side of the burger.  
Very disappointing as this is a convenient spot to get takeout on the way home."}
{"text":"Expecting an average joint with average service based on other reviews. The staff was actually quite pleasant and accommodating, esp since they had to be here New Year's Day. The burger was right on time...and so convenient"}
{"text":"Food was terrible the first time we went but much better a few weeks later when we went. For a place that specializes in shakes, their chocolate shake is vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. Don't expect authentic chocolate ice cream if you order a chocolate shake - theirs tastes just like McDonalds.

The service was awful both visits. It's hard to get a hostess or server because they're all busy eating at the bar. They don't give out silverware and it's hard to get refills on drinks. We had to get our own high chair both times we went and they were sticky and crusted with crumbs. The staff literally watched us, as they sat at the bar, struggle with a baby in our hands to get the high chair and move it to a table. 

Food is good but service is bad. Atmosphere is good and nostalgic. If you love chocolate shakes, so sorry, but a trip to McDonald's would get you the same product at a third of the price.

Worth a shot - you could totally disagree with me :)"}
{"text":"Guilty Pleasure

The food here is not good for your body but oh so good for the soul. The burgers are so dang juicy - like Five Guys. 

Fries are pretty good although small portion (thank goodness). 

Onion rings are very good - not salty like a lot of places."}
{"text":"Price was good, but quality very low. Hamburger was literally destroyed in the bun. No flavor. The fries has no salt at all. Disappointed for sure. This was my 1st visit and I don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"Nice little retro place with authentic music playing - but not too loud.

I got the double burger; my wife the single. Both were solid and they managed to give plenty of fries. I was worried about that since the basket is rather small. But they didn't skimp. We both got ice cream and it was plenty good. 

The service was great, and then tailed off as we went along. A number of people came in after us - so maybe I can let that slide."}
{"text":"This place is such a hit or miss when it comes to device. Food is okay, onion rings are great!  We got delivery service again to try them out after years of not going. Service still needs improvement. They forgot our fries, soda, and custard."}
{"text":"I need to explain the 3 stars. Going to the Hwy 55 has been a mixed bag. I've had some excellent experiences, some mediocre ones and a couple terrible ones. In fairness, that averages out to 3 stars.

You might ask why I keep going back if I've had bad experiences (or you just might not care:)), but the reason is the food has been consistently good each time. Unlike my experiences at another local Fort Mill hamburger place, Hobo's where the food has been inconsistent and the service terrible on each visit, Hwy 55 cranks out a good product time and again. My personal favorite is the pimento bacon cheeseburger, but in reality, all the burgers have been great and part of that is the way they season them - there is a peppery tang to the meat.

The service has been mixed. Look - the place employs a lot of high schoolers, so you aren't going to get the white napkin treatment, nor should you expect it. And in my visits, the waitstaff really seems to be trying to do their best. It looks like the biggest pitfall is the lack of experience. Not knowing how to handle a situation or not knowing what to do when things go South. there isn't the experience to know how to smooth over a bad situation. Again, I understand it and that's why I also keep going back. 

The appearance of the restaurant is hit or miss. I've gone where everything is orderly and other times, it looks like a tornado came through with litter all over the floor and ketchup splatters streaking tables. Most the time I've gone, the place is really busy, so I understand sweeping isn't the first thing on their mind. 

Here's what I've noticed. When it has been a small table of 2, things have gone pretty flawless. When it has been a table of 4, little things have popped up - forgotten bacon on a burger or not remembering to bring out a side of fries until prompted. Where the wheels fall of is when any table larger than 4 sits down. Again, not a huge surprise given the lack of experience the servers have, but management needs to see that and compensate by employing food runners or the like. The worst experience I had was when I came in with my family of 4 and my parents, which made a table of 6. Three of us got our meals in a reasonable time and they were tasty. Then the waitress told us one of the burgers was dropped and they needed to re-fire it. Great, but then what happened to the other 2 missing meals? 20 minutes later the other three meals came out. The first three meals were already eaten and digested at that point. My wife rarely complains, but she went to the manager to tell him the situation and his response was, \"Yeah, we are busy. Sorry\". 

If anything keeps me from coming back, that will be it. I can overlook service errors from teenagers. I can overlook a messy floor. But I have a hard time overlooking indifferent management. If he really doesn't care about that, what else is he blase about?"}
{"text":"Nothing really spectacular about this place. The food is fairly bland. The bread lacks flavor, especially the hoagies. If you used something similar to a Philly or New Jersey style hoagie roll, it would definitely help the flavor of your cheese steaks. We've been to the new Stevens Mill location and they need help with consistency. It looks like high school kids are running the place. Also, cooking bacon in the fryer is not a good idea, especially when using the same fryer to cook french fries and chicken tenders."}
{"text":"I was glad to see one opening in Indian Land. I liked the one in Fort Mill but this location has been an issue for me. First they really messed up our order. The owners wife took care of it and even gave us coupons for free stuff. That was when they first opened so  I figured the employees were new and they are all young, so I thought it would get better. Last time I went here, my fries were soggy I threw them out. I will try again soon and update my review if needed."}
{"text":"Had lunch here again today.  Double cheeseburger and fries.  YUM.  Just a basic, old fashioned style burger.  Freshly cooked and tasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST service ever.  Our order came out 2 times WRONG. ITS HAMBURGERS AND FRIES PEOPLE.   Place was a mess, our server could care less about anything. I believe she may have been new but had no ambition to learn or do better."}
{"text":"I'll have to say they are getting better, no where near as fast as the Harrisburg location, but I think some of it may have to do with it being a new location. 

Someone else mentioned the tater tots tasting like fish. I experienced that too. Hopefully they have a friatator dedicated to that role.

I spoke with the owner via email. Nice people. Give em a chance!"}
{"text":"Went here once with a friend. I ordered the grilled chicken salad with an order of cheese fries. The chicken salad was pretty good. However, the cheese fries weren't all that special. Personally there was too much cheese on them, but if you like it that way then it's pretty good."}
{"text":"My family and I just moved to the area and found this place down the street so decided to stop in. The staff was friendly, the decor is adorable and definitely has the vibrant 50s theme going. 

The food was typical diner food and it was great. My husband has been hunting for a really good chili cheese dog for a very long time and he's finally found it here. The texture and flavor of the chili are spot on. His only wish is that they offered a shredded or sliced cheese vs the liquid (they actually might, he didn't ask). I got the steak and cheese which was good. Not the best I've ever had but I would order it again. We also split onion rings and chili cheese fries which were all great. I like chunky onion rings. The kids meals come in a little truck which I thought was adorable as well. 

Before we left I was sure to get an Oreo milkshake which was delicious. 

We will definitely come back again in the near future and give the burgers a try."}
{"text":"Our experience tonight was less than stellar . Daughters  hot dog looked and tasted horrible , totally over cooked . I ordered a Cobb salad with grilled chicken , received a basic boxed salad with a few pieces of grilled chicken on top ! Not worth the money we spent ! Husbands grilled cheese sat on the counter so long it was cold by the time it was brought to the table . We won't be returning !"}
{"text":"Wonk! Wonk! Wonkkkk! I really wanted a good burger while out and about on lunch today. To my surprise I found this cute little burger spot that had an old school bar and diner feel to it so from that alone I just knew my burger was going to be nice and juicy. Side eye (lol) well everything was ok I can say I enjoyed the sweet tea but that was about it the burger and fries were both blah to me not what a burger should be  in my opinion. The one thing that did it for me tho was when I entered the ladies restroom and it was not clean,sanitary looking at all which is one of my pet peeves about any restaraunt a clean bathroom, there was tissue every where,the floor appeared unclean as if it needed a good mopping and sweeping, this tops it i even seen the toilet brush u use to clean the toilet thrown onto the side of the toilet ,its pretty safe to say I probly won't ever visit this burger joint again."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat. My daughter had a cheese burger and I had a shrimp Po Boy. Food was excellent and service was great. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food. Waitress came back and checked on us plenty of times and kept our drinks full. There was not a long  wait for our food and is cooked fresh. I would recommend eating here, we will be returning."}
{"text":"This retro burger joint is cool! 

They have pink tables and pink counters and retro scenes on the walls around the restaurant. 

The burgers are fresh, juicy, and classic. Just the way I like them. 

One of the best parts about HWY55 has to be their shakes. I had the oreo cheesecake milkshake... INCREDIBLE! They use custard as the base so it's thick and rich. Yum! 

Also, they make one type of a shake per day, instead of having a menu of options, they make a specific kind of custard (outside of chocolate and vanilla), I like this because then I don't have to make a decision about what flavor to get. Not only that but when I come again chances are I'll get a different flavor. 

Great place. Good food. Great people too!"}
{"text":"The cheese fries are banging and for that alone they get 4 stars. I mean the fries were perfectly crispy and the ooey gooey cheese sauce was plenty. One order is enough for 2-3 people to share easily. Or you could make a meal out of it alone. All I would need is a side of pickled jalapenos and momma would be happy.

I had excellent service and they were beyond professional and polite. I was the only eat in guest so I am pretty sure that made it easy but they had a few call ins while I was there and they were just as pleasant to everyone else that came through that door. 

In addition to the fries, I had a steak and cheese. It was good and hot and the roll soft. You have to ask for mayo or whatever kind of condiment you want on it. Otherwise it will just come with the toppings listed in the menu. 

While I was sitting, the waitress brought me a sample of their ice cream. Oh my goodness. It was good. It was creamy and delicious. If I hadn't anticipated going to starbucks afterwards, I definitely would have ordered a milk shake.

I plan on coming back. Those fries are calling my name."}
{"text":"Average burgers at average prices, if you are nostalgic about the 50's, stop by. Onion Rings and the shakes were great!"}
{"text":"Not a good first impression.  Food was great, burger had nice flavor however customer service was horrible.  We waited 15 minutes before we were acknowledged by the waitress, and not before we had to get up and ask the wait staff behind the counter why other patrons were given menus and drinks before us.  I didn't notice any management visible or available."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, 2 stars for the price.  This location is near the Walmart on N. Tryon.  $5.99 for a hamburger -- not a combo, just the sandwich.  Add $2 for fries and a drink (Pepsi products).  It's waited, so add $1 - $2 per person for tip; plus tax, and it's pushing $10.  The food was fine, the staff were nice; the prices were a little steep for the ambiance, I think.  

I had an oreo shake, which was tasty.  They have \"concretes\" -- frozen custard."}
{"text":"Love The Burgers ......great value so far everything is been great highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"The sign says under new ownership. It's a definite improvement in service. The burgers are pretty good.  Service was good. Not bad for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great food great service.  Combine that with good music and you have great atmosphere to dine in. 
After a juicy cheeseburger make sure you get a shake.  They do it the old fashioned way."}
{"text":"Good burgers and shakes...need new fries though. There are too many competitors in the area with burgers and fries within the same price point that  they need to step up the fries to entice people to choose them."}
{"text":"I work close enough to the outlets that I enjoy going on my lunch every once in a while to unwind. Today, I was short on time and decided to just grab something from this location. 

FIRST...I tried calling in my order (an attempt to save time) and was told to hold on before the call was disconnected twice. 

SECOND... once I arrived at the register to place my order (opting not to complain because they were a little busy) I was greeted with \"I will get someone to help you\" and the young lady walked away to go chitchat with another waitress. Finally, I got the attention of another waitress that obviously saw the look on my face and asked if she could take my order. She was pleasant and quick. 

This location has a young staff but that does not excuse the lack of professionalism and sense of urgency during the lunchtime rush. I waited 20 minutes for two hot dogs. 

If the other fast food places didn't have such a long line, I would've just bypassed this place and kept it moving."}
{"text":"Came here on a lazy Friday night! I didn't know that this location existed but more than willing to try it as I've had Hwy 55 in the past. 

First, the ambiance and decor is your standard 1950s soda shop feel. The restaurant was empty but Andy was cleaning off tables in between taking to-go orders and training a new waitress on things to do to prepare for close. 

We decided to order the food to go but sat at the bar to wait for our food. We received a sample of Strawberry Cheesecake custard. I was tempted to order but decided to stick with just my high-calorie burger in the making. Overall the wait for our food was about 8-10 minutes. 

Our food was hot, fresh and fattening, so there aren't really any complaints. I would give them another shot, but maybe call in the order next time."}
{"text":"Do not recommend this restaurant ordered the chicken 
Philly cheese steak it was just gross dripping with grease. It was so greasy that you could hold it up vertical and the grease would just run out of it, then received a call from the owner and he was not helpful or apologetic,to us and I do not recommend this restaurant unless you want a grease bomb when you order."}
{"text":"Since this restaurant is under new management everything is better. The food is fresher, made to order, the whole place is much cleaner.  The staff are friendly and accommodating.  This is just a good old school diner style burger joint."}
