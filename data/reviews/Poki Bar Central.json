{"text":"This Poke bar is nothing special compared to others that are in the area. First off, the tuna looked to be a weird color and tasted even worse. All the fish lacked freshness altogether. The sauces they give you as an option all lacked flavor. They were also out of white rice when I arrived and said they had no more. They were also out of mangos as a side topping. How do you expect to run a poke place if you run out of things?? Lastly, the wasabi was runny and did not look as it should which was concerning. I will not be returning as there are WAY better poke options in the area."}
{"text":"I thought it was decent my partner wasn't exactly pleased. I thinks it's worth another try. We came at closing and there was no avocado  well see how or opinion changes with the next visit."}
{"text":"Taste is alright, coming from LA this spot is def not on par with what we got out there.   First thing that I thought was how come the fishes aren't put into a separate bowl and mixed with the sauces and certain toppings. Instead it was just thrown on top of the rice along with everything else.   Overall is just okay moving great would not come again.   On top of that is $11 I think is def overpriced for two scoops of protein.   The fish is def not fresh   Does not have a good vibe, no music, and needs friendlier customer service....the guy seemed like he hated his life."}
{"text":"Generous sized bowl but topping portions were very small, comically so. I know Ahi Poke Bowl on Thomas and Scottsdale isn't exactly down the street but they don't give you teaspoon sized toppings and it's less expensive.  I had to ask for 3 scoops of seaweed salad and still didn't get much more than a normal spoonful.  The \"scoop\" of masago was laughable in size, and I'm not a big portion person or a glutton, they should just be aware of how silly the presentation is to put these tiny scoops on a big bed or rice.   The amount of rice will fill you up but don't expect a ton else on it. Fish quality was okay, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I met the owners and they are really cool people. However, the poke was just okay. I tried it out before their official launch so I will give it another try some time this month."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh poke & quick service this is your place! The bowl size is generous,  but could improve on portion size in item, for the price though you can't beat it! Delicious & healthy!"}
{"text":"FOOD SAFETY issues. The employees do not wear gloves, they do not wear their hair back. They look dirty. Fish is questionable.   I asked the woman if I could have the newer and more fresh spicy tuna wrapped in cellophane and she laughed and said I don't know that it's fresh but you can have it.... all while she has NO gloves on. And is touching the money and everything.   Sorry we will not be back.   You guys aren't even open late enough, ocean poke co just opened so we will be there if we need poke..    I also read someone found a mood ring in their spicy tuna.. seriously...   You guys should be glad that wasn't me because I would have sued you.  Goodluck..."}
{"text":"I tried this place this past Saturday with my teenage daughter and we both loved it. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The staff was super friendly and made very helpful suggestions to my daughter, who has never experienced poki before.  We will definitely be back and hopefully I will be able to get saki with my poki in the near future."}
{"text":"Super clean and extremely good. Not a raw fish person, but this place changed my mind on it."}
{"text":"This place is terrific, reasonably priced, great portioned and really hit the spot. Poke Bowl is a fast food-ish type of healthy restaurant where you pick your base (salads, rice or both) and then choose proteins, dressing, then toppings. I got half green salad and half white rice topped with spicy tuna and salmon. The citrus dressing that I chose was refreshing and \"the works\" toppings were very satisfying. The staff was friendly and helpful. I plan on habitually patronizing this spot!"}
{"text":"Best poke bowl ever. Nice portions same priced very modern and simple in a good way.nice neighborhood and good food"}
{"text":"Went here on Tuesday and what can I say, the food was great and so was the service! Food was fresh! My favorite on the first visit is freshwater eel and yellowtail! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Fish was very fishy. Atmosphere was terrible. I had to take my food to go because I felt weird eating alone in a dark room all by myself with no music. They don't carry gluten free soy sauce per the staff not being sure... just nothing good about this place. Fish tastes old. Took two bites and was scared of getting sick. Two stars is only because my friends quote it to be the best poke place. Clearly they haven't tried their other poke options within 5 miles. Ocean poke and ahi poke are clearly a much better choice. Sorry but it's true.....not a negative yelper often.. I thought I could eat the rice and avocado and crab mix but it all tasted like the cheapest ingredients in town."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything fresh made to order. Tuna, Yellow tail, Salmon, Octopus, etc. Every ingredient mixed to your liking. Great sauces. Will be back here again and again."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of their competitor but this one is so close to my house, I had to give it a try!  I am so glad I did, it was in my opinion better! The portions were huge and it was less expensive.  I really enjoyed my bowl! The spicy tuna and scallops were fresh and so flavorful!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Very fresh.   However, the eel isn't worth it. For $2, they only give you one slice."}
{"text":"The girl working picked up lettuce with her bare hands and put it back into the bowl instead of tossing. The other employee had gloves on for everything. Their sauce is super sweet compared to the other poke places in Phoenix and their portions were very small."}
{"text":"It's a small place, but there's enough space if you're a bigger fella like myself. It's got what you'd be looking for from a poke spot, if you know what to look for. The fish was super fresh which makes me wonder where they're getting their fish from?? I went to some Hawaiian spot that had poke and the tuna was tougher than a witch's titty while she doing push ups in a brass bra on during a snow storm! Anyways, this spot was good and I'd fux wit it again."}
{"text":"Loved this place until the my third visit last month when I found a ring....a woman's mood ring in the spicy tuna ended up in my mouth. I was so grossed out I cannot return here. I noticed the staff at the restaurant wear plastic gloves when serving customers, so I'm not sure if this debacle occurred in the back room, or at the supplier who prepares the poke off-site. Nevertheless, it is a huge health hazard, as rings carry a tremendous amount of germs and constitute a choking hazard. Luckily I didn't choke, didn't become ill, and didn't chip a tooth."}
{"text":"Okay, to be honest, I'm not completely sure what I was expecting. I wanted to get dinner on my way home and try something new. Poki Bar Central had hit all of that criteria? I had in my head. I've been hearing a lot about poki places lately and decided to give it a shot.  The directions were pretty clear on how to setup your bowl. I ended up getting greens as my base since I am eating low carb. Something I did not realize until afterward? is that if I have greens as my base I'm basically eating a raw fish salad. Next time I will totally try rice instead.  They had a special of the day which was a mix of all different types of seafood mixed in a sauce and I had that on top along with a portion of salmon. That house special mix was so delicious! I wish I had gotten both portions of protein as the special.  The girl helping me was very nice. She helped me decide what toppings would go together since I'm pretty new at this. I had a good experience, the food was good, and the service was fast. Granted I don't have any poki experience to compare to."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly, atmosphere, super fresh food !!! I would recommend this place and come back again!"}
{"text":"I might wait to revisit here...maybe they need some practice. I understand it's a new business with new workers but the pace of service was extremely slow. It took ten minutes just to get down the line. I listed off what I wanted \"white rice, salad, fish, edamame..etc\". But every time we got to a new section he would pause over each and every item and ask \"did you want this......pause....did you want this?\". Also I got 7 pieces of fish and a very small scoop of spicy tuna. Maybe I'm spoiled from Ahi-poki where the portion sizes are huge; not to mention the service is so fast you're practically running after your food. It looked like there were enough workers there to do a more efficient service where one person does the rice/salad and fish, one person does the toppings, and a cashier. But instead, one person took on 3 orders from start to finish. As for the food? My white rice was in clumps, like the way it is after sitting out for a long time and I could hardly taste any rice vinegar. My brother got the brown rice though and said it tasted fine. Did I mention they skimped on the fish? But boy did the pile on the toppings and sauce (my food was drowning in spicy mayo) to try and make up for it. Side note: if you get wasabi you might want to ask for it on the side...my husband got a huge dollop and then couldn't tell the difference between his avocado and wasabi and had a very risk-filled meal. I'm keeping my rating at 3 stars because I'll probably give them another try and my brother enjoyed his meal. Maybe I went on a bad day."}
{"text":"The people working here are amazing, so kind. And the food is delicious! It's my favorite thing to get for an easy dinner. The seafood is very fresh and all of the toppings really make it delicious. Do yourself a favor and try the spot."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that you are eating raw fish in the desert. Justy sayin.' I have been here twice for take-out and the food was really good, the service was wonderful, and the portions were generous. I had the salmon and albacore both times and really liked their octopus salad and seaweed salad. I will keep going here."}
{"text":"I thought it was super bland and tasteless. The fish wasn't fishy but was just blah and a very small portion. I won't go back :("}
{"text":"Audaciously expensive for the portions they serve. The poke tastes very inauthentic. Still waiting for a legit Hawaiian-style poke shop in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've came here a couple of times, great food. I love the service, they are always generous with portions and always make sure to ask if everything is ok and help out while we're dining in. Highly suggest to everyone!"}
{"text":"I've never tried open-faced sushi before!  I picked everything I wanted to eat so of course I enjoyed the hell out of it.   REALLY enjoyed the Aged Vanilla Cream Soda.  Gonna bring my vegan lady here."}
{"text":"Fish is not fresh, need more of a mixed green without iceberg for salad. They should also mix the sauce in the poke. Also overpriced for the product. Drive the extra 7 minutes to Ahipoki Bowl. Avs on top of the bad food the service was horrendous."}
{"text":"At last, a Hawaiian poki place in the central Phoenix area - so much closer to my place than the other poki place I used to go to! I went today after seeing their facebook page and tried a salmon, tuna, and half/half (I chose half brown rice, half green salad) bowl with the house dressing, and I asked for added salmon roe. For toppings, I chose picked ginger, dried seaweed, green onion, and daikon sprouts. They also gave me a small container of the sweet citrus dressing to sample. Everything was super fresh and the dressings were really tasty. I washed it all down with Stubborn Soda (I chose orange hibiscus). What a delicious, refreshing meal. Since this place is next to the Sprouts Market where I do a lot of my grocery shopping, it's pretty certain that I'll be dining here frequently as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a mid evening with family, the place was dead at 7:30pm. Their portion were extremely small, much smaller than ahipoki; it seems like they only have one size and one size only. The salad didn't look that too appetizing so I got rice and get my normal toppings, halfway through and it was full already so the guy had to kind of mash it down. The sauce was the best part out of the whole meal. I hope this place gets better over time."}
{"text":"Overall:  · Bowls were good will def be coming back.   Pros:  · Sauces were delicious  · Fish was better than expected - but not phenomenal (the scallop looked meh so I avoided)  · Prices are reasonable for a good healthy meal   Cons:  · Cashier did not wash hands after coming out of the back area before putting on gloves (was also chewing gum- huge pet peeve)  · Sauce was put directly on bowl - since it was taken to go I would have liked the option in a little to go cup · Trash was overflowing · Some of the fish portion seemed a little small   I know this has just opened, I'm confident these finer details will get worked out."}
{"text":"I come here for work lunches and have always enjoyed the flavor of their house sauce and their spicy mayo mixed. I get a full kale salad. Here are the pros and cons.   Pros:  1. The sauce is good so the flavor is good. I really enjoy the flavor the sauce adds to a kale salad base and the fish toppings. .  2. The space is very clean, modern, well air conditioned, and it is reasonably priced for Poke.   Cons:  1. One of the servers is Friendly, and lovely, the other one emotes nothing, gives smaller portions, and seems generally unhappy and unfriendly. You'll know immediately which one you have.  2. They use non recyclable non compostable serving bowls and utensils. I would appreciate some sustainability.  3. The fish portions are smaller here than at other poke places. An extra scoop of fish and crab would go a long way."}
{"text":"Been craving an ahi poki bowl but didn't feel like driving out to Scottsdale or Chandler for it. So I tried out this place Poki Bar Central that a friend told me about which is a little closer. I'm a big fan of their rival Ahi Poki Bowl but I will say Poki Bar Central is pretty good but Ahi Poki Bowl has the better sauces by far. But Poki Bar Central is good spot for some ahi poki too. I got the spicy tuna and salmon and added avocado and octopus salad. Delicious!   I will say the customer service of the staff could use some work. Not very friendly at all. They seemed annoyed to have to serve me. I had to knock down a star rating for that. No offering of help, hello or thank you for coming. Kinda rude if you ask me."}
{"text":"Wow, I love sushi and this place filled my belly. To boot, I'm 250 lbs.  Pretty much for 10 dollars and change you get the contents of 3 to 4 rolls at a regular sushi joint. I recommend 50/50 of kale and brown rice, spicy tuna, albacore, with everything, and half spicy mayo and miso sauce.  The next time I want to get a sushi/poke bowl fix I'll come here."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. Great customer service. LOVE the miso dressing. And next to Sprouts. I will definitely be back here. A lot."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and excellent service. Excited for them to expand. Possibly my new favorite \"guilty pleasure\"."}
{"text":"Reminds me of that other place in Scottsdale. It's o.k. It's like sushi except inside a bowl. I am not a big fan of it but my family members are huge fans."}
{"text":"Had a delightful experience at Poki Bar Central. Staff is super friendly and informative about all of the ingredients. Dining area was clean and organized. Most importantly, the food was fresh and fabulous! Portions are generous."}
{"text":"Loved my poke bowl here. Salmon and scallops were so fresh, got everything on my half white rice and half greens bowl with spicy mayo. Bowl was very filling and worth it"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for lunch as I work close by. I had rice, salmon and spicy tuna and a few sides/extras added. I found the portion of the protein was good but the size of the extra items/sides were VERY skimpy (cucumber, green onion - there were hardly any on there, dikon sprouts...very small amount, edamame..this was the only thing there was a lot of)! It was mostly rice and protein. The sauces were tasty. Very clean restaurant but think they need to improve on the amount of sides they put on. I really wanted to give it a 2.5 star rating because of the skimpy portion sizes for the price."}
{"text":"I noticed this place while walking into sprouts to pick up lunch and I decided to give it a shot.  The woman who helped me was very friendly and willing to help with recommendations.  I got a bowl of 1/2 tuna and 1/2 spicy tuna,  I'm not a connoisseur by any means but I did enjoy the food.  All in all, I wasn't disappointed with my choice."}
{"text":"Hard to review when sign says they should be open, but door is locked and ghost town inside."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, IMO. I've had better, but this is still a decent spot. I've been a couple times now and it's never crowded. Fair price point at $10 and some change after tax."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for fresh poki bowl.  Great friendly staff and high quality selection of poki. Will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"I was planning on having lunch at another place very close to here but they were closed so I saw this place and decided to give it a try. I was very pleased that I did as Poke bowls are one of my new favorite things. I thought this place was very reasonable. $10 for 2 different proteins and unlimited toppings. I had the tuna and salmon with a base of brown rice. Everything was very fresh and the staff were friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed my bowl and the only reason I knocked them down one was for the fact that they only offered 3 different sauces and they didn't offer wonton strips as a topping which I love for the crunch!"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. Stupidly small portions.. stay away. Do yourself a favor and drive to Chandler and get real poke."}
{"text":"Poki Bar is a-ok!   Nothing great here, definitely better poki places in town. I didn't dislike anything about my dish (spicy tuna and salmon with the sweet citrus sauce) but won't be craving to go back. All of the ingredients look unappetizing and tasted fairly bland.   We did really enjoy our bottled sodas though! Recommend the Orange Hibiscus & Agave Vanilla Cream Soda."}
{"text":"Seemingly, the new foodie thing this year has been poke. This small location just opened up in the Sprouts parking lot.   Clean location, although it is def more of a quick sit down or to go restaurant with their limited seating. Very clean aesthetic inside.   As for the most important part, the food. If you've never had poke, they have a chipotle style ordering. Start with your bowl of rice or greens, then protein, sauce, and finally toppings.   Salmon was a bit icy, but I'll let that slide due to them just opening up this week.   I'll def give this place another shot!"}
{"text":"I was nervous to try this place based on previous reviews, but I thought it was quite delicious and filling! I thought the fish portions could have been larger, but I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Sadly, we were disappointed. As a frequent visitor as the Scottsdale Poke restaurant, we were excited to find something closer. We won't be coming back.   The lettuce was the iceberg/cabbage/carrot mix from the grocery. The iceberg was brown and had to be picked out. There really was nothing flavorful outside of the crab mix and avocado.   With Poke restaurants popping up everywhere, this one has a lot of things to do to match its competitors."}
{"text":"Love poke, always eat poke. This place really gives VERY VERY SMALL PORTIONS. I really thought they were joking when they put 3 cubes of poke on my salad... I thought it was a joke at first. Then they put a tea spoon of sea weed salad. However they did put an insane amount of rice...   The employees were really nice. But the portion is insanely tiny. It should be more like the rice bar, with options of poke toppings (3 cubes).   Food quality was good, just portion was just small, and I mean TINY!   For 10$, I hoped to get a little more than 3 cubes of tuna."}
{"text":"I saw the write up in AZ Central and just had to try.  I think another Yelper said it best, this is similar to a deconstructed Sushi Roll.  Plenty of selections, I chose the 1/2 & 1/2 Mixed Greens and Rice.  My protein selections were Salmon & Spicy Tuna.  I added Masago, Sprouts, Cucumbers, Ginger, Seaweed Salad, Octopus Salad, Toasted Seaweed, Sesame Seeds, Wasabi & Pickled Ginger and topped it all off with their Miso Sauce.  For me the portions were just right, but I know of others that would have preferred more.  Therefore, I would say the price would be considered on the high side (based on posts that I have seen).  Since this is the first all Poki place I've ever been too, I can't complain.  The seafood is as \"Fresh\" as it can be, since we are in AZ.  The place was very modern in it's dining facility and clean.  The 2 guys providing customer service, taking orders and building the bowls were very nice and attentive.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Close to my house, but actually it is worth the drive to go elsewhere for poke. Decided to try this place out, asked for salad base and the employee looked at me like I have three eyes. The other employee came out of the back and assisted the other customer, and both kind of looked out of it. Weird vibe in there, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My brother told me this place was opening up so we decided to go yesterday. Being a relatively new fan of poke with the opening of Ahipoki Bowl this year, I was looking forward to trying a new place, thought I didn't see any marketing or advertising for here.  We came around noon and they had some balloons indicating that they were open. We came in and the menu is similar to that of AB: start off with a base of white rice, brown rice, greens, kale, or half and half. Then you choose 2 proteins, sauce and your toppings (extra protein and certain toppings are extra). I got the half and half with white rice and greens and my only suggestion is that they include some spinach and romaine in their greens, rather than just using the iceberg lettuce mix.  For my proteins, I got salmon and spicy tuna and spicy mayo, along with edamame, ginger, crab salad, sprouts, cucumber, green onions, sesame seeds and chili flakes. They have Sriracha and soy sauce to add too.  Overall it was a filling meal and the employees were friendly. I would also suggest they do more social media and marketing to get the word out about this new business because I wouldn't have known about it unless my brother saw it as he visits this shopping complex."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today as it's near the office and I was craving poke. Ordered a tuna and spicy tuna poke bowl with brown rice and all the fixings. It wasn't the best poke bowl I've ever had, but it wasn't bad either and wins for proximity. I love that they have the aloha juices! I will probably be back soon."}
{"text":"I eat there ones a week for sure I work next to them at VIP BARBERSHOP They ARE amazing friendly and the food is allways fresh"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in today after originally planning to get deli sandwiches from Sprouts. I'm a huge poki fan and I'm so glad to see that many poki restaurants are opening in the area. The set up here is very simple and easy; it reminds me of Chipotle. You get in line, pick your base, pick 2 proteins, pick your sauce, then pick your toppings. I got white rice, tuna and spicy tuna, spicy mayo, and for my toppings avocado, masago, wasabi, roasted seaweed, edemame, and green onions. So delicious! I was slightly disappointed to find out that they are no longer carrying yellowtail due to low demand, although I can respect the fact that they did this instead of serving less than fresh fish to those who would rarely ask for it. If your in the area check it out!"}
{"text":"The bowls that you get here are made with heaping servings of whatever you'd like. I got a bowl with fresh salmon, seaweed salad, fresh cooked rice, cucumber, daikon sprouts. Every time I go to sprouts to do my goddamned organic grocery shopping I make sure to stop by the Poki Bar Central."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and it was empty when I went, so that worried me because I didn't know how long the fish was sitting out.   I got a half salad half white rice bowl. The salad looked like it came out of those bagged salads at the grocery store, which kind of put me off. I got tuna and salmon, topped with a bunch of stuff and the house dressing. The portions are really small for $12.00. But I was pretty excited to get my hands on it when I got home.   It was OKAY. It wasn't my favorite. It was missing the freshness and quality. It was not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way there to go back there. There wasn't enough dressing either and they give you more rice than anything else."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. The quality and freshness of the fish was acceptable but the side options lacked flavor. The tuna had a metallic taste which put me off. There are plenty of much better options out there that exceed this place in every measurable category"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but meh.  It's small, the music was so loud that the employees couldn't hear what we were ordering and the labels on the different foods were confusing, so I wasn't sure what I was actually getting.   Then the poke - I wouldn't really call it poke, it's more like cubes of fish that you can add to your meal (which is served in a take out container). Having had poke in Hawaii, I was expecting that - but it's not like that at all.   Flavor wise, it was pretty good, but again, nothing close to poke. Atmosphere wise, the place is missing something that makes it feel welcoming."}
{"text":"I like this place. Kinda like chipotle for a poke bowl. I've been trying to find something close to a gorilla bowl that I ate in Kauai and I can get fairly close to it here. I like the tuna. Got the freshwater eel last time for an extra $2 and it definitely was not worth it. It was quite rubbery. As other reviewers have stated, it can get a bit pricy with the add ons but I absolutely cannot pass on the avocado add. I docked 2 stars because I tried to get an extra scoop of seaweed and they wanted to charge me extra for it. I think this is BS because it was only 1 of the 2 toppings that I got that I didn't pay extra for (and there was about 7 other options that I just didnt want)! Come on peeps!!! If someone doesn't want all the extra free toppings, hook a sister up with a little extra seaweed!!!  There are better places in town to go now! Thank goodness!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Small, but clean and bright dining area. I had white/brown rice with ahi tuna and octopus, house and citrus sauces, and all the toppings. Sooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's like sushi bowl (with rice or salad). A little pricey, but a must try."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and both times have been good! I got the octopus and citrus tuna. I'm not a big sauce person so just put a little bit of their house sauce with wasabi. I thought the portions for the cost both times were generous. 1 star off for the staff and quality. They aren't the most friendly, but I also don't really care if they get my food to me efficiently! It's also super close to my house."}
{"text":"My 1st visit & thought it was good, reasonable & will return. They prob need to work on flow in case the get real busy but overall a pleasant experience."}
