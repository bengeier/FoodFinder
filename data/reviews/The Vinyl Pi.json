{"text":"Have been here many times before and always a big fan.  Tonight brought friends and was disappointed in the service and changes to the food.  Probably won't go back.  Sorry to see a favorite place go down hill."}
{"text":"Try the fried Boomers!!!! Great food awesome service can't ask for a better place!!! The bartends know what they are doing Paul can create the best French Martini in all of Lake Norman and Michelle is a gem with well drinks! Come here you won't be disappointed and you get your money's worth!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place... A little different. Way nicer on the inside than the outside. Haven't tried the food yet but will be back to do that for sure. Menu looks good."}
{"text":"We loved it.  Their crust, sauce, cheese, toppings and herbs make for a really flavorful pie."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this past  Saturday. Service was very slow despite the fact there was only one other table besides us. Tea and water came with no ice. Pizza roll appetizer was hard. Spaghetti was salty and the sauce not very good. Got a to go order and when we got home and opened it there was maybe enough for a small child. Will not be going back there."}
{"text":"It used to be good. The food has definitely gone down hill, and the service was terrible the last two times we were there. It's just not worth the money, which is too bad because it had such potential."}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to having a good pizza place nearby, however, the Vinyl Pi is definitely not it. The atmosphere is good and our server, Dalton, was fabulous. Beer selection is good, as well. But, ultimately it comes down to the food, and our pizza was a huge disappointment. We ordered a plain cheese pizza which should be the easiest thing to make. There was virtually no sauce on the pizza. The small areas that we found that did have sauce had no flavor. Basically we ate some crust covered in cheese. Dry and plain. Other reviewers seem to love the food here, so maybe our order was a fluke. We won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Succulent Prince Edward Island Mussels. The garlic, crushed red pepper and white wine make this a tastebuds enticing experience. Service outstanding, music delightful and cozy ambiance. Keep it up guys. Coming back for more."}
{"text":"In town visiting friends...swung by for a quick lunch with the kids. Service and food were awesome! We all had pizza, so can't say much about the whole menu. But, the toppings and crust were very good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Whew.......let's start with the positives. The wait staff was 5 star. Great service! Our beers were cold. The food.....thats where the 2 stars come into play. The food on our entire table was not good. We could almost use the word awful. The worst was the Apple Cole Slaw, picture included."}
{"text":"Went for dinner one Friday night, did not get there until 7:30 but we were able to get a table pretty fast, ordered wings as an app, they took a lot longer than expected. Our server was great, pizza was good, although the kitchen staff messed a few things up, but needless to say the manager made things right, we got the check and that was also wrong, advertised prices did not correlate with what the bill showed... But in all, a good meal! We will give it a second chance with hopefully less problems!"}
{"text":"This place was really neat, my husband called the decor perfect for an aging hipster like himself (lol). Food and service was great, too!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here since they opened. Last night we were there and it is not as good and the BEST stuff they offered, such as the bruchetta is gone.   The menu is gone and some cheap plastic covered two- sided menu.   One appetizer they changed recipe and there was a tremendous amount of salt and for me a heavy salt user is saying slot.   The pizza roll appetizer you get 4 rock like rolls with a new horrible sauce. And it is $10 bucks.   $9.50 for a call brand horrible margarita   The Morrison pizza was good but I am sure they changed something on that also.   Very disappointed and not sure if we will return again or not.   My guess is a change in ownership or Management and I think for the worse.   ***Oh one last thing we sat on the patio. Disgusting dirty. Floors were black and looked like last time it was even blown clean was months ago. I guess they never heard of a blower and pressure washer.  Dirt and dust everywhere and light bulbs out.   Sad."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Bartender was very friendly and made me feel right at home. I got the sunday special mimosa (only 5$) and the Moe pizza with a side of ranch. So so so good. And the Sunday entertainment was a piano player and a fiddle player! Such a great first time."}
{"text":"Good music  Place was clean.   Chicken wings are very good.   Good selection other than pizza and wings.  Has a bar and dinning room so you can choose different atmospheres.  Looks like build your own pizza could get a little expensive.  Would go back!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for trivia and dinner. Trivia was okay, only 18 questions total and only 4 teams playing. Wings were good, good amount of meat on them. Pizza was okay. Good crust and toppings were fresh. I think I thought artichoke on pizza sounded better than it actually was. Beer was very cold and served in a frosty mug. Service was eh. Our waitress only had us as a table and kept forgetting about our wings, the second beer I ordered, etc. It was also pretty pricey."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered takeout recently. We ordered a Hotlanta Burger, Blackened Chicken Sandwich, and a large cheese pizza. The burger was really disappointing. It didn't have the cheese I ordered on it and it was very soggy because the tomatoes were already on the burger. Just a soggy and pretty tasteless burger. The chicken sandwich was pretty bland. We both LOVED the fries that came as our sides! They were perfectly crispy on the outside. The pizza was also pretty good. Although we were underwhelmed with our first experience with Vinyl Pi, we're definitely going to give them another try. We love that their burgers are grass-fed and that they're local."}
{"text":"Love this great, neighborhood pizza joint. Local music on the weekends, friendly staff, rotating draft beer menu, and some really good homemade wing sauces.   We just went last night with our son who was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease.  For those in the know, it can often times be difficult to find menu items when dining out suitable for him to eat, especially at a pizza parlor. Not only were we able to get a gluten free pizza (with pepperoni) but our waitress went the extra mile to make sure the kitchen took care of our needs properly.  Our waitress, Liz, was absolutely awesome!"}
{"text":"They didn't have half the toppings we wanted, might as well have gone to papa johns for a basic cheaper pizza!"}
{"text":"I love this place, if Im lucky enough not to get stuck waiting. Calling in to go seems to be the easiest way to eat here"}
{"text":"We used to go here often and recommend it, but after several off meals I think we are done. I heard they had a new menu and husband wanted wings, seemed like we should give it another shot. We arrived at 7:45 in a Friday and told a 30 minute wait. The bar was crowded and we enjoyed the good craft beer list. We watched  several parties come in and leave after being told the wait continued to be 30 minutes, by now it's after 8:00? After more than 30 min we asked how long and were told we could be seated right then. Did they forget us? The dining room we were seated in was empty, only 2 other tables were occupied? Why the wait and turning people away? The server was prompt and great. We ordered more beer, the sprouts and our entrees. The beer and sprouts were served quickly and we enjoyed them. Sadly, that was all we enjoyed. After a 20 minute wait after the apps were served our food came. The wings were cooked, but barely. The skin was so rubbery it had to be removed to get to the Chicken.  What little sauce there was was in the skin and  chicken had no flavor. They were unappetizing and we did not finish them. I ordered the carbonara. I love this dish when made right and I read the description several times to make sure the  description promised carbonara and not Alfredo sauce. He description did promise carbonara but that is not what I received. The delivery server asked who had the Garden party, which was the first inkling it was wrong. I said Carbonara and he quickly said yes, that's it. Wrong, it was a mix of the two. Orochetti pasta, with a cream sauce, with the peas and bacon of the carbonara. Either way it was terrible. No flavor at all, cool temp, and tiny portion. Not just small, kids size. The waiter asked how the food was, normally we let it go but this time we did not. He handled things well, as did the manager, but the outcome is the same. Vinyl Pi we won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots. The food has always been excellent. The calamari is awesome. Great appetizers, sandwiches, pizza, and yummy desserts. They also have an outstanding craft draft beer selection."}
{"text":"We ate here this past weekend. We were a little tired of the usual suspects in Birkdale so we fround the Vinyl Pi on yelp and thought we would give them a try. We were presently surprised. My wife is vegetarian and waiter made some excellent suggestions for some substitutions on a couple of items. She ended up getting the Marley pizza with pesto instead of the red sauce which was excellent. I had the Vedder which was very good if you like non traditional pizzas. We really loved the pizza dough. The waiter was very knowledgable and provided excellent service. We can't wait until we can take some friends up for another visit and maybe catch some live music. I've got a few more menu items I'd like to try!"}
{"text":"Ordered old bay wings, calamari and fried Brussel sprouts.  All was very salty and almost uneatable and I like my food salty! Very disappointed. I was hoping for some good wings!"}
{"text":"All the pizzas are really tasty here, you can tell they use fresh handmade pizza dough. The calamari with the fried lemon slices is to die for! The restaurant is somewhat small and booths are private so the atmosphere is laid back and intimate unlike a bigger restaurant. The patio is nice too."}
{"text":"They do tend to get busy so wait times can vary, but the food is worth the wait. Great wings, meaty and crispy, with the bonus that you can order all flats or drums (I'm a flats guy). Could stand to be saucier, but flavor and preparation are definitely on point. Bleu cheese on the side was top rate.  Also had their pretzels, which are of the chewier (and technically correctly done) variety. Great side dipping sauces, including house made beer cheese and a teriyaki style mustard. The boomers (fried mushrooms) were good but not great. Big shrooms, but that makes for a bit of a sloppier fry with the extra moisture. Missed out on the horseradish ranch, but it sounded very good.  Overall if you're looking for a laid back place and the food is why you came, you can do much worse than Vinyl Pi."}
{"text":"I wish we'd had pizza like this when I lived here 30 years ago. Excellent cocktails (I recommend the Black Mamba!), cool decor, a pretty good cover band (ask to sit in the back if you're sensitive to live music), and, of course, delicious pizza. And a special shout out to our entertaining server Liz, who listened to our dumb stories and shared a few fun ones of her own. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome place! Rock mates with beer and pizza. And what a perfect union! Plus, they have a Banksy work that was clearly made specially for the bar. Live music on Fridays and Saturdays. It can be a bit loud if you sit at the bar, but in the dining area it is a perfect place for conversation. Plus, the staff is super friendly! Terry the pizza rolls. They are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and bartenders. AWESOME draft beer selection. Wings and apps were delicious!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND  Live music and nice little patio bar out front."}
{"text":"Incredibly small portions.  Not worth the price for how tiny they are.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs with the pasta being very soggy and the meatballs were average.  The pasta was clearly cooked too long, easily the worst quality pasta I have ever had.  I cannot stress how small the portion was.  For $14.50 I would expect a larger size.  You are better off going to Olive Garden.  Seriously, the tiny portion size blew my mind.  Waste of money, do not go there!  I can not get over HOW SMALL THE PORTIONS ARE.  They must care more about their bottom line than serving good food and fair portions to customers.  DO NOT GO THERE  (My husband wrote this review- but I agree!)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Vinyl Pi several times. Some of my favorites are the pork belly, calamari, wings, and pizza. They just started brunch on Sunday. Wow! The shrimp and grits is just right. The shrimp was super fresh and the gravy was a nice touch. My husband had waffles with pork belly and fried bussell sprouts. Y'all, this combination was to die for! Topped it off with a bloody mary served with bacon. They make their bloody mary mix in house. The chef is only 23 years old. He is so talented!!! They have a great selection of craft beer as well as an extension bourbon menu. The service is always top notch! Put this place on the top of your list."}
{"text":"Tried again....,, food delivered was cold. Drinks weak and terrible. The owner apologized and comped the meal. Guess I need to sit at the bar for good service cause table service is just not good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Friendly staff, great beers and some pretty darn good music.  It seems like they've changed a couple of staff here recently and I'm loving all the new faces so far.  The first time I came here, I ate in the side with all the rockstar memorabilia.  It's cool over there, def give it a look see.  Lately though, I prefer the bar.  Always somebody friendly to chat with.  Some great recommendations on beers as well as quick friendly food service.  The fried brussel sprouts are a must.  The rest is up to you.  Will I be back....  YES!  This may be my new local watering hole."}
{"text":"Went here because a lot of people told me it was a great place for pizza in the Huntersville area. The service was great and I loved the band playing when I went. We ordered our pizza and when it came I was shocked! It's was hands down the worst pizza I've ever tasted. Way overpriced for the size. We got a medium, and it was personal size. Payed $13 for that. I could make something way better at home! Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped by today with friends for brunch. We had the following meals, Breakfast Nirvana, Brunch Street Bully, Egg Raid On Mojo X2, Nuevo Huevos Rancheros X2. All were cooked perfectly and the service was great. We will be going back again most likely to try the pizza after reading some of the reviews."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and service. Great food for a great price. Also, these guys know their booze. If you're looking for a solid beer or whisky selection to drown your sorrows or your saucy cheese bread concoction, look no further. Their old bay seasoned wings are super tasty. I have yet to experience any poor tasting pizza, and they also have fried brussel sprouts. They generally offer live music a few nights a week."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. Both the server and bartender clearly did not want to be there. They made that abundantly clear. It took forever to get our food. 35+mins  for a gluten free pizza. We were told that it was because they take longer to cook. I manage a multi million dollar restaurant that I'm pretty sure uses the same GF dough. Mmk. My friends and I were here the evening of 7/11/17 We will not be back bc of the staff that you had on that evening. They are bad news for your restaurant.  Please find some more uplifting, positive people and we will be back."}
{"text":"The fried brussels sprouts were phenomenal. Beware the included chili peppers unless you're bold. I guess I'm bold because I loved them. The lemon on top is essential.  Their beer selection is varied and well-priced. Bravo! Same with wine. Double bravo!  Pizza has a thin crust and the right amount of sauce. Pepperoni made it super greasy, but that's what I wanted that day. Cheese was good and not rubbery. I'd definitely order their pizza again, but I wish their make-your-own pizza menu weren't so pricey because I prefer to choose my own toppings on occasion.  Service was fast and friendly. Music was good. Parking is easy.  Decor wasn't great -- both TVP and Cork & Cask are owned by the same people, and they both have the same man-cave feel about them. I wish they'd acknowledge that decor plays a big role in the vibe of a place like this and hire a decorator to create the right ambiance for both restaurants. The bar at TVP is just right, but then they have this terrible display of music paraphernalia tacked to a metal grid on a brick wall detracting from the otherwise good vibe. Fix the decor and lower the cost of your a la carte pizza, and you've got a 5 star restaurant right here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice bar, great beer and whiskey selection. Meatballs were awesome and pizza was delicious as well. Definitely will be back! Glad to have this place in town!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Awesome beer selection! Great atmosphere. We ate outside because we had a little one with us and it was super crowded inside with live music. (Will def be back without the little guy!) Service was excellent. Liz was the greatest!! This just might be our new go-to!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! First time visitors tonight and we are hooked. Some of the best pizza around. Can't wait for the next trip."}
{"text":"When I moved here almost a year ago I began my search for the perfect pizza around these parts and I LOVE THE VINYL PI!!! Get the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer - they'll change your life."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Good food and vibes. Great live music too.  Lots a friendly servers and bartenders."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in I knew I was in for a treat. The atmosphere spoke of love and life and living. As we were greeted warmly by MARIAH we knew we were going to be treated well. We had come for the EVIL TWINS DUELING PIANOS and delightfully surprised the bar and food rose to the level of these 2 musicians.  Yes the food and service surpassed our expectations."}
{"text":"For brunch I had the stuffed French toast with peanut butter and bananas and it was amazing! The pizza is phenomenal. Great place to watch football, plenty of TVs. A great selection of craft beer and the staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered a large Pizza with cheeses and bacon. Paid $22 with a tip for takeout and drove 4 miles home.  This is not a large Pizza.   Very disappointed.  It's late and too inconvenient to go back.  Will not."}
{"text":"I've passed this place many times on my way to work and thought I'd finally try it.   Here's $20 worth of \"wings\".  The pizza, a large supreme tastes on par with Tombstone pizza, for $23.  What a waste of money."}
{"text":"After waiting 30min for our order to arrive (in a nearly empty restaurant on Sunday afternoon) we found the serving sizes to be ample. Unfortunately the meatball sub was lukewarm at best. They were sweet and tasted good but we didn't ask for it to be heated because the bread was already beyond toasted. My pizza - which was billed as 3 mushroom - was okay. It had significantly more capers than mushrooms. The two pasta dishes at our table were good - spaghetti and meatballs and fusilli w/ pesto. Service was begrudgingly adequate.  We'd recommend ordering a drink and appetizer if you're coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles, make you wanna slap yo Mama. Presentation is great. Steak, egg and cheese in Texas toast soooo good.  Check out their brunch..."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Pizza was on point. I love the record/rock and roll theme to the place and the menu as they have most pizza and dishes named after musicians. Service was good. Food was fantastic. Beer selection was on point. If you're in the mood for pizza definitely give this place a try"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a long time and the crust is scrumptious! The Nowell with mushroom and fried capers... just get it!!"}
{"text":"Very Eclectic Menu executed well.  My wife and I visited yesterday which was a Saturday for lunch and found The Vinyl Pie to be an excellent choice.  Interesting bar arrangement which is basically one long room running from one side of the building to the other. Bar area is on one side and the other is an interesting wall of art made up of various musical instruments.  Very interesting menu and from what we experienced, very well executed. For an appetizer, we started with the Pizza Rolls which were excellent. Basically a miniature pizza served with Marinara Sauce on the side.  For my entree, I had the Phish and Chips which was battered Cod served over fries topped with a Pea Shoots Salad. On the side was a Watermelon Tartar sauce. I tasted the Tartar Sauce but I'm not a fan of tartar sauce so I stuck with my Malt Vinegar which they had to courtesy of serving without even asking.  The Phish and Chips were excellent and I have to give very high marks for presentation. The eye appear of the dish was very appealing and was not expected. Good flaky Cod with a nice sweet taste on a bed of French Fries that were great. Only problem I had was the size of the portions was more that I could eat and I am a hearty eater.  My wife had the Strawberry Fields Wrap which was Grilled Chicken Spinach, Walnuts, Strawberries, Goat Cheese in a Wheat Wrap with a Cranberry Vinaigrette.. It was good but the paring of the Strawberries with the Cranberry Vinaigrette was a bit unusual.  On the whole, our service was excellent but the kitchen was a bit slow. No problem because we were in no rush. Our server did a great job of keeping our coffee cups filled and I might add, a very good coffee at that. Nice and strong and robust.  This is a fun place and I'm definitely going to be back. Lot of other items on the menu that I want to check out."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write a review on our service but after I thought about it, it wouldn't give management feedback on how they can improve it's service. Our waiter was young, enthusiastic but not very good at common sense service. He kept coming to our table asking if everything was okay while we were talking and leaving just as fast as he arrived. Mind you our glasses of water remained empty. After we ate our appetizer, chicken wings, he took the serving plate but left the other plates, which had the bones on them. We had to ask him to take those on one of his enthusiastic visits.  It took over 40 minutes to get our 2 small pizzas and he said that he was sorry but there was confusion in the kitchen. That sound forgivable but I overheard him say the same thing 15 minutes later to another table, He brought out the pizza with no plates, I had to take them from an empty table, I walked up to the hostess for parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. And the final insult was not only did I have a hair in my pizza but we had two hairs on our pizzas.  Management, please correct this awful, learn as you go service and invest in hair and beard nets. I've liked your business in the past but it might take a while before I come back, maybe after the servers go back to school and the kitchen staff gets itself clean and organized. Sorry for the bad review"}
{"text":"Cool place, decent beer selection. Waited over 30 mins for a take out pizza but it noted as such on the menu.. don't expect anyone to do more than the bare minimum service wise if you are not a regular. Pizza is sub-par.. got the \"Vedder\" but they were out of carnitas so I subbed chicken, not a trace of cilantro on the pie. 10\" pizza cost $14."}
{"text":"We have been here twice.   The first time we decided to go basic and just try the appetizers.  Meatballs, pizza rolls and stuffed peppers. The meatballs were cold and the homemade sauce was bland. The Pizza rolls were a loaf of bread and a little bit of dried pepperoni. Stuffed peppers were greasy, over cooked and not stuffed.   Second visit, we did pizza and I got a side salad.   It was similar to the caesar side salad at Wendy's; the only difference is that I paid six dollars. The pizza we ordered the basil, tomato and mozzarella pizza, the slick, and added roasted chicken. The chicken was mostly dark meat and the pizza was soggy. It had no real flavor."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but the wait is long! The food is worth it but be prepared to wait a long time for your food. Always slammed!"}
{"text":"Knocking a star off for waitstaff service....maybe 2...it's getting comical at this point."}
{"text":"Well,  we are currently sitting here and have been for an hour. The people that sat down just after us have had their appetizers and entre' and are gone while we sit waiting with a crying baby just hoping for something to eat.    Update: Food finally came and was good. An hour and a forty five minutes later I am waiting on my change to come back so that I can leave.    Manager saw me sitting alone as my wife and kids headed for the door,  decided to not check in on us.  Probably a smart move on his part.   Service is hit or miss apparently. Give this place a try if you have plenty of time. If you have kids or don't have a couple of hours you should look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yes!!!  Another Yelper hit it - CAVE MAN feel!  Love it, bar area is set up not to big, not to small.  Perfect for a Saturday or Sunday football hang out.  TV's everywhere, great sound, just the right amount of lighting.  Staff rocks, manager came by the table to chat several times....  The place was full and the crowd had a lot of energy.....  We went especially for pizza, The Vinyl Pi.   Name says it all.  So what do I do?  Based on another Yelp review, I tried the Broad Street Bully.    Yep, that's me.  Now if you know anything about the Philadelphia Flyers and the history of the famous legit philly cheesesteak, bam -  there it is.....  The ultra top secret, I can tell you but have to kill you ingredient - cheese whiz...........  Yeah I said it, but if you are not into NHL, the Flyers or Philadelphia, never mind, just order pizza.......you do not understand.  As for the pizza's, they were a 3.5.  Decent but not phenomenal.   I did try a slice of The Black Frances.  Tasty meats!   My issue is, if you are a Ultimate or Supreme fan, like my wife and son, building a custom pizza gets pricey.   If you have read my reviews, I have stated over and over, I do not pricey food and paying extra for the ultimate dining experience, like a high 4 or solid 5.  But sadly, this was just a borderline pizza.    Not being overly critical as everyone has a different PI in their mind.  Also, they are supporting the Non Widen / Toll Booth expansion - http://wideni77.org/ with support and fundraisers.  Props to them for taking a  stand."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, but the customer service is a bit slow. That's why I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"If my dinner entree isn't enough to fill a toddlers tummy, your portions are too small! Which is the case at \"The Vinyl Pi\" They offer a lunch menu for many items and understandably those portions are smaller. But what I ordered the Pasta Carbonara(which was not really Pasta Carbonara)  was only available in their dinner portion which I have posted for your amusement. I am not exaggerating when I say I finished my \"dinner entree\" in 5 bites, the portion was laughable!   Under no circumstances should Pasta be rationed to this extent! It's freakin Pasta!!! The servers were friendly, but extremely slow and it wasn't even a full house. I won't return."}
{"text":"We have come here many times this time sat outside because so loud inside. Was sat next to table with heavy smokers so moved over a couple tables. Smokers made rude comment about us moving....really? Ask management if smoking was allowed outside he stated thy discourage it and then blew me off as in I don't want to hear it. Either you can or you can't smoke. I don't pay to eat dinner to have smoke in my face."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. The food is excellent and the staff is pleasant and helpful"}
{"text":"Don't miss this place!  Molly Hatchett pie was delish!  Half price wine Wednesday.  We opted for a buttery fresh white.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch a Panther game on a Sunday afternoon.  Wasn't to crowded.  Nice beer selection and atmosphere was very nice and clean and inviting.  We sat in the bar area near the many tv's of course.  Very friendly staff and manager who checked on us mid way through our meal.  We ordered pizza's.  Most of their pizza choices were not quite anything I like.  Im a simple pizza girl...........just give me a supreme with all the toppings please!!  To do this I had to make my own pizza adding the toppings I wanted which=gets pricey!  The pizza was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  My daughter got a cheese pizza and I tried a bite of it.  It wasn't to good either.  I would possibly try this place again but not for the pizza."}
{"text":"I rarely give negative reviews.. I was really disappointed last night. I have been really looking forward to the hip atmosphere and that was nice. Music was GREAT, lighting is bright, they were out of 3 of the craft beers that were on the menu and salads except for romain. The waiter poured our beers with a full glass of head. And the pizza was just not great. The Moe (Buffalo) had so much blue cheese it over powered the entire pie. Hopefully they are stiff fine tuning and maybe out of stock for. Good reason but it was a Wednesday.."}
{"text":"Great pizza spot. Plus totally surprised by the fried brussel sprouts. So good I couldn't stop eating them. Nice salads & good beer selection."}
{"text":"2-19-17 Sunday 5:30pm..Super super super slow service.    Waited literally about 3 hours total.  We ordered 3 large pizzas, 3 wings 10 each plus beer and soda.   About at the 1 hour 45 minute marker we ask not the waitress but a manager where is the food, she replies back to my friend in our party, \"the owner is here, do you wanna talk to her\" in a nasty attitude like we did something wrong.  So my buddy went to talk to her but nothing was resolved.   There were 6 adults and 6 kids in our party. About the 2 hour 15 minute window some food started to roll in(they complained that they were short staffed) this is pizza folks. Now they roll out with the pizza and not the kids food first which they had some chicken tenders and spaghetti with a meatball.  Pizza comes then 1 order of wings.  Then another order of wings came about 4 minutes later.  10 minutes later the last set of 10 wings came and they say we have some hot wings here when I ordered barbalo.  They say after I say I ordered barbalo \"oh yeah these must be barbalo\". Wow.  I'm surprised they didn't taste it first.  We eat and now we get the bill.  After this entire wait of almost 3 hours you would think they would at least comp you something,  not a damn thing.  I literally will never eat at this place or drink a beer at this place ever again in my life and the 2 other families I was with will most likely do the same.  We all live in this area and there are many many choices of pizza to choose from.  The service was super slow and the management should be reprimanded.  3 hours at a pizza place with 6 adults and 6 kids is unacceptable and they should be ashamed to be in business with such crappy attitudes (management) .  At least comp our soda or something for such horrible service.  Never again will I step foot in here and I will tell everyone I know of what horrible service we had."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in the quality of this over priced pizza. They must pre make the dough for quick assembly rather than doing it by hand because the crust tastes like metal and has metal pan marks on the bottom. It was also very over cooked. Biting into the end of the crust hurt my teeth! For those of you looking for yummy New York styled pizza pass this place up! Such a shame because it's a great location. We will not order from them ever again! We actually ordered from here two years ago and it was quite good. From there the quality slowly went down hill. We waited a year and gave it another shot but the quality was even worse."}
{"text":"Great pizza and meatballs. This restaurant is in a strange location but the food is very good."}
{"text":"We came in a on whim, looking for a place with a nice patio and good beer selection. We couldn't leave fast enough. The beer selection is fine- the menu could stand to be simplified, double sided seems a bit excessive, particularly when you have a  craft beer-esque description of Bud Light.  The service was terrible, our waitress disappeared several times throughout our visit. It was a slow Tuesday, and we were one of two tables on the patio. She dropped our food and vanished; we ordered beers and ended up getting them from the bar ourself.  As far as the food is concerned, the wings tasted like Tyson's frozen wings out of the bags, rolled in Texas Pete buffalo sauce, baked and served. They were chewy and bland. The White Album pizza seems like an idea concocted as an after thought and never really fleshed out.  There are so many places to get pizza, wings and craft beer. You would think it make places like Vinyl Pi elevate their game. I can live without this place."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Took 15 minutes for someone to come to our table, AFTER waiting 1/2 hour for a table. When our food came, (margarita pizza) it was soggy and partially cold. And we never did get refills on our drinks, after asking for one.   We used to frequent this place when they opened but it has changed significantly.   Will not be returning. Ever."}
{"text":"I love the Vinyl Pi. We got pizza to go from there today and it arrived at the house hot and fresh! I've eaten at the restaurant and it is consistently good! Must try the pizza rolls, wings, black Francis PIZZA!! The live music is great and bartenders are always serving up the most delicious concoctions - definitely worth a try :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza with music legend names.  Awesome appetizer list that you can make a meal ordering a few to share.  Very chill feel, fantastic music decor, outdoor patio seating.  Great beer selection with a mix of local brews and other greats.  Brunch menu on Sunday.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great pizza that tastes as homemade as you get. We had several people with different tastes, so we got a large pizza, half all-meat, and the other half with pesto and veggies. They did a good job separating the two, so there was no overlap, and I can vouch for the veggie side, at least. (Note - would have liked to have had spinach as an option, but kale was close enough.) Also had the bruschetta, which was fabulously flavorful, with tons of tomatoes.  Upscale, eclectic atmosphere with lots of music-themed decor, and live bands! Ever found yourself dancing at a pizza joint? Me either, until now.   Everyone there was very polite - especially the ladies at the front door, who greeted me with big smiles. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza and the meatballs were hard as a rock.  Its a shame because this is a pretty cool place with lots on great music and eclectic vibes. It just doesn't go with the ketchup based red sauce frim a can. Know what I mean?"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé randomly found out about this place. We were in Huntersville and wanted pizza on our way home, went to Yelp and found this place. Apparently it is really new, a few weeks old maybe. The place is very peppy, with plenty of indoor seating as well as a fenced patio. The decor is really nice and everything here is named after music artists. We ordered a half Moe (buffalo chicken) and half Nowell (shiitake mushrooms, oysters, capers). The pizzas were really good, except that after finishing our meal I realized that I didn't taste the oysters, nor capers on my Nowell. Oh well, it still tasted good, and I have never had oysters on my pizza so I don't even know if they maybe got lost in all the cheese. They have a good selection of beer and wine, and the servers are very nice. We are looking forward to going back and trying more stuff here. They also have sandwiches and noodles (very rare combination, but I like it)."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am pregnant, so I live in a world of extremes at the moment...this can contribute to some biases. However...  This pizza was right on time! It was also really tasty! I was on my way home from work (around 4:30) when I realized I hadn't eaten anything in hours and was starving (extremes). At that point I knew the only thing that would agree with my pallet and my tummy was pizza. Two minutes later I saw the word \"Pizza\" on a building and I made the quickest right of my life into a gas station parking lot, which actually doubles as a lot for some of the other businesses in that strip, including Vinyl Pi.   I was greeted by this sweet lady who opened the door for me. I asked if they had slices and she said they did not, but they had small 12\" pizzas. Then a nice gentleman at the bar said \"we also have kid pizzas which is like a slice and a half.\" Lol. It was only $5 so I decided to give it a try. Nothing fancy, no bells and whistles, just cheese. But omg, one of the better cheese pizzas I've had in some time. I ordered my pi to go, and at first I was confused about why it took 15 minutes to make a child sized pizza (pregnant + hungry = Impatient), but it was actually a pretty hefty serving, even for my ravenous  appetite, I had two slices leftover.   Based on this pizza, the other yummy sounding menu items, the atmosphere, and the exceptionally friendly service (which is so rare these days), I will definitely be back to dine in soon!   P.S. Was also told that slices may be coming soon during lunch!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise. We recently ate at The Vinyl Pi while visiting family in Huntersville. Was a little skeptical when we pulled into the gas station. Pulled around to the side and found this little gem waiting for us. The pizza was baked to perfection (believe me, my husband is a pizza connoisseur). The atmosphere was great with the rock theme. Enjoyed all the rock art. Super clean dining area and great wait staff. The ONLY reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because IMHO I thought the dough could have benefitted from a little salt. Personal preference. Will definitely be visiting The Vinyl Pi again."}
{"text":"Has been hit or miss in our experience. The food is usually good, but something seems to go wrong with every visit. On our 1st visit, our credit card was charged $60 more than the receipt we signed. When we called, they acknowledged knowing about it but said their payment system can't process refunds so we needed to come back to get a check from them. Just very odd. On the 2nd visit we showed up to a half empty restaurant and we were told we couldn't be sat because they didn't have enough servers. This has happened several times over about a year of visits. Comes down to poor management of staffing needs during peak dinner hours. On our last visit, they indicated that they received the wrong ranch dressing in their morning shipment. The waitress rolled her eyes and said she's had to tell her tables to order different items all day - not sure why they wouldn't send someone a mile down the road to purchase some from a grocery store (this was standard protocol at restaurants I have worked in)."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Pizza roll app is great! I have had salads that are good. Pizza I think is just ok. Wings are decent as well. Service is always great even when really busy!!"}
{"text":"Attention Charlotte folks! You all need to come check this place out. Great pizza, wings, pasta, sandwiches, craft beer, cocktails, wine, etc. Like live music? They have it Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. Not your typical pizza joint, because they now have delicious steaks on Thursday! Grass fed beef cooked to your preference. After working out some opening week/month jitters, they have righted the ship and created and amazing experience. See you at Vinyl Pi!"}
{"text":"This place is much like a fancy new cell phone.  Its not that its bad but its way more expensive than it needs to be when there are wayyy less expensive options that are just as good.  Its a place you try once just to say you've had it but if you go there more than once you're either a pretentious hipster who believes overpaying is fashionable or own a piece of Lake Norman and money is no object.   The large-err excuse me- 72 pizza was solid with quality toppings but only marginally better than say Papa Johns which is almost half the price.  If you think this is the best pizza you've ever tasted you don't get out much and need to travel to NYC or Chicago.   I did pickup which also was a bit of a challenge since I had to work with the hostess to get my pizza.  She was at the front of the house close to the door creating a lot of congestion.  Would make more sense to have pickup orders originate out of the bar area. Service was nice but slow.  Pizza wasn't ready in time even though I got there 15 minutes after the discussed pickup time.  Had to wait an additional five.  Too many well meaning but easily distracted millennials working there.   Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course but I wonder if anyone given this place 5 stars isn't playing with a full record collection if you ask me (see what I did there)."}
{"text":"I'm struggling with vinyl pi!! I hadn't been in a few years as I was never really impressed and didn't ever think it was worth another visit.. we moved quite close a few months ago and decided to try it out Friday night with some friends. PSA- don't go here unless you expect an appetizer to take 30 mins to come from the kitchen after waiting 15+ for a drink!!! As for the food itself, it was just okay! The Brussels app was great but we also got the pinwheels app and for $10, those four little tiny pizza bites were kind of a joke! My friend and I shared a pizza and although the crust was good, the toppings sorta lacked flavor! In giving the Vinyl Pi three stars bc I'm open to trying again, and the bar area is quite nice... just don't expect anything quickly!"}
{"text":"Desperate times...  The kitchen was so poor performing, multiple tables were asking for early checks and complaining.  Shift manager did her best to apologize, but there was no option to overcome the kitchen fails.  Tough eve for everyone involved."}
{"text":"Arrived around 12:30 on Super Bowl Sunday and found an almost empty restaurant, but we ventured in. $5 Bloody Mary special was really good and garnished with cheese & pepperoni and a blue cheese stuffed olive. Fried Brussel sprout app was spectacular and portion size was perfect for 4 people. Had the Moe pizza (buffalo chicken) and it was delicious. Service was very good & staff was wonderfully friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much since it's near a gas station, there were wrappers outside, and the clientele entering the joint looked like they'd be willing to throw down if I glanced at their wings the wrong way.   Entering this establishment with my wife and son seemed as though it confirmed my suspicions: dark and only patrons at the bar, possibly drinking it up before noon. We cautiously sat down, and I wondered if we would make it to the meal. But I kept thinking: \"I can't Yelp it if I leave without eating!\" Therefore, I held firm, puffed out my chest (not literally), and ordered water for the family.   Have you ever met a tattooed motorcycle gang member that looked like he wanted to kill you but then ended up being the coolest person you ever met? Probably not. But pretend you did. That's The Vinyl Pi (for restaurants).   The waitress was friendly. We only ordered a pizza, which took about 20-25 minutes, but that was okay because I knew that meant it was more likely to be good. And the pizza was pretty good. A lot of seasoning on the crust, but still solid. My wife thought it was great. Don't put it in the Brooklyn South or Tony's category, but it's strong for bar pizza. I wish I had ordered the wings, but now I have an excuse to go out for a beer or two so I can update this review.   You're probably wondering about the bathrooms. Okay, probably not, but the bathroom was spotless. We were there only one hour into service and there were only a few people dining/drinking, which helps. This is hours before people drink too much and have the potential to urinate on the doorknob.   Overall, I would recommend The Vinyl Pi as long as you're comparing it to most bar/restaurants and not 131 Main. It's a Pizza Joint & Bar. It even says so on the marquee!"}
{"text":"Still working out the bugs. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated which is totally reasonable for a Friday evening. The vibe is kind of cool, lots of music related stuff on the walls, eclectic music playing, etc...  The menu had lots of good looking options so, we ordered and this is where the wheels came off. We waited, no big deal they're busy, and waited, and noticed people who were seated well after us getting food.   So after sitting there for an hour I got up and found our waiter to tell him to go ahead and just box our stuff up we had to go. About 5 minutes later the manager told us that the order never made it to the kitchen, he had just put a rush on it and they would take care of it which was awesome.   He couldn't tell us how long that was going to take though and after having an hour and half invested already with nothing to eat we left and hit a drive thru on the way home."}
{"text":"I'm a pizza aficionado. I eat it weekly, explore pizza joints around the greater Charlotte and Atlanta metropolitan areas, make it, love it, etc., and this is terrific 'zaaa.  Now that we've gotten that over, I've got to say this is the best damn pie I've had in NC and GA. The toppings are outrageously good, well sourced, fresh, and special (where the hell can you get pickled onions?!). The pizza is perfectly cooked. I always have to ask for pizzas well done, but not here. They take pride in the sanctity of texture, cheese, crunch and flavor."}
{"text":"Love it! Have been there several times. Salads are good and pizza with pepperoni and hot cherry peppers is my fav! Neighborhood feel, which is nice. Great Pom martini! Extensive menu."}
{"text":"I'd've given the Vinyl Pi a 3.5 altogether if I could.  I wish we could do half stars.  Located in a strip mall-ish style building next to a gas station, I drive past here all the time.  I finally stopped in because someone on Facebook recently mentioned how much they liked it and I like to check things out for myself.  We arrived at 7 PM on a Saturday night to ample open seats and we were greeted promptly by a hostess who offered us dining room seating or a high top in the bar.  We opted for the high top which would keep us near the band when they were scheduled to arrive at 8:30pm.  (Worth it, we liked them... \"Open Soul Project\").    Our service this evening was immediate, pleasant and consistent.  Our server was Audrey and she was great at making sure drinks were refilled quickly, empty dishes removed promptly and that food came out looking correct.  She's definitely on top of her game.  Since it was our first visit we asked for recommendations on what is popular at the Vinyl Pi.   She assured us everything on the menu was excellent and said that a couple times.  That's always a warning sign to me (and it turned out the other couple as well) because when servers claim everything is excellent it never, ever is.  Never.  It's totally ok to tell me that item A isn't the best but item B is always a hit.  Even everything I make in my own kitchen isn't always the best, it's just not possible to have everything be fabulous.  We started off with the pizza rolls (handrolled pizza dough with mozzarella and pepperoni and marinara dipping sauce $9.)  The handrolled distracted me because I was thinking homemade or housemade.  Our table thought the pizza dough tasted pre-made frozen and voted it good/fine.  I did like the marinara dipping sauce very much though.    We also got the Bruschetta which was supposed to be four toasted crostinis topped with diced tomatoes and onions, parmesan, basil and balsamic glaze $8.   Look at my picture.  It was an absolutely beautiful presentation!  The tomatoes and onions were finely diced making it easy to take small bites.  However, there was something going on with the crostini.  I couldn't decide if it had been taken out of the freezer and thawed or if it had been toasted earlier in the day and put in the refrigerator.  The crostinis themselves were stone cold and felt and tasted like bread that had never met an oven or grill.  It was an odd sensation because bruschetta crostini are always toasted and never \"out of the fridge\" cold.  But they looked SO BEAUTIFUL!  Great plating on the dish, at least.  I got the Pendergrass sandwich (shaved rib eye, diced onions, red peppers and provolone on a toasted hoagie roll $13).  This was almost an A+ sandwich.  I liked the meat, I liked the tiny dice on the onions and peppers and I was really, really happy with the hoagie roll.  The only problem was that it was so oversalted that my mouth felt puckered (and I have a strong salt tooth).  So too salty for me means way to salty.  Paired with parmesan tater tots the server had steered me to over the fries, I wasn't digging the tater tots but it may have been the double salt overload between sandwich and side.  Great sandwich with great potential and great bread.  Just a mere dusting of salt, please.  One person got a double order of wings (medium and whisky maple bacon) so 20 wings for $19.  Comes with plenty of carrots and celery and a nice ranch dressi, which she particularly liked about them.  Two people got the Corleone Kitchen Sink Pasta ($13) which was penne (that was actually slightly overcooked rigatoni) and tossed in their homemade Kitchen Sink Sauce (hot italian sausage, meatballs, ground pork, marinara, topped with pecorino cheese).  The pasta portions here are very small, which I'd already known because I read reviews before coming but neither of the men finished their dish!  They didn't like the meat or the sauce, which makes no sense to me.  I'm a little confounded.  So overall, here's my take.  We had immediate seating, an immediate hostess greeting, a very attentive and pleasant server, a very good band.  Food came out promptly and correctly.  If my sandwich wasn't oversalted I would have said I LOVED that sandwich, and that's high praise from me (the hoagie roll was the perfect one for the sandwich, too).  The bruschetta was so beautifully plated that I know someone in the kitchen is very good at what they do.  (The pizza rolls were well plated, too, btw.)  That bruschetta with freshly grilled crostini would have been an A+ and that's really easy to adjust, just by making the crostini to order.  We did not try the pizza but the one at the table next to us looked delicious.  My wine was buttery and smooth and I've gotten used to bad quality wines at so many bar places that I was really happy to get such a nice wine here (though the pour seems small).  The beer menu was interesting. I'd like to give Vinyl Pi another shot down the road and see what my take is then. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER EATEN AT IN MY LIFE. Took over an hour & a half to get a large pizza! When I got the pizza, its was so greasy and not even fresh. I spent about 30$ on a soda with a large pizza. Seriously? The service was horrible. I had a server that clearly did not know what the hell they were doing. Worst experience I have ever had. This place isn't going to make it out alive, it should be shut down & something better be replaced."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent. I rarely eat crust, but theirs is an exception. Live music on weekends which is fantastic.... My teen and her friends go up on occasion for desert .  Friendly atmosphere.  Bonus: walking distance for us."}
{"text":"Disappointing :( We have heard good things and live right around the corner so wanted to give it a try.  The staff was very friendly and professional but the food was not very good. Skinny, dry wings and burnt pizza with what seems to be low quality ingredients. Not worth the cost for sure! I'd like to say we  will give it another try but...that was so disappointing I really dont think we will."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on an afternoon during the week. honestly, the food is exceptional. we were both extremely pleased with the food, decor and service. We ended up getting sweet potato fries, pasta, mac and cheese, and a burger which were all some of the best foods i've eaten :)."}
{"text":"I usually love the buffalo chicken pizza, but the past 2 types it was mostly all crust, very little cheese, and not enough flavor. Was very disappointed. Pizza sizes are not big for the prices."}
{"text":"I had the fried mushrooms appetizer, had a light batter and two sauces. Teriyaki and horseradish. For entree I had the rhinestone cowboy burger. It's a double burger with fried jalapeños, mushrooms and cheese. Was seasoned very well. I loved the music decor. Service was very good. Will definitely return and try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Great place to check out any night of the week. Food is delicious and all the bar tenders treat you like best friends. Brian always keeps you entertained and your glass full"}
{"text":"Trying so hard to like this place but it may be moving to a drinks only destination. Last three visits sitting at a table have averaged over 10 minutes for a drink, over 25 for an appetizer. Food is great but would love to see the service step up to match"}
{"text":"I was a little suspect about trying this place given a few of the reviews but was I ever glad I gave Vinyl Pi a shot!  Since the majority of the negative reviews talked about service issues, I will start there.  We had great service. Very attentive, proud to work there, knew the menu well. No issues whatsoever.   In terms of food, even though it's kind of a pizza place mainly, we didn't order pizza on this trip. But... We did see a number of pizzas come to surrounding tables. They looked good and what was also good were the comments overheard from the people eating. We are committed to pizza on our next visit.   We got the fritto misto as an app and for the first time in a good while, enjoyed tender, non-overcooked and rubbery calamari. I had a Philly cheesesteak with Whiz. It was delicious with special props to the good bread on which it came. My wife had the Joplin pasta and enjoyed it as well. The only thing I ate that I wouldn't order again was my side of potato salad.   We will be back and now that I'm writing this review in the morning and am hungry, it may be for dinner tonight!"}
