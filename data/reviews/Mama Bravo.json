{"text":"I have been coming to this place for the past 4 years.
Service and quality of food is getting worse all the the me.
I do not know where the owners are or if they care about their business.
Tonight I went there, there was about a dozen people in the place, 4 waitresses, and after a 15 min. wait without anyone coming to see me I got up snd left.
If service continues in this direction they will close before long.
Owners wake up and smell the coffey."}
{"text":"We gave it two chances. It's the dirtiest restaurant ever. First time was delivery. We ordered a chicken plate with salad. The salad was stale, the chicken was barely cooked and tasted horrible and overall nothing was fresh. So we assumed it was just because it took FOREVER to be delivered (even though we live 2 minutes away) and must've got cold in the car or something... We tried again, this time we went to the restaurant. BIGGEST MISTAKE!! Again the food was bland, nothing special at all. At least this time it was warm, but the pasta was exactly like opening up a can of Chef Boyardee. What prompted me to write this review, there were flies all over the restaurant. It's too cold for flies to survive outside at this time of year so that clearly means they're living in the kitchen. The waiter had a hard time denying it when we asked if that's where they're coming from. I killed one with my napkin on the table. When the waiter came and we complained he was very aware of the fly problem. We just paid our bill and got out of there, wasn't even worth talking to the manager! I'll never set foot in that disgusting place again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and large open comfortable seating with plenty of booths. 
Battered foods had a nice crisp taste from fresh oil and fries are medium cut with potato skins - very tasty and flavorful."}
{"text":"Great food without the overbloated pricetags. One of my favorite places to dine out and relax."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, I go there all the time . I've tried breakfast, dinner , souper and the pizza . I've never had a bad experience. I recommended to all my friends. Lately I was there and I tried the new poutine with meat on top , one word WOW !!!! Staff is good , I spoke to the manager about food and hockey , that was fun . Definitely a restaurant that I recommend."}
