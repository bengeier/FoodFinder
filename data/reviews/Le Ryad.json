{"text":"Kind of expensive, but at least great quality.  Make sure to look the 3 sides of the place before ordering. Some gluten free alternative. A lot of little, pricy pastries.  The salted option look like they come from the freezer."}
{"text":"Les churros les plus croustillants et savoureux que j'ai goûté! Ils sont juste assez et pas trop sucrés (même avec la couche de sucre par dessus)! Personnel super aimable et un churros pour 2.50$, ça vaut la peine."}
{"text":"Mon arrêt obligé au marché Jean-Talon. Comment résister à un thé à la menthe avec un peu d'eau de rose ou de fleur d'oranger? Impossible!  Ils ont également un bon choix de pâtisseries du Maghreb toutes plus succulentes les unes que les autres. Pour quelque chose d'un peu différent, vous pouvez également accompagner votre thé à la menthe d'un churros, ce que je fait fréquemment.  Un espace adjacent avec des tables vous permet de relaxer tout en dégustant le tout!"}
{"text":"Incredibly pretty North African desserts.  Jean Talon market is a market like no other for North America in terms of breadth, depth, cleanliness, value, and selection of international foods reflective of Montreal's multiculturalism.   One such ethnic eatery is Patisserie le Ryad which has a large collection of pastries and also a few savory items like burekas. Frankly, I didn't pay any attention to the savory part of the menu or even traditional middle eastern sweets like baklava for the former didn't look too enticing and the latter are pretty much ubiquitous in Middle East and North Africa.  But, there were so many unfamiliar items that I had to confirm that these are of Moroccan heritage (though also found in neighboring countries like Algeria and Tunisia). I laud the bakery for the pleasing aesthetics of all sweet things baked and also for being adept at ensuring that they aren't too rich (perhaps French influence?) compared to their Middle Eastern cousins that appear to be jacked up in sugar to help people survive in the dessert. There was a pleasing mix of semolina, almonds, honey, orange flower, and dates in most of the items.  My one concern would be that I don't know what kind of turnover they see, despite such a prominent location in such a popular market. I only loved a couple (M'chekla and Dziriette) of the 5 items I purchased and they tasted comparatively fresher. I don't think the pricing is exorbitant compared to that at non-Arabic bakeries, but I can understand why a few of the customers and  window shoppers thought the small pastries (CAD 2.95 plus tax) to be kind of expensive. That's a shame, because these guys are pretty unique in terms of what they have to offer. (3.5 stars)"}
{"text":"Another inexpensive place for a really tasty quick lunch in Jean Talon Market, le Ryad stands in the very middle of the covered crossroads in Jean Talon market. Essentially a square with three long glass display counters full of Moroccan pastries and sweets (oh the honey! oh the rosewater!) there is a also a small section of savoury stuffed stuff (burekas, calzones, empanadas) - fillings options include chorizo, spinach, fresh mozzarella, kefta, and more. Thrown into a toaster oven these are delicious, the dough is thin and light and good greasy (not bad greasy) and not at all dry and the flavors haven't disappointed yet, especially at $3.  The staff here are charming. They hover around all the counters all day long taking orders from every corner in a relaxed manner that is like a little pocket of calm in the bustle. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Ryad is a place that has one of the most prime real estate location for a kiosk in the food/restaurant area of MJT.  Right in the center at the east entrance by the stairs heading down to the parking.  You can't miss it!      My review is based on some of the rose flavoured lakoum (turkish delight) which I thought to be just okay.  My work friend brought me some back from Turkey and the real Mccoy was so much fresher and more amazing in flavour.  Here at Ryad it's passable but not amazing!    They do however have a wonderful selection of other Morrocan and middle Eastern pastries and also different stuffed pastry options.  I did not try these but I will come back and check them out."}
{"text":"Si vous raffolez des pâtisseries nord-africaines, riches en saveurs et bien sucrées, vous êtes à la bonne place!  Moi, j'adore leur thé à la menthe sucrée avec un soupçon de fleur d'oranger! Accompagnez votre thé d'une corne de gazelle, d'un baklava ou de loukoums. Allez ensuite vous asseoir sur un banc juste en face. Fermez les yeux: vous êtes au Maroc! Ah! une petite pause, dans la folie des courses au marché, ça fait du bien!"}
{"text":"My rating is based on the turkish delight alone. Which was OK. Better than most store bought, but still not a taste of turkey. Very nice variety of flavours. I'd recommend Ryad only if you have a craving, and not as a place for the best."}
{"text":"Really excellent authentic Moroccan pastries. This stall is located inside of the Marche Jean-Talon very close to the main entrance. The vendor was friendly and offered us some mint tea to go! We didn't try any of the savory snacks, however, the cookies were wonderful."}
