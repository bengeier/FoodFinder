{"text":"The takeout option is great and I appreciate their lunch specials very much. I've eaten here once before dining in and it was a pleasant lunch experience. But mostly I do their take out lunch specials. Good size portion plus appetizer and beverage water included all for one set price. And that's a good thing. Great bargain. Also there was a time when I bought takeout lunch and it was late in the afternoon when the restaurant wasn't busy. I asked them if I could eat my takeout lunch in the restaurant because I was sooooo hungry, and they let me do it, so I appreciate their understanding."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on a Saturday during lunch time.  The restaurant is spacious and the staff was attentive.  The food is okay.  Nothing to brag about.  It definitely isn't number 1.  It's mediocre at best.  If your in the area and are super hungry it will do the job."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and reasonably priced. We had the Masala Chicken, Cantonese Veg Chow Mein, Spicy Green Beans, Veg Pokara and Hakka Noodles. All were yum! This is going to be our new go to Hakka place. Cannot speak to the inhouse service as we did take-out but can say that the food was ready fairly quickly though the place was packed on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Hakka No. 1. Consistent service and quality at their locations. Straight forward hakka food, believe 140 menu items ( always wonder how the chef memorizes all the recipes ), good portions, and great pricing. Unlike most locations they have lunch specials on weekends as well.   I occasionally go to the Keele and Kingston Road location. Recently found out about Kennedy and Eglinton, I believe its new.   Really nice large space, good amount of seating for large groups. With large windows, bringing in plenty of natural light. Clean environment. Large TV's, which is nice. Went on a weekend afternoon, service was quick.   We ordered the chili chicken, bombay chicken, and mango chicken. Flavors were there, no issues with the food. My friends and I enjoyed it.   My only issue was the side condiments. I wouldn't say that the sriracha went bad or something, but just tasted a bit off and had a weird consistency. As a result we got a handful of chili sauce packets, staff were generous with that.I didn't inspect every sriracha holder, but honestly wouldn't bring the place down cause of this.   Would recommend for catering as well. Ordered a chili chicken tray for $45.00 cash. Fed 10 people, no issues."}
{"text":"Good lunch special which includes water and a spring roll for $6.50-7.50. I only ever had their chilli chicken, and I think it's just average. Good for the price though"}
{"text":"Food is decent for the price. Restaurant is next to Giant Tiger and their lunch specials are not bad. I ordered for pickup and food was ready within 10-15minutes."}
{"text":"Horrible! I don't wanna be that guy but I am going to here. Went there with my daughter for dinner the place was freezing the wait staff was super rude even to my daughter when she asked for a refill smh. So how was the food u ask? Nasty I love hakka and this food was a waste of money. We were at the Giant Tiger next door and had a small window for something to eat before my daughter had gymnastics. I live in the area and I would never go here again especially when u have waaaaaaaaaay better places in the area like Chung Moi or Spicy Dragon hell even Hakka Legend. This place is trash STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent but the workers are terrible. Came here before and enjoyed it but today my experience was so bad.   -2/10: complete shit service.  8/10: good quality food.   Just order take out so you don't need to deal with the utter incompetence of the workers."}
{"text":"The food presentation, and the food itself, !EXCELLENT! The workers were friendly, and the space/environment was very nice and clean! I'll be back with my family again for sure!"}
