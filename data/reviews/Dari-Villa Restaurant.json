{"text":"Maybe not for everyone, but if you love an old school Greasy Spoon diner, Dairy Villa is a hidden little gem. Get the Bacon cheeseburger, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Just garbage. Service sucked. Coffee sucked. Took over 45 mins just to get food and they were not busy. Simply a waste of time."}
{"text":"Never have I felt the need to write such a horrible review. But the actions displayed at this restaurant are not only unsanitary but have to be breaking some health code violations. My boyfriend and I just went there for lunch. He ordered a burger and I ordered a crispy chicken salad. The cook placed the uncooked patty on the grill with his bare hands. Then proceeded to cut up the whole chunk of lettuce with his bare hands. He picked up every ingredient without the use of gloves. He pulled out cheese, onions, cucumbers and placed them on the plate without any gloves. And in between cooking, he used his cell phone, then went back to touching and cooking the food!! We tried to ignore it, but our seats were right in front of the grill. We were absolutely repulsed and could not finish our meals. This should not be tolerated by a restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the quaintness of Bellevue and the Dairy Villa could be one of it's best assets. Unfortunately, the heavy set waitress was one of the worst wait staff I ever encountered. She was more playing on her cell phone than caring for customers. The ogre cook was also rude and actually got our orders wrong. The food was mediocre to say the least and $1.95 for a cup of ice with a tiny amount of beverage is beyond belief. Refills are free but good luck getting one."}
{"text":"Best diner in Bellevue/ Avalon. 
The service is quick and friendly, the atmosphere is old school diner, and the food is fresh and what you'd expect from your local diner. 
Today I had the dari-vila burger. It was delicious. 
I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food's not very good nor is the wait staff, but the regulars are hilarious.  Worth the cup of probably burnt coffee to sit at the counter and make some new friends.  You can smoke inside, so be aware that you will leave smelling like an ashtray."}
{"text":"You know that pile of bacon that gets left over on the grill when you're cooking breakfast? The greasy bits and pieces that haven't made their way down the grease trap after you scrape the grill? 
They're on your bacon cheeseburger."}
{"text":"OMG there is a time warp in this place; was served the worst pea soup ever!  I know it was canned and watered down too!  ugh!  Coffee is swill; waitresses are unprofessional and snooty; careful what you say on the stools.  Food is sub par and will not.... go in that place again.  Oh, They have specials listed on signboards, and when you ask for oops they just cooked the last one!  Ugh"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite places. Ate there 3 times this week. If you think the wait staff is rude, you have the skin of an Uber progressive. This is a blue collar, hit the flat top diner. Food is very good, no one disguises what it is, great simple old fashioned food. My side of coleslaw could have been an entree. No gluten free buns, no Trans fat free fry oil. Just fresh yummy goodness. Clean, friendly, awesomeness! If you don't like it, there WAS a vegan restaurant in Robinson."}
{"text":"The idea is great. Fresh food, comfortable and reasonably priced. Service was really good and fast.  Downside small portion sizes. I don't need a huge plate of food, but I hate to pay full price for a full breakfast and leave sill hungry."}
{"text":"Three words: Bacon. Cheeseburger. Omelette.  

From the outside Dari-Villa seems to fit right in on Lincoln Avenue in Bellevue.  And when you go inside it's a cozy little place that's very welcoming.  I was a little disappointed at first because I took a look at their menu online and saw \"fresh donuts\" and was very excited to try what I assumed were their homemade donuts.  But alas, they were no longer on the menu when I got there.  I then attempted to order a grilled pecan roll only to be told they did not have any.  Sigh.  

What are right are the prices.  Everything is cheap and for a good hearty breakfast and coffee you can get away spending under $10.  I decided on the aforementioned bacon cheeseburger omelette and was not disappointed.  The ratio of bacon to meat to cheese inside the eggs was just right.  I would suggest ordering toast dry with butter on the side, though, because my toast was drenched in butter.  I also ordered the biscuits and gravy, just to give it a try and share with friends.  I ate it after my omelette and by the time I did the gravy was cold.  It was still okay.

There were some pros and cons, as reflected in my 3-star rating.  But overall I feel there are more pros than cons.  The bottom line is I think it's a great value and I'll probably go back.  They are also featured on www.restaurant.com.  I had one of the gift certificates that was good for $10 when you spent $20 - a total I never would have been able to reach had I been by myself or just with one other person."}
{"text":"Very nice place and the food is excellent. The hot sausage is very good and I love the potatoes pancakes are good."}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time for lunch (after leaving that place  3 doors down  - 561 grille, because of lousy service - I was NEVER waited on) - great food, great service and Oh , their sandwiches/hoagies are served on mancini's bread (can't get better than that).    I have lived in the Bellevue/West View area for 14 years and I am not sure why I never came here before. I will definitely be back !!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in and the server wasn't pleasant. The atmosphere was cold. We left and went to Joes Rusty Nail. Much better option!"}
{"text":"Friendly and classic diner. The generous portions and lack of pretension are refreshing. The hand-formed hot Italian sausage patties are sublime. Worth a drive to Bellevue if you're not from the North Side."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. They were still serving breakfast but I was in the mood for a salad. I got the grilled chicken which came with fries and provolone on a bed of iceburg lettuce, shredded carrots, sliced onions and tomatoes. The ranch dressing was THE BOMB! It was completely homemade and the perfect consistency: runny but not watery. It was only $9 and a generous portion (was too hungry and forgot to take a pic). My friend had an omelette and it looked so good so I'll definitely be back to try one!"}
{"text":"I try to stop by the Dari-Villa for lunch whenever I pass through Bellevue. It's become one of my favorite places to get something to eat. The prices are incredibly reasonable and the food is fresh and excellent quality. They have daily specials and decent soups in addition to the menu.

I could imagine there being a potential wait to get your meal if the restaurant is packed, but I've never waited longer than a few minutes for a plate the dozen or so times I've stopped in. Quick service and good quality diner grub.

Only downfall would be it's cash only and not many people carry cash these days. There's an ATM in the restaurant or you could walk two blocks in either direction to get to every bank that's on Lincoln Ave.

This place is definitely worth stopping at if you haven't already. The prices alone are enough to stop in, but it's actually pretty good too."}
{"text":"Terrific little Diner on Lincoln Avenue.  Classic menu of traditional selections.  Breakfast and lunch.  Try the Homefries!"}
{"text":"Note #1: CASH ONLY. However, they do have an ATM inside and will give you $1 off your meal if you use it. 

Note #2: They have a Facebook page...

For 34 years, this old-fashioned diner has stood in Bellevue, the home of comics artist Ron Frenz, the man who designed Spider-Man's black costume...

Betcha didn't know that. Geekiness aside, I had no idea this joint existed until I used some Google-fu in the hopes of finding some brunch this beautiful fall morn.

And find good, good grub we did. 

When you walk in, you'll find that time is motionless here. Stools that resemble upright dumbbells line a counter over which cooks labor lovingly over a steaming, sizzling griddle. Weathered booths have coat hangers sticking out from behind them. The help are all middle-aged and beyond. You feel as if you've known them for most of your life even though you've never seen them before. 

We arrived shortly after 11AM, and because of this, I almost ordered breakfast, but my readers know that I can't resist a burger challenge when I come across one. 

Along comes the D-V Burger, a behemoth with the combined DNA of 5 McDonald's Big Macs and 10 Eat 'N Park Superburgers. It is triple-deckered and quadruple the flavor and texture of any fast food burger. Veggies (lettuce, tomato, onion, and coins of dill pickle) and a \"secret sauce\" inhabit the first floor. Bread and smashed, blackened, flattop patties of protein rule the rest of this tower. The bun's brown crust is a throwback; its cushiony freshness an inspiration as the dressing remains an exquisite mystery. Upon first gaze, the burger itself was already catapulted into my Hall Of Fame. 20 minutes later, the burger was in my stomach, its soul rising to Diner Valhalla.

The side order of fries were commendably, flawlessly golden and crisp. 

The form of my dessert destructor came from a waffle iron. 

Enter: The Waffle Supreme. Massive, brown, fluffy, imposing to behold, and resembling the topographical image of a circular labyrinth, the waffle is topped with golden vanilla ice cream, strawberry sauce, and whipped cream. 

Having it for breakfast would be oh so inappropriate yet oh so delectably decadent. 

With two monsters slain, I paid my tab, tipped our waitress well, and headed back to Brookline with Kay behind the wheel. Today was a great Sunday to die.

P.S. Kay's corned beef hash was nice 'n crispy. Her biscuits and gravy were homemade heaven."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful lunch with my family. I had a Ruben with onion rings and they had burgers and fries. Every thing was pretty darn good, just the siltiest bit greasy but sometimes that is the best way to eat. 

Service was friendly and prompt.   The atmosphere was charming. The open kitchen was clean and organized. The photos on the wall and engaging and beautiful.  

The price was just right."}
{"text":"I've lived in Bellevue now for five years, and have tried most of the offerings the main street has that appealed to me. Most of them were either disappointing in food quality or price point, or after learning of their political leanings, I won't return. But somehow I totally missed the two 'diners' on the strip...until today. And holy moly...how did I miss THIS for so long?

From the outside, it looks like nothing. It doesn't even look big enough to be a restaurant, but those looks are totally deceiving. Once stepped inside, I was totally enamored by a true old-world style...DINER! Even walking up to the table to sit down, my heart skipped a beat...at each booth a coat rack. That includes space for...MY HAT! I didn't need to clear the salt and pepper shakers for a place to sit my hat. Smitten.

The decor was simple. Old photos of Pittsburgh from the early 1900's, and little shelves on the wall with old fashioned food containers, mixers, etc. Perfect kitsch for an old diner. One long counter with the grill behind it, old diner dishes with the brown lines around the rim and those brown heavy ceramic coffee cups. 

The menu was standard diner fare, with a few other touches, and they had both a breakfast and lunch menu. The prices are standard what-diner-prices-are-supposed-to-be fare, or more accurately, FAIR. 

We were there for lunch, and scanned through the menu and I initially eyeballed the Reuben. The fish looked good too, those it was served on a hamburger bun (I will never get why, in the land of 'hoagies', so many fish get served on a hamburger bun, with two three inch sections of fish hanging out either end of the bun), and the DV burger looked good too.

When the waitress came to take our order I asked \"The Reuben?\" and I held my index finger and thumb one inch apart and then three inches apart. She got it, and showed me about an inch and a half. So, the burger it would be, and it ended up for both of us. Mine with slaw, and his with onion rings. She got our coffee and water, and put in our order.

When I lived in Miami, I LOVED diner burgers. There, since diners were the last remnant of American food, ALL of it was home cooked food. After to returning to Pittsburgh I found that many of my real old go-to diners were either gone, or were serving up frozen crap from the back of the Sysco truck. I had no idea what I was going to get.

After we sat and chatted a few minutes, my better half grew wide eyed and said \"They just took an ice cream scoop of ground beef and put it on the grill and flattened it down!\" WOW, we were getting burgers...not frozen gray hockey pucks...but real ground beef! 

After a short wait, the food arrived. A beautiful double decker cheese burger with lettuce and pickles. A MOUND of cole slaw, and a MOUND of onion rings. They also brought my usual request of a side of mayo and dark mustard (most diner dives only have the day-glo yellow ball park nonsense). I did think that the bun was a little skimpy for these beautiful burgers...they got soggy from the juices and fell apart very easily. BUT, that being said...if I have to get up and go to the restroom to wash my hands after eating a burger...then you are doing something RIGHT! Frozen hockey puck burgers don't create juices. My hands were totally slimed in a delightful way.

Now I've seen other reviews whining about sanitation and bad service. Frankly, I experienced neither. The server was very mon-and-pop diner appropriate, the rest of the staff was totally presentable and respectable, and there was absolutely nothing 'unclean' from what we experienced.

For $20 we had two double decker REAL burgers, a ton of slaw, a generous pile of onion rings and two coffees. TOTALLY diner-reasonable and appropriate.

I am just so sorry that it took me this long to FIND it and try it!

Thanks Dari Villa...for giving me a great meal...and a place to hang my HAT!"}
{"text":"This place has the homey feeling of a 50's style diner without the tacky getup.  Not that it's not tacky (it is), it's just that it's not pretending to be anything other than what it is. The wait staff are incredibly attentive and genuine, and the breakfast deals aren't bad. So if you don't care much about taste and you just want to hang out and listen to the locals banter over yesterday's sports and neighborhood happenings while sipping a coffee and reading the newspaper, this is the place for you."}
