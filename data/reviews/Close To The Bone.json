{"text":"Five star bacon!  Less salty, more chunky, fries up super crispy and has great flavor."}
{"text":"Best tasting meat ever! 
Had purchase the sausages! ... head cheese, ground beef, goose liver... also salad dressing, spices......
Lamb Burger just popped into my mind, with rosemary, available in a sausage or burger. Ask for it!
...  your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"I love supporting local business, so it is nice to have such a great shop in the neighborhood to spend my money at!

Whisky and fennel sausages take the prize- wow! 

Fresh cuts of meat, lots of organic choices, great service."}
{"text":"The best, most succulent and tender beef tenderloin we've ever had; fabulous hot sausages made by an elderly Italian butcher; excellent meat loaf made by the owners- everything is good! Mary and Daryl are also very knowledgeable and friendly. At their suggestion, we tried rabbit - fabulous!"}
{"text":"What more can you ask for than a quality, friendly butcher right in your own neighborhood?

Close to the Bone, and the owners Mary and Daryl are just that.

They have awesome meat, cut to order and serve it with a smile.

Excellent homemade sausages in some pretty cool flavors as well as spectacular burgers!!

Seriously, my mouth is watering now."}
{"text":"Mary and Daryl are amazing. Super friendly and knowledgable. Perfect place to get local organic meats."}
{"text":"Wonderful butcher shop. Owners are awesome people -- friendly, helpful and always willing to share tips. They genuinely care about their customers and their neighbourhood. Products are top-notch quality. Sausages are great! Chicken is yummy -- best soups and gravies! Steaks and roasts are wonderful.  Much tastier than grocery store meat and we can trust in the quality."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice friendly neighborhood butcher...well, this is the place. Weather was nice so I thought I'd break out the bbq. The owner recommend the pork belly and gave me some instructions as to how he would bbq it. Although it didn't turn out as well as I hoped (my kids still loved it) I was impressed with the friendliness of this establishment. Cost is even less than my local korean grocery and much closer and quality much better. Can't wait for summer to try out some more meat! !!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to say except that I highly recommend this little place when you are in the need of any fresh meat.  Great delis and sausages.  Super friendly and helpful owners!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  I wish this place was in my neighbourhood.

Was having breakfast in the area and decided to pop in to check out the selection. The shop is small, but they have a great assortment of very fresh looking sausages (including gluten free ones), meat and poultry and none of the pretentiousness I've noticed at some other specialty butcher shops in the city.   

The owners were super friendly and very knowledgeable about their products. Was eyeing up some fine looking pork belly, but ended up grabbing the last of the beef short ribs, cut English style (the way I prefer them though sometimes harder to come by). They gave us an awesome (and unexpected) discount for buying the last of the lot.

Though it's a bit out of the way for me, I'll definitely be forcing myself into the car in the future to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Wow. We are Cumbrae and Royal Beef fans, and these guys blow them out of the water!  Chicken that tastes like chicken. Never knew most chicken is bleached in Canada. Now I know better!"}
{"text":"Great local butcher. My only real complaint is that they do not carry Canadian bacon. They do have pretty decent homemade sausages in different flavours, and different cuts of meat. Prices are definitely higher than the grocery store but it's higher quality meat and some cuts that are not even carried at the grocery store."}
