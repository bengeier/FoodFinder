{"text":"I ate at YC's Mongolian BBQ 20 years ago and today I went to Blazin Mongolian BBQ and the food was even better than I remember it being. The service was excellent and the place was neat and clean. I met the owner and he was very polite and friendly. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's what you would expect from a Mongolian grill. In my perspective nothing that stood out. It's nice that you can do all you can eat if you have a big appetite. Drinks, rice, soup is included with your plate."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, friendly staff. If you don't enjoy your meal you've done it wrong. This is one of those places that you choose the outcome. Love the options of ingredients and haven't made a bad meal yet. Highly recommend for a quick business lunch when you need to get in and out and enjoy the meal that you create yourself."}
{"text":"This place was very good. The new owner was accommodating to us \"newbys\"  .  Clean and perfect for our late lunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Best Mongolian BBQ in town. We drive here from the NW valley just to eat here once a week!!"}
{"text":"First time ever here. I am so upset I haven't tried this sooner! The price is great. The staff was friendly. The place is clean. I will become a regular for sure !"}
{"text":"The best Mongolian BBQ place in town.  Used to be YCs.  New items on the line like snow peas and kale, New tasty sauces like Blazin Thai and great service from the entire staff.  There are also two choices for soup - chicken veggie every day and hot and sour or egg drop.  They also have a mix your own drinks Coke machine.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was not bad. Not that great either. Nothing really to write home about. The owner is obviously cheap as he charges for everything, including a take out box for left overs. Sauces could be better. Dinner companion missed the cooking wine sauce they used to have. It's ridiculous to charge $0.50 for a take out box, especially when they cost maybe $0.15 to purchase. 
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Diet Coke is now working flawlessly :)  The quality hasn't changed since the new owners took over.  Only 1 request... more recipes for the sauces."}
{"text":"Great service, great tasting fresh food, and a great variety of sauces! I cannot believe that I've lived so close to this gem for the past year, and just barely discovered it. I cannot tell you all how important it is to give this place a try! The egg rolls are just - OMG!! Everything from the greeting at the door, to the \"farewell\" upon leaving was just great! You get your choice of rice (fried rice was so flavorful) and a beverage with your order. We ordered take out, but will definitely be dining in with these pleasant folks next time."}
{"text":"Great place for Mongolian BBQ, you can pack your bowl with whatever you want from an assortment of fresh veggies and frozen strips of meat. There are a bunch of different sauces and toppings you can add before and after they cook it for you! Nice and fresh! Reasonably priced. Get the regular bowl, pack it down, and pay fifty cents for a to go box. You can get two meals out of it! Yummy!"}
{"text":"First time at a legit Mongolian BBQ spot. The service was great, employees were friendly. Restaurant is kept clean, complementary wifi...

All you can eat for $12.75, pretty good pricing in my opinion. The food was great."}
{"text":"Our family loves coming here. They are very accommodating for celiac and gluten free needs. It's always kept clean and have great improvements happening every time we go in."}
{"text":"Everything you need and dim sum haha. Unlimited for $12 which includes unlimited fried rice and soup. The rice and soup are just edible meh, stir fry is decent. Every sauce and condiment you would need. Would go back."}
{"text":"Yay!  We had a great time. My incredibly picky eater is now a huge fan of this kind of food. Delicious, fresh, affordable."}
{"text":"We were shooting a commercial for Blazin Mongolian BBQ and they were nice enough to feed us for the commercial, the food was really good. There is a nice selection of meats if you like. I'm a vegetarian so I went for the vegetable section; they also have three different kinds of noodles that you can add to your dish. There's a variety of sauces including mongolian, house sauce, garlic sauce, and many others. They also have a selection of soups white rice and fried rice      and for dessert there is soft serve chocolate and vanilla ice cream!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Tons of food for the price. Definitely worth it. Similar to YC's but closer. Definitely going to eat here again and again."}
{"text":"Good food for a decent price. Meats and veggies were very fresh and the restaurant seemed cleaned and well maintained. I would have rated this place with 5 stars but the only downfall I would like to see changed is being charged for the to-go containers. There is a lot of food and it's almost a sure thing to have leftovers. Since I already paid for my food, why should I have to pay to take it home with me."}
{"text":"This by far is one of my favorite spots in ALL of Phoenix!

If you have not come here yet, you will not be disappointed.

I no longer eat meat and so I get the all you can veggie bowl.

Every bowl comes with a side of rice, soup or chips, free refills on drinks and a bowl of ice cream"}
{"text":"I normally drink iced tea with my meals and I carry Truvia and Splenda in my purse because I like Truvia and my husband likes Splenda. Today, while eating here the owner, Ed, walked by and noticed my personal packet of the sweeteners and let us know that he has Stevia, Splenda and Sweet & Low near the beverage machines. He said that he noticed quite a few people were bringing in their own so he decided to supply it for his customers.
   Now that is an observant and caring business owner! We love the changes he has made to the restaurant and the food since buying the place . Oh, and we were surprised to see 4 different colors of sliced carrots w/varying flavors available! It's little things like that that make Blazin Mongolian BBQ stand out and keep us coming back for more and more and more.....!"}
{"text":"I came into town for a dance competition and this place was friendly and it has great food!!!"}
{"text":"Very limited stuff for a Mongolian place.. n they charge for everything as extra. Even for eggs ?"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, very clean; the food is fresh and yummy and the owners ate very friendly and hard workers... I highly recommend this places"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to eat after working last Saturday at the office.  So checked out Yelp & came across this place...so there I go!

I was greeted by the New Owner who rang me up.... this whole set up was kind of confusing to me & I told him it was my 1st time.  He graciously showed me the ropes and down the line I go stacking as much I could get in the bowl.  

Then off to the cooking station which was really fast!  Yum it was delicious.  I told the owner I guess I couldn't complain about the good as I designed it.... 

Told him I would definitely be back with some of my office mates.  Guess where we went on Monday!  5 of us going down the line & I was teaching them the ropes!

The owner wasn't there that day... but there will be other times!  Good Luck Mr. Owner on your new business & see ya again soon!  

The Aflac Gal"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and loved it. It's very similar to YC's (if you have ever been there). Place was very clean and the meats and vegetables were fresh and well laid out. The grill master cooked our bowls to perfection and the owner was extremely nice. We will certainly be back and we are very happy we found a place that is closer to our house."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. You can make it taste however you want. Try the Thai Sauce. It's pretty spicy, but really good! The custard is a perfect ending. It's a place you need to visit more than just once."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for a little over 18 years the past owners we're always very friendly prices were always good went there today because I was craving it and the prices are insane almost $13 a bowl the gentleman at the register was the owner I asked him and he said because minimum wage went up his prices went up and they'll go up again next year way too pricey for the area it seems like portion sizes or smaller the new owner was rude after I had question why the prices had come up so much when I had been a frequent customer he began to slam things around very unprofessional will not get my business ever again good luck"}
{"text":"Under the new owner this place is fantastic! It's nice and clean, staff is friendly, selection is good and the food is excellent.  I see where people are complaining about price, I felt price was reasonable for what you get and unlike most Mongolian BBQ places they give you plenty of options depending on how hungry you are.  You can get small bowl, large bowl or unlimited bowl.  They even have vegetable only options.  Owner stopped by and talked to us, very friendly.  This is a real drive for us from Buckeye but will stop here anytime we are in the metro center area. Five Stars!!!"}
{"text":"One of our Staples! We go here probably once a week because it is affordable, fresh, quiet and so good. Awesome selection of meats and sauces and tons of veggies. Boyfriend's on keto so he can get his fill on a $15 unlimited bowl and I can eat whatever I want. Love the soups and eggrolls. Not a perfect or fancy place but great experience for food at avoid price!"}
{"text":"The Blazin Mongolian BBQ is a sort of casual Stir Fry Buffet located in a half empty strip mall that is around the nearly deserted Metro Center Mall. You order and pay at the entrance and have several choices of stir fry bowls including an all-you-can-eat option bowl called the \"Warrior.\" They offer several meat options and all the meats are sliced razor thin into wide frozen rolls that have to be squished down so you have room for food in your bowl. Then you help yourself and make your vegetable, noodle and sauce selection options. The Mongolian Grill master then cooks up your food and you have a few add on options to finish your bowl. Extras are available like white and fried rice, soup, fried noodles, beverages and self serve ice creams are included. 

My bowl came out very tasty. I picked dark meat chicken, vegetables and noodles for my bowl. The chicken in my dish almost dissolved because the chicken was so thin but my bowl still did actually taste good and was spicy too. I liked that my vegetables were tender crisp and not boiled like from some other Mongolian Grills. My husband picked the Warrior all you can eat with beef. The beef stayed more noticeable in the dish. He picked a different formula of sauces and his dish also came out tasty. 

If you need a good amount of protein you really have to go with the warrior option because the way the meat is sliced it's hard to get a lunch size portion.

I found people watching very entertaining here. Some people are very masterful at piling bowls up sky high and squishing the bowls tight solid with food and then they reach the grill master with a mountain of food. You just have to visit to see the rest that I saw.......

In the end the food did taste good and all the food I tried seemed fresh. I had a much better experience here than from other Mongolian Grills. I thought it was a good value."}
{"text":"Always fantastic! May seem a bit pricey, but efficiency has improved with the new owner. I've been a customer for at least 10 years since I work nearby. I go a few times a month. If you have never been to a Mongolian BBQ you should try it, and this is one of two or three in Maricopa county that I know of. If it's your first time, be sure to ask the cashier (who always seems to be the new owner) to show you the ropes. I love buffets so I can pick exactly what and how much I want. That's basically how it works. I always head to the frozen yogurt machine for dessert - it's included in the price !!"}
{"text":"This place will do in a pinch

I have to admit I am not a huge fan Mongolian BBQ's. However, I do appreciate that you can select your own ingredients and spice it up just the way you want it ehen creating your own bowl.

The prices are extremely reasonable.  The variety of potential ingredients and sauces was large and everything appeared to be fresh. The rice and soup station were replenished often.  Overall our visit was a good experience and would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is great! They were very accommodating when they found out that I was a vegetarian, making sure that I knew what sauces I could eat. They even offered to clean the grill, which has never happened at any of the similar places I've been to. Everyone who was with me also enjoyed their meaty meals. All in all, it was a great experience! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The staff is very welcoming. They were very patient explaining to my older mother how Mongolian BBQ works. The selection was very fresh with all the vegetables you would expect.  The sauce selection was good. The food was cooked to perfection. We will eat there again."}
{"text":"Ed & Susana - you & your entire catering crew TOTALLY ROCKED at our reception party last night!! Delicious food, excellent service, super accommodating and fun attitudes throughout!! Absolutely THE BEST decision of the whole event to have you cater! \"Thank You\" doesn't begin to cover it!  Best Reception Ever!!!"}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my Mongolian restaurants. I'm very impressed with the service here. The owner was great and checked up on me about how I liked it. The place is very nice cleaned and they are very well presented. 
I had no idea about this place until you pay close attention, so many other restaurants around you can easily miss. It's definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Finally!!! A Mongolian styled grill in Phoenix that actually tastes sensational. Healthy, fast, and reasonably priced - I can't think of one good reason why you shouldn't come and nom your face off here. 

The restaurant is clean with a fantastic selection of ingredients, the staff are friendly, and the owner was quick to find out what our past Mongolian grill experiences have been, reassuring us we would enjoy his restaurant and food. We did. 

We'll be back with friends and family. Gotta get the word out. So dang good!!!"}
{"text":"For the most part, if you've been to one Mongolian grill you've been to them all - but there are a few little things that separate this one from the pack.  The ingredient selection was nice and service was quick... they have one of those fancy beverage stations that allow you to create thousands of flavor combinations and the floors / bathrooms were clean which is something in this area.  We needed a place for our team to eat before going to Castles n' Coasters for our team builder and this place ended up being perfect.  If I'm ever in this area again needing a lunch I'll totally come back!"}
{"text":"No to go boxes, for someone who does not ever eat all their food in one sitting this is just ridiculous. My food was spicy despite me putting nothing spicy on it. My food was cooked after my husband's which his was spicy. You should clean the grill between orders. The people were not rude but were not welcoming or host like at all. Will never return. On another note, the restroom was clean!

**update** The Owner reached out and as i previously stated there was nothing wrong with the service of the employees, other than if you are going to do a customer service job you should focus more on your customers. I am a supervisor for customer service that is owned by  a multi billion dollar drug company and I would fire my employees if they did not try to connect with people, greet them, offer any assistance graciously and most of all make sure there is nothing more that the customer needs prior to ending their experience with the company.  Your sign needs to be updated if you charge for a box as it clearly states \"no to go boxes\". Suggestion: create a policy where a customer  would have to show their receipt to purchase a to go box, to ensure they did in fact purchase one of the bowl sizes. As for my food I understand that your employees \" have no problem cleaning the grill\" it should be standard practice it does not take very long to throw water and a grill rag on there to wash away the last person's meal. A customer should not have to address this concern as i remember seeing a sign requesting if a person has food allergies to let the staff know, if it is standard practice to clean the grill after every order you would not run the risk of a person having an allergic reaction and your any added liability would cease to exist. I am not interested in returning as once I have a perception of a person, place or thing any follow up experience would be tainted and would be unfair to try as I would not want to add negativity towards your restaurant. I have added an additional star as you have graciously reached out to me. I hope feedback helps you improve your customer interactions and make your business more successful."}
{"text":"I have always loved Mongolian BBQ. I can pick my own ingredients and spice it up just the way I want it. Unfortunately there is no such venue where we currently live. Although one will open up soon. So when we were visiting dear friends in the PHX area, I searched Yelp and found this. So we gave it a try. Since the prices are super cheap, I chose the all you can eat option. Just in case I would not like my concoction, so I could try again. I ended up not needing to do this. Despite the sign: one bowl only, I took two, the second as an instrument to squish down especially the meat since it is frozen and rolled. The variety of potential ingredients was large and everything looked fresh. The result tasted really good.

The reason I did not give this place 5 stars: the ambiance could be a lot nicer. Maybe some kitschy Asian decor or some nice tables and chairs. It felt more like eating at a McD's. The rice and soup station had not been replenished and I got the dregs of the fried rice. Also no beer or wine. But overall is was very happy and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I didn't ask before adding sauce to my bowl but learned it had fish sauce in it before I ate it. I'm allergic to fish! They let me get a brand new bowl at no additional cost. I'm thankful for missing that close call and for the excellent service I received."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots. New owner has definitely spiced things up and given the place a few improvements. The inside is very spacious and has enough room to eat comfortably. There is a great variety of meats and vegetable ingredients to choose from that are absolutely complimented with their sauces. The soups they offer are alright, I find them to be a bit too salty for my liking. The fried rice is a bit bland, and something I rarely indulge. Regardless, their main item is so good and so filling that I'm never left in disappointment, so I give those items a pass. Great food for a great price!

Edit: They've upgraded their rice and soup options, and they are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mongolian places I've been in Phoenix. You can either get a single bowl that comes with a drink + ice cream or an unlimited bowl with the same. Only about $3 difference in price. You build your own noodles with the meat, veggies & sauce. Then they cook it on the wok right in front of you & you can get rice with it as well included. And the staff are friendly & helpful with any questions you may have if you've never tried a Mongolian bbq place. Sooooo delicious!"}
{"text":"This custom stir fry restaurant is beyond amazing! It is mine and my sweethearts second time here in less than a week. The prices are very very reasonable with the app you can eat warrior bowl being the most pricey at only $14.00. The meat and veggies are fresh and fried up right in front of in less than 2 minutes!! Each bowl also comes with unlimited rice, soup and ice cream! Will be coming back many many times!!"}
{"text":"I'm a bad Yelper today. Hunger got the best of me and I didn't take pics. Next time I promise. New ownership, inside facelift, menu tweaking, new awesome Coke Freestyle machine. Great prices for small and large bowls alike. Chicken, beef, dark and white meat chicken and pork. A huge veggie selection. Yellow, red and green peppers, water chestnuts, onion, baby corn, noodles. Just to mention a few. Great selection of sauces and spices. If your new to this, go with the directions on the sign for sauce creations. Very tasty, highly recommend."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back. 

For about $12, you get all-you-can-eat access to the buffet of ingredients to make your bowl. There is a selection of steak, chicken, pork, and tofu for proteins and a huge variety of very fresh veggies and noodles. 

While the grill master is cooking your food, you help yourself to rice and soup (both of which were very tasty). 

The meal also comes with a drink and there is ice cream for dessert if you save any room...

Great value, great food, and just a very enjoyable place to have a meal."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious. I love the freebies that come with the meal. And it was pretty clean inside so thats always a plus."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of fresh veggies, proteins, and noodles for an excellent price. Finally a discount for a buffet where you choose not to have meat. This used to be AJ's Mongolian BBQ and is mostly the same with some improvements. Now the drink is included and there's an all you can eat option for an extra fee. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my first time back in several years. Ed, the new owner, dish washer, cashier, and head of the sales department was there. He certainly made the visit.  He took the time to explain the improvements he has made .  The food was fresh and sauces are great .  I especially like the fact that a lot of the vegetables are cut bite size which makes the meal more manageable during consumption. Thanks Ed!!"}
{"text":"My family has been visiting this restaurant for almost 20 years, through all of the management changes and little differences that come with each new company.  Blazin has really made this place special again! I like how they include the drink, rice, soup and ice cream in the price. The ingredients seem more fresh and of better quality than before. I love the new sauce choices! This is quickly becoming my new place to eat (again!). Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I live close by this joint (can walk here) as I did this evening. And once again, they didn't let me down. This restaurant is consistently fresh & Delicious!!! Although if you don't know what sauces and how much to put on your bowl...it could lack in flavor or visa versa. My suggestion is the MORE the BETTER, because the grill cooks off any wateriness in the sauce.

Anyway give it a try. You'll get better with practice. 

*My advice: put lots of the garlic & ginger sauces, maybe a spoonful (or two or even three!) of either the Blazin Mongolian sauce or the House sauce or even the Spicy Thai.
Either way you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've been going here for YEARS ever since it was YCs. I love this place. It brings back great memories. Don't come here for the ambiance come for the food. Also the chicken soup is to DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"Good spot with friendly service, good prices, and some unique perks (soft-serve!). My only feedback would be to serve the food on large plates instead of bowls. In bowls all of the sauces sit at the bottom of the bowl and the food in the top half is bland. If it was all served on plates the sauces are more equally distributed and the meal would be more flavorful."}
{"text":"This Mongolian bbq was really good. They had a good choice of meat and vegetables for your bowl and they cooked it really fast. The only thing I didn't like was their sweet and spicy soup, it had a weird taste. My husband didn't like it either. Other than that, the bbq was just the way I like it and they had good unsweetened tea :)"}
{"text":"Ever since this placed open, ive been going atleast once a week. I love the food here! The people who run the place are super friendly and the workers there are also really nice. Great place for eating, HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING."}
{"text":"Very good mongolian bbq. Flavorful sauces. Lots of ingredient variety. Frozen beef, pork, light and dark meat chicken. Only wish they had pineapple on the line. They also have fried rice, soup & wontons, a freestyle soda fountain and military discounts."}
{"text":"All you can eat $12.75 drinks and ice cream included. Not luxurious but certainly practical. Rust time here and will come back! Great price and food was wonderful"}
{"text":"Love this place fast, delicious, and priced just right. Worth every penny! So delicious and great service. The meat and vegetables are fresh and correctly proportioned.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. I like that they have all the right stuff, and not too many things so you don't know what you want to put in your bowl. And that the only portion control is that of the size of the bowl. If you want to put in a lot of something you can put it on in there. If you don't want something, you don't have to have it in there don't have to ask to put it on the side. Once you get good at it, you get a perfect meal every time!"}
{"text":"This place is so great!  I love how I can get a fresh, delicious bowl of noodles, veggies and oodles of meat (or tofu or whatever).  I love the new sauces!"}
{"text":"The food was great. All fresh and tons of choices for everything. I was just confused when it was my first time there and we paid before we had our meal, and the staff was rude when explaining it to me. But the meal was great!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Lots of veggie options. SOS, Vegetarian & Vegan friendly. Bike rack out front. Free wifi. Pokémon pokestop."}
{"text":"Quick, healthy, and comfortable! The owners have high standards for the quality and freshness of their food. They make all their sauces in house and work to find the best ingredients. They make the soups in house as well and vary what's offered. 

They also happen to just be great people. You can tell they care about their employees (during the holidays they had a tree with all their employee names on it). They are not only serving great food, but they're a great business to have in the community."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I've been going to this place (now on at least the third owner) off and on for the better part of the last decade, so I've seen more or less the full spectrum. With that in mind, you can imagine that I was elated to see they'd opened up again, after the previous iteration folded some months back. Mongolian BBQ places are one of those things where you don't always have the craving, but when you do, there's really no substitute that will fill the void and you've just gotta have it. 

That said, tonight we decided to give in to withdrawal cravings and the wife and I made the drive down to try out the latest incarnation of an old favorite. First things first, from the outside at least, there's virtually no change. I don't even think they've (perhaps I should say 'yet') changed the signage at all on the building. I suppose big fat letters that say \"Mongolian BBQ\" leave little to the imagination so perhaps it doesn't need to change, and it at least gave me some hope that what I would find inside still echoed part of what I liked about the last incarnation.

To put it lightly, I was not disappointed. Yes, there's a fancy new menu board above the cash register, as opposed to paper signage, and yes, they have a fancy new Square terminal rather than yesteryear's point of sale system, along with hand sanitizer dispensers in at least three places, but the heart and soul is still there. You still have ye old buffet line, trays, then bowls, then meats, followed by all the usual add on suspects as well as a few new additions, followed by the noodles (again, old favorites and new choices here). So far so good, this was pretty much the same place I remembered and I was happy to see that while changes were made, it was much of the same at its core. 

As far as difference, one thing that stands out as being notably absent is the mural along the back wall and some of the tackier wall art. The mural was cool, but to be fair, I think I like it better with a clean slate, now that I've seen it. Also, to borrow a phrase I've become fond of, there is a significant increase in the hipster quotient at this place vs. its previous incarnations. I am not speaking of the staff so much as the patrons. Never in all my years visiting have I seen so many douches with snow caps and jackets on indoors, sporting the now ubiquitous millennial beard, skinny jeans and wide rimmed glasses. For some reason, most of them were staring at everyone else coming in too, and watching the rest of us put our bowls together. Based on the tofu content they had going on, I'm hoping they were judging us for our omnivorous ways and not undressing us with their eyes, but who can say anymore? I'll leave that one up to the imagination of the reader, but if the hipster scene turns you off, consider yourself warned.

A couple interesting things to note, which you encounter once the food is cooked up, would be that they've added a new array of soups to the lineup, apparently alternating daily. I was never a huge soup fan, but this time my wife and I tried both the chicken and the spicy soup. Both were good, and I'd likely get them both again in the future, but no real preference between them. If you like spicy soup that packs a punch, you may be disappointed, but flavor wise it was pretty good. I'm not a spicy food person, so I was actually happy that it had very little punch. Additionally, the drink station that follows has been completely redone. There's a new, massive, touch screen operated soda machine now. Yes, that's right, touch screen, so you are by now probably starting to appreciate the copious amounts of hand sanitizer available in this place. It's not too awkward to figure out how to use the machine, and you have some pretty cool choices (Coke with orange? That's a first for me, but it was good!). 

Last but not least, as a few have noted, yes, the prices have gone up markedly from the prior incarnation of this place. By markedly I mean several dollars, and given that it was under $10 before, though it is little in absolute terms, relatively speaking, it's a notable increase. Yes, drinks are included as part of that, but at the end of the day, the same two people ordering the same two large bowls and same two drinks they always had are paying closer to $30 than $20 like they used to, including the tip and taxes in both instances. On a personal note, I couldn't care less about the cost, because it's a drop in the bucket for most of us and, seriously, if you can't afford to drop extra first full of dollars, you shouldn't be eating out in the first place. That said, to those who to whom it matters, yeah, it'll cost you more if you want to relive last year's Mongolian experience, but for me, it was totally worth it. I would gladly pay a premium to have this place back in the rotation, especially given that they've made some pretty decent improvements. 

Would I go back? Absolutely. Thrilled to have an old favorite back!"}
{"text":"Don't eat for the entire day, then go here and get the all you can eat goodness for under 15 bucks. Place is at least as good as yc's, I would eat here more often if it was closer. Got a beef bowl, then a pork bowl. So  very good! The soup was luke warm and the drink machine was gross and tasted liked all the sodas were mixed together. I would ditch the modern drink machine and get one of the classic ones. Overall the fresh cooked bbq is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"They changed ownership again, this would be the fourth if I'm correct. They added new sauces which I really like, white meat chicken, no turkey however, they raised the price from $9:01 to $12.22 and try to justify it by including the drinks but I only drink water with my food, it's the healthy way and I put a very small amount of meat if any since I am a plant based eater. I guess they don't cater to healthy eating. So I unless they change their fee structure, adios amigos, sayonara, arrivederci, au revoir!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum! I didn't want to stop eating it was so good. The House Sauce was delicious. I got the small bowl and I had lots of leftovers. I can imagine the big bowls will satisfy the biggest of appetites. For me, this is the ultimate comfort food. Hit the spot! I just wish we had this place in Utah. We will definitely come back when we visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Good place in an almost desolate shopping mall. Great if you like all you can eat. Choices appeared fresh"}
{"text":"First time coming here personally. I know a few who have eaten here already. Heard good things about it. Finally decided to try it. 
So pissed I didn't try it sooner!
First impression it is very clean!
The selection of meats and veggies are very fresh!
The price is very reasonable! A steal actually! Different sizes and prices to accommodate your hunger level. Comes with a drink and soup, rice and ice cream included in the price!
So super impressed with this restaurant!
I already can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I saw new ownership and knowing that it was formerly AJ's - I and the family decided to stop on in.  The layout is pretty similar, however the pricing on the electronic board includes soft drink and ice cream.  The owner was prrsent and he allowed my daughters (age 7 and 5) to split as they hardly eat and mainly just pick at the food and crunch on the fried won ton strips dunked in sweet and sour sauce.  

The food was fresh, and the restaurant was clean with friendly staff.  The owner is very personable and professional as well as taking a lot of pride in his new establishment.  

I wish for the best and successfulness of this business - whenever we crave Mongollian I will not hesitate to go here as W.valley Mongollian establishments are more rare than antyhing and don't get me started on the over priced and wannabe hipster locale such as Ghengis."}
{"text":"We love the food here! You know exactly what goes in, gets prepared right in front of you, and for a few cents you can take home left overs."}
{"text":"Just as  delicious as the previous YCs.  Great pricing and fantastic food. The owner worked with us for a dietary issue we had....excellent customer service! 
This place is so much better than Genghis Grill."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it. I really wanted to have a great experience too. I have multiple friends that like the place. It just didn't work out. 

My family visited this place about a 12-18 months ago, and it was, to be perfectly honest, trash. The place was one of the only businesses open in it's little strip mall location. That's not the fault of the owners, but it sure don't make customers feel very confident. 

The real issue was that the place smelled like the inside of a dead ferrets anus. Now, sure, the dude at the register told us that they were experiencing some toilet related issues, or something was being fixed, but when you're entire place, especially a place that has food out and open to the air, smells like the moldy o-ring of a dead rodent, shut the store down until it's fixed! 

The food was OK. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. It's the only place I have EVER been to that makes you buy your bowl (over $10) and then pay an additional charge for shrimp (like $3 for 5 shrimp). If you can't afford the shrimp, don't put it on the menu! If you claim something is \"all the meats\" and it don't include the shrimp, it's bullshit. 

Basically, no décor. No explanation on how things work. It's set up like a buffet, but you pay per bowl, I think.... again, no explanation."}
{"text":"I think it is under new management because it is amazing! I reached out to the restaurant due to my dietary restrictions and they were so helpful. We love the all you can eat bowl, something that is new!"}
{"text":"Something about stir-frying of meats on a large spinning iron mechanism doesn't sound too sanitary, but it sure was interesting.

My coworkers and I decided to give this place a try one day and had a very interesting experience.  The place was a little dirty, but was very spacious with plenty of natural lighting.  The staff was friendly and kind.  

The first thing you do is pay at the front, it is ridiculously expensive for the quality they offer.  The value is not worth it, trust me.  After you pay, you get your bowl and you start loading it up with noodles, veggies, frozen rolled up meats of all kinds.  You than dump some sauce of your choice on it, and you finally take it to the spinning iron mechanism, where the chef cooks your creation in front of you.  

My creation wasn't too bad, but definitely not worth what I had to pay, and one of my coworkers creation went all wrong.  It seemed simple enough, noodles with frozen rolled up beef and some broccoli and some baby corn and carrots.  But that creation literally went right through him.....and fast!    

Not even 5 minutes after he finished eating it, like the releasing of the river in the LOTR two towers movie, he shatted himself with no warning.  He suffered that day... No... we all suffered that day, riding in the car back to the office was torture.  Mind you it was a good long drive, that day the heavens tested us with all the traffic lights against us, a few car accidents slowing down the commute, some road construction, everything... ever rode in a car with someone that shatted themselves? Not pleasant at all...

Overall quite an experience, however coworkers and I decided we shall not be back."}
{"text":"FINALLY! Great Mongolian BBQ is back with fresh ingredients, caring service, a new look and ownership! High kudos to the new owner for taking over what I considered a mediocre restaurant and making it great again. 

There are new additional noodles to choose from and I also learned there are new sauces made from SCRATCH."}
{"text":"Years ago my favorite Mongolian BBQ place was Lai Lai over on Northern. It was there for many years and then it seemed like it disappeared over night and finding a replacement has been problematic though there have been a few good alternatives. Saw this place the other day and nearly decided against it until I checked the reviews on Yelp, I'm glad I turned around and went back. It took me a couple tries to get my ingredients right but this place is pretty close to Lai Lai for me and I really enjoyed the food. Their vegetable selection is extensive and everything looked fresh. Next time I decide to cheat on my diet, this will be the place I go to do it."}
{"text":"Very good spot- have vegan options and the food was fresh! Definitely coming back- Phoenix needs good Mongolian BBQ!"}
{"text":"My meal was pretty good.  I was ready write a more positive review, then asked for a box to take home what remained of my dinner.  Was told I had to pay $.50 for a box.  Seriously!  That kind of ticky-tack stuff just makes me angry.  For that reason, I will likely not return."}
{"text":"Having recently moved from LA I was sad to see the lack of Mongolian BBQ places around town. Until I found Blazin Mongolian. This may be my favorite Mongolian BBQ places I've ever been. They have one of the best selections of fresh meat and veggies I've seen at MBBQ. The one small complaint? I had was I wish the sauces were a little more flavorful, but I probably just needed to add more in all honesty. The best part however for me is that the bowls come with a Drink, Rice, Soup and SOFT SERVE! At the time of this writing you get all this for a little over $10. And I have a whole plate of leftovers for tomorrow! They do charge .50¢ for to go boxes but I think it's entirely acceptable given everything they include in the meal price. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been back multiple times. I'm sticking to 3 stars. I'm a HUGE fan of Mongolian BBQ and this satisfies my cravings. No it's not the best and yes it's a tad pricey, but overall it's worth the experience and money. 

Tip to the owner: make suggestion cards for customer for what sauces to use etc. There's only 3 and it would be so much more helpful for all the non creative cooks, like me, if there were more. 

Let Mongolian BBQ be your craving!"}
{"text":"Good good. Very quiet. All you can eat or single plate. Liked it.. would I come back? Ehh in a long time"}
{"text":"Blazing Mongolian BBQ has become the go-to place for Mongolian BBQ on West Side. This place has just gotten better and better.The new owner has really brought the level of this place up. It was good before, it's phenomenal now. You really need to try this place - it's great! If you are new to mongolian bbq, it is a little different but once you learn how to do it, you are in for a treat. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Had a great selection of veggies and meat and 3 different types of noodles. The selection of the sauces was great I tried the spicy just modified it to not be to spicy. The chef cook it perfectly. They had a more of a selection than most places for those that don't drink soda. I tried there blackberry herbal tea. I like that was not overly sweet think it the only sweetness came from the tea itself. The staff was kind and cleaning ND making sure everything was staked. Reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Decent Mongolian-style dinner, thought honestly I felt a little lost walking in here never having been before. Took us a bit of creeping on other patrons to figure it out but in the end it was very tasty :)

Just off the highway so super convenient if you're traveling down from Flagstaff through Phoenix like we were."}
