{"text":"I have been here for lunch a couple of times and keep telling my wife how good the food is and how cheap it is.  She finally got me to take her and the food did not disappoint.

We shared an order of Potato Balls, a ball of mashed potatoes mixed with a tasty curry and spices and then fried so the outside skin is as crispy as the inside is soft.  The taste is awesome and does not have the overpowering curry that other places put in their food so that it can be truly enjoyed without being overwhelming.

My wife enjoyed her Chicken Roti and I had the Goat Roti.  Huge portions for under $10 each with tender meat. Once again they use the curry so that it makes you appreciate how the flavour works with the meat and Roti and not just feel that it is the only thing in the dish. We enjoyed them both with a couple of beers, Bob Marley playing in the background and a cast of  characters at a few of the tables around us who had originally come from a few different islands in the Caribbean. These guys were mostly there for a cold beer after work (just $3.50 which is very cheap for any place in Toronto) and just added to the colour of the place.

Ordering was quick and easy since the place is so small and the owner you see in the pictures on Yelp was the guy who took our order and went back to help cook the food.

Dinner was under $30 plus tip.  Holy Crap, what a deal.  And on a hot August day in Toronto the food and ambiance had me feeling that I was no longer in Canada.  Hidden Gem indeed!"}
{"text":"As a previous cook at the The Blue Water Curry & Roti Restaurant the  kitchen is filthy and the owner is nasty. She does not wash her hands after going to the washroom. Then she kneed the roti dough. Make sure you look into the kitchen before you order.  They serve old food mixed with fresh food. Lots of cockroaches and rats."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service! Had the roti chicken + double + beer, no regrets :). Plus, it's the place is very easily accessible and prices are very fair."}
{"text":"At the time one of the better perks of working near Scarborough. My buddy and I used to come here for lunch when we had extra time.

You have to try the doubles here -- made deliciously and the best I've ever had. Never been able to find doubles that stack up since here.

Each time the food, roti and flavours have been excellent. This is top notch west indian food in the east end of Toronto."}
{"text":"Blue Water is not the best restaurant in the city. It's kind of a hole in the wall that most people would pass by on sight.

With that said, Blue Water is undoubtedly the best West Indian food that you can find in the city. They are the best at what they do, and that's what gives them all five stars in my book. I have been going there for quite a number of years and I always leave satisfied. I mean, I used to leave delighted, but I've been there so often that I have come to expect excellence, and when that expectation is met, then I leave satisfied.

The Chicken Curry is to die for. I can't even get Chicken curry that good at home (don't tell my mom that). The roti is always freshly made. ALWAYS. This takes some extra time (a lot of people say that the service is slow), but it is soooooooo worth every hungry minute you wait!

Also the price is good for what you get.

If you're looking for fried chicken that is home made and just as good as KFC or Popeye's. you've found the place. I would always recommend Blue Water for their curry, but their fried chicken was wonderful when I finally tried it. It's not greasy or oily and it has just the right amount of crispiness and big flavour!

Sorry for the essay on this place, but it really is that great!"}
{"text":"I came here after finding it on yelp and decided to come because it was super close to where I live. I walk in and this man gives me a menu, to which I order the $8.50 beef stew which also happened to be their special that day. I assumed he was the owner but he looked kind of shady when deciding how much to charge me. He charged me $10.10 after tax which I thought was weird...I'm not fucking stupid. At this point 

I asked him how much it was before tax and he said $8.99. I pointed out to him that the price should be $8.50 and he looked astonished that I called him out like that. I understand if he told me it was an honest mistake and changed it right away, but he grabbed the menu and looked at it up and down. He said yes I'm right, and he only started working here yesterday. OKAY NOW YOU UNLEASHED HANGRY DETECTIVE BOU.

I looked at him like that skeptical emoji and asked \"so you just started working here yesterday?\" To which he replied \"\"yes\". So showed picture of an old yelp photo that had him with a woman from a year ago. He was at a loss of words but said \"where did yoou find that picture of ME\"...note the me...I asked him, \"so this is you..?\" and then he said he has a brother...wtf  you just said its you...LOL and are you sure not twins cuz he looks exactly like you.

This point I'm hungry and angry that he thought I'd take his lying sack of shit. So I told him his business ethics is so wrong, and he lost a customer over $0.50. I don't support businesses who aren't honest with their customers, who knows what else they aren't honest about.

I rarely give 1 star but congrats to this place :)"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty harsh critic but consider myself a good judge of food.  That being said, this is the best roti I've had my life, bar none.

I had the boneless goat roti, channa roti, spinach roti, and a double. They fed two hungry people really well. Everything was amazing.

This is only the second review I've ever done on yelp, and I've been using Yelp for years. I don't review something or talk about something unless I think it's really amazing. This place is just that. Amazing.

Thanks so much Khem!

Tl;dr Best roti I've had in my life, at an unbeatable price."}
{"text":"Just moved recently and Blue Water was within walking distance so I thought I'd check it out. Walked into the small restaurant and first noticed the beautiful tropical wall mural then the matching blue tablecloths. It was very clean and organized. Staff very pleasant. Chose the Beef curry over rice and the chicken curry roti. Food came out pretty quick and stayed hot till I got home. 

When I unwrapped everything it smelled really good and I was excited to dig in. Tried the Beef curry first; the beef was tender but very dry. The rice was cooked with too much water so it was very water logged and wasn't able to absorb the curry very well. Next, the chicken roti. The chicken was tender but the potatoes were overcooked and mushy. There was something in between the layers of roti that looked like yellow cornmeal which didn't help with the texture nor did it look very appetizing. I didn't enjoy the tastes of either of the curry dishes. 

They do have affordable lunch specials from 11am-3pm that start at $3.99 so I might be back to try more of their food and the potato balls."}
{"text":"Shout out to Joey C for recommending Blue Water as a stop on Food Tour 2.0 (Scarborough Edition)! Good call.

This was the fifth stop on our trip. By this time, some of us were struggling from food comas. We came to get doubles and potato balls. Carbs + food comas. Oh dear.

We came during off hours, and there was basically no one in the restaurant, save for one man nursing a beer (so I'm taking they have some sort of liquor license). We ordered two doubles ($1.50 each) and an order of potato balls ($2.50/3). Our food took a while to make, but it came out piping hot, so I'm not complaining. 

I'd never had a double before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but basically, I got two fluffy pieces of bread (which I think were fried) sandwiching chickpea curry. I thought I would enjoy it less than I did. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The chickpea curry was not very spicy (thankfully, because I've been coughing for the last five weeks), but it was quite flavorful. The bread was light and spongy. For $1.50, I didn't think it was ridiculously cheap (bread and chickpeas don't cost much), but it makes a nice snack.

The potato balls were super crispy on the outside, and thankfully, fairly light on the inside. I was afraid it was going to be a dense ball of potato. I believe the inside of the potato ball was mashed potato, spices, and perhaps some other sort of starch. These were served with a (sweet) sour pepper sauce (?) that was not very spicy, but had a nice tingle. It went quite well with the potato balls, and made them feel less carb-y than they actually were.

If I'm in the area, I'll be back to try their rotis."}
{"text":"You can truly find hidden gems on Yelp if you look hard enough. This place is definitely one of those. I saw a few reviews, took a chance and it paid off!

This is one of those run down places that you probably wouldn't want to dine in. It's not exactly the most appetizing environment and you may not feel so safe hanging around this area too long. This type of environment typically harbour such gems. I would be inclined to deduct stars if it were just strictly based on aesthetics but seeing that this place is primarily a takeout joint; they get to keep their stars. =)

We had potato balls, doubles and curry. We were a little timid as we didn't quite have the confidence to go all out. The curry was incredibly delicious with the rice. It's got a nice spice too it with lots of aroma from the herbs and spices pulling through. The rice is nicely cooked and it does the job. The chicken was tender and really soaked up the curry well. Next was the potato balls, it was our first time. Fried to golden perfection with a slight crisp on the outside. As you bite into it, it just crumbles like a butter cookie. Again you really do taste all the spices in it. Delicious! Last but not least the doubles were some of the finest I've had. That roti is pillowy and soft all the while has a satisfying and squeaky chew to it. Inside you will find spicy chickpeas and again some spices (there's a theme here that I like! LOL).

As with most mom and pop shops, you can really taste the love and care the owners put into their food. Every bite reminds you of a home made meal that someone's been spending hours preparing it for you. There is a wait time for everything you order because it's prepared fresh. The quality is there and you really do taste it. This one is a keeper."}
{"text":"I love Roti. This place makes the BEST curry chicken roti I EVER had. It's best to call in your order though, good food takes time. Home cooking, distinct flavours. You can eat in, there's a small dining room where the yummy smell and the accents of the regulars are the best decoration.
Irie!

Still the best after 20 years!  This food can heal what ails you. 
THANK YOU BLUE WATER !"}
{"text":"I use to be in love with this place. If I could still eat here I would. I only ever got take out though because the atmosphere is pretty grimy but holy hell the food is amazing! 6/5 for the roti, it's that good. I would 110% say get take out from here. Food is amazing, prices are good. Would give it 5 starts if the place was nicer but it's in a little crummy strip mall on Victoria park."}
{"text":"Yelp's lack of half-stars is definitely a challenge for this solid 3.5 performer. I've had a lot of Roti around the city, and I was happy with Blue Water. The portions are great, the Roti was tender, and the gravy was super flavorful, but I just found a lack of spice. The doubles also weren't my favorite, the chutney was a little too tart and the chickpeas were still a bit chalky."}
{"text":"I had been doing renos at my place all day, and had gradually developed a ferocious hankering for some West Indian fare.  I had pulled up yelp on my phone and realized that this hole in the wall was merely minutes from my place.  Once inside I looked at the menu and nothing seemed out of the ordinary, however for some reason I opted for the jerk chicken roti.  I wasn't sure how this would taste as I've never ordered this anywhere before.  Let me tell you that roti was spot on!  The chicken was surprisingly moist and perfectly spiced without being overly salty.  It lay within a fluffy roti/ paratha which absorbed perfectly the amount of juices from the meat, minimizing the amount of collateral spillage on the plate, floor and of course my shirt.  I am pretty sure that I will be returning to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Truly a 4.5 star review...  where to start. I was in the area and saw this little restaurant (OK. Hole in the wall) that was serving up some West Indian/ Carribean fare.  I ordered my regular ox tail whenever I can from these places and a side of \"DOUBLES\"- Roti sandwich with a curry chickpea filling... tres yummy.  Nice flavor profile and texture.  When the oxtail over rice came out, the aroma was oh so amazing.  Good serving of rice and a very generous portion of oxtail stew.  The rice had a nice spice profile to bring out the flavor. The oxtail... I had a sensory overload!  It was cooked perfectly (not over or undercooked) and the many layers of flavors that all compliment each other.  With each mouthful, the boquet fills your mouth.   I only wish they had ginger beer to wash this down with!  This dish wins over The Real Jerk, Mr. Jerk and Tasty Bread no questions asked.  The wait time was only 8 mins from order to table top. Real Jerk... please learn. 45 minute waits during lunch is NOT lunch pace.  I will definitely be back to give their Roti Chicken a try."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place and the food did not let me down! 

We got an order of doubles, the potato balls and a boneless chicken roti. It's easy to tell if roti places are legit based on their roti she'll. The roti shell was very soft and the beans did not dry out the meal (like some other places). The roti was made to order like everything else on their menu. It's worth the wait. The doubles are not bad either, would've hoped for a more flavourful filling but the roti used for the doubles was absolutely on point! And the potato balls...I've never had anything like this in my life. Imagine curry mashed potatoes, rolled up and battered then deep fried...yea... It's served with a tamarind, vinegar and pepper blended sauce which is just perfect together. 

At the end of it, the roti and the doubles are as good as any other place in Scarborough, (roti hut, drupatis) but the potato balls are like none other. 

Would definitely come back for the potato balls!"}
