{"text":"More than Supreme. Good to have more home made salad dressing and fresh home made mint sauce. This will bring the whole cooking upscaled."}
{"text":"I went with my 80 yr. old mom for lunch.  Price and portion were okay, however there is a $7.50 minimum order per person, which we dislike.  I don't know why there's such a policy.  We were forced to order more than we can eat and had to pay $0.25 for the take out box to pack food home.  There was not much flavor in the butternut squash cream soup.  Laksa was tasty, pork cutlet was a bit hard for senior to chew.  They need to improve their tea with milk"}
{"text":"HOW CAN I GIVE THIS PLACE -5??  DON'T GO! SAVE YOUR MONEY!   This restaurant is TERRIBLE! GARBAGE!  Service - Next to none. Always have to ask the waitresses for things - refill on tea, utensils, THE FOOD.. The waitresses are also not the most friendly bunch. Waited FOREVER for the food. The utensils were REALLY dirty.. food still stuck on them - and i am not talking about one utensil.. i am talking about 5 or 6 of them.. If they cannot even get this down right, imagine how clean their kitchen is (gags)..  Food - Overpriced. Small portions. Bland. Too Salty. We ordered 3 daily special set dinners that came with: soup of the day, \"special\" apps, the main course, dessert, and coffee/ tea.   On the menu, their soup of the day was lobster bisque or vegetable soup. When we opted to order the lobster bisque, the waitress quickly replied with, \"There is a mistake on the menu, there is no lobster bisque.\" .. We then see other tables getting lobster bisque. *eye roll*  Their \"special\" app was a trio of random things (probably wanted to get rid of these things): 1. Chopped up tuna on a chip topped with avocado.. It was bland and the chip was so oily.. 2. A piece of eel on a toast cracker.. The eel was really fishy, the toast cracker was dry, and it was bland.. 3. Some kinda \"fresh\" spring rolls with only lettuce and carrot shreds inside, topped with some kinda mango(?) sauce.. It was just weird.. felt like they served this to get rid of their almost expired, rotting vegetables..!  We ordered three different main course:  1. Chirashi ($26) - SUPER DISAPPOINTED. As most ppl would assume, chirashi is a fish with ASSORTED type of fish on a bed of flavoured rice. I honestly wish I took a picture of my meal, but this is what I got: 3 pieces of salmon sashimi and 3 pieces of uni on a bed of COLD and HARD rice sprinkled with some black sesame. 6 pieces of sashimi!!! RIDICULOUS!!!!!!  2. Cornish hen ($23) - It was deep fried. Too salty. Sauce that came with it was too salty. Came with mash potatoes (probably the boxed kind).  3. Fish and scallop ($28) - Yes, scallop. ONE scallop. And some frozen fish fillet with some mysterious sauce. Also, had the boxed mash potato  on the side. This dish was not worth it at all. Honestly, how can a restaurant serve a dish with ONE scallop.. Geez  Dessert was plain cheesecake with some kinda raspberry sauce on the top. Looked like frozen cheesecake that was defrosted. It came with one blackberry. The one I got was MOLDY. (Side note: We notice that some other tables that ordered the same set dinners as us got an upgraded dessert.. Probably their \"usual\" customers. However, we were not even offered this other dessert even if we wanted to pay extra.)  Don't waste your money and time here."}
{"text":"First time here. Probably one of the better HK style cafe around. Decor is modern. They had four servers on staff today. That's awesome for a small restaurant of this size.   We ordered: Laksa noodle soup- strong coconut flavours, not spicy Peppered chicken and cheese baked on ramen.!... Yes!.. ramen! Pretty good. Flavours were great. A little spicy coz of the pepper but i like it.! Ox tail red wine on spaghetti- they did a good job with the ox tail. The meat was soft, tender and fall off the bone. They definitely used a better quality meat here.   Meals average $10-14 each. Comes with soup and drink.   Will definitely try to come back again."}
{"text":"This place is very small and the food is mediocre. The curry was no good but the truffle cream pasta was decent. The upside is they serve kangen (alkaline) water instead of tap water. This place is not baby friendly and they charge for take out boxes. Otherwise, it's worth a try if you're into a cute Hong Kong-Parisian style caf√©. I wouldn't purposely go out of my way to go though."}
{"text":"This is the worse dinner I ever had, everything tasteless and over priced. Pork~fail, spaghetti~fail  drinks~also fail. I will never come back again, it just wasting of money and cheap foodcourt even taste better than this place."}
{"text":"I'm kind of sad that O.M.G. is gone, OMG was pretty decent and the price was very competitive.  Steak Supreme has now replaced OMG but the staff on site look very familiar, so perhaps it's just an ownership and name change?    I came on a Saturday and didn't have to wait to be seated, some of the OMG lunch dishes are still available, but of course with a few extra dollars more and they no longer serve breads with the soup.  I ordered the Katsu Stuffed Cheese Pork Cutlet with spaghetti.  The pork came over fried, thus, the pork was not juicy and was very rough. The sauce that came with it was interesting, tasted like a tomato gravy sauce. Portion was decent, but the pork was so over-fried and rough I didn't really enjoy it.  The meal does come with a drink and I went with an iced milk tea which tasted like water and drank a quarter of it. That milk tea was probably the worst milk tea I ever had before.  Will I come back again? Most likely not unless I see some positive reviews on yelp within the next few months when they are no longer considered as \"new\"."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch with my mom after checking out the Yelp page and website.  I live close by and had always wanted to try O.M.G. before it went defunct.  We heard this restaurant is related to another HK cafe we frequent but couldn't confirm whether that was true or not.  We went around 1:30pm and were seated promptly -- it wasn't too busy since it was slightly after the lunch rush.  The menu we were given was just one page double-sided, but we noticed that there was a fair mix of cuisines (sushi, pasta, curry).  I got the \"mixed grilled with rice\" (there's a typo on the menu) and my mom got the \"pork cutlet salad\".  Both meals were served with soup (borscht or cream) and milk tea/coffee.  The pork cutlet salad seemed fine -- only thing to mention was that the honeydew melon slices that were served with the dish didn't seem that ripe so they were a bit hard to chew on.  For the mixed grilled with rice, the Chinese on the menu indicated it was a mix of beef steak, pork chop, and lamb chop.  However, when my plate came, there was only a pork chop, a lamb chop, and two sausages.  I guess they didn't have steak??? Or they didn't bother because the pork chop they gave me was pretty big.  I didn't ask about it and shrugged it off, but the English on the menu should make it more clear what will be served to the customer.  The milk tea that was served with the meal could be better. It was still pretty bitter and not as creamy/silky as other HK cafe places I've been to.  Also the tea mugs weren't very full with the milk tea.  Overall, portion size was good and prices are decent for the amount of food given to you.  I'll come back again to see what their curries are like.  A suggestion for the restaurant would be to make the English portion of the menu a little bit more clear about what is being served -- some of the dish names are very ambiguous (I can sort of read Chinese so that kind of helped me today but it won't help clientele that do not understand the language).  Having inconsistent menu items will not only confuse the customer, but also create misunderstandings.  Regarding Vivi C.'s comment about the $7.50 minimum order per person -- this is written at the bottom of the menu in Chinese, but not in English.  I think it would be better if the restaurant was a little bit more transparent about this policy because it will definitely make customers upset if it's not indicated visibly in English as well."}
{"text":"This is the MOST DISHONEST restaurant I've ever been. We ordered a dinner for TWO and the menu said \"foie gras x 2\" was included. So obviously we would expect 2 orders would come but they only gave us 1 order. They explained \"x2\" means 1 order since each order had 2 pieces. They also advertised a 15% discount on TV but then they didn't tell us the discount wouldn't apply to our dinner combo upfront. They claimed the combo was already discounted. But when we checked out the prices on the regular menu later, the price for the dinner combo was indeed HIGHER than the sum of the price for each item on the regular menu. The food wasn't great either.  THIS IS SO SAD!!!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what's the deal with the all the negative reviews!   Yesterday I had a daily special dinner set (half lobster/pork chop) and it came with amazing soup, decent appetizer, and a cheese cake and coffee at the end! I will try the delicious looking lunch special next time!   I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Over priced... $20 for spaghetti and meat sauce! Definitely not worth the price for the quality of food and portions"}
{"text":"???????????????????????presentation/plating???????  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????$30??????????$80+?  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"My recent visit to this restaurant was awesome and I wish I can give 10 stars if I could. The food was amazing and the service was excellent.  The most amazing thing was the price of the food (please refer to pictures) it was only and only $200 for four people. We still could not finish the food. How about the quality  you of the food? I thought I was in Asia and trying the fusion food. It is definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only have 2 stars, by it's a nice fancier version of HK style cafe.  Came here with mom after her recommendation. Lunch on average is $7.50-14 comes with soup and coffee or tea.  This place does not do afternoon tea but they serve lunch late. At 3pm, still people flowing in! They also offer a few Japanese rice bowls, not sure if it's a place I would get sushi and sashimi. Their lunch sets seem to be a great deal!  Best part, their soup was yummy and their HK Milk tea was rich and strong! Slight complain was that their tea might need a bit more milk due to the strongness of the tea.  I'm had the beef tongue which nice and tender with the upper cuts of the tongue. Some places serves the tongue even with the crappy bits with the vein and crappy bits. Moms pork cutlet with cheese was thick. It was a bit dry, might need a few more pounding and the cheese I believe they might be using processed cheese slices vs real shredded cheese but I could be wrong.  Portion for lunch is a bit towards the smaller side but with the soup, and after meal drink, it was quite satisfying!   Can't wait to come to try out their dinner menu (as posted)"}
