{"text":"I really like the subs from here and service is pretty good... that's about it. The chili cheese fries are just frozen and heated up in a microwave for crying out loud. It's upsetting the only thing fresh here are the sandwiches. I will go again though. I'm always willing to give places multiple chances to really wow me."}
{"text":"Still love this place! The new location is wonderful, it's easier to see and will hopefully give them more marketing power. Inside it feels like you've stepped into an old mom and pop shop the mix match use of tables and counters can do that.   The sandwiches are still delicious and I love how you can carry a conversation with the staff while they work on your order. The entire environment feels calm and relaxing, might be a great place for me to sit and just read for a day. Let's not forget how fresh their ingredients are and if you ask they always have a good recommendation of what to get or add to your order.   The soups are also as marvelous as ever, not to mention their deviled eggs they offer as well.   I'm so happy that they have been able to move to a bigger and brighter location.  (Just one note I do have to add, I haven't tried the coffee yet, but I have good things about it.)"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  Work orders from here every so often....sometimes it's great.  Other times you wonder if who ever made your sub actually ever saw a sandwich.  The hot food...lol...yeah, don't bother.  I always feel like I've overpaid for what you get. The weekly  chicken salad is normally your best bet....at least that's the one they haven't goofed up yet."}
{"text":"I adore this place! I love the people that work there, they are so kind. Its the only sub place that actually charges you less for getting a vegetarian sub, which makes so much sense! The bread is so good and everything is fresh! Love the new location they have as well!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, coffee not so much  This place has good sandwiches, great breakfasts, and very good service. The new location is a huge step up over their previous one.    But while the proprietor seems to fancy himself as a coffee expert, the coffee isn't so great in our opinions. While we wouldn't consider ourselves coffee experts by any means, we drink very strong, locally-roasted \"Just Coffee\" and thumb ours noses at the pedestrian pre-ground grocery store coffee. The two different roasts we tried at Main Street Kitchen were, in our opinions, barely drinkable; they were gross. Overly strong (think espresso strong), HIGHLY acidic, and just not good.  They did however try very hard to make sure we were happy and ended up giving us an Americano (which was good) no charge. I applaud their customer service.   We will absolutely go back and would recommend this place to others...just with the warning to ask for a sample sip before buying a whole cup."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches, as well as the new location. Definitely your boring chain sub shop. Lots of specialty breads, deviled eggs, and other sides."}
{"text":"10-15 years ago I frequented the old location for subs during my lunch period when I was in high school. It was always a popular choice among the high school students.    I've only been to the new location 3 times for lunch and have always ordered subs. It brings me back to my high school years. The French/white bread is what I remember it, soft, fluffy and fresh.   Two of the 3 times my boyfriends bread choice was sold out. They didn't tell him till after he ordered and we were waiting for our food. He isn't picky so he was always able to pick another kind and has been satisfied.   Looks like they have expanded their menu to include breakfast and deep fried/hot items. I have yet to try either of those.   If you are downtown Stoughton and need a quick lunch, I suggest giving them a try."}
{"text":"We stopped for a light lunch as we were driving through Stoughton. They offered to make a smaller Sailor sandwich for me which was delicious, with boiled egg slices! The Harvest soup was loaded with a variety of vegetables and not salty. To complete the lunch we ordered small cups of Gelato. And the Raspberry Lemonade had the right amount of tartness.  The restaurant is located in the former Stoughton Store."}
{"text":"I can't actually rate MSK, because when my friend and I went to go get subs for lunch, they told us they were out of bread. Being that their menu is more or less exclusively sandwich-based, we left.  They were still a little over an hour away from closing time, so they should have had the mind to run across the street to the bakery and pick up a couple loaves to hold them over - at least that's what I would hope for. The girls working the counter looked about 15, though, so they might not be authorized to pull cash to make a buy, or have had the thought to do so.  They were really polite, and my friend has eaten there several times before, so if I find myself in Stoughton for lunch again I'd maybe give them a chance to redeem themselves.  Maybe I expect too much?"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are made fresh and good. The service is poor. It seems as though no one really knows what's going on. That is my only complaint. It's a small shop."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch, not being familiar with the area.  It was cute and inviting, and had breakfast all day and an array of sandwiches... we ordered Chili and hot ham and Swiss sub.  It was so good we decided to get coffee as well.  Best chai tea latte I have had in a long long time.  The hosts were friendly and attentive, and offered us many choices (make your own sub with bread and cheese choices, as well as custom milk choices for my latte).  Places like this just aren't around anymore.  I will come again."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. Good food and selections. A nice clean place. I would definitely come back the next time in town."}
{"text":"Location / Atmosphere -  A very nice option for a quick lunch when in Stoughton.  Very clean and well managed.  Seemed like there was a bit of remodeling going on when I was there.  Not sure if this is an indication that they are expanding  Food / Beverage -  I had a soup / sandwich combo when I was there.  Chicken salad on a croissant and the Butternut Squash soup.  Both tasted very good and 'home made' which was the main reason for me stopping in.  Always looking for a place out of the ordinary and not a typical 'chain restaurant'.  A few thoughts that I think would improve my over-all experience.  Your silverware could be a bit cleaner.  It was clean but a bit tiered looking.  You also should be proud of your food as it really is good and with this should present it on quality china.  Wasn't really impressed with this 'plastic plates'.  I'm sure it's difficult and can be costly but it would be nice to have bread choices when ordering a sandwich.  Service -  Very friendly, pleasant, quick and attentive service.  It's always great to be served by people who have a positive attitude and everyone that I spoke to at the Main Street Kitchen was extremely friendly.    In summary -  A very nice place.  Hope to re-visit the next time that I'm in-town."}
