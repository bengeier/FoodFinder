{"text":"Came here for the first time just to check it out. I got the arroz de marisco it was okay not bad, not great. I would y order it again. My bf got the combo the civeche was good, the soup was a tad salty and the fried shrimp were good. We would come back to try other things on the menu maybe. It was also very cold inside they didn't have any heat on. I wish I wore a heavy sweater"}
