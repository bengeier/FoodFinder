{"text":"Ths place was horrible... yes it has a drive thru but i think it is so the people dont see how disgusting the inside is.. First off i spent over $30 for 2 subs, 3 slices of pizza and 2 beers. now dont be fooled when you order the sandwhich that comes with fries be prepared..... you will receive no lie maybe 8 french fries. and i'm not talking steak fries , i'm talking small ass mcdonald size fries. And when i complained they started counting the fries and there was 8. 8 F'ING FRENCH FRIES IS AN ORDER??? maybe they are trying to save $$$ to spray the place for all the flys flying around or the ketchup stains on the rug....NASTY PLACE TO EAT!!!!!"}

{"text":"The cool thing about Mo's Pizza is that they have a drive-thru! How fun is that? You can get a few slices of pizza without ever leaving your car. Not too shabby.  The reason Mo's is set up like this is because it used to be a Wendy's.  But when it went out of business, Mo snapped it right up.   Mo's has a decent selection of beer, and the pizza is really good. And slices of pizza are reasonable- around 2 bucks each.  It's that New York style kind with the huge slices you have to fold to eat.  But here's the thing- Mo apparently also has a big New York style ego.  A large pizza here is like $18.  That's way more than even Pizza Hut charges, and they're a nationally recognized pizza chain, not a little neighborhood pizza place.  I don't go here often because of this-it's just too expensive.  But when I do go, I either go through the drive-thru or go inside for a quick slice or two. And it's always delicious.  They have other items on the menu too though, like calzones.  So check this place out and see what you think."}
