{"text":"Pub très bien situé, Et bien aménagé . La nourriture est bonne mais sans véritable inspirations et le service est également sans inspiration. Un pub comme il y en a beaucoup mais il est sûrement possible d'avoir une expérience plus inspiré à beaucoup d autres endroits. Bon ... sans plus"}
{"text":"Just in from Toronto for a hockey tourney. This place was amazing!  Where else can you get a great platter of oysters, top quality burger ( with Brie of course), creamy Mac and cheese and one heck of a poutine!!  Great service as well but I would have waited an hour and not complained one bit.   Great job!  Sad to have to go back to Ontario !!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had the chance to try out their dinner menu yet, but I did have the chance to take a glimpse at the choices offered, and everything seemed divine. Various sandwiches, burgers, salads, and many more!  During my first visit, I had the chance to sit on their lovely terrace while enjoying my lunch. They have a special lunch menu, which includes a salad or soup, a course meal, and a coffee or tea (for ~10-15$). The salad that I ordered was refreshing and the butternut squash soup was delicious!  I definitely recommend trying this place out if you are in the neighbourhood, it is one of the nicest places on St-Charles."}
{"text":"Super!!!! Je vous le recommande."}
{"text":"Great service and food!  I was in town for a hockey tournament and we went with a large group and the service was great.  Burgers were great and beer was even better."}
{"text":"I just finished lunch st St. Mark's Pub. I had the fish & chips. They give you a big piece of battered cod. The batter was crispy but it was a bit greasy too. The fries were nicely cooked. I washed it all down with a pint of New Castle.  A great selection of draft and bottled beers. The service was fast and friendly. All in all a good experience."}
