{"text":"A decent Vietnamese sub joint, the best part about this venue is the pricing.  Many of their submarines including chicken, beef and pork can be had for $5 including tax, and their veggie sub is about $3.50.  I usually get their chicken sub whenever I'm in the area, and while tasty, it is a bit on the high side when it comes to salt.  But for $5, I can't complain too much and every joint makes their food a little bit different anyways.  There isn't much in the way of seating though, so it's really a take-and-go type place rather than a sit-down place.  My favorite part about the location is that it's next to a bunch of other small shops in the same strip mall, so mixing and matching a custom lunch for under $10 is super simple.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sub I've ever eaten. Visit this place a couple times a year over the past 10 years. Quality never changes. Always hot fast and delicious. BRING CASH. I wish they'd get a debit machine, because I don't carry cash often. I would deduct a star because it's kind of ridiculous to be cash only these days... But I can't give anything less than 5 because it's too delicious, and dare I say, worth the hassle? Check it out!"}
{"text":"Best in the city and its cash only. I like how they use pate for the original cold cut and there isn't any cheese on the subs, which is how it should be."}
{"text":"Best viet sub in the city. I have tried many subs and this one is the best. Super soft and toasty bun and awesome value for what you get. Since its a long drive for me to get a sub I usually order 2 and take one home. It's cash only so make sure you have some when you go there. The BBQ pork is my favourite and totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went to this place because it is up the street from my house and I am love with vietnamese subs. I had the chicken sate. The chicken came from a container that was sitting on the counter and microwaved, I think they keep it out because the chicken had a wierd taste. I never got sick! I wasn't worried about that I just don't think this is a good practice. Buns were crispier then I like but were fresh none the less. A lot of people come here and had 2 others before me so this looks like a popular place for locals. I can't get over the taste of the chicken. What other comments do others have I would like to know :)  I think the chicken sate is 2 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"This little gem is best kept a secret even if it's been around for 18 years!! Delicious Vietnamese subs with fresh toppings on crispy but moist French baguette. My favorite is the beef sate but they are all good.Lovingly prepared by friendly owners and reasonably priced. Don't forget to bring cash and be prepared for a lineup but well worth it. I want to spread the word but don't want their popularity to change what is so good."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over 10 years. Prices have gone up of course, but place remains the same. Their beef sate banh mi is the best, I've tried all their different subs before. Usually the assorted cold cuts banh mi is my favourite, but not at this place unfortunately. Their nem chua is also delicious and they don't use red food coloring which is a bonus. I also really like their nem nuong which you buy raw in a bag and then bbq at home. Bread is a bit too crispy, I had the best banh mi breads in Montreal actually... But we're in Calgary so yah, that doesn't count."}
{"text":"I've been here for Vietnamese Subs since 2002. Their subs really are the best in the city I find. Prices are quite cheap ($6 for a satay beef or chicken) compared to the one in Chinatown across from the Harry Hays building. The ladies there informed me that the buns are delivered there fresh every day too. Highly recommend this place if you want to try a V sub. I'd suggest beef satay without the hot pepper and no cilantro."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sub in Calgary so far. More authentic than Banh mi Thi Thi and you can also buy some Vietnamese treat at the counter if u cone early"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese subs in the city.  Favourites are the regular meat sub and the beef sate. This place is cash only."}
{"text":"3.5*   To be honest, I'm never in this area, but I was with my mom touring the asian markets in the area and asked a grocery bagger at a store where to get a good vietnamese sub.  His first recommendation was Thi Thi downtown/chinatown. I didn't want to drive downtown so he pointed me to Saigon Deli a few shops down from  Lucky supermarket.   It's a good price point @ ~ $5 / sub. 4* for value haha. (I remember when v-subs used to be $2.75!!! - haha ok now I'm dating myself!).   They have the assorted option, the satay option, the veggie option. I asked them to hold the sauce as we were going to eat later on and not right away.  We basically got all satay beef.   *note* for those used to thi thi, there is no cheese in the sub... the way i think it should be and the way i like it.  I thought it had good flavour, though slightly drier (but probably cuz I asked for no sauce). All in all a great option if you're in the area and don't want to drive to Chinatown.  It is a small place, basically a take-out place."}
{"text":"The Vietnamese subs here are kick-ass! Generous amount of meat, veggies and I love that they keep in authentic by putting in shrimp paste in their House sub (which is what I always get due to the fact it has Vietnamese ham AND chicken). And for only 5 bucks and the portion size of the sub I definitely think it's worth it. I don't care what anyone else says, this place is one of the best Vietnamese sub joints in Calgary."}
{"text":"Saigon Deli is one of my fave Viet Sub joints in the city. When it comes to banh mi I always crave this place or one of the other (very small) handful of banh mi places in Calgary.   Saigon Deli is a small family run joint that's been in the city for years! It's located in the strip mall in Forest Lawn attached beside the 7-11 and Lucky's Supermarket. I give kudos to this fine establishment on their amazing subs. Always friendly and I never wait long for my subs. Large orders should definitely call in as they usually only have a couple people working. The baguettes are always nice and crispy on the outside and a soft with a bit of chewiness on the inside. My favorites are the Sate Beef and the Cold Cut (assorted). Sate beef isn't drenched in sauce like some other places and doesn't make the bread soggy while you're eating it. It also has a kick of some. Kind of garlic sauce/mayo/butter that I'm not quite sure what it is that just makes me drool over this sandwich with every bite. And the cold cut has pate in it which most of the traditional Viet subs will have pate in it. If you're not a fan you should probably tell them to leave it out but I welcome it.   4 stars because sometimes their bread's crust is almost too crispy/hard and makes it difficult to eat. A sauce in the cold cut would be welcome but I still enjoy it very much. Bring a friend and share half of your sub with each other to try them all! These guys are consistent, friendly, and even with inflation continue to have great prices (about $5-$6)."}
{"text":"I've never been into subs  but my coworker got me into it.  I ordered beef sate and it was $6 with tax Now this deli is just strictly takeout...their menu is simple...really small place... You have a little place to order small place for them to work in they only take cash. The bread is freshly made everyday.  They put lots of meat and they put peanut...so make sure you tell them how u like your sub... The flavour is so good...Lolita worth the $6 ... they also have chicken assorted veggie  The place itself is outdated but it doesn't matter they are clean and good food."}
