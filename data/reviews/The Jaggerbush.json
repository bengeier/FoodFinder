{"text":"This used to be a great bar.  The new owners should have changed the name because it is dragging the old Jaggerbush name through the mud.  We stopped in for the grand reopening with the DJ this past Saturday. Our bartender was more worried about plugging in her phone than getting people beer.  Now that the taps have been moved to the back wall you can't see them,  and it's not a good sign when your bartender doesn't know What's on tap.  When asked if the Dogfish Head was the 60 minute or 90 minute, she came back and told me it was the craft beer.  It wasn't overly busy,  but it took a long time to get a new beer when we needed a refill,  and they ran out of the beer special an hour in.  And the back up special,  and back up special.  Our bartender did nothing to tell us what beer they DID have,  we just had to keep guessing beer until we picked one they had.  And there is something to be said about actually serving a beer and just having it slapped down in front of you and your money taken with no regards to the customer.  At the end of the night she tried to tell me she didn't have my credit card,  and we couldn't get out of there fast enough.  Very sad to see a great bar run so horribly"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, inexpensive drinks, good bar food, daily food & drink specials.  Tuesday is 2$ beer and 1$ taco nights plus trivia game!!  I can see this place becoming that special neighborhood bar where everybody knows your name.

One negative - the jukebox is waaay too loud.  Can't have a conversation with the other people at the bar when it's on.

All in all, a great start to success."}
{"text":"This place gets REALLY packed on the weekends, and a lot of meat heads and d-bags hang out there.  However, the prices are good, the bartenders are rather pleasant, and it's off the main path of carson so it's a nice beginning to a night, or last stop."}
{"text":"Cruised on in on a Friday, it was 80's dj night, we got there around 10 pm and it was dead.  Not a soul in there crept a bartender, owner/doorman and dj.  The place was spotless, amazingly clean for a SS bar... Too bad there weren't any people.  Not sure of the laws that govern bars but they allow u to smoke until the 'non-smokers' show up and they take the ash trays away.  I can't fault the place- clean as HELL, well lit, full bar, but not very well attended.  I'm sure it picks up later in the night."}
{"text":"A local dive bar - that's exactly what you get! But they have a decent bar selection (such as 2X IPA) and during the holiday season, they have the most delicious and amazing PUDDING SHOTS, you HAVE to get them!  Great for a fun friday night with locals and friends!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: 80s Night is no longer here on Fridays. (It has moved to the Smiling Moose down on Carson Street.)

BUT! This is still a great little spot with cheap drinks and lovely barstaff. So still come here to check it out :)"}
{"text":"Back Open (under new management) as of April 24th. We stopped in last night for wings. We tried the honey BBQ, garlic parm & the Jag sauce (sort of like general tsos). I loved all the wings but i will say the garlic parm were amazing! The wings were a great size and we really enjoyed them. The bartender also offered us a pudding shot and it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Went here because it was near a friends' place and our last night in Pittsburgh.  It happened to be the last game of the Penguins NHL Playoff run (sorry fellas) and also an 80s night with a DJ playing music to barely anyone.  But what I gather from this place is that it is very neighborhoody and literally everyone is local.  

They don't have a \"full\" bar but most of the clientele seems of the Bud Light persuasion.  Seems like a cool place to chill if this is your hood.  Sports bar-ish but more divey than anything else."}
{"text":"I had a seriously shocking amount of fun here last night.  More fun than I've had in a bar in a looooong time.   But I might be biased, because....

WE WON TRIVIA NIGHT!  WOOHOO!!

It was my first trivia night here at the Jaggerbush.  We got there around 730ish and it was easy to get a table, but just before and after 8pm, they filled up quickly.  Trivia got started around 830.  The dude who runs trivia night was really funny and very muscular, and let me and my friend touch his biceps.  So that's a plus.  He had a great sense of humor, the whole place was really high energy.  He also played seriously random and awesome music in between quiz questions.  Like the best and weirdest iPod in the world on shuffle.

Trivia is really fun, and took about 90 minutes for the whole game.  It's well-organized, with a wide variety of questions so you don't need to be an expert in one genre or another to do well.  You get to assign point values to your answers, so if you're really sure about one category you can assign the most points, and if you are making a random wild guess you can assign fewer points.

Anyway it was challenging and exciting and WE WON so that rules.  I had to leave right after the game was over so I do not know what our reward was, but I'm told we get a gift card to the bar or something like that, so it's incentive to come back for more trivia!

Bottled beer was $3.50, bartenders were friendly.  Atmosphere is divey casual but very lively on Tuesday Trivia night.  TVs to watch various Pittsburgh teams play sports.  And they still allow smoking, unfortunately, so I smelled like nasty gross ashtray at the end of the night, which I hate.  UGH city smoking ban please?

But yeah, I'd totally come back for trivia, any week.  Not sure I'd come just to hang out, given the cigarette factor, but the trivia night is solid."}
{"text":"Pudding shots. Jukebox. Sunday pot-luck for Stillers games. The best affordable tap-list in South Side, always changing and always featuring something for everyone. The staff is friendly and the bar-food is satisfying--not to mention the beautiful historic building (it's been a bar for over a century and features a built-in wooden barback as well as the classic South Side ceilings).

I spent many nights in grad school taking my work to the Jaggerbush to write papers and drink my stress away for good form.

I spent even more nights putting \"Wagon Wheel,\" \"Confessions Part II,\" and \"I Believe in a Thing Called Love\" on the jukebox.

Best dive in South Side. If you're coming in for a night out, hit up this place first for a relaxed atmosphere; or hit it up last for some good old fashioned debauchery and pudding shots."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this bar closed a couple months ago. But I still wanted to give it a review because I fell in love with the place. It was a local bar with cheap beers and great specials (2 dollar you call it every evening). Huge projector screen for pens games, but most importantly the staff and owner were great people. I was really sad to see they closed down."}
{"text":"Ah, The Jaggerbush. This spot is one I've been to a handful of times and it's always been a good experience. So many South Side bars, so little time to Yelp them all. I like that DJ Samurai does his thing there on Friday nights. He's truly one of the best and that to me that says a lot about Jaggerbush. Reasonable drink prices with good specials and good bar crew."}
{"text":"I've gone to a couple of 'quiz nights', Tuesdays at 8pm here at the Jaggerbush.  They have absolutely wonderful beer specials 5-7pm ($2 any beer), and cheap drinks all the time.  The quiz night is especially fun, and high energy with a young crowd, and its free. Winners even get gift certificates  The bartenders are attentive, but the place still does allow smoking, so be prepared.  I haven't been overwhelmed by the smoke, but I still smell like an ashtray when I've left.
I'll be coming back for the beer and the trivia, and suggest you try it out! 

I've also been hungry enough to grab some fries here, I won't do that again.  This is a place for drinking, not for eating, which is where it lost its star."}
{"text":"I'm going to add Jaggerbush to the list of my favorite bars. Why not? Bartenders are friendly, drinks are cheap, and the food is decent for such a small place. 

I regularly attend trivia night Tuesdays at 8pm (in 2012). I won't say much about the trivia because others have already commented, but I will say this. To those of you wishing to attend, try to keep your groups small. If you push together the very few tables this establishment has to make room for your group of ten (most of whom will never arrive), you are a douchebag. I have it on good authority that the staff hate you and so do other teams who wish to sit. (Steps off soapbox).

I like going to Jagger on other nights to drink with friends. Surprisingly, they get very busy even on weekday evenings! Thus, I try to avoid Jagger on weekends because it gets overly crowded and smoky. Be advised, smoke-haters. Jaggerbush is not for you. Try a pudding shot (made daily) and their pancakes and bacon shot at least once. Take a bite of the (real) bacon strip, do your shot, finish the bacon. Yum!

Aside from the occasional smoke, I don't have any qualms with Jaggerbush. However, if you have pediophobia, try not to glance upwards while sitting at the bar."}
