{"text":"Excellent ice cream shop. Customer service is top notch. Very friendly and welcoming! Great decor and a bunch of table top games to play with family or friends while you enjoy some Thrifty ice cream or one of their other great, unique creations. Monday nights are $1 scoops as well, and they are more often than not generous in their scoop sizes."}
