{"text":"I just recently relocated to Vegas from Oregon and was in search of a new pho restaurant for my families Sunday outings and it's safe to say we've located it ! The customer service is excitement and the food is fantastic ! I found them while just cruising and super ecstatic I did ! I will be returning my business next Sunday"}
{"text":"Noticed this place had just opened up near my house so I thought I would give it a try. All I can say is the food is           PHO-REAKING awesome!! Started with the spring rolls and they came with a peanut sauce that was perfect! Then I had 3 item pho with the meatballs, flank and rare steak which was perfectly seasoned and very tasty. This will definitely be my number one spot for pho from now on!"}

{"text":"To start off I'm a pho fanatic. I've been eating pho ever since I can remember so I'm very particular down to the finest detail.  To get started, the establishment seems liked it was remodeled. It was very spacious with new furniture and looked very modern. However the air conditioner was not working and they had us sit next to the portable swamp coolers. My dad and I were a little hesitant to eat there. I mean who want to eat pho in a restaurant with no A/C in the 110 degree heat. We should of listened to our guts and left but their 20% off grand opening special convinced us to stay. Oh how we should of left! So let's break down the experience.  Service. 3/5 The server sat us and took our drinks promptly. I guess that was because we were the only ones at the time. (We were there at peak dinner time @6.) He recommended we get the combination pho saying the portion was pretty good so we took his advice and went for that. He was quick to refill our drink but that's about everything that went right. The service was a little bit above average, but nothing worth memorable.   Food. 1/5 So my stomach is about average, however I can defiantly say they were skimping out when it came to the portion size. I'm guessing the server didnt' have a great sense when it came to the portion size when he said it was pretty big. My dad and I left unsatisfied and had room to eat more. The only positive thing about the pho was that the broth was super HOT (temperature) which I like. However, the broth was very salty and seemed to have a high concentration of MSG. I had to drink about 3 cups of water at the restaurant and had to guzzle down 2 more bottles of water when I got home. The noodles were not chewy and pretty much broke apart as I tried to pick it up with my chopsticks. The meat had a very chewy texture and the tendon was like trying to chew on rubber. The pho was a disaster in my opinion.   Overall I was very disappointed and left with a horrible first impression. I do however give everything a second chance, so I will give this place another try once it's a little bit more established. Sadly the pho was defiantly not \"Five Stars\" and it will be a while for me to come back."}
