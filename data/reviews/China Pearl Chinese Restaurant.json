{"text":"This place is still great! Won ton soup, rice and noodles are our staples and are always prepared to perfection. Also had a few shrimp dishes, they are equally as good. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We've had 3 good lunches at China Pearl--smaller portions and reasonable prices. Then we made the mistake of taking six of our friends there for dinner.  There were two other people there while we were there.  Since we knew their dinners were bigger portions, my husband and I wanted to split dinner.  The waitress/owner insisted that the portions would be too small and wouldn't allow us to split.  We tried to convince her we were not that hungry, to no avail.  We all ordered individual portions and received our meals at least 5-10 minutes apart. The man who served the food was rude to everyone and got the orders all confused.  The food was warm but not hot.  They must have been microwaved.  We were so embarrassed because we had recommended the restaurant to our friends.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place should be closed or IS going to close, went there, no one inside, red flag #1
The internet menu and what you see when the give youva menu are totally different, higher prices! And when they gave us the menu, they never asked us what we wanted to drink, never again!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese restaurant and I have tried MANY in the area. They have a great menu. My personal favorites are the Twice Cook Chicken and the Yu Shan Shrimp. They are affordable and the owners are very personable. I've been there about half a dozen times between dine in and carry out and they know my order. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves chinese food!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here after everyone one of her games and get the General Tso's chicken. Best Chinese food in town and a nice small restaurant vibe. The two workers are very friendly and service is great. Absolute favorite restaurant could not recommend enough."}
{"text":"Lunch was excellent. Price was good, food was better than expected, service was great. I found my new lunch spot for Chinese food. Real Chinese folks too as we chatted it up."}
{"text":"I often come here for lunch specials ($6.55 for the combo plate) and am always surprised by the lack of customers. In speaking with the owner, many of the surrounding stores have closed due to rent being raised so I think they are easily overlooked. I like that the combo portions are sized perfectly for one person and come with a soup selection, entr√©e choice, one crab Rangoon, and one spring roll. Normally I order a beef entree, but the last visit I ordered the cashew chicken combo which was tasty and fresh. The service is great and the owners are personable."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. Since we moved to Arizona it has been hard to find a decent Chinese food restaurant. We tried China palace and everyone in the family was happy with all the food. I am a huge fried rice fan and it was great!"}
{"text":"We had the broccoli beef, chicken fried rice, and orange chicken. The broccoli beef was great, crisp veggies and tender beef in a not too salty sauce. Chicken fried rice was awesome, chunks of tender chicken with crisp bean sprouts and some veggies. Hubby was not a fan of the orange chicken because the breading was the soft style, but it tasted really good. Delivery was fast, and food was fairly priced. Looking forward to trying out more dished!"}
{"text":"Very good egg flower soup! And authentic dishes... Staff is awesome."}
{"text":"We love this little hole in the wall, mom & pop. We were disappointed when our favorite \"China China\" permanently closed after a fire a couple years ago.   It was about a one-mile drive and the owners/management was so excellent, always treating us special and the food was great.  Well, the universe takes away and gives and we are so happy to have discovered China Pearl. It is run/owned by very nice people. We love the food and service. Everything is delicious and freshly prepared. We are big Wor Won Ton fans and it is great at this place.  Another personal favorite is pot stickers which are outstanding here.  We order a lot of variety and always plan on taking home plenty of leftovers, good for a couple more meals.  General Tso's Chicken is great here.  We have loved everything we have ever ordered here over the past couple years. DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Me and my gf always order from them and we are never disappointed. Yesterday we finally went to the restaurant and ate there. The owners are very nice in the store and on the phone."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in Gilbert!
Easy to find in the ValVista /Baseline Fry's shopping center. Family owned and run.
Food is consistently good every time for the past 10 plus years we have eaten here."}
{"text":"We ordered a variety of things and price was, $8.95 a dish...wasn't bad.

Shrimp with lobster sauce.  My daughter said it was delicious/she loved it and I have to trust her.   (The smell, if you don't like seafood, will put you off eatting dinner-esp if you are just trying to get a pic for Yelp, lol.)

Chicken Fried rice.  I I ordered this with no vegetables. It came out with no vegetables. I loved it. The chicken was moist and the rice came out perfectly cooked. Can't ask for more than that.

Mongolian beef. This is relatively spicy. I love spicy and for me this was a little more spicy than I was prepared for. It was still good.

General Tao chicken. This was a little on the burned side. Even so it still tasted OK. I love the sauce that it came in. It was not breaded which was a nice surprise.

Cheese rangoons these were absolutely fantastic. They went so fast I forgot to get a picture of them. The orange sauce that came with them was really thick like gelatin. I'm not sure why and I'm not used to that.

Potstickers.... These came out on the burnt side, as the pic shows. They weren't that tasty. I wouldn't let it stop me from going ordering them a second time though. But if this was something that is normal,  I might reconsider.

White rice, it's rice and cooked correctly.   The bag was packed with all the necessary supplies.

The diner is clean and the staff is really great.  The order came out quickly. This was my first time here and I ordered takeout.  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I lived in Tempe. Always open seating, consistently good food and the price is right. Can't wait to visit again when I am back in town this winter!"}
{"text":"Good: The food is almost always great, and the other times it's good. I've never had a plate that I said, \"meh\" to yet. When I call for delivery they always answer the phone within seconds. All of the staff I've had the pleasure to talk to are friendly enough for it being so busy. Their website is easy enough to navigate and to put an order together before calling.

Bad: It can be a little pricey if you are ordering for more than two people. If the prices were down just a little bit I'd give them 5 stars.

Other Thoughts: The driver for their deliveries is the man! He's always very friendly and indulges me when I want to chit-chat with him."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. The food was good and the service was excellent. We got our food in a timely manner, it was hot and delicious. The two people who waited on us worked very hard. It appeared that the were doing everything in the place. It's a very small place but comfortable. However, if you are looking for a lush atmosphere then this isn't the place. Very clean. They appear to do a lot of takeout along with dine in. Well done China Pearl."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean and ingredients are fresh. Grew up in NY where there are so many choice Chinese restaurants. Their house fried rice, Wor Wonton and Egg Fu Young is wonderful. Cashew Chicken is crunchy and generous portions. They will also prepare a dish lower in oil and fat if you are diet conscious."}
{"text":"I love you guys!!! Amazing fried rice. Wonderful place because it is well maintained and friendly service. Most Chinese places in AZ have sub par food and less than sanitary conditions. China Pearl exceeds those expectations."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese food goes, this place is pretty good for what I had. I ordered the house lo mein, tangerine chicken, Mongolian beef, and egg drop soup. The service was wonderful and the lo mein is probably the best I've had around here. The Mongolian beef, however, was not very good. Didn't like it. It's seasoned with WAY too much black pepper and definitely not something I'll be ordering again. But that's to be expected of any menu. You're not going to like everything you order, but I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I feel bad for writing this review the people really nice but I have to give one star for the niceness and 0 stars for the food and way overpriced for what I got. Almost $10 for a tiny portion of of what they think of Chinese food And the two hillbilly gentleman that walked in they gave them a ticker-tape parade and giant portions of food. I felt a little insulted when they gave these guys High Praise And when I walked in it was just a nice hello. Don't go there . Tokyo Joe's is right down the street I don't know if it's a good place to go but it looks really awesome or raw sushi or Pei Wei's or anywhere else even Subway cuz you'll  save your money or even save your money because for $10 a plate they put it better put more meat than what they gave me and it was advertised for only $6 a meal"}
{"text":"Great delivery times and the staff all speak English very well, which can be frustrating to place a phone order when they can't. The food is always fresh and delicious, sometimes can be a bit oily though, but it's peanut oil so, meh. 
If you want Chinese in the Val vista/US 60 area of Mesa, they'll have what you want, guaranteed. And special requests are filled, without a problem."}
{"text":"I like this place for the fact its less than a mile from my home an if Im being SUPER LAZY the deliver quickly. The crab puffs are bomb, my kiddos love the tangerine chicken and I've yet to order something that wasn't good from here. Always friendly staff and quick service.  Thanks China Pearl"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese Food! If you live close like I do they deliver."}
{"text":"All of our entrees and sides were great.  We did ask for extra veggies in some of our dishes and felt that we didn't get many veggies at all.  For the amount of food we got, the prices could have been a little lower.  

The food was ready quickly for our pick up order and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Food: 3/10. Too much sauce and very little meat with the combo. 
Service: 8/10. Was great, they were very nice and personal. 
Atmosphere: 3/10. Hot and muggy, but at least they have big gold fish."}
{"text":"We went there for the lunch special.  I had broccoli chicken and my mom had vegetarian.  Both were drowned in a salty sauce.  I recommend getting the sauce on the side.  Otherwise, the food was ok.   Mine came in a smallish bowel.  If you don't want to get full at lunch time, it's perfect.

Service was very friendly and fast.  Prices were ok for the amount served.  It's pretty quiet in there, so people can hear your conversation if anyone pays attention at all."}
{"text":"Small place located in a strip mall.  There are tables and they take  your order but it is nothing fancy.

the food is great, fresh ingredients, good portions at excellent prices.

If you like east coast egg fu young, this is the place for you.  The pork fried rice more like the east coast as well.

Lunch special prices start at $2.99.   3 of us had dinner and were stuffed with some left over for $30."}
{"text":"Ok so I just Basically left this place 15 mins ago.  I got the pepper steak lunch special for $7.20.  I gave a $1 tip for a pick up order.  This was my first time ordering from this place, being new to the area.  I ordered here because the online menu looked good and so did some of the reviews.  Whoever wrote a good review for this place is either being paid to or needs to go shoot themselves for thinking this food is in any way good at all.  When arriving home i look inside and I was shocked that the amount of food they give you is basically only good enough for a 10 year old child (it was not 7 dollars worth of chinese food) .  Next came the taste test.... The fried rice was NOT fried rice, it was just basically rice with soy sauce... freaking disgusting.   The beef, which for the whole order consisted of basically 6 little strips of beef floating on a soup (only way I can describe it) of sauce.  I ate it because it cost me money and I'm still freaking HUNGRY!!!!  Seriously not going back to this place again, If I could take my tip back I would.......This was suppose to be a treat for me today, but ended up being a total failure.  Can someone recommend a good Chinese \"to go\" place thats worth it near Gilbert?"}
{"text":"Mmmm...this place is good. I love their orange chicken. Good prices and the people are super friendly. Anything with shrimp in it is great."}
{"text":"Great food.  Super nice owners. Delivery was fantastic. So sad that they decided to close their doors."}
{"text":"Got it deliver. Sesame chicken was great! Little cold because of having it delivered but good! Will defiantly order from them again!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and tried based on Yelp and Google reviews...good food, tastes fresh, we also liked crisp bean sprouts in fried rice (nice addition), staff friendly...we will definitely be back.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wife and I have loved this place for over 5 yrs.  We've never been disappointed.  While we aren't Chinese food connoisseurs, we've found most other Chinese restaurants seem to serve veggies and meat that taste rubbery or out of can.  I'm not sure what others are talking about regarding prices and portions. We always have leftovers if we get two dishes.  Sweet & sour soup is tasty.  Very friendly owners and staff."}
{"text":"I have never posted a review while I was still at the restaurant, but with how good this place is, I had no choice.  We got a half order of crab puffs -  big mistake!  Get a full order.  Two even.  It's delicious.  For the main course, we got general tsao's chicken, the orange chicken, mongolian beef, and the chicken/shrimp/beef fried rice.  All were amazing, the best that I've had in a long, long time.  The mongolian was slightly too peppery for my wife's taste, but perfect for me.  The owners were very friendly and the atmosphere was great - relaxing, clean, and comfortable. 

The restaurant itself is slightly hard to find, it's next to the fry's on Val Vista and Baseline, but the stores face in toward the lake and not out toward the street.  This is definitely my goto place for great food in the east valley."}
{"text":"Gave it my usual 3 tries. First time had delivery and was really impressed, fast, great food. 2nd time we called for delivery, no deliveries that day. Started our order and they were out of most of the order. Third time we went to the restaurant. The staff had a loud, rude argument with the only other customers there.  We asked for straws for our drinks, they had run out.  The portions were so small we left hungry.  Not going back there ever again.  How do you run out of food or supplies with a Frys 2 doors down from you????"}
{"text":"If you like a good \"hole in the wall,\" and really excellent high quality food, you will love the China Pearl. The food there is very well made and they use very high quality ingredients. If you go, be sure to ask for the salt and pepper shrimp (not on the menu) and be ready for a real treat."}
{"text":"We do take-out about once a week. Owners are great and very friendly. Food is always fresh, hot and delicious. All of the dishes we've tried are seasoned properly and well-portioned. Our orders usually have special instructions and China Pearl always gets it right. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"China Pearl is the closest takeout place to my house so I've eaten their food numerous times. It's really pretty good. The egg rolls are decent, not the best I've ever had but fairly tasty. The dumplings are good. The egg foo young is good. The tangerine and orange chicken is good. The fried rice is good. I usually get veggie fried rice and I wish it had water chestnuts and really just more vegetables - the diced carrots and peas seem so \"frozen food.\" Load it up with mushrooms, pea pods, bok choy, broccoli, etc. 

On the plus side, I recently ordered shrimp fried rice - and it was really loaded with tasty shrimp. So, kudos!

I had been a big fan of their lo mein soft noodles but the last time I ordered the noodles, they came with long pieces of essentially raw carrot mixed in that got stuck in my teeth and made it hard to swallow the noodles. It was a bit strange. I couldn't get a nice forkful of noodle deliciousness without crunching or being stabbed by the raw carrot slices. Even though the noodle taste was delicious I ended up tossing my takeout container because the texture made it inedible. 

I do like their service, always very friendly, courteous and fast. It's a pretty good neighborhood \"divey\" Chinese takeout place. It does have tables and you can eat in but it's usually deserted. Most people get takeout or delivery.

They close at 9 so this is not a late night place."}
{"text":"GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!  SAVE YOURSELF!!  Worst.food.ever.  I should have went with my gut when not one soul was in the restaurant.  Placed my order anyway because we had a rough day and we just needed some comfort food. Let's just say I ended up having to make dinner after I got home with my to-go order.  AWFUL doesn't even begin to describe the shit that we were given.  $25 dollars of crap.  You'd be better off going to panda.  I've had bad Chinese food before, but this places top them all.

Ordered:
Orange Chicken
Veg fried rice
egg rolls
crab puffs"}
{"text":"I've been there twice for dinner and lunch both times the food was grose and practically unedible if you like quality food. This last time the dinner portion was so small it was not with the $10. I could have gone to Panda Express across the street for better quality food, less expensive and more portion"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service.  I had the Cashew Chicken and it had the most flavor of any Chinese restaurant I've had in the east valley."}
{"text":"Ok, was craving Chinese food, and being new to the area decided to yelp a couple places near us. UGH. Wish i tried a different place.

At first I was excited because I thought I had found THE place to go to for my Chinese food cravings. When i walked into the restaurant it was totally empty. The cook was eating soup and three other dishes at one of the tables and the hostess was sitting down reading a magazine. She totally jumped up and pretended to wipe a table as soon as she saw me but the cook seemed lost in his own world. She handed me a menu and it looked good so I ordered. The hostess had to yell something to the cook which woke him up, and he ran to the kitchen and started cooking. After 10 mins my order which consists of 4 dishes was hot ready and packed to go. I was happy until we got home and dug in. The dishes were greasy, tasted like a metal wok and soaked in soy sauce. I lost my appetite. The only thing I ended up eating was the egg rolls. Even the fortune cookie was stale.

If you want good chinese food, you can do better than here."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Small family owned restaurant.  Awesome egg rolls and egg drop soup...gotta get them everytime.  I don't usually try different items at Chinese restaurants, but here I have...and now have have a few favorites.  Highly recommend.    They deliver too!!"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried from this place is amazing! The walnut shrimp, lemon chicken... I always have a hard time deciding what to try next. My favorite Chinese food in all of the Phoenix area!!! A must try."}
{"text":"There was a piece of tin foil in my food. Would have rather ate Panda Express and I don't like Panda Express. Food came out in 5 secs, how could it be fresh. Guess I should have not wasted my 20 dollars, didn't leave a tip, which I never do. Sorry but you shouldn't have tin in your food... Ewww"}
