{"text":"Just went here last night with the SO and some friends for a New Year's celebration.  My friend got everyone tickets for a private event they were holding.  $30 for a buffet in their upstairs dining area with a glass of champagne.  The area it's in is definitely on the sketchy side.  Did not feel unsafe walking to the car but had to be aware of your surroundings.

Stepping through the front door the staff was inviting.  The hostess led our group upstairs and sat us at a table in a small alcove with a window overlooking the street.  The table was prepared with all the essentials to have a fun night. There were hats, noise makers, and party blow outs.  The wait staff were very attentive by immediately filling water glasses and presenting drink menus.  Between clearing tables and refilling glasses there was a fire which the staff continually stoked giving the room a soft smoky smell reminiscent of a camp fire.  Our waiter came over several times throughout the meal checking on us and was able to easily make conversation to enhance our experience.  He was very accommodating to our designated driver by making him a Shirley Temple (on the house) for the midnight toast.

The buffet was all types of food and anyone could find something to eat.  There was a salad with feta and grapes, build your own taco (soft and hard shell), build your own slider, spicy pasta, breaded chicken and a beef option.  The slider burgers were perfectly cooked.  Pink in the center so the life wasn't completely grilled out of it.  

Once again the wait staff shined as they cleared empty plates and used utensils quickly keeping the table from becoming cluttered.  Almost simultaneously as someone was clearing off the dirties, other staff were replenishing us with new forks and knives. 

Then there was the desserts.  I, unfortunately, was not quick enough to grab a cannoli but was lucky enough to watch as 2 of my friends were finishing them off and commenting how delicious they were.  I did get to grab a brownie covered in coconut that turned out to be my highlight of the night.  

After dinner, while everyone was recovering from the meal, the waiter was kind to take pictures so that we could have mementos from the night.  

The drink menu was more complicated than I am familiar with.  Ordering the Mandy Panky was a wise choice as it had so many levels of flavors.  I wonder if the flavors would have fit better as a shot as it took me quite a while to finish one.

Upon paying the bill there were cards for other events they will be holding in the future (scotch tasting, Valentine's Day meal).  Could definitely see myself back there for one of their other events.

The downstairs is a normal bar and has a pretty cool look as the space has been converted from an old house.  The exposed brick give it that classic Cleveland bar neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"5 stars don't come easy, but Graffiti really is \"as good as it gets\" in Cleveland. Graffiti's burger is definitely a contender for \"best burger in Cleveland,\" as it combines salty, sweet, sour, and spicy flavors with the meaty goodness of a high quality beef patty. Additionally, where else in Cleveland can one find fried chicken livers with a side of chicken liver mousse, and a chicken fat aioli? Chef Okin has a knack for layering flavors in a way that yields a complex dish without being inaccessible to those who shun the \"foodie\" label. Call it haute bar food? I don't know, but everything I've had, which is to say damn near everything on the menu, has been spot on. Unquestionably one of the most compelling (and humble) chefs on the Cleveland scene right now."}
{"text":"The ambiance on the patio cannot be beat. Great summer evening out. The food and drinks were outstanding. Creative twists on menu items making them delicious and savory. There were 6 of us and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals and drinks. Staff is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great experience!  Service was very friendly, food was delicious, and drinks were excellent.  Since its summer we sat on the patio which is very nice and scenic, yet private since it is fenced in. Will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner on the patio. Great atmosphere with a nice view facing out towards Edgewater beach (no view of the water). Great service and a yummy sangria special. Love the burrito and the Fat Boy 2.0 is required dessert. Deep fried cookie dough!!"}
{"text":"Brian Okin has done it again!  Thankfully this time his restaurant isn't 30 minutes outside of Cleveland. As usual, his menu presents a serious dilemma. Everything looks amazing. We stared with the potato skins, then the grainfitti salad. I had Shepards Pie and Molly had Chicken Parm.  Both were absolutely delicious.  We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Maybe I am delusional in thinking that this place tucked in a neighborhood next to Battery Park is still a well kept secret. There is still no patio in town that is nicer and more pleasant. Graffiti is a a great spot for sharing a few apps and enjoying a sunny afternoon. 

This place is run by people who know what they are doing and are truly passionate about everything that comes out of their kitchen being great."}
{"text":"Graffiti has never disappointed me and continues to surprise me! The chefs here are talented and really have some unique takes on classic dishes. This time we went for brunch, and it's now my go to brunch place in Cleveland. 

Chorizo Pop Tarts? Yum. They're soft and crumble in your mouth. Served with guacamole. 

The Breakfast Board (charcuterie) has one cured egg yolk. Holy cow. That little egg yolk might have been my favorite part of the meal. It was soft and salty and so good! I could easily eat a whole bowl full of those things.

Breakfast Meatloaf. Fantastic. Served with gravy and cheddar grits. I'm not a huge fan of gravy, and I hate grits, and this dish made me love both. 

Monte Cristo. Pork tenderloin on top of french toast with a raspberry sauce and some type of cream. Very similar to chicken and waffles, but better! The pork tenderloin was cooked to perfection and was tender as can be. 

I was super sad to find out they took the Snickers Bread Pudding off the menu... WHY?! It was soooo good and one of the best desserts I've ever had. They replaced it with some smores thing. Lame. 

Also, they can't serve alcohol before 1pm--only beer and wine.

Still haven't been here for dinner, but will make it there eventually."}
{"text":"Very creative menu.  Had a delicious blueberry ginger sangria.  Shared appetizers with friends...the egg roll was outstanding but so was the rice cakes and pork ribs.  Had a delicious lemon curd and lavender panna cotta for dessert.  Will definitely come back to this restaurant and bring my husband.  He enjoys trying interesting and creative dishes.  Hats off to the chef and his staff."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this.. watched the chopped show and was excited to come for brunch.. but... eggs in both frittatas were cold and undercooked.  Ham and cheese frittata was pork roast and not ham with very little cheese.  Monte cristo was good but also was not warm.. sadly we would not come back."}
{"text":"Cute spot tucked into the battery park neighborhood . Food was delightful and cocktails were smooth. A well kept secret ."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the customer service is better. My mom got the salmon and thought it was a little undercooked so the chef came out to personally apologize and offered a dessert on the house. I recommend the Monte Cristo"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit and again we  had a phenomenal meal. Very interesting variety on the Sunday menu. Service was spot on. We will be back."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving is a tough act to follow, and Graffiti did a great job!

Located at the end of a residential street, Graffiti had a great vibe. Bold art on the wall, funky building materials and multiple floors, our party of six was tucked what seemed like the best seat in the house on the top floor in the corner at a round table. 

We sampled the chips and dip - chef's whim was - amazing - pesto and Parmesan w crostini. More crostini please, because I damn near licked the dip bowl! (So sophisticated!) My husband and I shared the beet salad: beets, pears and blue cheese. It was ok - my least favorite part of the meal. It wasn't as fresh as I would have liked. I had an excellent burrito with short rib: moist, tender and full of flavor. Ryan had the shepherd's pie and raved about the taste. We also split the Fat Kid 2.0, and if you're a fan of fried cookie dough, ice cream, whip cream and candy-covered chocolates, then you'll find a winner. As a whole it was delicious. 

The service was outstanding, and I appreciate something as simple as taking and replacing the used silverware. Truly enjoyable and attentive service. 

Ambience, service and a mostly delicious experience equaled a 4/5. Well done!"}
{"text":"We had a huge brunch spread that was a culinary Sunday morning dream! Comfort food with knowledge backing it up and cocktails that are as innovative as they are delicious. The service and staff are outstanding. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited Graffiti earlier this summer. The location has been several digs, including Snickers, which was one of the first restaurants at the beginning of the Gordon Square/Battery Park revival. It was a nice night so my wife and I sat on the back patio. I had a hamburger and it was one of the best I have ever had. The problem was my wife wanted a more complete meal, but the menu selections seemed to be better suited for winter in Cleveland, and on the heavy side for summer dining al fresco. After discussing this with a friend who lives nearby, she said she doesn't do Graffiti in the summer for the same reason. It has a lot going for it and we will be back when the weather gets colder."}
{"text":"Graffiti... What to say about this place. I guess I could go with a blow-by-blow with regards to what my impressions of the place were and how they evolved as the night/meal progressed.

Initially, I did have high hopes given the reviews, but the menu did seem to be a bit lacking and a bit weird, maybe even lacking true inspiration at first glance. But I figured, what the hell. Why not try it out. Maybe the food might be better than the menu is letting on.

Graffiti is a bit of a hole in the wall, with a patio in the gentrified area that is otherwise known as Battery Park. Parking is on the street. Good luck finding it, it's a bit tough to find parking if you want the car to be near the restaurant, despite the restaurant being really the only commercial space in the area.

Nothing really special about the place. Kind of a bar setup, but it's also set up to dine in like a lunch or dinner. My company and I ordered the calamari, charcuterie, shephard's pie, and oyster po'boy. Beer selection is decent, but we didn't take a part in the alcoholic offerings.

I've been sitting here and really have been trying to wrap my head around the food they served, but I can really best say that what they serve is stuff that is really hard for anyone to really screw up from a cooking standpoint. I'm not saying that Graffiti didn't get it wrong, but I feel like it tried to do interesting spins on more traditional dishes when given the opportunity to especially the po'boy and the shepard's pie. The charcuterie and calamari can't be messed up, really, with regards to prep. However, the bread served with the charcuterie seemed to deep fried or at least drenched with oil before being dehydrated crispy, as opposed to bread being spritzed with some oil and then baked crispy. In addition, the amount of bread was nowhere near enough to accompany the various meats on the platter, and a lot of the chicken paste (substitute pate?), sliced and cured meats (prosciutto, etc.) ended up being eaten straight, which was very salty and wasn't very appetizing. Calamari was acceptable and nothing to really write home about.

The main dishes were the big turnoff. I'm assuming that due to the mundane dishes that are the po'boy and the shepard's pie, they tried really hard to do their own spin on the dishes, and it really don't work all that well. The shepard's pie was a large chunk of braised lamb(???) placed on some root vegetables, a block of mashed potatoes, and maybe some small semblance of crust. (Inverted shepard's pie???) The lamb may have been braised and had some flavor, especially the outer portion, but it definitely wasn't moist as you'd expect it like coming from an actual shepard's pie. It was pretty darned dry, and within the cut of lamb, it doesn't taste much other than just gamey. It just felt that the shepard's pie was a completely wrong label for what was served. The fried oyster po'boy was just fried oyster stuck in a slice of folded white bread. Pomme frites that were supposed to be in the dish were deep fried julienned potatoes that are basically potato sticks and nowhere near the fries you'd expect from the description of the dish. The champagne greens were probably best part of the dish heavy on the vinaigrette. Overall, the po'boy was buried under the greens and matchstick potatoes as if saying \"good luck finding your po'boy and oysters.\" Honestly, it's as if hipsters were trying to cook, but were actually somewhat successful in cooking something, or cooks trying to cook like hipsters, which is even worse.

What probably gets me the most is that the foods they cook are those that have a high tolerance for being hard to screw up, yet for the price, you'd expect something different and really good, but it really isn't. It's almost like they're looking for inspiration in all the wrong places. As the result, my gut feeling looking at their menu online really was spot on. I'd give the restaurant a 2.5 for being decent eats and not screwing up the food, but I am also wanting to give a 1 star for being a restaurant that just doesn't have its stuff together, and really not wanting to come back here since it was so unsatisfying, especially for how much was spent for the dinner. So 2 stars it is, and, frankly, that's rounding up. Sorry, guys, but it just didn't work out for me or for the guest I had with me."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a previous reviewer. Graffiti is nothing like its old counterpart Reddstone. That's not a bad thing, but I found myself trying to compare the two and you can't. 

With that being said-service and food both were great. I had the \"monte cristo\" and my boyfriend had the chicken parm. Both were excellent but not what we expected. The chicken parm was a smaller piece of chicken without pasta, the monte cristo was an amazing maple glazed pork tenderloin but came with a large piece of bread, no side. So again, not a bad thing just different. Drinks were also good. 

If I compare this place on its own, it's fantastic. I gave it four stars because portions are pretty tiny. I don't have a huge appetite but I could have eaten more for sure. 

I think I'm just a little disappointed because really, I feel this area has SO many of these eclectic, fancy, small portion places. This isn't some place I would go once a week for dinner and drinks which I feel this area is lacking now."}
{"text":"Went for the Mother's Day brunch today.Great variety from apps,breakfast,and entrees. Young man carving was very informative on carving board and sauces.also able to answer questions on other choices. Glad we chose this brunch for today. 5 stars for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here in November and it was still 70 degrees out so we sat on the patio.  Really cool patio set up and lots of space.  We had some apps and entrees.  My wife had a pumpkin lasagna that was served in a pumpkin, which was cool and tasted great.  I had the pork belly BLT and it came with two large slices of pork belly.  Great service and vibe overall, would come back again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, if I could leave a zero star review I would.  I was a going to someone's going away party tonight.  I have had brunch there before so my first reaction was that I needed to eat before going for dinner.  My buddy said he had some good apps here in the last month so I should give it another try. Unfortunately, he was wrong.  We went early for a drink and apps before dinner.  Truth be told they were good.  I was almost excited for dinner.  Then dinner happened.  My buddy ordered the special, the waiter told us it was Faroe island salmon served over clam chowder.  In fact, the special was swordfish served over clam chowder.  Huge difference if you've ever eaten and/or enjoyed fish!  Wait for it...  The dish comes out and he asked if it's salmon.  It's not.  They say, they will rush a salmon dinner to him.  The word Rush was used very loosely!  It wasn't rushed; and by the way, it was completely raw.  I'm not sure how you can take that long to cook salmon and have it served completely raw.  I ordered a salad which was supposed to come with an Italian vinaigrette.  Note to self; I've eaten meals all over the world and have never eaten a vinaigrette that's base was mayo.  I will not be going back for anyone else's party or if someone pays me.  It's unfortunate because the location is amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped for small plates and drinks w friends. Rosemary popcorn brought out as a comp was savory and unique. Ordered potato skins app. Loaded w guacamole and chorizo, needed a little more chevre, but really tasty.  the French onion Gruyere cheese egg rolls were a real surprise...like a rolled up bowl of french onion soup. The chicken livers....divine with a trio of sauces carmelized onion, chicken fat Aoli, and apple liver pate and perfectly crispy chix livers combo. WOW....and the baguette toasts are the perfect compliment.  Lastly we got the oysters. very disappointed. tiny oysters that were all breading...really good batter just no oyster. shame and at more than $3 each I would expect better. the patio is cool, and actually thought about eating there on Dec 23 2015 be it was so ooh nice out. I recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Amazing! Food is amazing.  Service was amazing. Drinks are amazing. We got the rib appetizer, the Graffiti Burger and the Monte Cristo and the cereal dessert. Everything we tried was fantastic and had a unique twist (banana catsup, the crema on the Monte Cristo, ect.) Tried two cocktails, St*Ella*r, and Take a Chance on Me and both were amazing. Each were $10 or $11 but I thought they were fun, interesting and definitely worth it. The server, Tom, was awesome; super friendly, attentive, genuine and always smiling. Seemed to genuinely enjoy talking with us and working at Graffiti and that was great to see. Made our meal more enjoyable! Other workers who cleared plates, the hostess, ect. were also all very nice. Such a great addition to the neighborhood. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Over priced very small tasteless plates drinks over priced not very good service place looks very nice on the inside and outside so I am happy about the remolding being that I own property in the neighborhood but this place is way in over it's head they try to word everything to make it sound fancy but it's not impressive at all food is covered in garnish that looks like clickers and most of the ingredients do not go together it just looks nice seen a peak of there brunch menu and it is all over the place honestly I don't see it working out it's to much on the menu and unless they have 3 or more people on the line cooking I can't see food coming out in 10 min or less wish this place the best but honestly I give them 2 years"}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner date with the girlfriend. It was a long weekend of partying so I drank water with this one. Had heard good things so we thought we'd try it out. Never had been to Reddstone but from what I hear there haven't been many decor changes.

Started with the chips and dip- apparently this app changes, it was homemade pork rinds with a sour cream based dip- tasty 

The waiter was super quirky but fun. He had an obvious passion for this place and the owner/chefs.  He encouraged us to try the graffiti artist- an appetizer sampler,  We chose the pb&j wings, ribs, and potato skins.  All outstanding. The wings blew me away.  Tender inside, crispy outside, just perfect.

We split a blt salad- the pork belly was delicious. Had a \"cereal\" dessert to finish it off.

We never made it to entrees which was fine with us.  Everything we had was unique, well executed, and most importantly delicious.  This place exceeded any expectations I had."}
{"text":"Food poisoning off the shepherds pie... not going back. Service is good and so is the atmosphere. I loved the place."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out based on Yelp reviews as part of our drive through Cleveland. The food is solidly four-stars. Visual presentation is great though and everything does look yummy. Service was friendly during the meal but limited in terms of greeting and saying goodbye. You also get (instead of bread) a small bag of popcorn to start off the meal.

I enjoyed the patio seating, but unfortunately spotted some mosquitos and insects the night we dined there (there was a dead mosquito in our tealight holder, which had not been relit). I wonder if they could look into addressing that issue. 

We are devoted dog parents and appreciate places that allow pups to be a dinner guest. At the same time, it may be helpful to have a dedicated places for dogs and their parents to sit. We were seated near the bar and another patron's dog kept coming up and placing its paws on my legs, begging for food. While I am used to this with my own enterprising pups, I can imagine how uncomfortable this could be for others. I saw wait staff patting dogs which can give off a concerning image in terms of hygiene. Another dog owner had his pup sitting on a chair at a dining table which only reinforced that concern. I hate myself for bringing this up but in a small patio space like this, I think some people who are thinking of going to this restaurant should be aware and consider this (especially if you're going with people who are afraid of dogs, etc.)."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant! For those of you who have never been to the area your GPS is not misleading you. This place is in the middle of a neighborhood.

Now don't get me wrong I really liked Reddstone but I really like this new take on the place! The owners made the inside of the restaurant much more inviting! I was so happy to see that they changed the windows upstairs to bring in natural light. The most surprising thing about this new restaurant is that it wasn't more crowded on a Friday night! 

My friends and I were seated upstairs near the fireplace (because yes last week it snowed again)! We were the only ones dining upstairs for the first hour and that was quite alright because we were able to be our loud noisy selves. Our waiter has tried pretty much everything on the menu and was able to recommend some dishes to us. He also informed us that they will start having specials in the next week or two (sorry, no happy hour though).

Free Popcorn to start you out with your drinks. The flavor of the day when I went was tomato cheddar. Our group of four started out with the Graffiti Artist in which you get to pick 3 items. We tried the PB&J Wings, French Onion Rolls and the Potato Skins. The French Onion Egg Rolls taste exactly how you think they would, like french onion soup and delicious! The PB&J Wings were interesting. The wings have a great crunchy skin and are moist on the inside but we wanted the peanut butter sauce to have a little more umph! The potato skins were good but I can't review these as well since I do not like goat cheese. The potato was cooked perfectly and the chorizo tasted great but this is not something I would normally order.

For our entrees we ordered the Monte Cristo, Graffiti Burger and Omelette. All were fantastic. The omelette looks better than any other omelette I have ever seen. It was extremely fluffy and not browned on the outside. Just a note for those ordering the Monte Cristo, it is a deconstructed Monte Cristo not an actually sandwich. Eat all the ingredients together and Yowza! is it fabulous!

We of course also got 2 desserts to share: the Fat Kid and Snickers Bread Pudding. The Fat Kid was a little underwhelming but the bread pudding I would definitely order again!

Make sure to check this place out! The food is great, the mixed drinks are delectable and the service is wonderful. I can't wait until patio season!"}
{"text":"Our food was delicious and the atmosphere is fun. Only issue we had was that our waitress, who was very sweet - continued to take our plates and drinks before we were done. We soon realized that she was switching shifts but by then, Amy had taken our apps before they were done, my husband's meal plate early & a friend's drink with wine still in it. That was a bit disappointing. But other than that, it was a great experience. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to check out this place. I've heard only fabulous things about their original restaurant Cork & Cleaver but unfortunately haven't been. Since Graffiti is close to me I had to see what it was about! Absolutely loved everything - the food, staff, and atmosphere. I had been to Reddstone several times before and they definitely updated the inside a decent amount. Turned the upstairs into dining with a nice lil fireplace. The bar area looks pretty much the same but with a few updates. Love the 'graffiti' artwork and bright accent colors they use. Can't wait for the patio to open. 

The food was on another level. We got the ribs to share and they were fall off the bone so good. For entrees we got the burger and the Monte Cristo- both of them were not ordinary at all. The burger had so many different flavors that all complimented so well and was done to perfection. The Monte Cristo by reading the description you would think would be very sweet but no no everything went perfectly together and the pork was so tender. For dessert we got the snickers bread pudding which was just yum. Really wanted to splurge and get 'the fat kid' but for two people seemed a bit too much - when I come back with 4 or more people it's going down! 

The staff was so wonderful and friendly and knowledgable. Seriously great experience and I will be back so many times - have a feeling this place will be hard to get a table on weekends in the coming months."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday brunch. Nice crowd on the patio. Had the fries appetizer then beet salad and frittata. All very good but very salad was little light on ingredients. Service is what brought it down to a 4. Felt like waiter had a late nite or something. Didn't introduce himself. Had to ask for refills. Walked passed check with CC 4 times. We finally paid in cash. Will return but maybe on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, great patio, and yummy drinks. I'd say our device was fine - not awesome. Our waitress didn't seem to know how to handle our kids but I called and asked in advance. They said they were family friendly. Anyway, we had our dogs with us and one guy brought over water bowls for them. Very cool. Tables also had a small bag of spiced popcorn as a free app for when you get there. I had the linguine with peas. It was very good!  My husband's walleye was a huge portion. My kids had the chicken Parmesan, which I thought was good, but not really what my kids wanted."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant owned by same people as Cork & Cleaver in Broadview Heights. They have a limited menu buy everything I tried was delicious.
The chicken parmesan is a small portion but very different than your typical chicken parm- it is shredded dark meat chicken confit that is slowly baked over a bed of home made spatzel & marinara sauce. The chicken was tender, juicy and delicious.
The snickers bread pudding was amazing- has chunks of snickers and peanuts in it served with vanilla ice cream. 
I also tried the moscow mule which was good- as expected. Service was excellent, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Love love love graffiti. Amazing food, amazing people, great cocktails, great wine list, great patio (dog friendly). The special tasting they have are always awesome. When they first opened we were a little apprehensive. A lot of the dishes are \"deconstructed\" which threw us off the first time we went. Once we tried a few things we were hooked. Good happy hour specials (food and drink). Parking is always easy to find if you're driving.  Great patio again but also chill place to grab a cocktail in the middle of winter. Also, all day brunch on Sundays is fantastic."}
{"text":"Oh!!!! My!!!!
This was a great find thanks to the other yelp reviews. 

The hubby and I needed  a meal on Sunday afternoon. So turned to yelp and graffiti stood out. 

Atmosphere is old school with enough funk to make it comfortable. 

The pear cider with butterscotch schnapps was out of this world! We enjoyed this with our chorizo pop tarts. Guacamole was perfect. 

Hubby enjoyed the breakfast meatloaf. Good portion so some was in the doggy bag. I feasted on the chicken confit and waffles. Served with butter and maple syrup to increase the decadence. Unbelievably delicious!   And yes some of it was in the go bag too. 

Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Brian and Giuseppe put together a customized rehearsal dinner menu on their awesome patio for me, that had some critical guests raving.  They are as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, drinks and atmosphere!!!! Could eat here every night!!! Gisseppi was awesome.  Great night - love how genuine this place is!"}
{"text":"Need to be ready to experiment.  Creative takes on all. Not expensive.  The Pick Three Appetizer was a HUGE portion compared to the regular dinners.  Ribs, Wings, and Rings seemed to work well.  Or sub Fried Green Tomato's for Rings.  Popcorn was a good start to go with a nice long list of beers on tap.  Fun!"}
{"text":"Funky neighborhood restaurant in an old, well maintained and somewhat updated building. Loved the cozy room upstairs with a real fireplace. 

Nice start with a small bag of cumin curry popcorn on the table. The beer selection was good. 

We ordered two main dishes. Both contained beans. One was a cassoulet which came out covered with beans. Unfortunately these were so hard and undercooked as to be nearly inedible. The rest of the dish was also less than expected with a strange muddle of spices. 

When the waiter came by to inquire, we had to say it was not good. He did take it away and remove it from the bill, but only with a lengthy explanation (bit of a lecture really) about how it was not a mistake and how the chef likes it that way. He did also mention that other people sometimes complain. Regardless of what they might say, these beans were just plain undercooked unless you like snacking on a bag of dried beans from the Acme. 

We also had a burrito which was big, pretty tasty and creative with short ribs and black beans. These beans were undercooked too, but within the window of edible, so we gave the chef the benefit of the doubt on those. 

The place shows promise and I might go back to try some other choices. For now it seemed like it has too much attitude, self importance and is trying a bit too hard to spin dishes in odd ways, especially for a place with a big bar and sports on the TVs."}
{"text":"Friends of ours go here all the time...to the point where they're on a first name basis with most employees.  So, we met them for brunch yesterday to see what all the excitement is about.  It was a super cute patio.  Spacious enough for many tables but not cluttered either.  Our server was fantastic.  I drink a LOT of coffee at brunch but my cup was rarely dry.  We got the pop tart to share. Delicious! I loved the heaping pile of guacamole.  I ordered the burrito and my husband got a special they were having that day, cheddar buiscuit or something? He felt his portion was a little on the small side but still very tasty. I got the burrito which was full of flavor.  I'd love to return for happy hour or dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Have heard wonderful things about this restaurant and based on the pictures was dying to go.  While the food tasted amazing and looked beautiful be prepared to spend a lot of money if you actually want to be full after eating.  My husband and I split an appetizer, both ordered our own entrees and frankly left still hungry.  I had the special, shrimp with tomato and apparently 4 baby shrimp and one large tomato cut and placed on the plate to look like it filled it up was to serve as a full entree.  Again, the flavors were on point, amazing and savory.  But when I spend money to go out to eat I actually want to eat.  We left and I ended up wanting to stop somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"This place has a lot going for it but a few of the dishes were a little rough around the edges.

Graffiti has a very decent patio (which I visited when this space was called Redd Stone) but since it was the end of February, we got to enjoy the warm atmosphere of the bar area and the dark wood trim all along the room. I think they also have an upstairs room with similar  Old World charm (at least they did when this space was called Snickers -- hey this restaurant is off the beaten path in a residential neighborhood not called Tremont so it can't be easy making it work).

The martini menu showed some creativity and decently priced at about $10 a glass, so Jeannene had a Tequila-based drink that was refreshingly tart and I took a bourbon drink and snacked on some spicy popcorn (quite unique) until our appetizer arrived.

I was ready for bar food so we tackled the chicken wings ($10) that were drizzled with a cranberry hot sauce and sat on a small pile of pumpkin butter. The wings were perfectly crispy and the spice from the hot sauce wa ideally balanced by the tartness of the cranberry. I might even prefer these to the legendary ones at the Greenhouse Tavern, but... the pumpkin butter seemed only one dimensional, like eating apple sauce without any zing. It needed to be either more tart, more sweet or have some spice.

For the main course, I had the Salmon ($21) having been intrigued by the pairing of it with a potato latke. The fish was nicely crispy on the outside and a medium temperature on the inside and the latke also had the crispy outside and a heartiness that made for a perfect winter dish. Pickled onions and dill creme fraiche added contrasting notes to the dish, but... the salmon was placed on a bed of creme fraiche like other chefs use rice or potatoes. The texture was too much as every time I had a bite of the moist fish it felt like someone stuck a can of whip cream in my mouth and filled it up. I'd recommend asking for the creme fraiche on the side so you can fully enjoy the excellent food.

We then had to try the best named dessert in all of Cleveland -- the Fat Kid 2.0 ($10). It did not disappoint -- Vanilla ice cream, whip cream, caramel, some candy-coated chocolates and not just cookie dough but country fried cookie dough. Yea, it was good."}
{"text":"Meh. This place really isn't my style for food. It has a nice atmosphere though, so I could see enjoying it kind of like a neighborhood bar if I lived in the area. I would just like one thing on the menu not to be fried or on a bun for making a meal out of it."}
{"text":"In from out of town and SO GLAD we came here! 4 of us all got different entrees and shared, all so yummy!!! Highly recommend and priced great! A must try."}
{"text":"Grains versus Grapes 4 Course wine/beer tasting dinner was great.  Chef did an excellent job pairing the food to the Belgian beers and French wines.  The food was top notch!  The only downside was that food portions were on the smaller side.  Wouldn't mind paying a bit more if the food portions were a bit larger - since it's billed as a 4 course dinner."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant by the owners of Cork and Cleaver. More causal spot than C&C but very similar style of food. All items are classics with major twists. I had the French onion spring roll appetizer and the burrito. I loved the spring roll, so unexpected and amazing. The short ribs in the burrito were great and the fried onion ring crisps added a great twist. The burrito is GIANT. There is easy street parking all around. As its so new this place is still pretty quiet, once it's discovered I'm sure it will get busy. The restaurant is on two floors with the bathroom halfway up the stairs. I think the split layout gives it a cozy intimate environment. The bar has TVs. They have a good bar selection/cocktail menu. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We tried the French Onion egg rolls (good), as well as the Monte Cristo and a Swordfish special. The Monte Cristo (which is so much more than a Monte Cristo) was amazing and highly recommended. The swordfish was in a sausage ragu and was impeccably plated and delicious. The patio is really great - definitely eat outside if you can."}
{"text":"I got the chorizo pop tarts and the chicken wings.

They were very good.

it's outside, so there was a bee that was bothering us, but other than that, I liked the entire concept of the place, tucked into a residential neighborhood and really tasty food!"}
{"text":"This place was great. It was a sunny evening so we sat on the patio- awesome atmosphere. I love Cork and Cleaver so I was excited to see what this place was like. The drinks looked good but I didn't indulge. I had the chicken Parmesan and it was a great twist on the classic dish with shredded chicken. My friend had the Shepherd's Pie and enjoyed that as well. Would definitely recommend and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Beautiful spot after checking out art galleries in 78th St. Studios. Perfect mixed drinks, delicious apps, tasty thought-provoking dishes. Try the Reuben Ribs fo' Sho'. It's pretty small, but we always get a seat."}
{"text":"Had dinner on the patio this evening.  Their version of a Monte Christo is not a sandwich which our server pointed out prior to my ordering it.  It is however a mouth-watering dish with perfectly cooked pork, french toast, some mashed potatoes and a fantastic raspberry sauce.  So good. My guest had the chicken parmigiana which is unlike any chicken parmigiana I had ever seen but  was excellent as well.  Patio is a great space to spend an evening, and service was excellent.  Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better for brunch.  Fantastic atmosphere outside near the lake, great service and amazing food.  Very reasonably priced & interesting brunch drinks (bloody mary, mimosa, \"dickel punch were $6 when I visited).  Would absolutely recommend to anyone in Cleveland."}
{"text":"When all you really want is your neighborhood bar like Reddstone, this place won't do much for you. It's different. It's overpriced. It's not your Thursday night summer hangout."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks with my friend last Friday. We got there at about 9 and the bar was mostly full, but there was still some seating available so we sat down right away. After an hour or two, it started to clear out. The bar is smaller so it wasn't too loud. We could easily hold a conversation without shouting. The lighting and feel of the place was cozy and upscale, even though it's a casual place.  There is a separate dining room upstairs.  The beer list was plenty for me and although we didn't eat, the food looked good. They have this delicious garlic butter popcorn on all of the tables in sealed bags for you to snack on. What really set this place apart was the service. Our server was very friendly and checked on us frequently, but not too often. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"First time near battery park. The restaurant is in the corner house. Patio seating in th summer wth lots of trees. They are open for dinner and a Sunday brunch. Thursday's are barbecue night. 

They have a nice cocktail selection. Prices are reasonable. The dick punch was a refreshing watermelon with burbon cocktail. Tommy's tree is a tequila based cocktail, a stronger margarita essentially. Zeke E stardust was a nice and light mint refreshing Cointreau hibiscus based drink which was probably the best among the three. 

Chicken wing appetizer had fried chicken with a Thai smoky flavored sauce. I wish there was more sauce and a little more kick to the chicken. The chicken was a little smelly or was that the flavor. 

The beet salad was hands down the best thing we ate and worth a visit just to eat that. 

The linguini pasta with peas, mushroom and dill curd was very flavorful. 

For dessert the S'more was decadent and very rich. Didn't care much for the granola but I guess it adds to the crunchy texture for an otherwise very smooth dessert. 

Well worth a try. I should add that the service was attentive, personal and efficient"}
{"text":"Holy yum. I loved everything about my meal here. Very inexpensive for the quality and uniqueness of the entrees! Instead of bread, they serve popcorn-- such a great idea. We had the potato skins, Graffiti salad, Shepard's pie and the Fat Kid 2.0. My taste buds were doing flips. 

Each dish had the most unique spin on them and their own signature flavor. The potato skins are topped with a goat cheese guacamole and chirizo that give it a sort of Spanish taste. So good! Graffiti salad had great flavor and texture and the Shepard's pie was out of this world!!!!!!! It wasn't your typical gut-heavy Shepard's pie and the lamb was so tender. I would order it again in a heart beat upon going back.

The Fat Kid 2.0......wow! Our server described it as \"the blood in his body\" to indicate how much he loved/ recommended it. He was right. It was phenomenal. They make their cookie dough in house...omg...don't ask question or hesitate. Just go and order! I cannot wait to go back! 

Located in an old house--very cute, relaxed vibe. Beautiful stained glass windows."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because we live near by.  Most of the food is terrible. The food that is good is super small, 2 bites.  The service is terrible.  Bring back the old owners please!!! Worst place in Detroit shore way!!"}
{"text":"First time at this joint with two of my friends. We were greeted and seated immediately on a slow Friday night @7:45. It was dark rustic and cozy feel. The staff was okay. They clock-in and clock-out kind of attitude. They had great beer selections on tap. Cocktail menu did not taste so great. Everything that my friend ordered she hated and I had to drink it all. It was very sweet and syrup like. The food came out in a timely manner and we split one ribs appetizer and two entrees which was one of the special a chicken confit and the monte cristo. We enjoyed the flavors of all three dishes. We did share a sweet treat which was the \"fat kid\" malt ice cream, bacon, caramel, hot fudge, sprinkles, candied peanuts covered pretzel. My friends enjoyed it more as I do not have much of a sweet tooth. All in all, I cant say that this was a place I would be dinning out at often but I am glad we tried it out!!"}
{"text":"I was a fan of their food at Cork & Cleaver, so when Brian Okin and Adam Bostwick brought their food to my neighborhood, I knew I was in trouble - and they and their staff do not disappoint. 

The work they did to upgrade everything about the building and the patio has made Graffiti a warm and welcoming space inside, and returned the patio to being one of the most relaxing and perfect outdoor spaces in Cleveland, 

The food is what they do - and their take on food you know - makes you want to get to know it the way they see it. The Monte Cristo, Chicken Parm and Shepherd's Pie all have the flavors you know -- but the presentation is unique and the flavors are what you like about each dish - but just - better. The salads -- the BLT salad makes you realize - a BLT does not need bread, or mayonnaise - the beet salad is just summer on a plate and the wedge is what that salad should be - everywhere. 

My favorite appetizer is the French Onion Egg Rolls == all the flavors of your favorite soup -- in a crispy wonton wrapper with au jus for dipping. Delivered hot with the cheese all melty -- yep.

The Graffiti Burger has ended my search for my favorite burger in Cleveland - all of the ingredients sounded good ... then they were all together in my mouth -- CAB Burger, Fried Tomatillo, Banana Catsup, Pickled Banana Pepper, Goat Cheese ... so much better than any one thing by itself. 

The desserts run the flavor gambit - light, filling, tart, comforting  -- We LOVED the Snicker's Bread Pudding -- we hope that one makes a come back.

They also have a fantastic Sunday brunch -- I'm still waiting to enjoy it on the patio - in the sun - maybe Mother Nature will cooperate soon. But we did try to chorizo pop tart -- buttery pastry, spicy chorizo topped with a cold, perfect mound of guac. Plate lickable is all I can say. 

Go, get a seat on the patio - order whatever sounds good to you -- it will be."}
{"text":"UN UN UN UNREAL. Life changing. This is honestly the best meal I have ever had in Cleveland. I feel like I stumbled upon Cleveland's greatest hidden gem. From the entire vibe of the place, very rustic, fireplace lighting up the room, and accompanied by the nicest staff ever - Shout out to Shawn he was the man. My girlfriend got The Chicken Parmesan and it was absolutely life changing.  I got a Strip Steak which is a special they had on a Saturday. You cannot go wrong with this place. Freshest ingredients with so so so much attention to detail. If you are looking for the greatest hidden gem in Cleveland, it is this place right here."}
{"text":"BEST SPOT for a nice, calm evening. Went here with friends on a Friday night and had the most pleasant experience! Our waiter (also the manager) was a pleasure to meet; one of the coolest people out there! His passion for each of the dishes and his energy was clearly visible and transferred into the mood of our group. And of course, food was SCRUMPTIOUS as well! If you enjoy trying unique creations and expanding your taste palette, then this is definitely a must to try!Awesome experience all around, we'll definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to start by stating what this place isn't, which doesn't impact this review score in any way.  This place is not anything like the old Reddstone.  That place was a neighborhood bar.  It had its problems and now its gone.  In it's place, we have Graffiti, which is more of a restaurant.  Yes, it's a restaurant.  I struggle to call it a gastropub as Mark I. noted, because the prices place this more towards an occasion spot. The meals aren't too expensive, but at the same time, I can go to Lolita and get charcuterie, chicken livers and a burger (when it was on the menu) for the same price.  There are a lot of places like this and I wish the number of neighborhood bars with neighborhood prices in our area wasn't in the decline.  With that said, the food is good, the service is good, and I can't knock the rating just because the new owners went in a different direction.  I just wish I could still get basic burgers and wings and basic prices.  I'll certainly return, but probably not for a couple months.

So, service and food and drinks is 5 stars, price is 4 stars (most of this feels $1 to $2 too much), ambiance is 5 stars.  My only major complaint is the charcuterie.  The texture never seems right every time I get charcuterie from Saucisson.  Since every restaurant in Cleveland has to do some sort of board these days, there's better charcuterie to be had."}

{"text":"i had brunch here with my girlfriend and two other  friends, who had suggested this place.  i knew it wasn't like reddstone, which i had frequented and enjoyed.

our server was nice, very helpful, but way too chatty for my liking.  we started with appetizers of wings, which were good, and then crab cake...which was possibly the worst crab cake ive ever had.  i mentioned to my friends that it smelled like mothballs.  im not sure what they used to make it but it was a huge disappointment.

our entrees came, and we waited almost 5 minutes for silverware until we asked the server for some more, which was another put-off for me.  whether the busser forgot or not, just a bad look.  i had the burrito, which was really good...except it had black beans which were really hard and it took away from the overall consistency of the rest of the plate.  this bothered my friend so much that the server actually switched that out for another choice.  my girlfriend had the meatloaf which was very good on her end.

i was just so bothered by the food and the lack of attention of the busser that upon paying, i told my server how i felt.  to his credit he took care of my bill, but kind of went overboard with explaining how the transaction would be voided...and i got 8 notifications that my card was declined, which i found odd and unsettling.  i provided another card to use to pay for my girlfriend's part, and he came back saying that was declined as well; this i found strange because there was plenty of money there.    as a result i didn't pay for anything, but i didn't feel right being told \"my card was declined\" when the funds were there.

overall, im glad they took care of me, but the food really wasn't that great.  can't really recommend it to others."}
{"text":"The culinary minds behind the amazing Cork & Cleaver (http://www.ccsocialkitchen.com/) have done it once again. They've managed to transform a ho-hum, sub-par restaurant/bar into something guaranteed not to bore you or your palate. 

I won't go into the actual restaurant too much, as I feel my fellow Yelpers have already done a more than adequate job. Suffice it to say that if you want a loud bar thing there's one downstairs and if you want a more intimate restaurant dining thing that's upstairs. Oh, and the stained glass in the upstairs windows is a brilliant touch.

Graffiti, which also sports the tag \"a social kitchen\" takes after its big brother with a hip but not too hip atmosphere and creative menu that's world's away from the rest of the pack. Now, I don't really understand what a social kitchen is supposed to be, probably just marketing schtick. I wasn't finding myself being any more/less social than usual within their confines and the staff sure wasn't all that talkative. Enough on that. You get my point.

Speaking of the staff, I wasn't terribly blown away by the service and hospitality. We were greeted immediately upon entering and escorted upstairs, but our hostess and our waitress were more your strong silent types. Kinda serious. Believe me, I don't need a hug or sloppy, wet kiss when I go to a restaurant, but a smile and some recommendations would have been nice.

The beer and cocktail list is short but sweet with 20 taps of craft beer averaging about $6.50 each (a handful of \"don't bother\" bottled selections) and a half dozen fancy-schmancy $10 cocktails with names like Take a Chance on Me and She's a Woman. Kudos for carrying some locals from the likes of Platform Beer Co., GLBC and Fat Head's. My inner beer geek was satisfied.

The food, now this is where Graffiti shines. Like I said earlier, Graffiti is not yo mama's restaurant. Taking their cue from the unique creations at Cork & Cleaver, the chefs at Graffiti have really put together a great menu. It's full of the unexpected like bologna pate, fried chicken livers and bologna fried rice (they've got a thing for bologna) as well as some familiar favorites like wings and potato skins, neither of which will remind you of the local bar up the street.

Here's something different (and better for you). Rather than bread, you get a little bag of seasoned popcorn to munch on while you wait for your food. Nice touch. For starters, we opted for the French onion egg rolls and Graffiti salad. Yeah, French onion egg rolls. Damn. They made my mouth their bitch and I loved it. Crispy wonton wrappers packed with caramelized onions and Gruyere cheese. It was better than its namesake and would make awesome drunk grub.

The Graffiti salad was one of the most unique salads I've ever had. Whoda thought that shaved Brussels sprouts, brown rice and bulgar would get along so well and the house-made polenta croutons? Shyea. My only complaint, not enough of the champagne vinaigrette. It was a bit on the dry side. Perfect size for sharing, though, so keep that in mind.

My wife did the appetizer/salad/pick from my husband's plate dealy and she went with the ribs and egg salad. Done corned beef style on top of some slaw and dollops of stadium mustard, the ribs were fall off the bone good. Another small gripe, they arrived at the table lukewarm. Not sure if this was their intention, but it just seemed like they should have been hot. The egg salad was comprised of Frisse, a split soft boiled egg, pickled onion, and celery. The touch of smoke from the paprika ailoi paired well with the acidic bite of the dill vinaigrette.

For my entree I went with what has to be one of the greatest menu creations I've had in a very, very long time. Listed as simply \"Omelette\" on the menu, the name does nothing to prepare your face for what you're about to put into it. One of the fluffiest, perfectly cooked omelette's ever - this thing had to be 5\" thick - covered with short rib chili and paired with a side of potato pancakes. Just. Damn. Good. Get it for lunch, get it for brunch, get it for dinner. Just get it.

Graffiti is definitely a marked improvement over the previous tenant and a great addition to the Westside enclave of Battery Park. Their unique takes on classics and innovative new dishes are a welcome reprieve from the same-old-same-old that's being copycatted all over Cleveland. Locally-sourced ingredients, artfully constructed plates, delicious food. Sure, some slight hiccups along the way, but they didn't mar an otherwise delightful experience."}
{"text":"Got out of the touristy downtown area and found this gem in Battery Park.
Outdoor seating was fantastic as was the food.  Arguably the best burger with such a non-traditional taste.  Quinoa salad was excellent and the meatloaf was very good.  If you're in Cleveland, it's definitely a place to visit."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to see such a fantastic restaurant takeover the old Reddstone space in Battery Park! Reddstone was known for mediocre food and an amazing patio space. It was always unfortunate to have to sacrifice a good meal to enjoy al fresco dining on the patio, well now Graffiti brings you amazing food and an amazing patio. What a win for the neighborhood.

Seriously, the food is amazing. Don't let some of the names on the menu fool you. They are really culinary masterpieces and the prices are great too.

The monte cristo meal was an entree inspired by the famous sandwich. The pork was so incredibly tender and flavorful with mouthwatering raspberry and cream sauce. 

The beers on draught selection was extensive and Graffiti offers a great cocktail selection.

All their desserts looked amazing. I tried the snickers bread pudding, which was peanut and caramel filled ... delicious.

I also cannot stress how nice the back patio is on this restaurant. It's by far the nicest in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great location, food, and ambiance.  Take a walk down to the beach after dinner.  The manager is a great guy, and will go out of his way to make you feel welcomed.

Top Notch."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, food was amazing! Our server was a little snarky and made me a little uncomfortable but I'm open to trying it again!"}
{"text":"This location has the best patio in the Cleveland area.  It feels like each seating area is secluded and there is an ample amount of shade provided by the 2 giant tress inside of the area.  I can't get enough time outside during the short Cleveland summers, so that's why I chose this place to meet up with friends I haven't seen in a year.

My main reason for choosing this place was solely for the patio, but I will definitely go back rain or shine.  The food is that freaking good!  Oh wait, we had drinks first so I should talk about them.  There are plenty of local and craft beers on tap and there is a decent variety.  I started off with Revolution's Anti Hero.  As I perused the cocktail section, I knew I would be switching.  Beer before liquor, never sicker!"}
{"text":"What a gem! We were driving through Cleveland on a cross country trip and found this spot through yelp. Ahh, so happy we did! 

Came through on a Wednesday night and grab two seats at the downstairs bar. We were greeted by an incredibly friendly, personable and knowledgeable bartender. Keith is awesome! The menu has a lot of traditional items but the approach on them here is so unique. Keith took us through the menu and shared chef and guest favorites. The chef (and owner) came out and introduced himself and recommended some of his personal favorites as well. We went with all of their combined reccos and man did we feast. Everything was amazing. We had: 

Reuben ribs (best dish I had on our 17 day road trip). Just get this. 
French onion egg rolls - another awesome dish, the roll itself was so tender and fresh tasting. 
I had the shepherds pie. Never had one like it. The spuds were on the bottom and the flavor was semi sweet combined along with savory from the braised lamb that fell apart all over the dish. It was amazing. 
Hubs had the chicken parm and he thoroughly enjoyed it, despite being not at all what he expected from chicken parm (your catching my drift overall on the interesting take on standard dishes, right?). 

Great beer selection of local and regional brews, decent wine selection and a well stocked bar. 

The staff was very friendly to everyone. Seems like they have a great customer base of locals. Just what any place would want. 

If I ever make it back to Cleveland I wouldn't miss this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Monte Cristo ($18). It was a deconstructed affair featuring pork loin and French toast with a raspberry sauce. All of the ingredients were terrific as were the flavors. The presentation was beautiful and appetizing. The downsides were that the French toast seemed to be about half of what the portion should be. There wasn't enough to match up with the pork. Nothing on my plate was hot. The toast was warm, but the pork was cold. It was also undercooked. I'm not suggesting that they serve me a piece of leather, I prefer a nice pink medium. What I don't want is a pool of blood on my plate. Also, the host was a condescending, pretentious ass. Next week I'll go back to Jack Flaps."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best restaurant in Cleveland!! I've had almost everything on the menu and have never had one complaint. I love in the summer that they have a weekly seasonal sangria flavor! Their beer dinners are amazing as are the valentines dinners!! I wish they would put the pb&j wings back on the menu, also excellent. Short rib burrito also top notch. 

My only complaint would be not to waste their time with the BBQ takeover they do. The bbq isn't good."}
{"text":"A bit off then beaten path but def worth hunting down. Got there late one evening and was pleasantly greeted and promptly taken care of. 

The drink special was great. The entrees were delicious and the outdoor seating behind is really cute. 

Will for sure be back."}
{"text":"A fan of everythibg plus the service was fantastic. The perfect meal I would say... We sat in the patio and had a wonderful time, the drinks were Delish the mule I got was refreshing and the kick of lime i wanted.

The appetizer was fabu the WINGS people soooo good !!! We got the trio and it was worth it.

I had the stuff peppers and pasta and man it was heaven... My boyfriend had the Monte cristo and perfect pork PERFECT! We were beyond satisfied with the service and the meal along with the patio Ambiance. So I say try it right meow!"}
{"text":"Love this place!

Love the patio!

Love the drinks!

Food is GREAT!!!

So my husband and I stopped in on a Friday around 8:30 it was a beautiful night so we sat on the patio. (which is so cute, they have little string lights and candles on the tables)

Service was great very attentive and speedy service!!!

We started with the beat salad and chicken livers both were delicious.  My husband got the burger which he said was THE BEST BURGER hes had in awhile and I got the lobster roll. 

THIS IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT- The lobster roll itself was super SUB pair, I mean it had more celery in it then meat. So I was bummed about that but the kale salad they serve with it was very good. (I feel like I got the remaining portion that they probably should have served with roll ordered.)

Over all guys this place was great I really enjoyed everything other then the roll and we will def go back."}
{"text":"I have been here 2x and was completely underwhelmed. Ribs are down right awful over cooked, over salted. Dishes come out looking awesome but taste underwhelming and very little protein.  The drink pours are meager.

My friends oyster boy had 3 oysters mostly just bread. 

Pumpkin spiced wings were looked terrible. MEH"}
{"text":"I would recommend going to graffiti for the cocktails (the blind artist was delicious!) and the ambiance of the outside patio but not so much the food. I ordered the lobster roll- the salad on the side was soo salty I couldn't eat it and the roll was filled with a mayo and celery mixture, no lobster to be found. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm and I must say their interpretation is very strange. It was shredded chicken formed into a cube and then fried?? We won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Amazing mixed drinks, always tinkering with their great menu, guaranteed you'll taste something new and find a reason to come back and eat something you didn't get a chance to try yet!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu sounds so good it's truly hard to make a choice. I didn't have any bozzie drinks but I will say that the cocktail menu looks awesome! I had their coffee and for whatever reason, it was really great coffee! Awesome patio. Good atmosphere. Must try."}
{"text":"Graffiti  is definitely on my go to places on the near west side. Beyond delish. Last night was my second visit and was based on an incredible Sunday brunch experience. Ask for the Sunday shot special -amazing if it's The side of pancakes and bacon shot. 

For dinner I had the meatloaf sandwich, sans bread which was perfect for a cool CLE night. The service is friendly, on top of things and always ready to share knowledge when asked. You can tell they actually enjoy working here.

I would recommend  and if it's still patio season- go for it!"}
{"text":"Consistently innovative and tasty seasonal menu with a cozy/modern indoor space and one of the best patios for the warmer months."}
{"text":"Apparently, I'm in the minority here but I was not a fan of the food. I had brunch there and had an OK Plum Bellini and not so great but super overpriced breakfast meatloaf.

The two pluses are the service and dog friendly patio. (Shoutout to attentive and friendly hostess/servers!)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great drinks!! What else do you need? Make sure to save room for dessert, the Fat Kid is YUMMY!!! We will for sure be back:)"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely obsessed with this place. Adam and the staff are always so polite. 
The atmosphere is incredible. Very comfortable. You can find just about anything on the menu. If you're a vegetarian, there is something for you. 
The drinks are amazing! The shrubs are simply incredible and the beer list is awesome. 
If you haven't been here, I recommend coming and asking your server to just pick your entire menu. 
I guarantee they'll pick an awesome meal paired with awesome drinks!
Don't forget about dessert! The fat kid is by far the most amazing thing on the planet. 
I highly HIGHLY recommend it. 
I mean, who doesn't love deep fried goodness smothered in ice cream CALLED the fat kid?
Seriously, check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A Yelp Yup! Like the other Yelpers mentioned, Graffiti has a fantastic patio along with its own bar. One of my favorite patios in the city. 
My go to here is the Graffiti Burger. While this isn't a burger place, it does have one of my top three burgers in Cleveland. The juicy CAB patty comes with a fried green tomato, banana catsup, frisee, pickled banana pepper and a nice spread of goat cheese. You also get a side of fries. While there are other fancier dishes on the menu, I rarely can resist this meal. 
You can kill you thirst with a drink menu that lists 20 draughts and 9 cocktails. 

If I lived in this neighborhood, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Service, appetizers, salads, entrees, fat kid dessert, cocktails. A+ :) Great job!"}
{"text":"I just went to Graffiti for brunch with a friend today and it was OK at best. I asked my server what her recommendations were for vegetarian and I do not think she did her best to describe the menu options very well. I ended up ordering the Vegetable Frittata with a ride of toast and my friend ordered the Battery Park Breakfast. The restaurant was not very packed, yet our food took a little too long to come out. When our food came, my frittata was barely warm and I did not receive any butter or jam with my toast. My friend's meal was $12 and did not look filling at all. She ended up having to order more food. 

The frittata was basically just an omelet with a sparse amount vegetables and aoli on top of it. I *think* the vegetables and aioli were good, but there was not enough of it on the eggs for me to really tell if the taste was unique in any way. The food was certainly not bad, but definitely not worth the money and looked like a meal I could have made at home."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for dinner. Sat out on the lovely patio the first time and was thoroughly impressed with the food and service. Our waiter was attentive but laid-back and very informed about the food/drink selection. It was definitely one of the most memorable dinners out I've had this year. 

Our second visit was during a Cavs game, and the weather was rough so all the patrons were confined a relatively small inside seating area. I love the decor though, especially the graffiti'd tables. Our server was a nice guy, and equally enthusiastic about telling us about the menu. He quickly brought us a few varieties of popcorn to try, which was a nice little touch. Cause this girl is a popcorn fiend! Somewhere during the course of dinner our service seemed to go downhill though...our waiter would disappear for 5-10 minutes and then re-appear only to chat with another table for another 10 minutes. Maybe it slipped his mind that we hadn't placed our entree order yet, because it took us at least a half hour after sitting down to do so. And we were hungry! Thank god for the popcorn. After eating, we were trying to get out of there so we could get home and watch the second half of the game...but it also took us quite a while to ask for our check.

Anyway, that was frustrating. BUT all of that aside, this food is playful but keeps its integrity. They do a lot of de-construction and re-construction of well-known dishes -- like the Monte Cristo and the Shepherd's Pie -- that are outstanding. I'm somewhat skeptical about dishes that sound like they might be trying too hard to be cutesy. Not everyone can execute a creative concept when it comes to food, but the flavors and presentation were very strong in all the dishes we've tried. And between the two times I've been here, we've tried 6 of the 8 entrees.

My favorite is probably still the Monte Cristo, although the omelette is a mighty impressive dish. They must use almost a full carton of eggs in that thing! The Shepherd's Pie is a stunning dish, and so yummy, but I would've like a little more  of the parsnip/rutabega cake on the bottom and maybe a little bit less lamb. If you're someone who likes a protein heavy plate, then have at this dish! Also: ORDER THE FRENCH ONION EGG ROLLS."}
{"text":"I found this place to simply be, just ok. The food came out in fair style dishes and wasn't very flavorful. What concerned me the most was the service though. Fairly slow and at times a little condescending."}
{"text":"Visited Graffiti this morning with my husband for brunch before heading out to the Browns game. This was my 4th time dining here (1st time was for dinner, 3rd time for brunch), and it did not disappoint (never does!). This place is easily in my top 3 favorite breakfast spots in Cleveland. 

First off: if they have a cider option at brunch, GET IT. My husband had a mug the last time we were here for brunch, and this is what brought us back in from the East side of town. This morning they had a Bourbon butterscotch cider. I'll be honest, I don't really like mixed drinks, but this cider was amazing. Warm, with a sugar/butterscotch? rim, perfectly spiced. Oh it's so delicious I can't put it into words. Too bad it isn't served at the actual Browns games. 

We ordered the chorizo pop tarts to start (because breakfast appetizer? why not!). Housemade pastry and guac. We'd never ordered these previously because they kind of sounded like dense gut-bombs to me. Whoa was I wrong. The pastry was flaky, the chorizo perfectly prepared, and the guac was the perfect compliment. They were awesome. They'd make a great stand alone breakfast for someone with a lighter appetite or with some sides added. Yum.

For my meal, I ordered the Ham N Cheese Frittata (Mornay, Ham, Tomato & Potato Latkes). This is the most deceptive name for a breakfast dish ever. It should be called, \"Amazing pile of pulled pork on a super-fluffy frittata with perfect latkes and roasted tomatoes and cheese\". Holy moly. This is not ham from the deli counter. This is also way more than a \"ham and cheese frittata\", which sounds kind of basic. This breakfast is not basic. It's amazing. It should have a way cooler name. I would have cleaned my plate, but I was stuffed to the max. My husband happily obliged to clearing my plate for me. He then declared it was one of his favorite breakfasts he'd ever had. And he only had 1/4 of a plate. It was that good.

My husband, for his own meal, had the waffle (Pumpkin Butter, Whipped Cream & Pecan Granola). The presentation was artful, because you know, you eat with your eyes first! It was sweet, but not sickeningly so, and the whipped cream was fluffy and light. 

We're excited for our next trip to Graffiti, because well... our first FOUR trips have all been outstanding. We've eaten twice upstairs, and twice downstairs, and don't really have a preference. There was a wood fire burning in a fireplace upstairs this morning, which was pretty cool. Cozy on a cold winter day. All 3 times we've been here for brunch there have only been a handful of other customers, which we can't understand. This place should be PACKED because it's AMAZING. 

Oh yeah, and our service is always perfect. Didn't catch our server's name this morning, but he did an outstanding job. My husband drank approximately 50 glasses of ice water (in addition to the Cider, remember GET THE CIDER), and his glass was never empty for more than a millisecond. Spot on.

One more thing: this breakfast is so good... looks so upscale... and the space is so trendy... but we felt perfectly comfortable rocking some ridiculous Browns gear during brunch. Layers upon layers of cold weather clothes, boots, hats, and scarves that made us look less than fancy. We totally appreciate the lack of pretension at this place. Absolutely one of our favorites.

Graffiti crew, thanks again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Graffiti on a Friday evening. It's located in Battery Park, a cute little neighborhood across from Edgewater Park. 

We sat on the patio which you can access directly from outside, so I didn't get the chance to checkout the interior of the restaurant. The patio, however, was adorable. It was a chilly night, but there were heaters so it was perfect! 

Our waiter was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. It was our first time at the restaurant, so we asked him for food and drink suggestions. They have a rotating sangria, which was a blood orange basil at the time- quite refreshing. They also start you out with a popcorn appetizer, which is also rotating in flavor. 

We split the french onion egg rolls to start, which were amazing. Next time I won't be sharing! I ordered the Monte Cristo for my entree, and my boyfriend had the Chicken Parmesan. Both meals were memorable for their \"twist\" on the traditional. 

I will definitely be back to try another inventive item from the menu, and hopefully next time I'll have room for dessert."}
{"text":"Graffiti has the patio game on lock in the CLE. Really, I LOVE this patio. It's a true hidden gem. By the exterior of this restaurant, you would never guess that a tastefully decorated, twinkling and spacious patio exits in the backyard. Coupled with a large art mural, heaters and exposed bricks, it achieves a modern and cozy vibe.

I stopped by here for drinks and a late dinner with a friend. After perusing the drink menu, I settled on the house made Watermelon Sangria. It hit the spot fully, and had the most refreshing, non-sweet overload quality to it. It's all too easy to have a few glasses...be careful! I could sit on the patio on every breezy night getting lost in that wonderful sangria. For dinner, I ordered the Shepherd's Pie. The lamb was indisputably tasty and tender. I have to agree with some other Yelpers--the portion is a bit small compared to the price tag. The Pie was definitely quite savory, but I wished I could have had a little something to go with it.

Regardless, it was still a nice experience with friendly service and high quality food. Graffiti is perfect for a romantic date night or evening with friends."}
{"text":"Met some friends for brunch on a Sunday. I haven't been out to the Battery Park neighborhood in quite some time and I must say I was impressed. I loved Graffiti's intimate, homely location which was busy, but never felt overly crowded. 

The brunch menu was great with plenty of variety. I ordered the salmon and bagel while my friends opted for chicken and waffles. The portions were great and everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. Prices are reasonable as well. The beer and wine list is quite wonderful as well. They have lots of local beers to choose from as well as a variety of nice wines and cocktails. 

Overall my brunch experience at Graffiti was an A+! I look forward to going back and maybe trying their dinner menu in the near future!"}
{"text":"Had a great light dinner with cocktails on the patio with friends.  It was an Edgewater Live night, so very crowded, but our server was still responsive and had great suggestions.  The daily chip special was a great snack and my fruit-infused cocktails were awesome.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Yelped this little place and was like wow this is so cute and look delicious , we get there and think hmm it's closed , we aren't from the area and my bf says this doesn't look like a safe place it's sketchy hahah , I'm like but there is new grass and some updates things around don't judge a book by its cover , after much reading over more reviews he decides to trust my intuition , we go in and are blown away the food was amazing , salmon and the monte cristo amazing , dessert blueberry bread pudding yes please , not over stuff perfect sizes for 3 course meal , staff is wonderful and chatty and lovely , thank you Keith , DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP , it's so worth going inside , yes a little gem , eat up"}
{"text":"This place is terrific and very unique!  We've already been here twice in the last month and now we are going to try the chef's other restaurant, Cork & Cleaver, in Broadview heights, as well.

We've tried the following:
- French onion egg rolls - This was a neat twist on french onion soup with cheese filled egg rolls that you can dip into an onion soup dipping sauce
- Onion rings - Liked the bleu cheese dressing on this.
- Reuben ribs - Fall off the bone and very flavorful.
- Walleye - Fish was cooked the right amount, and I thought the potato latke that it came with was very tasty.
- Po Boy - This was great!  Nice large portion, didn't skimp on the oysters, fried well
- Burrito - This was also very large, and bursting with flavor
- Linguini - This was okay.  I liked the flavor but thought it was a bit too oily.
- Watermelon sangria - This was very nice!  Refreshing and could barely taste the alcohol
- S'more - Liked the cinnamon shortbread, liked the merengue, thought the solid bar of chocolate ganache was a bit much.

The waitstaff is very nice and they are able to customize dishes for you (to make them vegetarian or not, etc)."}
{"text":"Graffiti is an unassuming building that's really easy to miss unless you're looking for it. We went tonight with our dog in tow.  Any place that allows me to bring my puppy daughter is automatically good by me!The back patio is so relaxing and pretty, definitely a good hangout spot. It wasn't too hot, and the patio was just right for a June night. 

The food was probably one of the best I have had yet in cleveland. We ordered the Ruben ribs to start. They were the only forgettable part of the meal. The meat fell off the bone but there wasn't much flavoring to them. Hubs ordered the Battery Park hot dog which he described as incredible. I didn't try it, but he said he really enjoyed it. I ordered the Graffiti burger. Holyyyyyyy wow. The best burger I've had in my life. Whoever decided to put goat cheese and a fried green tomato on a burger deserves all the high fives. Burgers are never my go to meal choice and I never finish a whole one. But this was incredible. I will be back and I will order that dang burger again. The fries were pretty good too. Perfectly seasoned and fresh as hell, yes please.

The reason I simply cannot give Graffiti 5 stars was because of the service. Our waitress was very nice and did a great job but this place was S L O W. Maybe it was an off night? Maybe it's just how they operate. But even our drinks took at least 15 minutes. And we sat there without water forever. Definitely not a place to go and have a quick meal that's for sure. There were also plenty of open spots on the patio so they weren't even super busy. Also, they were out of the beer my husband wanted to order and like 3 others. I ordered their sangria of the day which was the perfect summer drink, but they ran out after my serving. When I asked for Chardonnay, they were also out of Chardonnay. On Saturday night. Anyways, the food was worth it and the patio is so cute. I do recommend!!"}
{"text":"Graffiti was my restaurant of choice for my birthday dinner. It met all the criteria: 1. I'd never been there. 2. Some of my friends (and fellow Yelpers) said nothing but good things about it 3. Reasonably priced & whimsical menu. Graffiti was an obvious choice. 
We had a reservation for Friday night at 8 and the place was not as crowded as I expected. This spot (formally Red Stone) is famous for a beautiful patio, but it was a chilly fall Cleveland day- so no patio for us!  Luckily, the upstairs is also beautiful and artistically decorated, it even had stain glass windows. They start you off with complimentary \"popcorn du jour,\" which was a savory pumpkin spice that day. We also had the appetizer platter with chorizo potato skins, wings (with seasonal sauce), and the pork belly. Dear lord. Thank you for gracing my taste buds with those potato skins and tender pork belly. Wings were tasty but personally, wings in general don't blow my mind. 
I had the Monte Cristo for dinner and this is one of the BEST dishes I've ever had. Graffiti deconstructed the classic sandwich with juicy pork, French toast, berry perseveres and some cheese sauce that I wanted to lick off the plate. To be honest, this dish was the deciding factor when I saw it on the menu before choosing to go to Graffiti. I was too full for dessert, but next time my sweet tooth is aching, I know where I will go! 
Plus, our server was also amazing. She was more than willing to take pictures of our group and even tried to get the best lighting. 
Thank you Graffiti for helping to make my birthday fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excellent patio when for the nice weather, but the ambience indoors is great as well.  They are food-focused and execute their creative dishes well.  Fantastic service and perfect fit for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My first time at Graffiti, but won't be my last. Three of us went on a Wednesday shortly after they opened at 5. We sat on the patio, which we literally had to ourselves (atleast for the first hour).

The hostess was very sweet and gave us menus and some delicious flavored popcorn saying she would send the server over. It looked like they were still setting up and getting things organized for the evening  

Our waitress Re was excellent. She gave us some suggestions when we asked, told us about drink specials and made sure to inform us all the drink syrups, fruit were homemade in house. 

The beet salad was great. I would have preferred more beets and less pears, but the flavors hit the mark with the blue cheese and balsamic. 

We decided to share the appetizer platter. The French onion eggrolls were excellent and I would come back for these alone. The chicken wings were fall of the bone good, but did have a kick. The Reuben ribs , while had a great Reuben like taste, were a bit fatty. 

Some interesting things on the menu that I would like to try. Like I said, I will be back.  The overall experience was great....the staff and great patio area sure did add to the food"}
{"text":"I was very eager to try this place, as I see a lot of posts from there on instagram! That was all this place was, instagramable! My food (the burger) wasn't bad,it wasn't good either! I ate a couple bites and wanted to leave ASAP! Why the rush? Because our server was very, I guess you could say strange, and made me very uncomfortable. When we walked into the patio from the street he looked at us and said\"oh did you want to sit to eat?\" Um, yes please! When we asked for waters to start he said \"uhh,sure I guess\" when my husband asked for a side of dressing he said \"not sure we have dressing here\" and never returned and a female took over! She was pleasant! Still not enough to shake the weird vibe he gave the place! We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Trendy fun atmosphere in a great neighborhood. Guacamole potato skins appetizer was amazing. Lamb entree for dinner was even better"}
{"text":"This place has made a good change from the previous Red Stone. Happy hour is only at the bar, so we sat there. Each day of the week, they have a special-Friday was $8 for endless Chili, and I saw Wednesday was meatballs, but I forget what the other specials were. It is a pricey restaurant, but that's the type of crowd they are trying to draw in.

I got the chicken and waffles off the menu, which was smaller than I expected, and nothing really out of the ordinary.  I also got an order of the potato skins-you get two for $9.  They are pretty big though, and dang they were good. They had Gruyere cheese on them, and they dat on some guacamole, which I typically do not like, but that really, really pulled the dish together. If I ever go back, I will definitely get those again.

The bartender working there was so nice. He was very attentive, checked with us to see if we had any questions about the menu, etc. He engaged us in conversation, asking if it was or first time there, and we talked about what Redstone was like as he worked there too. He talked about how involved the new owners are and seemed very excited about the place-and we even talked about other new great restaurants, like Banter. It really was a nice experience, just a little pricey for me."}
{"text":"Delicious burger and fun neighborhood patio chilling. A Gordon Square patio that is always on point. Great list of cocktails and a nice variety of beers. Apparently the patio is Dog friendly which is a plus if your people have dogs."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a few months, but I did go on quite a bit of a dining bender here over the summer. First off their patio is absolutely beautiful, and oh so relaxing. You will always feel so welcomed when you walk in, everyone is so friendly and courteous. My biggest problem here is deciding on my meal, for it all looks so delicious and so far has blown me away. The chicken Parmesan is so perfectly done, you could applaud after you first bite. My favorite employee there, I believe his name is Giuseppe, is oh so thorough and passionate about the food and product here. And truly has made our dining experience above exceptional many different times. So whether you re going for brunch or dinner I promise you will be completely satisfied. I can not wait to be back."}
{"text":"Stop #2 on our pub crawl in battery park. We hung out on the outdoor patio of Graffiti only, and it was a big hit with the warm weather. The shaded patio was inviting and peaceful, and I could see time easily slipping away while being out here with a few cocktails. 

I didn't have any food, but opted for draft beer, which I regret because their cocktails looked amazing! The drink menu was full of signature specialty cocktails, each being handmade in front of you. They did take several minutes for each one to be prepared, but I'd rather have to wait a few minutes extra for a good cocktail than get something from a mix. I'm sure I'll be back to try one out and update my review!"}
{"text":"I'm a fairly experienced eater, especially after owning a restaurant in New Zealand and then moving to Istanbul. Cleveland has an awesome food scene and Griffiti is, without question, SPECTACULAR!!!  Great food, excellent service, and the perfect ambience.  Please, please give it a try. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"OK, at this point some may be thinking \"this guy has to be a paid shill...\" Can't blame you, but in all seriousness Graffiti is just that excellent. Third visit here, third wonderful experience. 

Decided to try the Battery Park Breakfast: Pork Belly Hash, 45 Minute Eggs, Rye Toast Panzanella, Ketchup Vinaigrette. Learned this dish was the creation of co-owner Adam Bostwick and he deserves kudos for coming with up with something truly unique--not to mention delicious. Those two words, \"unique\" and \"delicious\" are pretty appropriate for everything we've tried so far. . 

I will be returning to Graffiti soon and can't wait. If you haven't tried it yet do yourself a favor and go enjoy a wonderful, creative meal in a great environment served by professional and personable staff,"}
{"text":"1st time here and it was BBQ night with a visiting chef. The were from Willoughby and their place closed and now they do catering. We sat out in the garden/ patio area. The food was great we shared the sample plate and it was enough to fill 4 good eaters. Food and drinks were great and the atmosphere even better."}
{"text":"Second visit to graffiti, once for brunch this time for dinner. Graffiti does not disappoint! I really love how they do such interesting twists on classics, like a monte cristo, shepherds pie, and chicken parm! They really elevate these classics! I had the chicken parm and it was so interesting! It was shredded confit chicken formed into a large cutlet and fried served over spatzle. It was delicious! I also tried the monte cristo (which I had for brunch before) and it was delicious as well. Very moist! Also tried the shepherds pie and although it was good, it was a little gamey for my taste but that's to be expected with lamb. I will be back! Additionally we sat outside on their beautiful patio! Could not have been a better night."}
{"text":"Our server Keith, was awesome! He was friendly and funny. Ask for Keith if you can, however the entire staff as a whole was welcoming and accommodating. The drinks were decent and the food was delicious. I highly recommend you try the The Burrito; the manchego will surprise you. Graffiti is tastefully festooned with Bob Peck artwork and overall is a chill spot for chill people with a proclivity for intimate settings and eclectic music. I found this place on a lark and I'm glad I did. You should go."}
{"text":"We were trying to decide between trying Graffiti or going to trusty old Barrio. I wish we went to Barrio, unfortunately. Graffiti was underwhelming. I got the monte cristo, which was described as a graffiti staple. It was just ok. It was kind of cold, actually, like they had prepared it an hour ahead of time then waited for someone to order it. I'm not sure if that was intended. The chicken parm was really tasty, but very small. Service was fast but our server seemed a little off... Patio looked pretty and we wanted to sit outside because it was about 70, but it was closed. Probably wouldn't recommend it, but everyone else seems to love it....so try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Really liked the vibe , and decor. It was to cold, but look forward to going back to enjoy the patio. Great service, Great selection of draft craft beer. Made reservations for a rare night out with my wife. We had wedge salad, skins,ribs, and chicken livers. Look forward to going back to sample more of the menu. Food was extremely fresh..."}
{"text":"When this place first re-opened I was a little unsure at first and now I can't get enough! Living right next door is such an added bonus! The bartenders are great and the food is all so fun and very interesting. The chicken parm, turkey leg, and fat kid 2.0 are all amazing! If youre feeling spontaneous order a \"Penicillin,\" its a fun scotch cocktail thats not on the menu that Im kind of in love with. Wish it was open later but that's the only negative I can even come up with. Plus daily popcorn flavors.. YUM."}
{"text":"Went to Graffiti with a party of eight. The staff was very nice.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  We all said we would like to go back.   We sat outside in a nice fenced in garden area."}
{"text":"Detroit shoreway is up and coming. It's gorgeous. This little restaurant is tucked in among beautiful new little homes and apartments. 

The food was good! Not over the moon incredible, but a good, really interesting take on traditional meals. I got the chicken and waffles; instead of fried chicken, it was confit chicken. The consistency of cat food, but it was delicious. The spicy butter for the waffles was amazing too! 

My friend got the monte Cristo. Meat was actually cooked perfectly and the French toast was so fluffy. Very jealous of her! 

If I was to go back, I would for sure get the Monte Cristo. There are so many interesting things on their menu though! Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Have not been down in the Battery Park area in a while, so glad I came. Great happy hour specials. Pork belly and Toast of the day were both excellent. French onion egg rolls were tasty, best part of French onion soup , including the broth  to dip in. 
The Board stole the show. Bone marrow was great, full of flavor and plentiful. Beef cheek rillette was simply amazing. Was not familiar with the hearty version of pate, but you will be very happy. We sat at the bar, and Kianna, the bartender was great. Friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable. Very good selection of beers, cocktails, and wines.  You cannot go wrong with the food or service. Awesome food and very reasonably priced. The space is really cool as well. Looking forward to our next trip on a warm day to enjoy the expansive patio!"}
{"text":"I loved the patio at this place when it was still Reddstone, so I was excited to see what the new owners did with the place. Well, it's still beautiful as ever outside. Shaded by trees, you can enjoy a nice breezy meal surrounded by plants and a cobblestone patio. It's very charming, and of course, there's a wall of \"graffiti\" in the back that looks nice.

The menu is definitely \"funky.\" You don't have too many options, and we were kind of surprised at the lack of vegetable options. But that didn't stop us from having a delicious meal. We came on Taco Tuesday, so we tried a couple veggie tacos for an appetizer (meh) and the Grainfitti Salad, which is a mix of lettuce and grains that was delicious and light. And oh, the polenta croutons, oh my! So good.

I got the Walleye for dinner, and it was light and mild, with corn and hush puppies underneath. It was pretty good, not mind blowing. And Adam got the Monte Cristo, which is definitely an interesting, delicious spin on the traditional sandwich. There's a thick piece of french toast, topped by pork. 

Dessert took the cake. Not literally... it wasn't cake. But it was AMAZING. We got the S'mores. It was basically this amazingly smooth chocolate (ganache? mousse?) on top of a brownie and topped with marshmallow topping. Even if you only come for one thing, come for this dessert."}
{"text":"Mmmm tasty and different.

Although not to the caliber of Cork N Cleaver, Graffiti was indeed very different and interesting.

- small interior- but we were seated right away, in a shared long table.

-appetizers: ordered the graffiti artist- whew, big portions!
   -Bologna fried rice: Bologna was good, however being Chinese, I wasn't a fan of the soy sauce laden rice. But I'm sure people like it.
   -fried chicken wings: whew that was real tasty! Meaty and good, especially with the sauce.
    -potato skins: man, they were loaded potato skins! Super flavorful, tasty, and pretty heavy- loved the chorizo in it!

- dinner: graffiti burger- a tasty delicious burger. Sadly, the banana ketchup didn't really taste like banana, but overall, the burger was flavorful and tasty.

- drinks: tried their version of their vanilla dark n stormy, but it was strong. Prob would go with something else next time.

The desserts looked great, but we were way too full!! Next time...

I give Graffiti a thumbs up though!"}
{"text":"Great brunch menu. Inventive takes on traditional dishes. .. I'd definitely revisit. Monte Cristo was not overly sweet, as it is often prepared. Drinks were average. Servers were attentive, offering thoughtful suggestions. Outdoor seating is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great experience, the service was excellent as was the food and atmosphere. My wife had the Shepard's pie which she really enjoyed and I had the squash pasta which was delicious. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was amazing! Our table was upstairs, right by the fire. The food was not amazing. The onion rings were ok, lots of ingredients that didn't need to be there. My burrito had a kick to it but no other flavor. It was just a little spicy with a lot of cheese. It did have a ton of meat in it, so that was nice since a lot of places skimp on the meat. I won't be going back for food. I didn't have a cocktail and the drink menu looked amazing, so I will be back in the summer for a drink on the patio."}
{"text":"Wow, I am really impressed with this place.  I've been once for dinner and once for brunch and loved both experiences.  I'd recommend going on a nice day and sitting on their back patio.  In fact, I've only sat on their patio so I can't tell you too much about the interior part of the restaurant.  All of the food I've had has been so creative and delicious!!  If they have the \"dick punch\" which is a watermelon rum drink, get it!!"}
{"text":"Hidden patio gem in Gordon Square.  I came here recently with yelp CM Lauren K to enjoy some patio time, drinks and eats.  

The patio here was beautifully decorated with string lights, plants, heaters and a large mural on the back.  Having never been here it was a little confusing on what to do since we walked in the front door to no guidance.  Apparently their hostess is located outside by the back patio not inside in the front.  Once we figured that out we were promptly seated on the patio, water was given and a small bag of Cajun spiced popcorn to munch on was presented to us. It took a little bit before our waiter came over, however since he didn't introduce himself we were a little confused who he was until he asked for our drink order.  We both opted to try their house-made patio special of Watermelon white wine sangria....refreshingly delicious. 

I opted for the BLT, while tasty the texture was missing something.  The pork belly was soft, the green tomato jam was soft, the frisse was wilted and the bun was soft - something crunchy is needed desperately.  Lauren K opted for the lamb Shepard's Pie - I didn't try it however she said it was quite tasty.  I was disappointed in the portions sizes however given their larger price tags.  

While the food was slightly underwhelming the patio and drinks were fantastic.  I will be coming back during the summer to sit and drink on the patio."}
{"text":"I tried their brunch today. There is currently a new fall menu with several delicious sounding options on it. I tried the burrito. 

The burrito is of really good size. It was stuff with two layers of short rib plus Burrito black beans and red rice. I really enjoyed it. There was also a hot fall drink special combining apple cider, cinnamon and bourbon. Simple. Delicious. Yes it had alcohol in it, but you couldn't really taste it. I could have drank a gallon of it. 

I was only here once before for dinner. My second time here did not disappoint. Definitely check out the fall brunch (Sunday only) menu. There are also good sounding brunch appetizer and desserts."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were in Cleveland and decided to have a date night - I sent him a few ideas and told him to surprise me and boy did he ever surprise me! This place was AMAZING. We made reservations for 8 p.m. When we got there we were seated immediately out on the patio which was beautiful. It gave the perfect setting for the evening that needed and wanted to have. We ordered a bottle of Rose Brut De Cuvaison Moutard for the table along with some Fried Green Tomatoes to get us started. The chipolte aioli that was served with the tomatoes was perfect. For dinner I had the Shepard's Pie and boyfriend had the Chicken Parmesan. The lamb in the Shepard's Pie was cooked perfectly. He loved his food too - said it was one of the best Chicken Parmesans he's had. This place is perfect for date nights or dinner with the girls. I hope I get the chance to go back."}
{"text":"The food was top notch! As always for me this was a date night adventure! We both LOVED the experience. wish they were open on Mondays only because that is typically my day off during the week and we are always looking for some wonderful food and a great patio! I would recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"A+ service. Awesome atmosphere (it's the old Reddstone). Great cocktail & beer selection. Amazing food. Perfect portions. Price is right for the quality.

Their Monte Cristo: Maple Brined Pork Tenderloin, French Toast, Mornay Crema, Raspberry Mostarda... One of the best things I've ever eaten. 

I'm one of those weirdos who doesn't like chicken parm, but I'd eat theirs all day - fresh flavors, super tender.

Their Chef's Whim Chips & Dip was like sweet potato nachos: black beans, cilantro, gingery sauce... Hope that's the chef's whim often b/c it was bomb.

I think this is my new favorite place - we'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"This location has the best patio in the Cleveland area.  It feels like each seating area is secluded and there is an ample amount of shade provided by the 2 giant tress inside of the area.  I can't get enough time outside during the short Cleveland summers, so that's why I chose this place to meet up with friends I haven't seen in a year.

My main reason for choosing this place was solely for the patio, but I will definitely go back rain or shine, or snow and wind.  The food is that freaking good!  Oh wait, we had drinks first so I should talk about them.  There are plenty of local and craft beers on tap and there is a decent variety.  I started off with Revolution's Anti Hero.  As I perused the cocktail section, I knew I would be switching.  Beer before liquor, never sicker!  I ordered the Tommy's Tree which had tequila, rosemary syrup, and lime juice.  Yum.  Someone at our table ordered a gin drink (I don't remember the name) and it had muddled basil and blueberries.  I'm not a gin drinker, but this is what I'm ordering the next time I go.  I guess that makes me a gin drinker?

Enough shenanigans, I want to talk about the food.  I had some of the best food I've eaten in a long time.  We started out with the crispy chicken livers with apple liver pate.  Holy frijoles, I couldn't get enough of that pate.  It is super creamy and flavorful and paired perfectly with the crispy liver.  Oh we also ordered the Graffiti Artist, which allows you to pick smaller portions of 3 different appetizers.  We ordered the wings, based on the waiters suggestion, French onion egg rolls, and chorizo and guacamole potato skins.  The wings were my favorite. 

As for our dinner selections, we ordered the shepherds pie, monte christo, chicken parmesan, and 4 side plates for sharing.  I want to talk about the monte christo.  This is not a sandwich.  It isn't laden with powdered sugar as one might think.  It is just some of the best sliced pork tenderloin on top of french toast that you'll ever eat!  My mouth is watering just thinking about.  Every plate we had was delicious.  I love the creative ways each dish was presented.

And yes.......we saved room for dessert.  Not realizing it, we had actually been there for 3 hours already!  Not because of the service, but because of the awesome time we were having.  We split the cereal dessert.  I loved it because it wasn't too sweet.  It's actually quite refreshing.  And who doesn't love fruity pebbles!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. It's a bit hidden, but it's worth it when you find it. We sat outside in their garden. Great low key atmosphere, and they gave out complimentary flavored popcorn.  The pork belly blt was amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing Date night atmosphere. We loved everything we ordered. Quality made unique drinks on the lovely patio at night time. We had fried oysters for an appetizer, we even ate the mixed greens garnish which was in a delicious vinaigrette. He had the chicken parm and loved it. I had the burrito and appreciated the ingredients but would only give it a B- for taste (more sauce would probably make it better). We absolutely loved the service and atmosphere and would go again to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"AWFUL- Ok to be specific it was a cool-ish atmosphere- super dark- even to be considered intimate. The food was gross. Got the fried green tomato appetizer and it was decent. Then the entree was where I made a BIG mistake- I ordered the lobster roll and it was DISGUSTING. It literally tasted like it was sitting in a bucket all day and it smelled super fishy. Didn't eat it. The salad that was on the side was good though. My date got the burger and it was ok. Nothing special. One star for the good drinks. Also expensive."}
{"text":"Great brunch!  loved the service, food, and atmosphere.  I would suggest the chicken and waffles - simply divine."}
