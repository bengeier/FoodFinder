{"text":"The burger was great! It was just the right size so you don't over-stuff yourself. The fried jalepeno's were amazing!! (Hint: put them on your burger for some extra texture and a bit of a kick, you will love it! trust me). The pretzels were really good as well with the beer cheese (which was really good). Would definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Hard to find but worth it. More than 20 beers on tap. Burgers, hot dogs, and chili are the staples of this place. Small, but with a friendly staff. You cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Best chili cheese fries I've ever had! Good burgers as well, but be sure to get some beer cheese on the side to push them up even higher."}
{"text":"Found this awesome spot while visiting charlotte. Loved the pretzel with the beer cheese dip. Lots of excelente craft beers to try.  The hotdog choices are amazing!  The place is a bit small but cozy, the staff is cool. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great laid-back chill spot if you're looking to grab some drinks and some hearty food (chili, burgers, hot dogs). 

It's a pretty small venue, but it's clean and they don't blast music so it's easy to converse with your company. Don't expect a fine-dining sit-down setting. You place your order and they serve it to you in paper/foam plates like a food truck.

Nice selection of beers, but here's the pro tip: Each day they have a \"Kick the Keg\" beer special, where they put 2 beers on sale and you can get a pitcher for like $7 or $8. Basically for the price of a beer anywhere else, you can get an entire pitcher. It may not be your favorite beer, but it's still solid and the volume pays for itself.

Have only tried the chili cheese fries and those were good. Service is friendly and fast, and the prices are fair. I would go back."}
{"text":"Super dank chili on top of creative dogs, burgers, and nachos. Long list of craft beers on tap. Perfect spot for a casual date. Underrated"}
{"text":"This is EXTRA legit.  So legit it motivated me to actually write a review on Yelp.

No weak sauce pickled jalapeños, they give you the fresh ones on top your chili.

Flavors are fresh and tasty.  Far from your average restaurant chili, i.e. it doesn't come frozen in a bucket.  

Do yourself and the owner operators a favor and get some!!!!!"}
{"text":"Real laid back atmosphere......GREAT food!  Chili and hot dogs the specialty.....Attentive service ......off the beaten path.....be sure not miss it!"}
{"text":"Great stop for a selection of 20 beers for the discerning beer drinker. Bring a growler or grab one of Queen City's and have a pint, fill a growler, repeat. 

Great spot. Worth the trip. 
Finally a filling station in Charlotte that has a great selection."}
{"text":"The beer selection is awesome - 20 beers (and 2 wines) on tap!! And they're from all around the country - some local in Charlotte, some from all the way in California! You must try the \"Good morning Vietnam\" (coffee blonde ale) it's the BEST! The food is great if you're looking for some nice good bar food to go with the beer. Definitely returning, can't wait to make it my favorite local happy hour spot"}
{"text":"Horrid service
Bartender and manager with horrible attitude.
Any question he'll answer rudely.
I was appalled.
When i went to ask my friend wht he wanted to get he said I don't go there they have bad service.
I thought maybe he's having a bad day, I guess everday he's like that."}
{"text":"Cool concept.  Nothing like it in Charlotte.

If you're already in the area, definitely worth getting over some of the other courtyard spots.

I wouldn't say it's mouthgasm quality, but it's definitely solid...."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place out after seeing it come together over the last several months. 

Two dogs, side & drink for $10. I think that's a pretty darn good deal, especially being in Uptown. For my two dogs I opted for the Cincinnati style & the New York style. If you're into carolina style with the slaw on it, it looked realllly good, I just don't care for slaw. My favorite was the cincinnati style (probably a little biased since I'm from Ohio). The cooked onions & mustard on it were awesome. The chili on both was exceptional, and couldn't can't go wrong. The fried jalapeno caps were a great side choice (watch out for the red ones mixed in ... they're HOT). 

My only 'complaint' was that they got a little soggy. My recommendation for management would be to either toast the buns a wee bit, or not put the mustard on the bottom of the New York dog? Other than that, it was a great choice. The inside is small, but they've done it up very nice. I'll definitley be coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, onion rings, fried pickles and poutine fries. Service was great too! Definite must eat near French Quarter!"}
{"text":"Great beers, great food, great people. Try the peanut butter and jelly beer, and grab some fried apps and a burger!"}
{"text":"Food could be great but we would never know! The fact that you have 1 persons behind the bar taking orders and bartending is ridicules! Get it together guys... It's the 4th hire staff get prepared. How about putting a sign on the locked door that says please you the \"other door\" won't be back won't ever recommend a place that can't serve customers properly."}
{"text":"Bartender was very sweet and helped me pick the perfect beer for a hot day. She offered a small sample beforehand so I wasn't disappointed. If I lived in NC I'd definitely be coming back for Thirsty Thursday $4 All Draft And Can Beer. Very happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Popped in for a pitcher of craft beer with my coworker. Got a pitcher of a local Octoberfest for $13! That is a steal no matter where you live. The beer was fresh and cold and delicious. Enjoyed the beverages outside on the seating area in the alley way and had a great afternoon before the Thursday night football game."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning cheeseburger. Beer cheese is also outstanding for dipping fries in. Don't miss this place. Run, don't walk here. I'll definitely be back to try the jalapeño mushroom caps and one of the daily specialty burgers. Great beer specials and happy hour spot as well."}
{"text":"Holy SHIT.

A)Thank you for not having 300 things on your fucking menu. Be good at what you do and I will love you (and now I do)

B)Menu items are hilariously named (not in a kitschy way, but actually funny

C)Nice beer selection

D)Owners are cool and there's a really good look and feel to the place.

If I lived in Charlotte, this place would be the reason I die of a blood clot."}
{"text":"My kids and I were uptown (Pokemon hunting) and stumbled through Latta Arcade looking for a bite to eat. Any parent with a picky eater knows this can be a difficult task, finding one of the 3 things your kid will eat while also having a wide selection for yourself. 

My oldest is always down for a burger (plain, literally meat and bread only) QCBC's menu was posted in the window of its storefront and we hit gold! Burgers for $6, pretzels (for the picky eater) and a Carolina style sloppy burger for mom...SCORE!

The bartender wasn't too attentive and seemed a little more interested in his beer drinking (and tipping customers) but I got his attention and placed an order. To my surprise dude stepped up and packed our stuff up for a great picnic lunch. He even asked how I wanted the fries packed and suggested separate so they don't get wet from the chili (however I would not mind but kids...).

We took our massive Togo order all packed with every utensil, condiment and plenty of napkins across the street to Romare Bearden Park and spread out in the sun at which time we laid out and devoured those burgers. The ratio of chili, slaw, onions, cheese and mustard to burger was perfect. Even the bun was amazing, grilled with a buttery crust which kept it from getting soggy. The pretzels were huge and fresh which is how I would explain the fries too. 

This is my new burger joint and I intend to bring my family back. Until then I will stroll down to QCBC on my lunch breaks for some chili on the first cool fall day in uptown."}
{"text":"I'm the guy who has complained for 15 years that you can't get a good chili dog in Charlotte. Just got back from lunch.I had a burger and a Carolina chili dog. Fantastic! By far the best in Charlotte - no kidding. Finally I can stop complaining. Of course it's not located in Blakeney so there is still that to rant about."}
{"text":"I never knew how much I loved pimento cheese before trying the pimento fries and the pim-baco-chee burger at qcbc. Staff is always amazing and there is a rotating plethora of amazing beer on tap! One of the best places I've ever been!!!"}
{"text":"So disgusting that I'm surprised to see the other reviews. A place that specializes in chili but has gross tasting, barely warm chili. Sorry, theres WAY too many better food options just steps away."}
{"text":"Wow, I haven't written a review for this place. I'm so slacking. So when I was working in Uptown on pay days I would walk around and try to find something to eat. I came across this place. So the chili is freaking great. Love the burger and the fried jalapeno chips are just awesome. They have like 20 beers on tap.  The staff super friendly makes me miss working Uptown and my lunch break beer. :)"}
{"text":"Nice to have a growler shop in Brevard Court. Came here for lunch and got it to go. I was impressed by the chili cheese nachos. Hand cut potato chips, fresh chili, fresh jalapeño slices, and the beer cheese was better than any processed nacho cheese. My bowels paid for it later, but it was worth it...My husband had a bacon cheeseburger, and he said he'll come here first next time he's craving a burger. He called it a \"real\" burger, not some frozen precut patty. The have fountain orange fanta. You never see that! 3 of us ate for under $30 and still had 20 minutes before lunch hour was over. This spot is definitely going into rotation."}
{"text":"In full Dora the Explorer mode I found this gem on Yelp and decided to walk over and glad I did! I was welcomed by the lovely bartender Brandy who recommended an awesome brew & the North Carolina Chilli Burger. 

The crafted beer list is displayed and updated regularly,  I love the selection of small breweries from across the US. 

Must try: North Carolina chilli,  Tangerine Wheat Ale & Pineapple Sculpin IPA  oh my absolute favorite is the Jalapeño Bites! Do yourself a favor add them to your burger and get a side of them!"}
{"text":"Two hotdogs and a drink for $4. YUMMY!!! It is in Greenwhich village and two doors down from Queen City Beer and Chili. The coffee at Queen City Beer and Chili is the best."}
{"text":"Place is legit. I don't play no games when it comes to coneys and neither do they. Slightly disappointed they don't have a Chicago style dog but I came for the coney and it was on point. 

I don't drink a lot of beer so I'd like to see them add some old fashion style soda pop or maybe a root beer on tap. However My old lady got a beer and enjoyed it. 

Great food, great service, great atmosphere and great prices.  I'll be back to Queen City beer & chili by the end of the month."}
{"text":"I was blown away by this place. I took my wife there this past Monday just to check it out and WOW am I glad I did. I went for the nachos and already know what I'm getting next time I'm in town. Not only was the food amazing but the hospitality provided by AJ made my visit that much better. Do yourselves a favor and head there right now!!!!"}
{"text":"Another good find through Yelp!  A colleague and I wanted something simple and quick for dinner. We both like chill  and beer is a must. Stopped in and did well in both departments. Great little place. Met the owner on a somewhat slow night and had a great chat. The chili and Reuben dog was the bomb!  If you are in Charlotte, make it a must try place. By the way, get the one pound bowl. Just the right size!"}
{"text":"QCBC is a cool little spot that's off the beaten path. It is very small but does offer a verity of craft beers and does have tasty food options. However, I was unable to try the my appetizer of choosing and they only had French fry options. I will say this tho! Those French frys were awesome though!! The beer was ice cold and the service was fast and friendly. If you are in the area stop in!"}
{"text":"What a cute lil place!! The famous Nathan hot dogs just make everything even better!! How in our many foot travels around Uptown the last month or two we never found this lil gem I'll never know. QCBC is \"tucked up\" in the French Quarter, once again a place found completely by accident while looking for a place to eat. Price is very reasonable for the quality, my husband had the Carolina dog, I a simple plain Nathan's dog with yummy beer cheese and grilled onions. We both enjoyed our dogs and will very likely go back. The chili was very good, and we will certainly have to go back for a bowl of chili. That said for hot dog chili my husband isn't a fan of chili w beans. That certainly won't stop us from going back!! Honestly what's better than an ice cold beer and a Nathan's hot dog on a late Saturday afternoon??? Our simple meal and drink took us both back to the early days of our marriage when we'd get a 25 cent draft, 15 cent hot dogs and play pool for another 25 cents!!! Too bad QCBC doesn't have pool tables! They do have a decent beer list you can choose from both local and non local breweries. I had a tangerine wheat and OMG was it one of the best beers I've ever had!! If you've not taken the time to check QCBC out yet you are missing good food, good ice cold beer and a cool lil place to enjoy them!! They have both indoor and out door seating."}
{"text":"I work nearby and have passed by several times and today I decided to give them a try. Im glad I did!

The place isn't that big, but it wasn't crowded to the point where I couldn't find seating. I was greeted right away by very friendly staff. I sat at the bar. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted and it was recommended that I tried one of the burgers. 

I placed an order for the Kickstarter Burger. It came with a fried egg, bacon, cheese, chipotle mayo and Tabasco. It was very good. It wasn't too spicy if you don't like spicy food. The food came really quick. The burger came with fries and they were actually salted perfectly. 

Normally for lunch, I feel like I'm waiting for my food forever. All in all, I was seated, placed my order, ate and paid, all in a matter of 30 minutes. Which is great, as it means I will for sure come back during my hectic lunch hour."}
{"text":"Great chili dogs! Service was quick and easy! Hot dogs could have been a little bigger but the chili was good!"}
{"text":"A miss overall. Gives you plastic bowls and silverware. Are they trying to make this a to-go place or a sit and eat? Pretty expensive too for chili. Chili was pretty good to be fair."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! This place is a gem. Yes, it is small but the atmosphere is awesome. If you miss this place you will miss a real treat."}
{"text":"Post marathon pre-selected choice for beer by my friends and no complaints from me. I love seasonal beers and had two that were recommended by the bartender. She was very personable and took the time to explain the beer she had on tap.

This place doesn't have a lot of space inside but had plenty of room to accommodate our crew of 8. A few pub tables, larger tables in the middle, and a decent-sized bar. We didn't stay very long and I decided not to order any food as we already had plans. I heard they have great chili and looking back, it was a mistake not to do that as cold as it was.

I think this would be a cool spot to come back to. My instinct is that it would fill up relatively quickly, so perhaps a trip outside of peak hours would be the best call. It was minutes away from the marathon finish and turned out to be a no brainer to come here."}
{"text":"Once you try this almost-hidden spot at the Brevard Court, you'll kick yourself for all that time you wasted having drafts instead of crafts. 
Here's why:
- More than 15 taps pouring crafts.
- Constantly rotating crafts selection. Duh!
- Friendly bartenders. Shout out to Rochelle. 

Tip:
Great beer. Average food
Four and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"I'm torn about this spot... The food is average. The beer selection is good. The location is great. 

First, the food... Your run of the mill bar grub -- burgers, hotdogs, fries. You would think the chili would steal the show but it's really pretty bland and lacks that pizazz or spice I enjoy in a good chili. 

Next, the beer selection... Lots of great, local choices on draft. 20 choices, to be exact. I like that they offer flights because I am indecisive and like to sample lots! 

Lastly, the location... I love Brevard Court. It reminds me of a little alley in Europe. It's really an oasis right in the heart of uptown Charlotte. The interior of QCBC is nice, too. Lots of sleek wood. High top tables and a few seats at the bar. It's teeny-tiny though, so if anything is happening uptown (especially a Knights Game) expect a packed house. 

So, moral of this story is, I wish they'd up their food game. I would be inclined to visit more if there was something I really loved and craved on the menu."}
{"text":"The Carolina dog is good but the white chicken chili is great! You know a good chili from a bad one when A) you can eat with a fork and B) when The fork stands up in the bowl. Well done!"}
{"text":"Overpriced boiled Oscar Meyer Weiner hotdogs and cheap store bought buns. The one and only time I came here, it took about 40 minutes to get our food. We were four of the 6 people in the restaurant. Pretty sure the same person serving was also cooking."}
{"text":"My BF and I stopped into this quaint little bar after visiting the NASCAR Hall of Fame last Saturday. They have a good selection of craft beers and a great menu. The bartender was really cool and he let us sample a few of the dark beers. Our favorite was definitely the Mexican chocolate stout (can't remember the exact name). We ordered the Bavarian pretzel with beer cheese to start, and my boyfriend ordered a burger and I ordered the buffalo chicken burger for lunch. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. If you're in the Charlotte area, you must stop here for some delicious food and a few beers!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent beer choices, I would recommend the peach cider! Service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"A Yelp find! Ol trusty Yelp machine at it again... A friend and I had just finished up at the Charlotte International Auto Show and decided to stick around Up/Downtown. The location wasn't what I originally pictured, but it was definitely a quaint little spot in the heart of the French Quarter. Apparently, it has recently changed to QCBC from a different format.

The bartender was very friendly offering suggestions when it came to food on the menu, the drinks on tap and other drinks she could make for you.

There are just shy of 20 rotating craft brews on tap, plus a selection of liquors if you dare. They have a special where you can get one beer and a select whiskey for $10. 

We both ordered burgers. He went with the bartenders fave - the pimento cheese bacon burger , and I opted for the basic burger. All served with your choice of side item. They came out fairly quick and on no frills paper plates. The burger and fresh fries were very delicious! He was still hungry so he went back for seconds and ordered a loaded Carolina dog and devoured it -- says it was tasty. Against my better judgement I wanted something else as well so I put in an order of beer cheese fries. Man it came out steaming hot! It was tasty as well, but the beer cheese is very thin and 'soupy' .. booo! I wonder if there is a way to thicken it up a bit? It'd be even better!

Apparently, they are known for serving delicious chili. We'll have to make it back and give that a try! I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"First time going to QCBC and it definitely won't be the last. Tried the burger of the day \"The Fatty\" and it was one of the best burgers I've had. The patties were rolled with onion and jalapeño topped with a Sriracha ranch sauce. Highly recommended! Great craft brew selection as well."}
{"text":"The special chili is always on point..Haven't checked out the beer selection as I go for lunch (can't drink during work hours) but chili is great"}
{"text":"Good chili joint, excellent beer selection. Neat little joint for sure. You want chili and or chili dogs or chili burgers,,,,. Here you go."}
{"text":"I went there once for chili and have returned once a week since. I'm hooked! This is the best damn chili I've ever had. The spices and heat taste amazing."}
{"text":"This place is the shiznit! Excellent beer menu and some seriously good chili. They've got all the bases covered for real chili lovers. They've got your classic Texas style chili but with a hint of beans, perfectly seasoned. Don't worry Texans, the bean to beef ratio is more than reasonable...it's mostly beef, you won't feel cheated. For Midwesterners they've got the perfect chili for smothering all over a good old fashioned middle America style chili dog. ?Folks from the Southwest won't feel left out when they see the green chili on the menu. Granted, it's chicken instead of pork, but still pretty cool to see that green chili all the way out in Charlotte! For me, the most exciting thing about QCBC is the good old fashioned chillighetti (spaghetti noodles topped with chili, cheese, and onions) that I grew up eating in Illinois, ahhh, Heaven. 

QCBC, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"As a recent transplant, I was very excited to find a Cincinnati style coney in Charlotte.  Grabbed one for take out.  Quick in and out, no waiting.  The taste of the Coney is very close to a skyline.  It is missing just a smidge of something, but truly not a bad coney.  I will be going back again for another coney and to try some of the craft beers on tap!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and it won't be the last! Service was on point and food was delicious. We had chili...3 choice platter which included smoked sausage, ribs and pulled pork. The mac & cheese is like grandma's.  Baked beans and collard greens seasoned like homemade. Great choice for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"These are the best burgers in the city. I appreciate that they go with two small patties versus one big one for maximum char flavor!

Very good fries also. This is my (and several other co-workers) go to place for a burger in Uptown.

Only bummer is they don't serve iced tea. But I am over that."}
{"text":"This my first time here. Everett the co-owner was kind enough to welcome us into the newly  owned QCBC. The Chicken Chili is amazing . Christopher was our Bartender and waiter he was amazing great suggestions and recommendations. The #1 Spice Merchant Chai Cider add a fireball shot $10 . I also had the #16 Fools Gold Imperial Mocha Blonde Stout (11.9% ABV- you only need 2) the service was so amazingams welcoming. I will definitely be back?"}
{"text":"Omg i was visiting from Miami and wanted a burger so this place was perfect! I got their award winning burger and it was perfection, it felt homemade. Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"This is how a burger should taste!  Super friendly staff, great beer selection and awesome food!  Quaint little dining area in Brevard Court Uptown with a couple of outdoor seating options for some fun people watching.  Definitely would recommend checking this spot out!"}
{"text":"I love hot dogs, so when I heard about this place I knew I had to try it. I stopped in Saturday night with a friend and wasn't sure what to expect! The location is small and inviting. They have several beers on tap that you can choose from by looking through the laptop. You can even buy a growler! The menu is pretty simple. We each got two hot dogs; the Carolina Style Chili Dog and the Cincinnati Coney. Both were great, we also split a side of fries which were fresh out of the fryer. They were cooked perfectly. It's a good spot to grab a quick bite to eat or have a beer. The staff was super friendly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Ambiance is cozy and inviting. Craft beer is on point, and the food is great. You're only going to find Burgers, Dogs, Chili, and Fries here, but do you really need anything else? We went prior to a Panthers game and really enjoyed ourselves. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers in Charlotte. Consistently delicious, fresh and fast. Just stick to the basics, you won't be disappointed. 

Each burger comes with two patties. Meat is cooked fresh upon ordering and is the right ratio for the size of the bun and other toppings. 

The staff has even delivered my order to the neighboring bars in Latta Arcade (when they are not too busy) so I didn't have to wait. 

Good selection of beers too!"}
{"text":"Queen City Beer and Chili does not disappoint!!  I had been waiting for this spot to open up for a while since I see it every time I'm in Brevard court grabbing lunch- glad to see it finally opened.

Went here for lunch so I could not partake in the beer, but I will definitely be back- either to grab a couple pints or fill a growler up to take home.

Love the concept.  The two chili dogs I had for lunch were spot on.  I went with the meal combo 3 which consists of two dogs, a side, and a drink.   They do not have many menu offerings but they make a strong showcase of their chili using various food vessels. My buddy got the nachos that were made of their house chips and a ton of toppings (added bacon for a dollar fidy).  Super reasonable prices for the food - seems like the more Charlotte grows the more expensive lunch uptown becomes.

The right side of the place is where you order the food, you can either take it out or bring it into the bar area where they have about 6 tables- or sit at the bar!  Modern warm wood covers the entire space and there is exposed brick on the bar side (left side).  Edison bulbs win the growler shades adorn the ceilings and give the bar a pretty great relaxed atmosphere.

Staff was super nice and made sure we were happy with how everything turned out.  I definitely will be back to partake in the 20 beers they have on tap."}
