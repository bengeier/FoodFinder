{"text":"OK, found this flyer at our doorstep this past weekend and decided to try it out. We ordered 2 cold sandwiches and some wings.... oh my goodness.... Italian HOAGIE, what a disaster.... they use mini pepperoni slices (like Hormel, pre-sliced), some pre-sliced ham and salami and 2 pieces of cheese on a broken hoagie roll. Husband said the gyro tasted awful. The fries on the side were COLD, neither of us received an even luke-warm fry.... Awful sandwiches. Standard boneless wings.  Delivery time: surprisingly fast, under 45 minutes. HOWEVER... that does not make up for their awful sandwiches.  End Result: 95% of food thrown away, $40 wasted and Grand Italia menu smashed in trash can."}
{"text":"I'll admit....I havent tried any of the italian food.  However, the gyros are great.  Tried the beef/lamb combo.  Meat was tender and juicy and tzatziki sauce freshly prepared & plentiful.  All veggies crisp, flatbread warm & soft.  Great pricing at $7.00 luch special (includes drink & fries) Fast, friendly delivery.  Would recommend based on this dish alone"}
{"text":"seriously????!! This place took a HOUR past what my confirmation said it would take them to deliver! I ordered my food at 8:01 email said it would take them to get at my house at 8:50. They didn't even show up till 9:50 and when I said that's not okay for them to be an hour late, the delivery guy had no care in the world and just said oh i had to go back.. Even if that was the case they have the number and could have had the decency to call and let me know.(and my food was cold by the time it did arrive) I've called twice to talk to the manager to have the matter handled and \"hes not here\" conveniently each time, and has never returned..had the manger taken care of this and gave good customer service I wouldn't even bother with this review . Bad service, foods nothing special"}
{"text":"Although I got a flier on my apartment door, which has a no soliciting sign 5 feet away, I thought I would give them a call as their menu has listed a full rack of ribs for 12.95.  When I called they told me it was 19.95 and refused to give it to me as their advertised price.  So soliciting in a prohibited area and false advertising, sounds like a place I would really trust to make food for me...."}
{"text":"This is the worst business in Las Vegas it's really sad that I'm refusing to order from here anymore because I refuse to deal with the manager Rasheed and it's extremely sad that his father leaves the business to him the way that he runs things this business will never get far they are a rip-off if they don't have your order correct they will not fix it and when they tell you they will fix it they never do I am now fighting them in court because my order was way off I spent $100 on a business order and now they're refusing to do anything about it not to mention I've been a customer over 2 years now and Rasheed has the nerve to treat me this way HE IS THE WORST MANAGER I HOPE IS FATHER PUTS HIS TRUST IN SOMEONE ELSE RASHEED IS DEFINITELY NOT FIT FOR THE JOB save your self the trouble don't order here"}
{"text":"Food was decent. I've ordered pizza, spaghetti and now chicken fingers and fries from them. Nothing bad to say about them really. It's close to my house and easy enough to order. It's not anything I would go out of the way to order but satisfying enough."}
{"text":"CAPTAINS LOG- Star date: 20014 After following through with an immediate need for consumables, we placed an order through the\"Grand Italia\" food expediting system. Although specific instructions were clearly communicated to said party, there was a major discrepancy upon time of delivery. At approximately 10:15 pm standard Pacific time, the package had arrived 10 minutes later than the estimated time of arrival, and without its full volume. They forgot my French fries.... Communications were immediately initiated, and after a seven minute interval which i was left unattended on the phone, they conveyed their final response,\"sorry our manager isn't here right now, but i can give you a dollar off your next purchase.\" ... Communications were then immediately halted with no intentions of future encounters..."}
{"text":"Wow.  Absolutely discusting!  I put in a delivery order for me my husband and 2 kids.  So it was a good sized order I guess. The girl on the phone asked me \"Anything else\" after everything I said.. so annoying. We ordered chicken phili, 12 plain chicken wings, and 2 kids pastas, 1 alfredo 1 spaghetti. The phili had mushrooms onions and peppers that were black from being burned to death and there were like 5 strips of chicken on this huge roll. The kids meals were ridiculously too big.  I couldn't have finished one. And then for a side with the pasta a whole Styrofoam full of fries for each kids meal!  All the food was awful to eat. No taste at all. To top it off my husband bit into our 3rd chicken wing and it was green.  Yuck! I won't even get into their gross sauces they provided with the wings.  I would have to say the worst food I've ever had. Ever."}
{"text":"I hardly ever, ever take the time to do a Yelp review, so the fact I am doing one speaks volumes.  My fiancé and I have been frequent customers of this place, usually ordering the pizza, which is good.  A while ago I decided to order something different.  I ordered a hot beef sandwich.  I literally could not believe my eyes.  There was hardly ANY meat on the sandwich at all.  My fiancé said maybe they were having an off  night.  I was VERY disappointed, but we continue to order from them.  Last night my girlfriend and I both ordered a cold salami and cheese sandwich.  I don't even know where to begin with the disappointment of this experience.  We waited OVER an hour.  We had to call them, and I'm not sure if they forgot us or what happened.  Finally the food arrives.  There literally was ONE THIN LAYER of meat.  Exactly like the salami from Subway - PAPER THIN!  A pile of lettuce and no mayonnaise.  We could not believe our eyes.  I cannot believe a food establishment puts out food like this ON A CONSISTENT BASIS (sandwiches) and is not completely embarrassed.  They have lost our business now, as we will never order from them again.  What a complete rip off!  If you do order from here, DO NOT order a sandwich, as you will be very, very disappointed, unless all you wanted was a bun."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken Alfredo , with a side salad gyro and a Capri salad. 2 cheesecake slices for dessert. Total for our food was 44.00. Had the food delivered. Paid by credit card which cost another dollar. Didn't get a receipt, going off the menu prices looks like I paid an extra 7.00. The food was marginal at best. The cheesecake tasted like it had been thawed out and put in the fridge for a few days. I had high hopes and unfortunately won't be ordering again after poor food quality and being over charged."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered, it was great. I ordered a second time, they forgot one of the toppings and gave us garlic balls instead of the breadsticks... no biggie...  So we ordered a third time (all within a 1-week time frame, Fri- Fri)... I informed the woman about the previous mistakes, she said we should have called them that day. Okay, fair enough...  The delivery took over an hour. Not to mention,  the delivery guy in the black Lexus wasn't friendly and had an attitude like WE were the ones who were late.  The pizza was wrong and the breadsticks were burnt. I called the restaurant,  explained what was wrong with the order. Mind you,  the children had been waiting over an hour to eat, so they had already taken a couple of slices from the pizza... the woman said the chef said the bread was fine. Really?  Because I offered to text them photos of the black bread we received!! She then said she would replace the pizza ONLY IF NONE OF THE SLICES WERE TOUCHED & IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER HOUR (putting us past 7 pm, when we ordered before 5 pm) After explaining our situation, she spoke with the manager and came back to say she could offer a $2 credit off our next order.   I said that was unacceptable. I spent over $120 with their business in the past week. She said the manager would call me back... I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY NO LONGER RECEIVE OUR BUSINESS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN $500/MO EASILY."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The food sucked tasted like a TV dinner. We ordered the four course. It comes with fries, wings, pizza, choice of pasta, dessert and drink. An hour later he comes with pizza and two orders of fries and wings. He had left by the time I realized. I called and the chick on the phone told me he had actually brought us the wrong wings and fries and we were to give him back everything when he comes to give us what we ordered. I'm like seriously so all I have is a pizza. Another hour later he comes and brings us the pasta and dessert and thankfully  I just starting eating the wings and fries since he didn't bring those either. He stands there and tells me it's the girls fault over the phone not his. I'm like really dude? And stands there like Imma give him a tip.. Yeah right on top of that again the food sucks and I have some pics.. The pasta was watery and the bread stick was burnt.. The pizza was greasy as hell and fries were dry and gross. Yuck never again.."}
{"text":"They delivered a cheeseburger with mold on the bottom bun. When we called to complain, they offered a 10% discount on our next order. No thank you. We will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Ordered for takeout.  Spinach Calzone was black on edges with little spinach or cheese inside.  Marinara was more like tomato juice.  Salad and cannoli were tasty.  Not worth the price. Will not return.  Employee sleeping in chairs @ table."}
{"text":"We like this place because there is many different options. We like that they deliver. However, delivery takes FOREVER. If we plan on ordering from here we do so well before dinner time. We mostly order burgers and they are HUGE. You really get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst meal I've had in over a year. Horrible frozen food re-heated and passed off as dinner. We ordered the spaghetti dinner special which included an appetizer, salad, spaghetti and meatballs, pop, bread, and 2 dessert orders. We had breaded mushrooms as an appetizer, these were about the same quality as something that you would buy and heat yourself in your microwave. The salad was just basic bag lettuce mix but tasted fine. The bread, oh the bread. This was when I started laughing out loud in my kitchen. The bread was a hot dog bun soaked in a garlic butter sludge and then put back together and heated. When I say hot dog bun I mean the kind you get at the store for like 50 cents a package. The spaghetti order was generous at probably a full pound of noodles. How ever they had been badly overcooked and then allowed to dry back out in parts. This was complimented by maybe a 1/4 cup of \"sauce\" which was just enough to color the noodles an odd orange color. The sauce tasted like ketchup that had a few tablespoons of dried oregono tossed into it. In fact that was the only real detectable flavor in the whole dish. 2 meatballs, total, accompanied our dinner. They were obviously frozen and both slightly smaller then a ping pong ball. Looked and tasted exactly like stouffers. We ordered zeppoli and a cannoli for dessert. The zeppoli consisted of maybe 20-25 globs of cold rock hard dough ranging in size from pea, to meatball sized. All were too hard to bite into and tasted like old oil. The cannoli was also cold and filled with what I believe was cream cheese icing from a can, mixed with some mini chicolate chips. I've never had a cannoli lose it's filling when turned sideways before. The 2-Liter of Coke we had was by far the best thing about this meal. I won't be back for any reason, complete waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This restaurant sent someone to my neighborhood solely for the purpose of dropping off fliers on folks doors.  Unfortunately, there is a big NO SOLICITING sign posted at our gate for our neighborhood, but these guys evidently didn't care.  I decided to call them and see if they actually would deliver to my house (live about 8 or 9 miles away) and they told me no, it was too far.  So, they drop off fliers where they are prohibited from doing so, and it is beyond their delivery range.  Good marketing guys..."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews I have no idea what those people are talking about because the pizza is the best in town! You guys just have to try it and believe me about what I'm saying. If there were 6 stars then that would be my rate. I live in Brooklyn where the best pizzas are at, I know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Just ordered today 2 hours to get my order (I was told 45 minutes)  pizza was cold and soggy below average in taste.  Management had no reasonable explanation.  Not sure how this place has two stars, zero stars would be better."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this restaurant, so I tried the lunch specials and it's phenomenal! For a good price I got a grilled chicken with lettuce, a lot of fries and a free soda. I had a good laugh with the girl on the phone. I am ordering there again next time!!!!"}
{"text":"We placed an order thru GrubHub for TWO Salads, one order of French Fries and Chicken Marsala - SIMPLE - right?  I placed the order at 501 pm and we FINALLY got it ALL at 834 PM - $42 and 3 trips to the house with the WRONG food, missing food, etc... when I tried to contact GrubHub Customer Svc online chat I was 57th in LINE - called the restaurant directly and they don't know ENGLISH very well at all - said that they were very busy - how hard is it to make TWO SALADS, an order of French Fries and Chicken Marsala -ALL things that they should have MADE AHEAD OF TIME, drop the potatoes in the fryer and the Chicken Marsala should be made up already and sitting in the marinade - WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE EVER ORDER.  This was the 2nd time - Valentine's Dinner we will NEVER forget.  I order last week on the 7th too and it took 1 hour and 32 minutes to get just food for me, totally unacceptable. The restaurant blamed GrubHub because they were \"TOO busy to take more orders\" - well buddy - then bring MORE staff in on Valentine's Day and PLAN AHEAD!  The drivers every time they brought something WRONG to the house told us that another driver was right behind them and would be at the house in 10 minutes - outright LIES - BE HONEST!!   Has anyone ever eaten Chicken Marsala without it being served on Angel Hair Pasta or some type of pasta.  I order it all the time and did last week and thought they forgot it; but again last night same thing - so I had to cook up my own noodles.  I have NEVER eaten Marsala with 1/3 chicken and 2/3 spinach in broth  - that to me is SOUP!  STEER CLEAR!!!  He offered drinks and desserts the 3rd time I called to find out where our food was and then sent over ONE PIECE OF BEAT UP CARROT CAKE at the 2.5 hour mark - gee thanks - there are 2 of us and have had to wait SO long - that is all you can comp us to make up for all the mistakes - get real!  I'll eat Saltine Crackers for dinner before I ever order from them again - so if you ever want to try - call and place your order at 2 pm for a 6 pm dinner  ridiculous and to boot, they charge you for DELIVERY!"}
{"text":"I got the flyer pushed threw my front door. I tryed twice to order both times I was put on hold right way not even a nice greating. I waited for almost two minutes. I felt this was a long wait on hold. If placing  an order is this hard. It must be really hard to deliver."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but quality and service has gone out the window. the last time we ordered 3 of the 4 items we ordered was burned. when we called to let them know they offered a $10 credit we said no that we wanted to speak to the manager they said he wasn't in and he would call us the next day and never did. In fact we call a couple other times and manager still was not in"}
{"text":"I ordered a basic large pepperoni pizza from them a while ago and mozzarella sticks and it took them over 2 hours to make them! I've heard from other people to expect a long wait but over 2 hours, wow?! They ended up bringing us our pizza in 1 hour and forgot the sticks. Over an 1 hour later they gave us our sticks and a free slice of cake which was horrible and soggy! The pizza wasn't THAT great and it was cold. The mozz sticks were burnt, hard as a rock, and cold - not worth 30$!! I could have bought dominos and had entire meal for that amount and have them show up in 30 mins.!   I don't know if they only have one oven or were extremely busy but both times we got 1 hour and longer waits that we thought the first time was an innocent mistake. O-well just be aware of the wait and the food being cold and sometimes burnt."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner from Grand Italia at 7:00 pm using Grub Hub. Estimated delivery was 7:55-8:05. At 8:35 I called Grub Hub customer service; they said they would check on it and text back. Received text 10 minutes later that the \"restaurant has not started making the order yet, but would start it now,  though it would be another hour and ten minutes,\" and that Grand Italia wound refund us $8.09 (and Grub Hub was giving us $25 in free food too).   The fact they had our order for an hour and 45 minutes and didn't even prepare it is OUTRAGEOUS. Then, the audacity to offer to only discount 8 lousy dollars when it's their fault (not GrubHub's) the meal didn't exist.   The business practices of Grand Italia are ridiculous and  absolutely unbelievable. There is no food tasty enough to compensate for this lack of regard and carelessness by a business."}
{"text":"Ordered breadsticks, mozzarella sticks and  fetachini Alfredo pasta, the pasta had no flavor but the breadsticks and mozzarella sticks where amazing."}
{"text":"pizza is pretty descent. I was about to 're-order something I got before - the same exact thing and yet they're charging me $20 more..(yes, $20.00 more) they said their price are higher now...hmmm, I checked their price on the menu, asked the lady for price of their \"anytime special\" and the ones on the website ....still, its exactly the same one I have in my hand....they keep records of your order history at least they could've honored the price they've given me previously. Right?..  Yet, I  still placed my order one last time  but feeling sad because of this incident.... Plus, There's so much pizza choices around our place anyway.   Message to the Buss. owner/manager, try to keep your customers....    (You just lost me, what about my in laws, my cousins, my aunt's and my best friends....who all lives 4 mile radius from your business?) Just a thought.   Tip: be prepared to add $1.00 for credit card processing fee charge, $2.50 for delivery charge,  sales /food tax and ur tip for the delivery guy.  Lastly, $1.00 misc. Charge for switching a tomato topping to spinach.  Just order a pick up special if u want to save some money."}

{"text":"New place, found their ad on my front door, thought I'd try it. Kind of a hole in the wall strip mall store. Because of the size i think it is more geared toward take out or delivery  They have a fairly complete menu. Can't rate the Italian food, as I was in a wing mood.  They have 12 lunch specials, everything from wings to eggplant parmigiana spaghetti at $6.95 - $7.95.  The portions were generous, had 12 large wings, fries, carrot and celery sticks and a drink for $6.95.  Ordered them medium, because sometimes hot wings, are too hot for me, The medium had no flavor and they were swimming in oil, the ranch dressing was good, you can also opt for bleu cheese.  I was underwhelmed with the wings, but I will give the italian a try and report back.  As I said, they're new hopefully they will work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! This place literally to the minute took 3 hours to deliver a burnt pizza. I am so pissed and to make it worse everyone who ate some of the pizza is complaining of stomach pains. I will never return."}
{"text":"I ordered the 20 piece chicken fingers and fries meal through GrubHub. They delivered my food hot and fresh within an hour. I gave them a 4 out of 5 because the delivery was fast and friendly, the food was hot and fresh, and the food tasted pretty good, but they should have added a little seasoning to the chicken and fries. Also, the fries were a little too soft, as I like them crispy."}
{"text":"This review is just for the dumb girl answering the phone. We had no chance to actually try the food. When first calling we were placed on hold... and hold... and hold... finally she answered.  My wife had to give her phone number not once , not twice but three times. Then the fun of trying to give our address .... which took my wife spelling the 4 letter name of our address 5 times... then trying to spell their name of our cross streets..  nope done. Wife told the idiot never mind and she got all excited saying OK GREAT THANK YOU ! And slammed the phone down.  Great people working here.. not. And now seeing all their bad reviews im glad we didn't get them order through."}
{"text":"This place used to be considered one of my go to places for ordering pizza. But for whatever reason the quality of their food has gone down significantly and their customer service has followed. Recently I called to place an order and the girl who answered the phone was \"can you hold?\" And that was it ...click! She hung up the phone!! Well they just lost a customer for good!"}
{"text":"Delivery: Pizza tasted very delicious but I felt the breadsticks were lacking a lot of ingredients and taste. The salad was the perfect size and the free soda with the meal was amazing."}
{"text":"Got a flyer, so decided to give it a shot.   I ordered at lunch time, and they delivered fairly quickly  The salad was really nice, but the Ranch Dressing tasted like straight up mayo - very bland, no flavor. I ordered Chicken Parm, which came with ziti pasta. The portions were huge, but the sauce was lackluster. As the previous poster said, the garlic bread was a hot dog bun soaked in oil/butter."}
{"text":"Juat placed an order for delivery. I opted for the #16 lunch special with the 14\" Pizza, Garlic Balls, 12pc Chicken Wings & a free 2L Soda. When the girl answerd the phone right away she sounded very monotone. Not at all helpful either, she asked how I wanted the wings w/o giving me the options they had (plain, medium, hot, bbq, lemon pepper, etc.) I don't know their options this was my first time calling. Also, when she confirmed my order at the end she did give me a total however, she did not give me an ETA. Once/If my order arrives I'll update my review. Until then, I'll keep my fingers crossed."}
{"text":"\"Not impressed. Boring pizza, almost no sauce and had no seasoning. But generous portion for a small order.\""}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.  I went here with my daughter to eat lunch. They didnt offer any luch specials. The lunch specials ended at 3pm and we were there at 2pm. Then we tried to use there Yelp discount coupon and the lady was rude stating its there address but not there coupon. She said she was calling yelp to fix the issue. We asked her if she was going to honor the voupon and she said no again. I guess now I know why there was nobody in there restaurant.  Maybe the blonde lady working there should take the blue streak out of her hair and become more professional.  She was rude and deserved to be smacked. The owner should shut his doors and hire people with common courtesy.  I will eat Little Caesars before this can get my money"}
{"text":"I wish there was a -10 star for this place. I had called to place an order and Jessyca picked up the phone very rudely!! Seriously if u can't or don't want to take orders don't hang up the phone on customers!!!! So I called back and ask for a supervisor and to my surprise he wasn't there, the owner? Oh he never comes in she said!!! So the bit.... Is all by her self answering the phone like it is her house!!!!!! Please DO NOT hire white trash people that don't know how to be polite to your customers if u still have any. Just as I posted this review the \"owner\" called me, to see if he could help me order, not to see why I was upset. I tried to explain to him what had happen and he kept insisting that she wasn't rude by hanging up the phone or asking rude questions! Seriously??!!!? And of course he hang up too, very professional people!"}
{"text":"Normally we order the chef salad and it's always a safe bet when you're short on time and no can agree on what to eat.   Today the salad was just as good as expected. What made me finally write this review was the pizza we ordered.   We called in a supreme pizza and when it arrived we were not happy with what we received. The pizza itself was soaking in grease and the cheese and toppings just slid off at the smallest touch. I've included a picture and hopefully you see what I mean.  They sell wings too but they're normally not something I'd recommend. Save your money and buy a large 5lb bag of Tyson buffalo wings. They're cheaper and even tastier.   Doubt I'll order again."}
{"text":"Have gotten food from here before. I remember their Philly cheesesteak being pretty good. I was laid up with a gout flare up, and was home with the kids. Needed to get some dinner. My wife had the credit card, and was at work all night, so she texted me the numbers so I could order, like we've done many times before. I called to see if they delivered to me. They did, so I placed my order. They told me there was a charge for delivery. No prob. Most places do charge for that. They told me it would be $1.00 to use a credit card. That's a little odd, but again, no prob. I was told my order was almost $40, and usual delivery time. Then they said I needed the card, and ID for the driver. I said I don't have the card, my wife has it. I was told the card needs to be present. There is no reason for that. I asked can't they just run the card. I was told the card had already been run, but they need to send the $ back to the bank. So the card already went through with no problem, but they still won't deliver the food. My wife called them, and even offered to fax a copy of the card and her ID, and they still wouldn't do it. She asked to talk to a manager, and surprise, surprise, there was no manager there. After reading some other reviews, that seems to be an ongoing trend. Lies. The owner may not always be there, but I'm sure that they wouldn't let that place run without someone in charge. Are you telling me that the inmates run the asylum? Doubt it. It's just probably a gutless person who doesn't know how to handle irritated people. So now I have no dinner, and $40 short on the credit card. Was told it will be reimbursed. I wonder how long that will take. If it awaits a manager's approval, I guess I will never get it. Do yourself a favor. Do not even bother with this place. I don't understand how this place is still in business after reading the other reviews. I should have read them first, then maybe I wouldn't be out $40 and have three hungry kids. Guess I have to hobble downstairs, and try to stand on a bad leg to make the kids dinner. With a good leg it wouldn't be a problem, that's why I tried to order dinner instead."}
{"text":"This place used to have good pizza, such a shame.  Nothing worse than soggy, greasy, limp pizza crust.  3 strikes, your out."}
{"text":"On this trip to Vegas, we had a couple of lazy evenings.  Didn't want to really go out and weren't up to cooking so we finally decided to try one of the 1000 delivery menus we always find on our doorstep.  The first night we ordered bruschetta and chicken tortellini Alfredo.  Both were very tasty although I would have preferred the tortellini to be cooked a little longer and more sauce.  The second night we ordered a supreme pizza, half of it with pineapple (hubby's preference).  The pizza crust was NY style and really good.  Would definitely order this again.  We only got through half the pizza, their large was more than we expected.  Both times we were given delivery times of 45 minutes and they came WAY before that time.  Delivery guy was friendly on both occasions.  Only complaint we asked for Parmesan cheese and LOT'S of red pepper flake packages, they gave us one of each.. LOLOL  Hubby wasn't too happy about that one."}
{"text":"I would have given them 0 stars if it were possible. I ordered 2 sandwiches and kids chicken fingers, I was quoted a 45 min delivery time which would have been ok since I ordered it early in the evening. After 45 min I called and they said it was on the way, after an hour I called back and the girl on the phone said \" It should be right there.\" After 1 hour and 20 Min I called again to cancel my order, no apology what so ever. It was the first and the LAST time I will order anything from this disgrace of a business."}
{"text":"I ordered their \"pick-up speical\" large 1- topping pizza for $6.99 and got pepperoni on it. It was decent for the price. Not to greasy and a lot of cheese."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE delivery driver. It's rather unfortunate too. The pizza was pretty good. I ordered a small with pepperoni and sausage and another Ranch Chicken and added bacon. In addition I got an order of mozzarella sticks and a couple sides of ranch dressing. In my opinion the price was a bit steep. But I was informed that the ranch was made daily, so I assumed that everything was fresh. I was told 45min to an hour for delivery. That's about average for my part of town. And hour and a half later I called back to inquire where my food was. The person who answered said any minute. Which turned out to be scary accurate, a few seconds after hanging up, there was a knock on my door. Unfortunately, the delivery driver showed without an entire pizza. Needless to say that this is unacceptable. I called the place back and told them the situation. They told me that they would remake the missing pizza and send it quickly. I reluctantly signed the receipt for my entire order (definitely no tip) and accepted my one pizza, cheese sticks and dressing. My room temperature pizza and Cheese sticks. Gotta say, not spectacular. But then again cold pizza is never anything special. So about another hour and 15 minutes later, the same delivery driver finally gets back. But with BOTH pizzas, so I scored a free pie. Not bad. But this guy hands me my food rather rudely, says here and runs off. In my opinion he's a complete idiot and should be fired immediately. The only reasons I MAY consider this place again is because the ranch dressing was very good. And when I finally got hot pizzas (nearly three hours after my original call)  it was pretty good. Definitely better than any chain place. Also the order taker sounded like he took genuine concern with my discontent. He offered me free dessert and to remake the missing pizza. So I felt that he cared. But the drivers piss poor attitude, lack of apologies and slow delivery time severely effected my experience."}
{"text":"For the price foods good...they deliver practically anywhere. They make the biggest pizza ever"}
{"text":"After looking through many Delivery menus, we had finally settled on this location (a block away from our Apartments). We called, placed our order with little to no issue. However, upon waiting for the order to be delivered, the driver called with concerns over the address. After clarifying the best we could (The driver has a very strong accent), we waited for our food, instructing him to call us if there were any other issues. After 15-20 minutes had passed (Mind you, the restaurant is within a few minutes of our apartment) we called the store itself. We asked if the driver had actually left, they told us they had. We expressed to them we were not going to pay for cold or soggy food (our order was Chicken fingers in sauce and Fries). We then went through an off and on phone conversation as they put us on hold to contact their driver, where they informed us he couldn't find the place, then he had been there and knocked with no answer (we had been listening intently for the door), he was at the gate to the complex, and eventually while on the phone conversation (the woman on the phone had polite and apologetic for the incident) he knocked on the door finally. By now it had been so long, we had informed the person on the phone we had no intention of paying for and/or accepting the food. They did offer us 20% off (or 3$) for the inconvenience. Once we opened the door, the Driver yelled at us, literally raising his hands (while still holding the food) in an aggressive manner, asking us why we didn't answer the door 15 minutes before hand when he says he had knocked. After a few moments of him harassing us, we closed the door. Finished our conversation with the representative from the store (who again apologized for the incident, and the drivers behavior). And have now requested for the manager to contact us in hopes of preventing situations like this in the future."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  The flyer left at my apartment was great.  BUT  the pizza was lukewarm.  And there was no egg in a my spinach salad.  It clearly says egg on the flyer.  And Italian restaurant should have mushrooms and egg in the spinach salad.  Won't order again."}
{"text":"Totally awful! I ordered at 10:15 pm, online and it took so long I called at 11:05 and learned that they were closed.... I recieved my order at 11: 12 pm. I ordered chicken fingers w/fries and an order of cheese fries with bacon....Everything was cold and soggy.. like it was sitting in someone's car all day (not on a hot day). I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was good but took 90 mins to get to me. Priced ok but needs to be alittle quicker on the delivery"}
{"text":"We were a little hesitant after reading the past reviews but went ahead and ordered delivery. Food was fast, hot, & excellent.  Portions were large & order was accurate.  We will order from them again in the future."}
{"text":"For the most part, I've had a good experience overall. We've been going here since they opened- so far, so good. It's a pretty good pizza for 7.95! I haven't had much else, although the wings were alright the time or two that I had them. I stick to the aforementioned one topping pick up special. They're also pretty good about complimentary paper plates, which come in handy on pizza night. Having a decent pizza at that price, I don't expect too much else so I'm happy with that."}
{"text":"4 stars for the pizza 1 star for delivery time. 45min-1hr delivery window  Waited almost 2hrs for my pizza lol  Pizza is great just go pick it up yourself"}
{"text":"it's a different kind of pizza place. we dinned in and had to watch India tv in Spanish.  The special we ordered came in to -go boxes.salad was ok.Blue cheese dressing was good .The garlic balls had no garlic on them.plenty of butter though .Pizza crust is more like bread,toppings were ok.Not a place I will go back to though"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Italian food, I made it my goal to find a place with good food that was just a call away. Then one day their menu was in the cracks of my front door, and it was like my prayers had been answered. A family member and I ordered together and we both loved it. The delivery people are always so nice and the food comes at a reasonable time."}
{"text":"Pizza sucked.  I asked for extra cheese, pepporoni and sausage. I didnt get the extra cheese. The pizza tasted bad"}
