{"text":"If this is a seafood restaurant .. Where's the live crab or fish? Maybe the gold fishes in the aquarium are the 'seafood' :)"}
{"text":"This place was introduced by my co-workers, i have never physically been here but i have tried the chili chicken and it is very delicious. The chicken is made hot and fresh and the little hot pepper that comes with it is my favourite too! Will definitely be trying more items here!"}
{"text":"Was introduced to this mom and pop restaurant by my friends and never really knew what Hakka food was until I came here! Is a smaller place but prices are reasonable and food is delicious!  Must try the Manchurian chicken/chili chicken if you like spicy, I like it a lot more than sweet and sour pork!  Other items that are great are the stuffed tofu and shrimp balls.  I come here twice a month now to get my Hakka food craving settled down."}
{"text":"Found it on yelp, read the reviews.  It lived up to the reviews. Happy with everything. Only thing was hot and sour soup was way hot. I will ask them to tone it down next time."}
{"text":"I've know this place for at least 13 years and it has always been top of my list for Hakka Chinese food (or Indian-style Chinese food). This family run restaurant at the South-East corner of Middlefield Rd and McNicoll Ave has recently expanded and renovated, yet the food is still very affordable and servings are generous and the place is very clean. Everything is made to order so you can request your preferred level of spiciness. The owner and her family take extra care to see that everyone is receiving the best service and food. Order Chicken Pakoras as starters. Unlike the food at some of the other Hakka Chinese restaurants in the vicinity, the food here is not oily or loaded with MSG... that's why I am still alive and loving it."}
{"text":"I've been here many times with my family.  Food here is great! It has always been.  But the service has somewhat deteroriated lately. Last time I went there to pick up I had to almost wait for more than an hour, and few people who sat down decided to get-up and leave after wating so long.   But overall the food is great!"}
{"text":"Favourite hakka place, can not go wrong with the Chili Chicken, Chili Paneer, Fried Rice and Manchurian Noodles! Takeout is always on time :)"}
{"text":"This place is in a old plaza and when you walk into the interior - it as rundown as well. Don't get me wrong they keep the place clean. However - there has been no attempts at renovation and I tell you why? The food  This is the epitome of authentic hakka- this place and china cottage and eddie's wok and roll are my top 3 hakka food joints in the city. The masala fried rice is one of the best things i have ever had. The shrimp is also good."}
{"text":"I've never written a review on yelp so this is my first but i couldn't help but leave my first on here.  BEST CHINESE/HAKKA FOOD I'VE EVER TASTED!  Me and my husband's family's go to spot whenever we feel like chinese/hakka. Our usual order: Hakka chow mein Half crispy chicken Spicy deep fried calamari Masala chicken (pretty spicy) Yang chow fried rice Baby bok choy in garlic Crispy shrimp balls Chicken pakora"}
{"text":"I've lived in Scarborough almost my whole life, and I never would have found this place if it wasn't recommended by a friend.  We got the fish maw soup, shrimp pakora, hung mei mein, chili chicken (less spice), chili crispy beef, manchurian fried rice, and beef and broccoli. My favorite was the shrimp pakora by far. It was perfectly fried and very tasty, definitely a must have. All of the other food ranged from decent to good. I was very happy that they would accommodate spice levels as we had a person who did not like spicy food.  The dining area is quite small and could definitely use some additional lighting. However, the staff was very friendly and gave me a homecooked vibe to the meal.  This place is definitely worth a try if you are in to hakka style food."}
{"text":"I was in search for something new to try and found this high-rated restaurant from Yelp.  The photos that some reviewers posted of the royal pepper fish and legendary shrimp balls looked absolutely mouth watering delicious.  While I was in the area I called and placed those two items for take out.  It was 5:30 PM on a Monday and there was nobody in the restaurant upon my arrival to pick up my order.  It wasn't ready and on top of calling ahead to place the order I still had to wait 18 minutes for my two items to be ready, not acceptable in my opinion for a restaurant that had no customers.  Shrimp balls - they used square bread crumbs to coat the shrimp balls which gave the illusion the shrimp balls were big in size but the shrimp filling inside was rather small.  I would give the taste a 3 star rating but it was one of those foods that tasted good only if you have one and food court quality, definitely not restaurant.  Royal pepper fish - this was poorly cooked.  The deep fried battered fish tasted stale, old and the batter was so tough and chewy.  I suspect it was leftover days old and they refried it.  I will not be revisiting this restaurant again it's not worth it at all.  The food taste and quality is comparable to Manchu Wok."}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood and stumbled upon this restaurant as we were driving by. It was almost 4pm on a Saturday and we hadn't had lunch. Thought of going for a quick meal.  Some tables still occupied, but we were seated right away.   Ordered a Vegetarian Manchurian and a Vegetarian Fried Rice.  The server asked us if we needed the gravy from Manchurian separate. Which we were surprised that an option was available eating in the restaurant. We didn't take it though.   The food took a bit longer for some reason to come to the table.   The Manchurian were bigger veggie balls than we were used too. The gravy was good, however the balls had a flavour that didn't go well. Some spice used in the ball was not normal, perhaps a Chinese 5 spice blend or Indian Garam Masala. Regardless the taste didn't go well with the gravy. The rice was OK as well. What we didn't like was the mushrooms were canned (why?). So many fresh and reasonably priced available.   The other downer was there is a 10% service charge imposed! For the three of us. When asked they mentioned it was policy. No signs on menu or on the door or inside that I could see. Well if they sneak this , as a matter of my policy I left them no extra tips. I normally leave 15% or so in most cases where the service is normal. But to sneak this in.   They also lost a star in the rating because of this."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I grew up in India and LOVE Indo-Chinese food and I can vouch for this place. Their chilli fish is wonderful and the prices are very reasonable given the size of the portions."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with quality cooking & ingredients used in their dishes.  Take out &  dining room menu was geared for North American Chinese tastes.  Adequate free parking. Dining room atmosphere met basic needs but quality of food more than made up for this."}
{"text":"There are so many Hakka restaurants yet this is my go-to absolute favorite Hakka restaurant. A hidden gem that is easily missed on the corner of middlefield and mcnicoll.  Place is small and rarely ever full but the staff is courteous and boss lady is always so sweet. She goes around from table to table asking how the food was and knows the regulars by their names.   Let's get to the food. There is not a single dish that I've tried that has disappointed. The prices are relatively cheap for the portion and the ingredients! Each dish averages out to roughly $10-12. I recently went with a party of 3, ordered 4 dishes and a soup, total was $50 (including cash discount and tax).   Must haves: Fried stuffed tofu in black bean sauce (traditional Hakka food) - there's also a steamed version but c'mon, who doesn't love fried food??  Chilli chicken - perfect flavor every time. You can also let them know if you want it less or more spicy   Shrimp/fish Pakora - Fried to perfection with the real deal , topped with some raw onions and a lime.   Garlic shrimp - more fried goodness with loads of garlic, onions and chilli peppers. Shrimps are larger than average too.  Hakka sweet noodles - these noodles are cooked with a sweet sauce which makes the noodles dark brown but taste super good. Another traditional Hakka dish. It is a bit more oily than any other noodles but that's due to the sweet sauce, if there isn't enough oil then the noodles still stick to the wok.   Sliced beef with preserved vegetables - beef is not over cooked and with copious amount of gravy. Flavor is natural and authentic - not msg loaded.   Green beans - a simple dish yet addictive! Deep fried green beans cooked with onions, black beans and chilli oil. A bit on the oily side but flavor is on point!   The rice and noodle options are all pretty decent for the ones I've tried. Portions are huge for price is always reasonable.  Overall their dishes are either fried, saucy or spicy. If you're not a fan of those then this might not be the place for you. White rice is usually served with the food.   A bonus is there's an additional 10% cash discount   Parking isn't a lot but you will rarely find it full. From the outside it doesn't look very appealing, even the inside is very simple. But hey, never judge a book by its cover! I've brought tons of friends there and they all would love to go back!"}
{"text":"This was my first Hakka restaurant to try. I had the Manchurian Beef which had good flavor but boy was it hot!   The second time I went with my hubby and we had the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce (it had soy sauce and black beans), Beef Brisket with Ginger and Onions, Yang Chow Fried Rice with Chicken and Shrimp and an Iced Milk Tea. The food was fast food quality, a little greasy but tasty. The tea was super sweet.   Restaurant was clean with comfy booths. Service depends on the type of waiter/tress you get - either friendly and helpful or cold and speedy.   Would return if I was in the area and in the mood for Chinese/Hakka fast food."}
{"text":"After going to a handful of Hakka restaurants you tend to know what to expect or to at least have some level  of expectation. Coming to Royal there were a few things that were off. Venue wise, parking can be a nuisance especially during dinner hours. Inside, the ambiance is very dark and dim. Service was extremely slow and it took forever to get drinks. The layout of the restaurant isn't the best as we were seated in the corner with a big table and a huge pillar blocking our view of the counter away from the visibility of the staff. Overall experience was a 2/5. Here is the breakdown of the food: **Chili chicken 3/5, was tasty but portions were too little. Not overly spicy. **Ginger beef 3/5 too much onions hardly any beef which was unfortunate.  **Pakora 2/5 way too spicy!! though we asked for mild. And to my surprise came after some of our main entrees. Usually this dish is served as an appetizer **Chicken Hakka chow mein 2/5 bland, could have added more flavoring to this promising dish. **Sweet hakka chow mein 4/5 probably the savior of it all, great blend of flavors and had the right touch of sweetness in this off the menu traditional dish."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I were talking food one day (as we do most days) and I was saying that I was in the mood for some good Hakka food. I was given the name of this restaurant.   To me, it was a diamond in the rough. The decor was bright and up to date and super clean! It looked like they just opened for business. The bathrooms were also very clean. Wait staff was very pleasant and helpful, unfortunately they would either all be on the floor at once or all disappear into the back, which is why I took a star away.    What was nom nomed - tandoori chicken, Spicy beef,  Manchurian chow mein. (bill was approx. $30 all in)   This was no ordinary Tandoori Chicken, it was awesome Tandoori Chicken!!! fresh chilies added to the general warmth of the wonderfully spiced dish. Sorry can't say any more than that as I am not 100% familiar with the authentic way of cooking tandoori so I couldn't tell you how its different just that it was amazing!  The spicy beef had a great balance between great flavour and interesting texture. So it was thinly sliced lean beef (I want to say sliced flank steak but not 100% sure) coated in corn starch (as most crispy Asian dishes are) and fried. The beef was seasoned with garlic, onion, ginger, fresh chilies and some other spices to round it all out.   The chow mein was nothing to write home about, it was just chow mein. Chow mein noodles with onions, broccoli, bean sprouts, and you guessed it fresh chilies!!! It's not that it wasn't good, it just wasn't anything special. Next time I would personally just opt for steamed rice.  Would definitely  go back when I'm in Markham, great price point, good food and friendly staff... can't really ask for more.   NOTE: I am a fan of spicy foods, and I can take quite a bit of heat. All three of these dishes were spicy and it was the building type of heat so if you are not a fan or suffer from heartburn or indigestion frequently I would recommend taking something to settle your stomach first, prior to tucking into some of the great food at Royal Chinese Seafood Restaurant."}
{"text":"A (discerning) friend recommended this relaxed, family-run Hakka place. Favourable Toronto press has been lavished upon it since the owners ran a downtown spot years ago - then migrated to Scarborough. (Though a small restaurant, it happened to be the meet-up location for Hakka-food-lovers joining forces to launch a cookbook.)   Food! I ordered one of the Chef's Specials - spicy garlic prawns. Delicious! They were perfectly cooked - just the right texture, and so flavourful. I definitely needed a thick mango lassi to cool my tongue. :) Generous chilli peppers, onion, and spices. Yummy! It came with a large bowl of steamed rice and Chinese tea.   Next, I tried the Hakka specialty wonton lo mein. (I can't resist a great lo mein.) I wasn't a fan. It tasted like packaged ramen, with an overload of black pepper to compensate. (The wonton itself was good, though.) This dish is a filler, and probably something kids will like.   I'll return to try other dishes - chicken manchurian, fish, meats - and other Hakka specialties. Overrall, I enjoyed my visit and would recommend!  Update: On a second and third visit, we ordered Crispy Shrimp Balls, Royal Pepper Fish, Chili Chicken, Tandoori Chicken Masala (crying-tears-of-pleasurable-pain-hot), and chicken fried rice. Huge, family-style portions, tasty, excellent home-cooked quality!"}
{"text":"There are many Hakka Chinese restaurants in the east end of the GTA but this one stands out because of the food they produce. Their menu is not as extensive as some of the nearby competitors but whatever they do, they do it very well.  The food is always full of flavour. Their deep fried stuffed tofu is the best in the city! The stuffed bitter melon (foo gah) is another traditional Hakka dish. They do everything well. Try the chili chicken, Manchurian chicken, chicken in hot pot, Hakka chow mein... I could list everything on the menu. Don't miss their spicy ginger beef either!"}
{"text":"Hakka you will die for over and over again!!! I've been coming here for years with my family, and I have to say this restaurant gets better every time. The Indian mutton curry guarantees a bowl-licking it's so good, the chilli chicken has the perfect combination of flavour and spice, and the Hakka stuffed tofu will melt in your mouth. Those are some of my faves, the menu is extensive and every dish I've tried has been delicious. The price is extremely reasonable. Modest décor and slow service at times but the food will make up for any shortcomings. It's quite crowded now-a-days, so call ahead!"}
{"text":"I have been going to \"Royal Chinese Seafood Restaurant\" since 2012. The food is DELICIOUS, the price is right and the staff is very friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"4.5  It's been a while my last review.  What better way to kick back into things than with a review of a Hakka restaurant.  Pros: Very well priced dishes Food is well done Preferred by the locals  Cons: Restaurant is on the smaller side  I came here based on Yelp reviews looking for a new Hakka place to try.  You know I love my Hakka.  As soon as I walk in I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. This place is a definite favourite of the local Indian and Chinese population.  It's the same with Frederick's, which is still my all time fav.  That's really the telling sign that you're a good Hakka place.  We came in early so we were seated promptly.  By the time it was 630pm the place was packed.  Being a local favourtie, you get entire families coming in to eat together here.  Sometimes that families are 10+ ppl huge.  Seating becomes a problem then because the place is rather small.  I find a lot of their clients just order take out as well.   So of course we order our staples, the chili chicken and kan shue green beans.  These are the two dishes I believe a Hakka restaurant absolutely needs to do well. This place does not disappoint at all.  I still feel Frederick's is better but this place does a good rendition of it as well.  The portion size is OK too but I felt there was a lot of onion used as filler.  No matter, still a very good meal.  Prices here are also very good.  We ordered 3 dishes total.  Each dish comes with a bowl of rice for free as well.  All together it was less than $30 after taxes.  Gotta love that!!  All in all, Royal Chinese Seafood is another very good Hakka restaurant.  Just be prepared to com a little earlier before the larger familes pile on in!"}
{"text":"Newly opened restaurant in Markham-one of many Indo-Chinese restaurant. Dishes were not only very crunchy but saucy too. However, the sauces were of the colourful variant; Red and radioactive yellow goo for some options. The food was very palatable and fresh. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great food.  We were told about this place by a friend. It turns out they were bang on with their review of this restaurant.  The food was fresh, good size portions, great service and clean.  The food was prepared with just the right mix of spices.  First time here and it won't be the last.  Strongly recommend this restaurant.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good Hakka food. Prices are decent and flavour is good. Can't say amazing, but portion is great.   I ordered the crispy spicy shrimp and the black pepper fish with seafood fried rice. If you're not a fan of spice don't get it spicy!! But because I like spice, it was pretty good! Portion size could feed 2 people for the food I ate. The rice was kind of greasy, but the fish and shrimp were great!   I would come back to try other dishes if I was ever feeling Hakka in the area.   (Sorry no pics because I was too hungry)   But if you would like Hakka and you're in this area, check this place out! :)"}
