{"text":"This is a fantastic place and I absolutely love the food. My clients, my family and friends they all love it.
The owners and staff are very friendly and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Taste wise okay. 
But too much oil in everything we ordered. 

Had a Yelp deal $10 for $20."}
{"text":"Was very surprised to find such good food in such a hole in the wall location, and even more by the fact that this place was so empty! We were the only people here on a Tuesday evening, but tempted to try this place out after seeing some other Yelp reviews. Very tasty food! Definitely recommend the spring rolls and the Chili chicken, which had just the right amount of spice. Will be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"The food is really yummy here. Love the indo- Chinese food. The service is really good too- they are very friendly. :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place, after finding quite a few recommendations from my friends., as mentioned by others, this is a nice place to get good inexpensive indo chinese food., which is as good as other indo chinese restaurants like inchins bamboo garden. 

Really liked their Tempura Chicken, pan fried noodles (hakka noodels)., and we all loved it. This is definitely the place to going forward :)"}
{"text":"We just walked (wok'ed) to this new restaurant to give it a try. I was unsure of what Indo Chinese food would be like, but they explained very well the mix of spices they use.  The owner was very kind and helped us pick out dishes, which were very tasty. We had spicy chicken and lamb in cayenne sauce, as well as soup. We look forward next time to try more of the vegetable stirfry dishes. The whole staff was very nice and there was a lot of diversity among the customers which makes you feel like it's good authentic food."}
{"text":"Amazing indo Chinese food in Arizona! Great customer service,"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Indo-Chinese restaurant in town. The food was excellent and a big shout to the dessert."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance. One of the best Chinese food. Cayenne pepper fried rice was terrific"}
{"text":"Amazing food, perfect to my taste, we had Cyanne pepper fried rice, Manchurian and paneer in cyanne pepper sauce, corn pepper salt appetizer, liked all of these had perfect taste. The only drawback is the food is slightly greasy, which usually is the case with indo chinese food, I would have liked it less greasy. They adjust the food to your taste well.  4 stars for food and cleanliness 1 star less for greasyness in food."}
{"text":"1st visit and found through Yelp. If you are anywhere near this place it would be a mistake not to give this place a try. 

The food is unique and the service is both efficient and informative . 

My girlfriend really enjoined the ambience along with the gentle music playing in the background to add to the mood.

So many menu options for vegetarian dishes as well as meat, fish and chicken.

We requested that our dishes did not contain msg and, this was not even a challenge for the cooks. 

Also, Yelp offers a Groupon type deal on their yelp profile, spend $10 and get $20 worth of food. 

Bravo to this place....we will be back for something new next time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Don't screw up the coupon on Yelp and order delivery because you won't have it honored. We got some beef with veggies, stir fried veggies and a shrimp appetizer. The food was good HOWEVER the portions were super teeennnyyyy tiny. I'm not a bulk eater but I was glad my oldest son wasn't feeling well because we wouldn't not have had enough to go around. I've been with my fella for seven years and it was the first time ever that I complained about portion size. It was also ridiculously expensive. Over $40 for two entrees and an appetizer. What?!?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Someone recommended this place and I was amazed. If you like Chinese with an Indian twist make sure to visit. The service is amazing and the recommendations by the staff are great too. The only downfall was the items were not described in the menu but we were told that they are updating their menu, so looking forward to that for the next visit."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Gracious staff and very helpful!! I got the Manchuria entree with cauliflower and mushrooms and my mom got the oriental noodles. It was unexpected and very good!"}
{"text":"Best indian wok food. Loved their appetizers. Must visit if you are in the chandler/tempe area."}
{"text":"The Korean noodles are AMAZING! My son loved the chicken fried rice and the chicken chow mein was great as well. Definitely would recommend to anyone who loves Asia-Indian fusion!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service... very very expensive food... the owner looks likes wants to only earn more & more money... beware..."}
{"text":"Worst chicken chow mein I've ever had. And to top it off they sent the wrong drinks. Will not return"}
{"text":"Really yummy food. Every item we ordered was super yum. We've been here twice and both times it was good. Will definitely go back to this place. Even the service was good"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Simply the best 

Two Thumps up. 

Being going to this restaurant ever since they have open the door and never been disappointed with food nor service."}
{"text":"Excellent service and wonderful food. Because I only eat halal food this was great to have variety with Indian style Chinese food. I had the tempered lamb hot and sour soup and Korean glass noodles. Food was spicy, succulent and tasty."}
{"text":"Wok is one of the very few restaurants in this area that serves Indo-Chinese food. The taste is excellent. I've been here only once so far, I'm not used to writing restaurant reviews at all, but this food and the friendliness at the restaurant is what prompted me to do so.

The best items here IMHO:
1. Chilli Beef
2. Wok Fried Cottage Cheese
3. Cayene Pepper Fried Rice.
4. Ice Cream and Caramalized Fried Noodles"}
{"text":"Great food! 
Hot n Spicey fish was really good
We ordered two paneer dishes, not too spicey, it was perfect 
Great service 
Would highly recommend it to anyone! 

Thank you"}
{"text":"This place has great food and is probably one of the few places in the valley that provides Indo-chinese food! Quick service , clean and at a great location !! Highly recommend this joint to all!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I had been there twice then I took my husband there we are so happy to have a place like this with really yummy food.
The 4 plates are not a big deal at the table if it's only 2 people. If you worry about stupid stuff like that then you should always stay at home and eat.
The prices are compatible to the large size of food that you eat. It's really fresh vegetables and noodles.
I hope people will give this Restaurant a chance it 's so good."}
{"text":"Good food. My new destination for indo chinese cuisine. Their WIC tossed chicken is really good."}
{"text":"All food was really delicious. Especially the scheuan soup and veg balls in Manchurian sauce. We had a really nice time. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm really picky when it comes to rice and their fried rice was awesome! My wife and I had fried rice and eggplant and requested they made it spicy. It had the perfect amount of heat."}
{"text":"One of the rare places that offers Indo?-Chinese cuisine. Loved it! I am a Vegetarian and this places are great options."}
{"text":"Was craving for indo Chinese food so we decide to come here..Had the manchow soup, chili chicken and cayenne pepper noodles. The food was delicious! I think the best in Tempe chandler area..highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out this place since it is right around the corner from work. I'm happy to report that it was amazingly authentic food! I recently spent some time in Malaysia and it was on par with the food I had out there. The menu had plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes and the waitress was very attentive. Today I had the Tom Yum soup, chicken spring rolls, and Korean noodles with beef. All were perfectly prepared and very filling. I am definitely looking forward to trying some of the other items on the menu and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"1. Food was delicious
2. We tried Veg ball Manchurian and Triple Szechwan fried rice. It was really yummy
3. Service was also super fast. Staff was very helpful with menu
4. Bought back memories of enjoying indo Chinese food while bunking college classes 
As one of the only place in Chandler for Indo Chinese, I surely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. so clean, the staff is friendly, food came quick and was absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great find. The menu has a great selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes. I personally got the crunchy mushrooms which were unique with it's texture and spices. For dinner their red curry is a favorite. We also got a side of Hawaiian rice, and the basmati rice was sweet and fluffy. Saleem was a great host and made sure our complex orders were correct. 

Definitely come here if you want to try something new."}
{"text":"The place is awesome. The service is friendly. The crispy mushroom manchurian, teppanyaki fried rice, and honey glazed noodle are must eats. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing... the gobi maunchuria and the noodles are amazing... definitely worth trying !!!"}
{"text":"My cousin who has been coming here since this place opened offered to take my husband and I here a few weeks ago.  This restaurant has a pretty good menu. We all ordered noodles of some sort and it all looked amazing. We all enjoyed our dishes as well as our appetizers.  I would definitely visit this restaurant again. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place right down the street from my house even though it is a little hidden. Great Chinese food with a hint of Indian influence. I did the carmelized Mongolian chicken with a side of the hot and sour soup  Both I had now had twice. Only slight complaint was the water tasted odd on a refill, but the matter was resolved quickly. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. My 4 year old nephew said the waiter/host \"is a nice guy!\" Great flavors. Awesome vegan/vegetarian options. Generous portions as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in and were greeted warmly...We asked about the sauces and he described them so well we decided to have each a different one...I had the Caramelized Mongolian with Chicken lunch special...Excellent!  My husband ordered the chicken with the Oriental sauce...Very tasty!  The each come with soup (both egg flower and hot & sour good) and a spring roll and rice...Super nice staff! Very good deal for lunch!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Initially left a 4 star review. Within six hours of eating here I found myself with awful food poisoning. The worst case of food positioning I've ever had. Never again :("}
{"text":"Hai everybody!.
I tell u guys...
The food here reveals the hardwork and the interest these people have on giving us an unique and liking taste.
Fried rice and noodles are awesome."}
{"text":"Super excellent food. Salim extremely helpful guy and food is just awesome recommend everyone who wants to try indo chinese"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times already, but finally ended up getting to this review. This is an OK place for a decent Indo-Chinese food experience. I have tried their noodles, chili chicken and a couple of other dishes as well, and they are all pretty good. However, I cannot say that they have been among the best I have ever had. Their service is prompt, the representatives are helpful in guiding which menu item to choose, the quantity of food is plenty, and the existing yelp offer certainly makes it even more worthy to try out the food. Overall a pretty good experience. :-)"}
{"text":"I personally wasn't a fan, we ordered their Manchurian chicken and sweet and sour chicken. It smelled fantastic but was very lacking in flavor. The dishes were very soupy and bland. The fried rice was not bad until I chomped on a massive piece of eggshell. I think they could be better if they tweaked their recipes. The dishes were in dire need of salt, more garlic wouldn't hurt either"}
{"text":"The food was unique and delicious! If you're looking for a typical American Chinese food place this might not fit your needs, but we found the combinations of Indian, Chinese, and Thai flavors to really work together. The service was very good too."}
{"text":"Best Indo-Chinese restaurant around chandler and east phoenix. This is my second visit love the flavor of tempering spicy fish. Will recommended this to all who like a fusion and trying different to normal."}
{"text":"Literally one of the best fusion places ever! Authentic flavors from different parts of the world & atmosphere makes you feel at home. Food is incredible!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is new but the food taste is really awesome. Main attraction of this restaurant is their open kitchen we can see everything how they are preparing.staff are very polite and also dinning place is neat and clean.we think the food is Chinese type but it's not purely Chinese it's tastes very different and yummy.i love this place I will surely recommend this place..."}
{"text":"If you miss Indo-Chinese!....this will surely satisfy your taste buds...just don't forget to tell them to make it more spicier!"}
{"text":"We came here based on the Yelp ratings.  It also helped that they have a Yelp coupon offer (pay $10 for a $20 certificate).

Upon entering it was interesting that the music sounded Indian, not Chinese or Thai.  The personnel we saw clearly were not Chinese or Thai.  The chef (who came out to greet us) appeared to be Indian.  Not a big deal, but I will have a tie-in momentarily.

We ordered the \"tempering spicy chicken\" appetizer first.  It was different.  Can't say I've ever experienced that flavor before.  It was pretty good, really.  They served it like an entree, but no rice.  I would rate that item at 4 stars.

I ordered the Kung Pao entree and my wife ordered the \"American Chop Suey\" entree (both of which come with rice).  I forgot to specify brown rice, so I got white rice.  White Basmati rice.  Do I detect a theme here?  Indian music, Indian chef, and Basmati rice most commonly used in Indian cuisine.  Very interesting.

The Kung Pao wasn't.  That is, it wasn't Kung Pao chicken.  I've have had a few different versions (including when I was in Taiwan), and they all had an undertone that left no doubt it was a version of Kung Pao.  This dish lacked that entirely.  It was a different flavor I don't recall encountering before.  I can't say it was bad on its own if I was served this without being told what it was. But as I ordered Kung Pao and this wasn't Kung Pao I have to say it was bad Kung Pao.

My wife had a similar comment about her Chop Suey.  It was sort of like sweet and sour without the sour.  I did sample it and my wife was exactly right (aside:  I know that's redundant...wives are always right, so there's no need to say it...it's just understood).  She didn't really like her meal either.

The staff was friendly and helpful.  They explained there is an \"Indian influence\" in their dishes.  Which is fine, except they didn't tell you that on the menu.  \"Kung Pao\" means something specific.  \"Thai Basil\" (also on their menu) means something specific.  If they are going to use those names for the dishes, and not remain true to the basic flavor of those dishes, then they shouldn't be surprised when people say they got a bad \"Thai Basil\" or \"Kung Pao\" or whatever.  They need to change the names of the dishes, or do something so that patrons know they aren't going to be getting anything close to a traditional Chinese dish.

I debated going to three stars.  If those dishes were served to me at a dinner party without anyone identifying them, I would have been OK with them.  And the \"tempering spicy chicken\" was quite tasty.  But if I rate the food for what they claimed the dishes were, then I just cannot give three stars.  Because those dishes weren't really very good interpretations of the dishes that bear those names."}
{"text":"I ordered using Yelp Eat24 and they pretty much had the order done in time. That's where the positive review ends. I was very hopeful that the new place in might become a new go to. That did not happen. I ordered chow mein, some chicken and some beef dishes. There were not too many people in the restaurant when I got there and only one person was taking out food ahead of me. I got the food home, dished it out and found that it tasted as though they re used oil. Everything had the same burnt flavor to it. The meats were over cooked and so were noodles. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is nice place to have fusion food. We ordered Manchurian, schezuan and Cayenne flavored foods and they were all really nice. The spice level is great and the ambience is cozy. The quantity is also good, we had to pack the food coz we couldn't finish it. Service is great, friendly staff. They're working hard to succeed in this new business and it's paying off."}
{"text":"Good appetizers and fried rice. Ordered the crispy cauliflower and baby corn Manchurian. Was very good."}
{"text":"i have visted the restaurant recently and i have tasted shrimp fried rice, fish manchurian, chicken manchuria and veg noodles, the taste was amazing, affordable, reasonable and authentic."}
{"text":"This is the best Indo Chinese place in the region. We tried all the soups, appetizers and the rice entrees.  It's absolutely yum .

Even though the place is not upscale but the food is just superb.

If you are missing Indian Chinese, jus come here. I am sad that I don't live here but every time I come here I will make sure I stop by.

Kudos to all the chefs .. keep it up . 
Nandri nandri nandri.."}
{"text":"My family and I were in the general area and were looking for a place to eat. We ended up here on a Sunday night. The menu was rather confusing because there were no descriptions to anything and a lot of typos. The service was great and prompt (we were the only ones in there for some time though--another group came in, but our food was already cooking). I had a lo mein noodle dish and it was ok; my fiancée had fried rice but it definitely wasn't the Chinese kind of rice. My mom's partner liked his lamb dish; mom liked her glass noodles. I can't say we will be seeking out this restaurant again. The Indo-Chinese fusion doesn't work."}
{"text":"Best Indo-chinese place in the valley. Do check out the mushroom manchurian and the deppanyaki fried rice!!! I eat here atleast once a week"}
{"text":"Good Indian chinese food. Not a lot in this area serve this.
Owner is good, Ambience can be a little better but one is not looking for a fancy restaurant when he chooses this."}
{"text":"Food and service were good. Please remove extra plates and cups when only two people sit at a table set for four. We will try again sometime"}
{"text":"Service was okay. In the midst of ordering our dishes, waiter just disappear and didn't come back until 5 min later without telling us, and made an excuse that he told us? 

The triple schezhwan fried rice was delicious. The beef Machuran dish was okay. Couldn't really taste the flavor, maybe try other dishes again if service was better. Not big portions for the price point. However waiter seemed pushy. After I was given the check, the waiter forced me to write a review and kept saying to do it now, so here it is."}
{"text":"I go here to get lunch sometimes and I absolutely love their caramel Mongolian beef! And it's so cheap! You can get an egg roll, soup, and an entree for use 9 dollars! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this food?!!!!!!!!!  Yesterday after coming across the business while perusing doordash, I was so intrigued that I drove over there just to look at the real menu (pictures help).  Today I ordered thru doordash and ordered:  

Caramelized Mongolian Mushroom
Manchow  Soup
Baby Corn Manchurian
Veg Noodles
Tossed Crispy Cauliflower

This was all after at least 45 minutes of reading Yelp and Google reviews. When I finally ordered, I was still kinda bitter that I'm not rich enough to try everything I've never heard of on their menu. Anyway, every single dish was out of this world.  Maybe some dipping sauce for the baby corn would be nice but if you are planning ahead, you can make a nice yogurt-dill sauce in no time.   This food is wonderful  This location is in a strip mall under a lot of construction so don't quit looking to find them.  They are in the very south-east corner of the strip mall on the south east.  Do Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just got a delivery from Doordash from this place. When I ordered I was given a choice of rice for chop suey and chose steamed. When order arrived---no rice as advertised on both restaurants's web and on Doordash. Called restaurant and they insisted chop suey doesn't come with rice.  So basically they want me to eat this as a soup........

Edit: So I made my own rice. I would give the chop suey and Manchurian mushrooms an average rating."}
{"text":"Food was just \"okay\" and the beef was chewy. The waiter was a bit patronizing and rude and asked repeatedly for a review written on the spot and also forced us to give cash. I've been to a few Indian food places in Chandler and this was the worst customer service experience I've had."}
{"text":"Very good taste. Best indo chinese food in this area. Reasonable prices and very authentic food. Great taste for spice lovers and lots of vegetarian options as well.

The cayenne pepper rice and noodles were the best.

Recommend this place."}
{"text":"The only reason we visited this restaurant was based on some other review mentioning this place is comparable to Inchin Bamboo Garden. But OMG this place is just horrible. The food had all the ingredients but it tastes pretty awful. The soups are salty, pepper corn has some weird burnt flavor, undercooked meat, bitter poached egg in American choupsey, white rice is too thick and hard. Long story short, would never visit this restaurant again. Not sure why the place has 4 stars on Yelp."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Desi Chinese restaurant. If you are looking for how South-Asia interprets Chinese food this is the place. It's all halal also."}
{"text":"Amazing place if you want a cross cuisine. Lot of options for vegetarians and i would highly recommend wok fried cottage cheese. One of the best ! :-)"}
{"text":"The menu is not updated in yelp. Someone added few pictures of the menu though.. they must update their menu in yelp to make it easy to order.

it's a cozy place and with indochinese cuisine. It has lot of vegetarian and vegan options too. 
The service was very quick, we got our orders in 5mins."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a great find for me.
When you the waiter can explain the food to an extent of causing a  mouthwatering experience, you know you came to the right place. They may great food. Just talk to the waiter and have him explain before you order. Ordered Tossed Cauliflower for starter. Amazing.  Kid had baby corn and she was happy. Triple Schezwan was amazing. It made me cry from the spiciness as I asked for extra heat but awesome food. This is a jewel in a small place. Go there before they become famous and you have to wait. My regret - looks like they have been there a while but I never knew.
It is not for everyone but it is for everyone who loves a bit of spice. Will be repeating my visit many times.

Note for the newbie's: They are not Chinese restaurant but Indo Chinese. So the Kung Pao there is not going to taste the same way as in an Hunan or Great China restaurant. It has the flavor enhanced with Indian spices."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the vegetarian fried rice and the Vegitariam Manchuria with mixed Vegas. My friend had the Green Curry with chicken. 
The Egg drop soup was simple and delicious. The Egg roll so-so
Our server was very new and not well trained but VERY personable 
I really want to give them 4-stars. 
 BUT they have a ventilation problem, the dining area smells strongly of cooking oils ....so 3-stars"}
{"text":"We went there at Wednesday night. We were welcomed properly and asked to sit inside. As, another reviewer told, the server did not remove the remaining plates (we were 2 and there were 4 plates). It was awkward. We were given water but had to ask couple of times to get straws. We ordered chicken manuchurian sauce, shrimp fried rice and another chicken item. The food quality and quantity both did not match with the price. It seemed expensive. On the other hand, server was taking the plates from our table without even asking whether we were finished or not. We felt really bad. I am giving it 1 star for service quality, food price (expensive) for this quality and quantity.

You have to do a lot better in service when you have a competition with New India gate (very close to this one) as their service, quality and. price are excellent."}
{"text":"I like the food here. Hot and chilli fish, chicken lollipops and manchuria sauce chicken both dry and wet is a must try. Price is descent and they also deliver. This place is kind of a small version of Inchin bamboo. It has the Indian version of chinese street food"}
{"text":"This is for indian wok lovers!! You will probably be disappointed if you expect authentic chinese food."}
{"text":"Wow, this food is amazing. Imagine the Chinese food you're used to and multiply the flavor x 10. (It's Indian-Chinese fusion) The staff is also beyond friendly and welcoming. 

Don't miss the hot wings, tossed cauliflower (trust me) and chocolate spring rolls. If I lived in the neighborhood I would be a takeout regular. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Great Indo-Chinese food. All the dishes that we tried were excellent, especially the Garlic Burnt Fried rice."}
{"text":"Very nice Chinese food with little Indian touch.... fantastic quick service!! Casual and easy place for fantastic change of food :)
Will come here again"}
{"text":"I felt like I was at a friend's home instantly upon walking in. We were greeted so sweetly and they truly appreciated our patronage. The waitress was so kind to our daughter, she even played her a special song with her name in it when she heard us say it. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. I asked her what their speciality/ popular items were and she gave us vegetarian or meat options. She recommended the pepper onion and we went with that with chicken. It was the highlight of our meal, my husband and I were blown away. Even my 3 year old liked it. I don't even like peppers. The chicken was just so good. It's an appetizer, but my husband said he would have been ok with a bowl of rice with it for a meal for lunch. We also really liked the mango lassi. I had the yellow chicken curry and it was really good. It had a lot of depth to it. A bit heavier then a thai curry, a good fusion between an Indian curry and a Chinese curry. 

This is a great place for vegetarians with many options, as well as carnivores (non-vegetarians) a like."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight and it was amazing! Had the caramelized Mongolian beef, deep fried cauliflower and teriyaki chicken noodle. Will definitely be going here again"}
{"text":"If you are interested in Indo-Chinese cuisine, this is the right place, I tried Cayenne noodles with chicken and it was good with proper spice level. Check this place out"}
{"text":"Great spot! The owner is very friendly and courteous. Food is perfect desi chinese. Everything is halal. Definitely worth visiting"}
{"text":"Amazing Indo-Chinese food, reminds me on Nanking back in Hyderabad (India). By far the best Indo-Chinese starters in Phoenix. Have been here multiple times already and specifically love onion pepper chicken and American chicken chopsuey!"}
{"text":"Extremely good \"hole in the wall\" food. Went 2 nights ago and had to come back a second time. Authentic Asian and Indian food. Hot & Sour soup and sweet n sour chicken is incredible. Found my new spot in the area."}
{"text":"Great food. Its Indo-Chinese for the major part. reminds me of food i used to eat back home!"}
{"text":"When I ordered delivery Chinese food in Chandler I wasn't expecting much. This was hands down the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona. I ordered the Chow Mein Noodles, Honey & Sour Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, and Tossed Crispy Cauliflower. Don't worry, it wasn't all for me, but I wish it was. I could have finished the Crispy Cauliflower myself had I not had greedy children paws fighting over it. The Kung Pao Chicken was so flavorful and delicious. I thought I had ordered enough Chow Mein so that I could have leftovers for lunch tomorrow, but I wasn't anticipating it being so good. (and by the way, it was a very generous portion). Thank you Wok Inter for restoring my faith in Arizona-Chinese food. Yum."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem. The waitress was so helpful when making selections and very attentive. The chef introduced himself and explained the recipes are original and one-of-a-kind. There are so many vegetarian and carnivorous options, including appetizers, soups and main dishes. The food had great flavor and spices, and was completely unique! The portions were well sized and filling and the food was fair priced. This is everything one can hope for in a restaurant. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome Indochinese food! I would go there for my chili paneer craving any time! The triple schezwan fried rice is amazing too"}
{"text":"Our cousin suggested this place and it was very good. Caramelized Mongolian with shrimp has little crunchy noodles. They made it less spicy for us. Thai red curry with shrimp this has coconut milk and was great. They can make whatever you want however you wish. The menu is a fusion of cultures."}
{"text":"Every dish you order tastes the same! Too much oil in everything. I don't like the ambience at all!! I won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I went today for Lunch with some co-workers. We all greatly enjoyed what we had.  the lunch special was a good price.  I had the Caramelized Mongolian Chicken it was sweet with good flavor.. added a little chili and was really happy.  Noodles were better than the fired rice... as a tip.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a great new place that serves oriental cuisine. The food is very tasty, fresh. The staff are also very nice and extremely polite. Soup was thick, tasty and authentic; appetizers (tossed spicy chicken, crispy mushroom) was a delight and noodles was great too. 

This is a definite place to check out in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken fried rice and carmelized Mongolian beef with an egg flower soup. The soup was Bland although the Mongolian beef and fried rice we're good although a little salty tasting. I'm not sure if I would come again although the staff is friendly and the accepted the Yelp coupon with no problem."}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing customer service. We are always pleasantly surprised with the menu choices. Salem at the front desk is amazing to ask about menu items. Will definitely come here often."}
{"text":"Two of us went for lunch with the $10 for $20 Yelp deal, great deal.
Good service and tasty food.  More upscale than I thought it would be with real cloth napkins especially for lunch.
Kitchen is open so hidden agenda here. Clean and well appointed.  Chefs are professional and service is friendly.
Both of our dishes were good but saucy.  There is an option to go 'dry' for a dollar more, might be worth it on some dishes if saucy isn't your thing.
We hope they stay around but lots of competition in the area.  This fusion approach may give them the edge to just stay ahead of the other choices near them."}
{"text":"PROS
Door dash approved! BC they are so new we think that is why the delivery fee is free
Spring rolls were yummy and crispy
Beef fried rice - 2 meals out of this entree

CONS
The food is good just be careful when you order something as \"mild\" it has a very strong kick for being mild...you can always add spice you just can't take it away from the dish
spring rolls are a little pricy"}
{"text":"Excellent place for takeout. I recommend the Tempering Spicy Chicken - an intriguing combination of flavors, with just a thin coating and a hint of spice. Note that it doesn't automatically come with rice, and I couldn't figure out how to order a side of rice on the app. Maybe I'm just dense."}
{"text":"This food was amazing! Let me first apologize for the photos of mostly eaten noodles, but the aroma coming from the boxes was so enticing, nobody would wait for me to take a photo. LOL. In addition to being delicious, the containers were generously filled, and the quality of the ingredients was top notch. If you're like me and cannot take spicy food, don't worry, just let them know when you order. The food will still be prepared with care and full of savor. My personal favorite was the vegetarian Korean noodles, but everything else, from the Mongolian Beef to the Korean noodles with lamb, was outstanding. Based on flavor, quality of ingredients, and excellence of service, their prices are more than reasonable. Treat yourself to some of this yummy, and healthful food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Indo-Chinese food then you must visit Wok Inter cuisine. Appetizers and soups are too good. Awesome service and plenty of choice to choose from. Overall yummy food. 
Must try"}
{"text":"By far the best Asian-fusion in the area. Unique and interesting dishes. The Manchuria with lamb is special. And get the Chikoo shake - light and refreshing. We will return!"}
{"text":"A friend of ours recommended that we try this place, I was intrigued and excited since I had a feeling this could be a type of Indo Chinese cuisine (big fan). I went in here and almost immediately realized that this place may answer my prayers, all the folks working there are from South India and so my expectations peaked a little more.
We ordered the spicy chicken, which absolutely hit the spot and was really good. The after effects of it was not so good. We then got the cayenne fried rice and the oriental noodles. Both disappointed me from an indo Chinese stand point, but then that's not what they advertise, so it's cool. The fried rice was actually good, keep in mind I do have high expectations. The noodles was pretty decent as well, just did not hit the right spots for my palate. Both the noodles and fried rice had an abundance of meat in it, very generous servings.
The staff is awesome and very friendly. Overall, I haven't decided if I love them or no, may need to go back and find out."}
{"text":"Amazing food... Stupendous service. Makes you feel at home...!!! Definitely a five star service ... And the host is the most hospitable and friendly person you'll ever meet"}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of this place fool you. This place serves authentic homestyle Taiwanese  beef noodle soup, dumplings, etc.  Order off their side menu."}
{"text":"I had Delivery service to my hotel and it took about 35 mins from placing my order and food arriving. I ordered the Orange Chicken(Comes with White Rice), Sweet & Sour Chicken (Comes with White Rice), Fried Rice Chicken, Chow Mein Noodles w/Chicken, Order of Spring Rolls and finally Egg Drop soup. Yes, I love chicken! But the food was amazing! Great Flavor!!! Thumbs up to whoever the Chef is! My kids are fairly picky eaters but they ate everything that was ordered! The portions of food aren't as much as I thought it was going to be for the price I paid but I guess this is where Quality beats Quantity. Thanks to the manager who came back and gave us utensils after the delivery guy forgot to include it! That was very awesome of them to do that! Could of been 5 stars if they didn't forget the Crispy Chinese Noodles for my Soup. Worth the experience!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is wonderful. Saleem is a great host and server!Menu has  wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegeterian food that is delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, Phenomenal service and a clean environment. The noodles are to die for !! We had a very nice experience.  Absolutely loved it. We sure will be returning on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"If possible I will give negative ratings. Horrible food, the taste is below acceptable range. The prices are expensive and just for two of us with two starters and one entree the price came to 45$. The taste is very very bad, I usually give all the restaurants a second try if they fail for first time but this restaurant doesn't even qualify for first try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The best indo Chinese food in Arizona. I personally love the cayenne pepper sauce chicken, with noodles. 

5/5 
Must try."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here to see the friendly staff and have some amazing food! The Mongolian Chicken and Chicken Lettuce Wraps are to die for. You have to try the mango yogurt smoothie! I haven't had the chance to try the desserts - next time for sure! Keep up the great work :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food... we tried mushroom manchurian , tempering spicy chicken n cauenne fried rice... authentic indian chinese n very good service"}
{"text":"If give this a 0 if I could. How this place has 4.5/5 is beyond me and actually makes me question there integrity of the reviews. From start to finish, what a mess. Poor seating, chaotic service, atrocious food. I felt compelled to review based on our visit today and would advise readers to stay away if you want good quality tastey food."}
{"text":"This place is  providing amazing Indian-Chinese fusion food. I have been already here twice in a week, and food quality never disappoints me. For vegetarians, Baby corn manchurian and crispy mushroom manchurian are as good as they can get. Kudos to the chef for the unique taste in these items. Cottage cheese veg manchurian is also pretty good. For the fans of Indian spices flavors, try their oriental sauce. They also provide dry items for 1$ extra, though I never tried that. Owner is very friendly and takes personal interest in describing each item on the menu. Kitchen is open, so you can ensure the cleanliness and hygiene of the food. Also don't forget to try their milkshakes. Chikoo shake (Sapota fruit) was very refreshing. My colleague tried chicken manchurian and was all praising the food. I live across the street, so will definitely make many more trips in future."}
{"text":"Hot and Sour Soup was really good. Crispy Mushroom Manchurian was good but fried rice was really bland,for Oriental Fried Rice I was expecting lot of flavors and hotness but didn't get much. Overall good experience."}
