{"text":"Just average wings for North royalton resident 

They advertised as world best wing but definitely not the best wing not even in cleveland 

Okay to enjoy sports with many TV though 

They pricing for wings are strange either they goes by 1lb market price so u pretty much doenst know how much you will pay for wings and how many 

With we have here in cleveland bonchon chicken they have the world best wings but that is just my dream"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever!  Food sat waiting to be picked up by the wait staff and was luke warm at best when it finally was served.  Wait staff is totally inattentive to their guests.  Not once did she come over and say, i checked on your order and I'm trying to get it expedited.  Sorry, never again, this place used to be fantastic, now, it ranks close to a typical fast food joint.  Thankfully, between Ohio and Minnesota, there are tons of choices when it comes to a sports bar and grill."}
{"text":"We were weekly patrons of this establishment for several years but after a number of nights with cold food, very greasy chips and wings, and bouts of gastric distress by the time we got home, we stopped eating here. While the wings ere tasty the aftermath was not worth it.

Tonight we were asked to come out and try it again by some family members so we did. I made the mistake of ordering the Grey Wolf fish, which had been huge but a bit disappointing in the past, but hey.... maybe it was better after all this time! Right? Not right. For $11.99 (more expensive than the all you can eat fish dinner) I got one perfectly formed plank of fish that was of mediumish size, breaded and had all the earmarks of a frozen plank of fish. This was laying on a HUGE bed of fries with about a 1/4 cup of cole slaw. For $11.99??? Everyone at the table was appalled. To hercredit, the manager replaced my dinner with the all you can eat fish. One serving at $9.99 was twice as much as the Grey Wolf fish! I didn't order seconds as it was very filling and I will say it was very good.

Sadly, my return home was accompanied by gastric distress once again. I think the problem is the fried food, as my husband's chicken paprikash left him feeling fine, as did our relatives nachos. 

I doubt we will be back anytime soon, but when we do return you can bet I won't be getting anything fried!"}
{"text":"Wings were dry and not good and very expensive..New to the area suppose to be the best wings defiantly not.."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place and will never go back. Wanted to get lunch and was happy to see they weren't busy. Sat at the bar for 10 minutes and got completely ignored by the staff."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Food is always excellent. Service not so much. It seems lately they are staffing with people who do not know how to do the job, or just don't care. Tonight we did not even get what we ordered. Sorta like pot luck - but it was still high quality. As one previous post wrote, doesn't really cut it with so many other great options in the area."}
{"text":"It has been a great place but the problem is if your order a draft beer they are instructed to leave 2 fingers of head. They charge a premium for beer and it disappoints that they don't give you a good pour. They started this a few year ago. It's a shame the dont pour a full beer."}
{"text":"Terrible. Boneless wings were good but everything else was horrible. Cold soggy fries. Microwaved hard bake potato. Chicken sandwich was greasy and cold. Manager did nothing. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for a Lenten fish fry and we were disappointed. The \"all you can eat\" fish fry consists of pre-formed triangles of fish which were gummy. The fish dinner was a cod (or Haddock) filet and was a slight improvement but you couldn't tell if they were breaded or battered. The fries, slaw and tartar sauce were all good. They advertise \"Gray Wolf Dinners\" but they didn't come close to the quality of the food at the old Gray Wolf Tavern.
I'm giving them three stars because the service is friendly and prompt and the whole place reminds me of an old family friendly neighborhood tavern."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent..Not what is used to be....Look elswhere

We came here regularly for years. Then a couple years ago we had some a few bad experiences (cold fish, tough burgers, etc.) and stopped coming.

Finally we gave it another try and it was pretty good...until tonight.

We decided to pop out on a rainy Thursday to have some bar food.  Cleats was our choice.

The place wasn't busy and we had our choice of seats.  That was a good start.

Our Christmas Ale's came right away (the first of the season) so we were off to a good start.

I ordered the beer cheese sliders and my wife got the buffalo chicken sandwich.  Now comes the disappointment.

My food came pretty quickly, but it kind of warm, not hot.  I wanted mustard and when the server didn't come back soon with my wife's food so I had to go to the bar to get it...that happens.  I wanted to be polite and wait for my wife to get her food.  Ten minutes later, still not  meal for her.

She told me not to wait and start without her.  After all it should come any minutes.  But by the time I started, my food was cold.  Cold burger, coagulated cheese, you get the picture. But I think they would have been good if they were hot.

I ate slowly hoping my wife's food would come, but after nearly 30 minutes I finished my meal and still not buffalo chicken.

Finally it arrived.  Our beers ($7.00 for a tall and $6.00 pint were empty).  It's really no fun eating by yourself then watching someone else eat.

BTW, It wasn't just us.  Most of the people around us were having the same experience (except for the couple who arrived 20 minutes after us...they were served pretty quickly).

To their credit, they offer us (and the others) a free desert.  

Everyone has an off night.  But we're not find out."}
{"text":"If you like cold food this is the place to go. Ordered wings and fries. The fries came out cold so I asked for a new batch so they brought out another batch like 2 minutes later and they tasted like straight oil. Should've just poured me a cup of oil instead. I also thought there was no such thing as bad wings until I tried these. They were cold and over cooked. It seemed like they probably had those wings sitting there all day and just put some sauce on it.   Do yourself a favor avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet spicy wings and a side of Mac and cheese. The wings were pretty good but the Mac and cheese came out cold. I was charged for ranch and celery even though I never received it. When I told the bar tender I never got ranch or celery she asked me if I would like it after I had finish my meal and was ready to leave. I said and she took off the charges but seemed annoyed she had to redo the receipt."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch while working at a nearby store.  I've been here before to watch the Cavs 2015 playoff run.  This time I ordered a fish sandwich with fries.  It was well prepared, fairly priced, and the portion was enormous.  All in all a fine place to grab a bite, but if I'm in a real rush I probably wouldn't pic this place for lunch again.  The server wasnt slow, she just didn't seemed to have a lot going on and was hustling to handle the entire dining room and bar by herself.  She was doing an admirable job at it too.  They do take phone ahead carry out, that may be a better option if you're on a tight schedule."}
{"text":"Was here last Saturday night and got the 30 wing platter.  This is the original location and they have some of the best wings in NE OH.  Hand-cut fries are good as well as the beer battered onion rings.  The best wings are the \"sweet heat\" \"dry rubbed cajun\" and the lemon pepper.  I can drink the sauce from the sweet heat; a fucking great sauce that I wish they bottled.  
Come here for happy hour deals until 7pm if I remember correctly.  They also have a wing night on Tuesdays I think.
Solid wings and fries.  
They do insist of giving you a 3 finger wide head on every beer you order which is pretty shady."}
{"text":"Great Cleveland bar.  I only get the Texas hold em burger with a basket of hand cut chips which are to die for if you dip them in the bacon ranch dipping sauce.  Downside is they charge extra for the dipping sauce which  I could eat about 5 of.  The burgers are top notch bar burgers."}
{"text":"A good chain restaurant that makes you feel like it's more of a neighborhood bar.  There are regulars here and many of the waitstaff and bartenders have worked here forever, so they make everyone feel very welcome and like they know you.  Cleats has been remodeled in the past few years, boating nicer interior decor and a brand new patio which is nice for the warmer months.  

As far as good goes, I always really enjoy whatever I order!  Their wings are tasty as are their burgers, sandwiches (the buffalo chicken mac and cheese melt is just as amazing as it sounds!), and chicken.  The plates are always heaped with fries or, my side of choice, homemade kettle chips with bacon ranch dipping sauce.  

The drinks are generous pours and decent prices.  They always have seasonal beers as well as old favorites on tap, and the selection is good.  

Overall, a comfortable, casual place to get some good food and a cold drink at the end of the day!"}
{"text":"Fun little dive bar. Cheap drinks and food. I came here with my dad for a drink around Christmas time and they were coming around with free shots and free sandwiches. I've never seen that at a bar before and I like it!"}
{"text":"Went there last night, have been there before. Great menu! Good service. Can't believe I had to post this location as a new listing? Shows other locations here? Great burgers, wraps. The fries are phenomenal! With vinegar or ketchup. I could not decide between a Reuben and a burger, guess what? They have a Reuben burger! A 1/2 lb. burger with the Reuben on top! My wife had a chicken wrap with a spinach type doe. Loved it! My only gripe? They only have  Bud light lime in the summer, do I/others enjoy Bud light lime in the winter? YES, my second request..Miller high life..Nope..don't have it, 3rd request Coors lite..yes they have that, why can I get a good burger and a Bud lite lime at BW3 in the winter and not here? They do have a large beer selection though, probably catering to the 21-40 group, do people over 40 like beer and a good burger?...YES!  It's a little more personable that applebees here, a little easier to talk, hear. My wife said she felt comfortable there, It's a little less \"corporate\" a little more neighborhood atmosphere. We will go there again soon."}
{"text":"They have a large menu with a bunch of great options.  I'm a big fan of the wings.  I don't tolerate much heat, so Medium is perfect for heat, Kentucky Bourbon are an awesome 'flavor' wing, and Lime-Pepper are my favorites.

Only reason i gave this a four is because the service can be a little slow at times, but do not let that deter you!

Also usual Cleveland sports bar atmosphere, great to watch games."}
{"text":"Went there to pick up corned beef and cabbage dinners. Huge portions, it was very good, corned beef (lots) potatoes,cabbage, carrots,and a slice of deli rye, the only thing is, the bread should be wrapped in waxed paper or foil, who likes soggy bread? I threw it away. The meal was a little pricey, but worth it. What a meal!"}
{"text":"Just happen to stop in to grab something to eat great place wings were awesome had the flatbread was very good !!"}
{"text":"Back to a miss. And the last one for me. Went for lunch with three other people. The service was sooooooo slow and my meal was soooooo bad I sent it back. Not sure what the problem is, maybe turnover, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Just average, which doesn't really cut it with so many other great options."}
{"text":"The mayo packets are warm at this establishment...you know........beware of this . Mayo.. Is warm...."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The wings not fresh tasted like freezer burn. The fries were too greasy. The restrooms were not clean with only a hand dryer and no paper towels. The entrance way to this place was gross with those huge ashtrays with garbage thrown into them as well as lottery tickets and cig butts. The manager/owner might want to spruce up the entrance area and make sure it doesn't gross you out as you walk in and stay on top of that issue. The wait staff was nice and fast though. Lots of nice TVs."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Wed for the wing special.  They were awesome!! I had hot and honey mustard.  The hot had a bit of heat but not, lite your mouth on fire. They could give a little more sauce.  I have been to the old Cleats/ now Tailgaters in Wadsworth many times and this Cleats is MUCH better.  Their interior is decent with a modest outdoor area.  They definitely have the wings down pat as they were perfectly cooked!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious wings, cute little patio, good beer selection... What's not to love?! And it's an awesome place to watch a game!! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I checked out Cleats during happy hour with my dad and his buddies. When my dad and I walked in (a little after 4:30 on a Friday) we were surprised there was not a lot of people in the restaurant. The restaurant is a decent size with cool decor. It is also very clean which is very nice. After being seated we were quickly greeted by our waitress. Cleats offers a lot of food and drink specials which is pretty cool. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Really good wings.  Nice patio and friendly staff!  I really liked the barbeque chicken flatbread"}
{"text":"Corned beef as good as - maybe even better than - Sliman's! Moist, juicy, full of flavor. Made fresh today! Delicious, hot, fresh cut French fries, and the PERFECT chocolate martini - who woulda thought?!   And wonderful, attentive barmaids - ask Karen for her chocolate martini. Awesome atmosphere on St. Patty's day! No need to travel downtown and fight the traffic and parking"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Cleats in years and a cousin suggested that we visit for some wings and beer. So off we went. Upon arrival, we were immediately seated at a high top table. There was a good crowd within and music was playing. Since my cousin worked at Cleats for a few years, she knew people that worked there.

As an appetizer, we ordered buffalo chicken dip along with some stuffed potato skins. The appetizers were delivered quickly and they were very tasty. The buffalo chicken dip was good, but we eat it at home often, so I was not impressed with it. The stuffed potato skins were really tasty with cheese, bacon, chives, and sour cream on the side.

For dinner, my cousin's boyfriend and I split 20 Lake Erie smoked chicken wings. These wings had a dry rub and were ordered \"extra dry\". They were served with home made potato chips and we asked for melted cheese dip to accommodate them, which was delicious. The home made potato chips were crispy, salty, and perfect, especially when accompanied by cheese dip. The dry chicken wings were very tasty. Between the two of us dudes, we did not polish off all the chips or wings.

My 22 oz. Yuengling was only $3.50. That's a deal where I come from! Our server was very friendly and attentive.

Great bar!"}
{"text":"1. Patio (I am a lover of all patios)
2. Wine (decent house selections by the bottle)
3. Huge Menu (dry rub chicken wings. cheese planks. salads. nachos. bar food. do it)
4. Service could be better... but overall it's ok - it's a bar
5. Patio (again)"}
{"text":"It's a Cleats so it has decent food.  I only gave 3 stars, because I asked for well done wings, and half were soggy.  The sauce was still good, but they are known for wings."}
{"text":"The guy next to me was farting the whole time but the food was pretty good for a dive bar."}
{"text":"A chain restaurant with only a couple locations. This restaurant has been remodeled (about 5-6 years ago) so it has a nice, updated interior. The staff here is friendly and very welcoming. A lot of them have worked here for at least 10 years so it seems like you've known them for your whole life if you've come here even a couple times. They really make it feel like a great neighborhood restaurant. Now onto the food. The food here is usually really good and I feel like I'm never disappointed. I usually get the buffalo chicken mac and cheese and it is as delicious as it sounds. If I don't get that, I get the chicken tenders, a burger, or wings. And they are all as equally good. Overall, this is another great place to get together with friends"}
{"text":"I was suprised at how nice this location was!  Cleats always has pretty decent food.  We split some garlic parm wings on our visit here and also ordered a couple of sandwiches.  Yum!"}
