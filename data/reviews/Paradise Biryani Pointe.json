{"text":"I didn't want to stop here because of the ratings but was outvoted by my friends.  Clean, nice atmosphere and fast service.  The Dosa is amazing ++.  Chicken Tika Masala and the Buttered Chicken were also delicious. We had a veggie dish with cauliflower and potatoes~great too.
This is an undiscovered hidden gem.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, great ambience and amazing Indian food. A bite of Biryani here takes me on virtual trip to my hometown Hyderabad, India. Noodles, Chicken Appetizers and Naan are a must try here."}
{"text":"Probably the longest I have waited for a to-go.
50 mins and counting..
They better make the greatest biryani ever in the world."}
{"text":"I have eaten many times at Biryani pointe in Edison, the food here doesn't even come close. It is highly overpriced, taste is strictly okay and the quantity is very less. Will not be going back again."}
{"text":"lousy, tasteless biryani; nothing similar to the paradise biryani in new jersey; lot of better biryani places in charlotte; not worth coming here for biryani."}
{"text":"Not up to the hype. Food taste and quality is not even average. Prepared to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant in the valley that boasts of making so called \" Hyderabadi biryani\". The staff is reckless, they don't care what you need and their orders have been messed up for the third time consecutively. Calling the waitress for a misplaced order,  I was shocked to her laughing  at the mistake and asked what she can do about it. Bunch of jokers got together and launched a semi professional restaurant faking it as an authentic biryani spot- they are not a part of Hyderabad franchise guys. Do not waste your time and money- they are not even worth trying guys!"}
{"text":"Restaurant opens @11am, but none of the items are ready until 12.30pm. What's the point?  People didn't get V. Biriyani till 1 pm or later, they keep saying slight delay..taste is also not good.."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, however food is not everything in a restaurant. 
1.  Staff is not professional, if they are on the phone, they do not care and they are on the phone for 10-15 minutes when you are still waiting them to finish their phone call. They make you wait and suffer even when you are staring at them for help or at least a smile, it was clear from her conversation that she was not talking to the customers but somebody else.
2. There is no meaning for spiciness levels, as we asked for least spicy but the food ends up being very spicy
3. I also tried to place orders by Phone. They have a single phone line and their phone is always busy or engaged and very hard to place phone orders. 
4. The tandoori items are a shame

With all the negative comments being said, their Biriyani is still awesome and most of the curries and starters are really good. I would rate them 5 stars but their staff is to blame for their ratings."}
{"text":"We went three times and it was disappointing.. half cooked rice and half cooked chicken came all times. they are in hurry to serve i guess. even the rice is like masala rice not cooked well.. compared to biryani bites this is very bad ..."}
{"text":"I have tried 2 times. For Chicken Biryani, Rice is more cooked than required. No way, it's close to Hyderabad Paradise Biryani."}
{"text":"This place legit one of tha best chicken tiki masala I've ever had ! Great flavor garlic non-bread was delicious!! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I went like 2 times first week the restaurant was open and it was really crowded and we went today at 12.30pm and they even don't have biryanis available. The worst Indian restaurant in Phoenix- I am very sad to say this."}
{"text":"My wife & I were both born & raised in India. My wife is an excellent cook, especially of Indian dishes. Our first trip to Paradise Biryani was a shocking eye-opener. We had never tasted Biryani, Dum Biryani, as tasty & succulent as this!!! We have since returned & taken friends with similar reaction. The pungent or spicy variation is very good  depending on the individual preference. If you wish to experience authentic Indian food visit Paradise & sit back & enjoy good service, good environment & excellent Indian food.
Nash Hansotia."}
{"text":"Awesome biryani. Can relate to the authentic taste from Hyderabad. Small but clean. Staff is awesome . My thumbs up for the same in North Phoenix and Glendale locations."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Indian food 
We pretty much always get take out from here but dined in the other day and we're very impressed 
Excellent service, very attentive staff
They ll make the REALspicy Indian food !
My favorite is the chilly naan and mirchi ka salan"}
{"text":"Came out with full disappointment ... Customer service is not good... Billing is not proper..."}
{"text":"Wait is over for Biriyani Lovers in OH.....I use to travel all the way to New Jeresy to have a spicy Hyderabadi Biriyani now I can have it whenever I crave for it. \"BEST PLACE TO EAT BIRIYANI\""}
{"text":"Best biryani in the phoenix and goat sukha was very good and specially Hyderabad goat masala was awesome with garlic naan"}
{"text":"We had take-out from Paradise Biryani Pointe last night. Friendly service, great prices and DELICIOUS food! Some of the best Indian cuisine I've tried so far in Montreal. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good desi place. Looked at the reviews and decided to try the Dam Briyani at Biryani Pointe. Excellent decision! I tried the goat biryani and got double ka meetha for desert. Loved both of them. Their serving are larger than what I am used to eating so for someone who eats little the serving would be good enough for two. 

Highly recommend it and would definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"We ordered chillie chicken and kadhai chicken and asked them to make the food medium spicy.
They made chillie chicken too spicy to eat, it was just too hot. The spice rating could be easily 10/10.Unfortunately I had placed to go order as we were in a hurry else I would have returned this order.
Kadhai chicken was ok..garlic naan was not that soft."}
{"text":"I ordered special dum biriyani and madras goat curry. Biriyani was delicious but the Goat curry was a disaster with bitterness. INTERESTING is when we asked for the check, he was asking for the credit/debit card without showing us the total bill. Even after we asked the bill he said he would give after the card is swiped which is strange! No restaurants just take your card without showing the bill which highly disappointed me."}
{"text":"Perfectly prepared. Range of spices. Restaurant is clean and everyone is friendly.  Love the music. Will be back also for takeout."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open in the valley and it is worth the wait. I have tried biryani in all the Indian restaurants in the valley. This is by far the most decent biryani in phoenix. The gravy that comes with the biryani was right on. That's how you know they are here to stay for a long time."}
{"text":"Awfully long wait time. You aren't hungry anymore by the time food comes. Food is okay. I am writing this waiting for my biryani to come."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is a goto spot for fresh and great tasting Indian cuisine.  I have been here about 10 times and always love it.  The dishes are served hot and the spice levels can be tailored to any pallet.  The staff is very friendly and we have never disappointed.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The biriyani was not so good as we expected cos of the name biriyani point we were hoping for a awesome biriyani but that was a disappointment. The tandoori had a raw masala taste and smell. The channa batura was very thick and did not taste good. The best part of our dinner was the Kadai chicken it tasted so good and we loved it. The dessert double ka meetha was very good. The prices  and a little high for the quality of the food. Not worth the money we spend on dinner."}
{"text":"You can give it a shot .. not the best but not the worst too...
I dont want this to close just because of terrible reviews as it just started.

Servers seem new to the job."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Took more than 50 min to serve food. Not tasty food.
Worst service.. Would not prefer to visit again.."}
{"text":"Good food, fresh and spicy!!
Appetizers were yummy, felt the real hyderabadi taste :)"}
{"text":"Very bad service.They take order in a tablet device and end up serving a wrong order every time (3/3 so far) Took more than 45 min to serve the food after they took order, giving silly excuse that it was mistakenly placed behind. No one comes to attend the customers in time. Had to ask for water while they go back and forget abt it. I would never visit this place again. Food ofcourse wasnt fresh, I wonder why they take so much time to serve food for reheating ."}
{"text":"Nice Indian authentic taste. Affordable prices! We usually take biryani to go and order biryani in bulk in weekend gatherings and occasions. Biryani has never failed in taste and South Indian authenticity except in few cases when they initially started business at this location.

We heard about new entries in their menu and wanted to try. We revisited to try Maharaja Bhojanam. This item has got a Thali with veg, non veg curries and fries with one roti accommodated along with white rice and biryani. Also, came with a spicy papad and a desert. Apart from all this tasty stuff, treated with a freshly made sweet paan, which I liked the most and bought 5 of them for my family. Got a glass of butter milk with sides like yogurt and dal. It is hard to get this kind of treatment and I think it beats the price, taste and quantity against a buffet as long as Paradise maintains and keeps this bundle always. 

Keep it up, Paradise!"}
{"text":"Most authentic biryani till date in the valley ! Loved their special chicken dum biryani ! If I eat here I do not crave for Indian food , as it's super authentic !!!! Love it"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Gobi 65 was delicious!! The hostess was amazing, super friendly, personable, and a joy to talk to. The array of dishes to choose from were great, and it was cool to see that you could go straight to the lunch buffet and grab a take out container and grab some grub to go! Really great price too, $24 for two to eat and have sodas as well. If you haven't already check it out and give them some love. I saw they also have a really interesting midnight Biryani dining experience on Friday's and Saturday's also!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife were visiting Montreal from the USA. Many people might not be aware but Paradise Biryani Pointe is a franchise with multiple locations/branches in the USA. Our favorite has been the one in Baltimore (highly recommend their chicken biryani and lollipops). 

That said, when we heard about this place we immediately decided to try it out. We went on Saturday evening. The place is located in a basement. It's a small restaurant with 4 small tables and no customers were present when we went around 7:30ish. There was no one at the reception table but a lady walked in from the kitchen soon after we arrived. We decided to try their special - Paradise Biryani. The food was served within 10 min after after we placed the order. 

This biryani was no biryani at all. Basically it was pulao with fried chicken on top. The rice as well as the chicken was tasteless. There was minimal salt but no spice to it. The chicken was likely marinated in turmeric water and though it was tender and well fried, it was again tasteless and we couldn't appreciate any Indian spices. We had decided to order more food but after the poor performance of the biryani, we decided to leave. 

The lady attendant was nice and polite. During the half and hour we were there, only one more customer came for a pick up. 

We must have tried biryani at least over 100 different places in USA and this by far was the worst one."}
{"text":"When I went there first time, I didn't get a place to sit after waiting for 45 minutes so I was bit disappointed.

But next time, my experience was good.  Chicken Biryani was very good with moderate waiting time, but it's too early make any opinion on food or waiting because the place is new. It's gonna be the best place for Biryani if they could maintain the food quality.

Currently they are serving only Biryani, Curry & Rice \"NO Bread\"."}
{"text":"I have been here just once for a pickup of veg apptz.r and it took 30 minutes.

I haven't asked a single question for the delay and the owner of restaurant politely gave me a refund for the delay.

My food was delicious and I am also Impressed with the service.

Good luck..."}
{"text":"Don't order anything by phone. These guys are lazy and don't pick up any phones after 7 pm. Very very bad customer service"}
{"text":"Pathetic service.Total mismanagement for pickup orders. I have been told initially that food can be picked up in 20 min. I am waiting since 30 min post arrival and still nothing is ready. Bad part is no one provides a status update. All the staff is inside and no one stays at the reception. Upon checking for order status they mention 5 more minutes every time. Once again pathetic service and total mismanagement. They are taking more than what they can deliver on time."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in d valley for hyderabadi biriyani taste. We tried Gongura Goat biriyani and it tastes awesome. We also ordered a tray for couple of times for our parties and they maintained the same quality while we dine-in"}
{"text":"Strictly average restaurant... Food was okay but service was really pathetic.went with loads of expectations and returned dissappointed 

We ordered chicken tikka which was pretty good .. But the biriyani was a let down and it's pretty expensive to a dine in as there is no buffet"}
{"text":"Was missng Hyd a Lott! That is wen I found this place.. I may not have Haleem in India.. but thnks to paradise biriyani pointe! Finally hd Haleem in ramzan. Taste was really awsum.. yummy.. I wld love to recomnd this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Very cozy place. Clean and classy. Servers were great with our kids and food was wonderful. Biryani and raita are excellent. The malai kofta is probably my favorite. My wife was introduced to Indian food here and was not disappointed. We will definitely return more and recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"The food was good, the portions were great too, it was flavorful.

However the spice levels are very high, that was difficult for me even at the mild level.

For those with low spice tolerance, please be careful when ordering, and make special request."}
{"text":"Good choice of biriyani in the north valley, there weren't many. First week so they were busy with lot of wait, I decided to skip the lines and ordered to go. 
This is probably best biryani in Arizona but since this is a chain let me compare them with their other locations in California.
I tried their goat biriyani in Santa Clara, Fremont and Artesia CA...so let me highlight why this biryani was a let down....there was hardly any meat! Dum biriyani is known for meat..they included more rice to fill the void! Less meat and masala the biriyani hardly tastes like one.
Compared to other locations they did not include slice of egg and fried onions as well. I hope they improve and maintain the consistency of their other locations 
Good luck guys don't let me down the next time on meat!"}
{"text":"Flavourful chicken biryani at the best price. It's really just perfect and resonates more  closely to Bangladeshi biryani. The biryani is not full of masala like sindh biryani (Pakistani, the type you find at Sana/Student Tasty). It does not violate extreme levels of spicy (Punjabi biryani you find at Bombay Mahal). It might be slightly dry but they provide raita to compensate. Best part is the onion garnish. The ingredients are fresh. I haven't visited the place, I mostly order delivery which is seamless. For maximum impact, start eating while the food is still piping hot. I've already become a regular and shifted my loyalty from student tasty Haha. You'll definitely like this place if you appreciate authentic desi food."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try out their food for so long and finally went for dinner last night. Wow!! The restaurant was full and we had to wait to be seated!! I have never ever seen any other Indian restaurant where you have to wait because its full!! I was already impressed. Apart from this they had non stop carry out orders.. the staff was very nice and courteous..Food is delicious, Best Chicken Biryani I ever eat in US.  The aroma of Biryani is in the air!!! Love it

pros

Excellent Service
Very good taste
very clean and nice"}
{"text":"Prompt service and really tasty food. I've had the weekend combo special which has biryani, fried rice, a cup of dessert, 2 appatizers, 1 curry and also one naan. It was a big portion and biryani was full of flavor although not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Paradise is the closest any restaurant has come in the Cleveland area at creating Indian dishes with authentic flavor profiles. The lunch buffet has a generous yet reasonable variety of entrees, salads and desserts. It stays true to its name and makes the best hydrebadi dum biryani (I've tried the goat and chicken)."}
{"text":"I have not had Indian food many times in my life but my son works at Albertson's and he said it smelled so good and he wanted to go when he got off work. When your 16 year old wants to go out you go!  We had great service,great advice on what to order and the food was delicious!  It was after 8 pm when we went it there were lots of others there at that time."}
{"text":"Service was great, authentic food from India but a little to authentic with the no ice. I respect the cultural reasons but in AZ summer cold ice water is a necessity. Food was delicious & you can tell they are very popular within their own community with the amount of take out orders... tons!"}
{"text":"I always order in biryani from this place ( The Chicken dum biryani) because it's so cheap and filling and yum. They serve the biryani with yogurt and onions and lime which makes the biryani even more delicious."}
{"text":"Had the lunch combo. Came with soup, chicken curry, chicken 65, naan, gulab jamoon and chicken dum biryani(for 2$ extra). Highly recommend it if you like to taste spicy Indian food. This combo is unfortunately only available for lunch."}
{"text":"Arrived here to find a girl on the phone chatting away. Asked for a menu, she pauses (and looks at me as if I'm disturbing her conversation), \"We are out of those\" and then goes back to talking.   Then I asked her for a business card, She pulls away from her phone call again \"We are out of those too\"   Then she says \"You can take a picture of the menu with the contact information with your cell phone\"  During this time, the place was practically empty and had only two diners. 

Based on the unprofessionalism of this employee, I decided I will not dine here nor recommend it to friends. If they couldn't do something as simple as get off the phone to do their job, I'm scared to think what would happen if I had to actually be waited on. No thanks, I'll take my dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best Hyderabadi Dum Biryani. After a long time, i had Good Biryani and Haleem.   Haleem is awesome."}
{"text":"Best biryani in Phoenix
I have tried many of their appetizers and paradise special chicken biryani multiple times panning several months and I have to say it's been super delicious , authentic and very consistent ."}
{"text":"Best biryani and Indian food in Phoenix... Had an appetizer, goat curry and their special chicken biryani... They were all very tasty and authentic."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The Chili Gobi is amazing, fun Telugu music, great service!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant zero stars. The people who work here actively discriminate against LGBTQ customers. When same-sex couples go into this restaurant, they will seat you, give you attitude, and then proceed to tell you that everything on the menu is \"out\".

Yeah, they will never see my face or a dime of my money."}
{"text":"Not so Healthy Food! Very oily food. We had buffet lunch and both had bad stomach. Prices are also high as compared  to others in the area."}
{"text":"Can't give a review of the food or the restaurant because we didn't even get a chance to sit down. Was told the wait was 15 minutes, and we just left at 45 min cause they kept adding time. Not mad about this because they were busy. The crowd that was trying to eat at this place was absolutely terrible. Everyone was so impatient and just going up to the front and asking the 1 host questions all at the same time. When tables were ready there were so many rude people at the front that the next group of people couldn't even get a chance to get seated. Absolutely inconsiderate and no manners from grown adults. Not sure if I want to experience this again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Butter Chicken and it was fantastic. I usually order this when I'm trying out a new Indian restaurant. We had carry out, but the restaurant looked clean and the staff was friendly.
------
I've ordered the butter chicken here several times now. We like it so much that I got two orders of butter chicken with our most recent order. I did not receive twice the quantity of rice. When I raised the issue with the staff, I was not given more rice. I was disappointed by this so I called the next day. The staff again did not make any offer to correct the issue. Good food, friendly and reasonable staff, but not really open to making attempts to correct lapses in customer service. I'll still order again."}
{"text":"Go to this place if you want the real deal on biryani. I can bet no one comes close to what they make here . I ordered vegetable biryani and can't get enough of it. As far as buffet or North Indian food and such, go there at your own risks. Hyderabadi making Punjabi food ... just doesn't fit right. Anyways stick with biryani and you will feel the same !!! Keep it up guys , Wil be back for some chicken biryani this time"}
{"text":"This is the third time I am posting my review and every single time they delete it because my review is not in their favor.. I am sorry to say but the biryani is not authentic, i have tried biryani at their california location. There is no comparission at all. Very less quantity for the price. I ordered appatizer and there was not meat but just flour in the dish.. I hope they don't delete this review again.."}
{"text":"Because of my job, I usually always have to order in dinner, and this resturant became one of the places my work orders from. I love Indian and this has to be one of the tastiest butter paneer masala and tikki masala paneer I had ever had. Also love their garlic naan. if you love Indian,  defenatly give this a try."}
{"text":"Food is flavorful and fresh.. the items in the buffet change from day to day which is a nice change from some of the other Indian buffets in Cleveland. If you're a meat eater, this place has tons of chicken and goat options... if you're a vegetarian, unfortunately the same cannot be said. We came on a Saturday afternoon and paid 30 dollars for 2 people which was not nearly worth it for the variety of vegetarian food they have. Also, prices for the buffet aren't listed anywhere so ask before you sit down."}
{"text":"I've been trying my best to like this place but the food simply won't allow it. Their biryani is very bland and basic, the curries are bland as well and on top of that every single thing I've tried here makes my stomach sick! The quality of the ingredients used are not up to par, all in all I would not recommend this place, it's far from the paradise I was hoping to taste ."}
{"text":"3 adults and a 7 month old. Adult cutlery+baby spoon served with Phoenix's best biryani and gobi manchuri :) loved it and will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Nice food. Good Indian taste. Reason for giving 2 star is they charge tax on take out food. That's against Ohio law of sale tax. Hopefully they correct soon otherwise can get into trouble . I wish them best luck . I got my tax corrected and refund my money but seems like not everyone seeing so close to their receipts when order online and when they pick up food."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Saturday night 30 mins before they closed in a huge group of 16 hungry folks and they did a great job of taking care of us. They had run out of some dishes but told us upfront. Food was tasty and we dint have to wait too long considering the size of our order. High marks for the Malai Kofta, Butter Chicken and Chilli Gobhi. The special chicken biriyani was good too (was tastier during prior visits). A fried who was visiting from the bay area was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was (now that's saying something). Hope they keep up the good work and maintain the quality of the food. P.S. Please sign up with Uber Eats."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to an Indian restaurant in NEO, and it did not disappoint. I arrived at 7:30 on a Friday evening, and was promptly seated. I was waiting for a friend and got to subtly eye up some of the dishes being brought out to other tables. Very nice presentation and everything was steaming fresh. The server was friendly and gave us the time we needed to choose what we wanted. I ordered the butter chicken and paneer tikka masala, both medium heat, garlic naan, and samosas to start. My friend ordered the goat masala, garlic naan, and samosa. It took a while for the food, but it was a fully seated house, and you could see a lot of take out going to the front. We were in no rush- I recommend that if you go during sit down service, to not be in a hurry on a busy night. Each dish came out very fresh and hot. The samosas were nicely seasoned and the accompanying sauce was delicious with a nice heat level. All three entrees were fragrant and delicious. It is worth waiting for the dishes because of how fresh the ingredients taste- you can tell that each dish is made with care. I had the butter chicken reheated on the stove today with the naan, samosa, and rice heated in the toaster oven for brunch. Just as delicious as last night! The naan was nice and chewy yet crispy at the edges, both fresh and leftover. 
My only critique is to maybe have the server offer the check a tad sooner- although I do appreciate we never felt rushed at all and being given time to chat at your leisure is really nice in a restaurant. My water glass was dirty (dishwashing machine fail) but I didn't bother (I don't drink much water during a meal). I could have spoken up but it wasn't an issue. The manager came by after we ate and asked how we liked everything, which I thought was a nice gesture. 

I highly recommend this restaurant. I can't wait to try other dishes on their menu- each biryani I saw looked and smelled very good. So impressed!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on her recommendation and I was blown away. The owner was very friendly and treated us like family. I had the veg thali and the portions were huge (even by Indian restaurant standards). The dishes tasted fresh and flavourful, I rated it 5 stars because we have a lot of Indian restaurants in Montreal but I feel like this one is better than others I have tried in the area and even Parc Ex. They also have some Southern Indian options like dosas which are pretty hard to find in Montreal, I will definitely be back to try them!"}
{"text":"This place is on point!! I've been here a couple times and ...... Delicious.  I'm not sure who 3 stared this place but \"COME ON\".  Order the Apollo fish and Gobi 65 with some white rice.  OMG.   I DON'T GIVE 5 stars out like candy.   This is a must try.   The only down fall is a tad bit pricy.  An excellent example of you get what you pay for.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Wife and I went there today because next door is a top-notch vacuum repair place.  We decided to visit this restaurant for the first time.  Boy!!! Are we glad we did.  Very clean.  Hostess/waitress was very accommodating and helpful as we deciphered the menu items.
This is not a buffet but a restaurant having a list of lunch items.  Each dish comes as either vegetarian, chicken, or goat.  Wife had chicken and I had goat.  Both meats fell off the bone.  Was a bit spicy but not all that bad.  Each lunch special came with a appetizer, main course with nan, and a dessert. We both loved our meals and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Worst place to order food... they say order will be ready in 20 mins and they keep you waiting for more than an hour

Worst Service experience and there is no place to sit.

Hope they realize how worst is their service and at least try to empathize with people who are waiting in queue"}
{"text":"We had the chicken tikka masala it was really good, I've ate at like 4 different Indian places in Cleveland this one is the best by far, nice staff and fresh good food ."}
{"text":"Great authentic food, I had the buttered naan, Gobi, and butter chicken. . Genuine staff that care about you and the food they serve! We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Expensive. Not punctual. I ordered over the phone for pickup. They hung up before I was able to ask for my total. They said 20 min, I showed up 25 min later and they still asked for 10 more minutes.
$32 dollars later I ended up with 1 piece of naan, 1 chicken kabob without the stick, 1 shrimp kabob without the stick. Nothing else. It was not disgusting but surely not worth the $32 bucks. I feel like I was slapped in the face."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely great. We order or dine in at least once a week. Food is delicious, service could be better but not going to hold it against them. Food however is good, we usually get the boneless chicken biriyani, butter chicken and chicken lollipops. We are happy that this place exists in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Paradise Pointe, and quite frankly, I was not impressed with anything here, including the food, the ambience, the prices, or the service. Since the restaurant is titled \"Biriyani Pointe\", I thought I would try out their their signature biriyanis, and some appetizers. We were a group of four, and we ordered the goat gongura biriyani, the hariyali chicken kabab, the fried shrimp, chicken biriyani, bhindi masala and tandoori rotis. Since everyone at the group liked to share their food, I got to chance to sample most of these items. The goat gongura biriyani was too strongly spiced, so much that it almost masked the taste of the meat itself and was at the brink of tasting bitter. The hariyali kabab was not well marinated, and spices barely reached a few layers beyond the coating, the fried shrimp was OK, and the bhindi was probably the best of the four items. The items are also a bit overpriced in my opinion. The service was average, and could use a LOT of improvement, including the basic courtesy to treat customers. For example, when the customers are asking for five to-go boxes, it's probably not polite to ask them why they need five, and not three. Seriously guys? We were merely asking for to-go boxes, not free dessert! And guess what, they still didn't give us the number of to-go containers we asked for. I would not discourage anyone from going here and trying them out, but try not to keep your expectations too high. :-("}
{"text":"You can tell this place is family run. They care. Their version of mild is still very hot - so beware.  The service was disjointed, they couldn't answer questions,  maybe they were new.  The decor is modern.
The eggplant dish and the cauliflower appetizer were amazing. The biriyani was too spicy for me, but also excellent. Really good flavorful fresh ingredients throughout."}
{"text":"Decided to give Paradise a try to try out something new. We got the butter chicken and the Aloo Gobi which were both very delicious! I ordered mild and was a litter hotter than expected but still very good and not too hot to eat. Butter chicken was so creamy and rich and chicken fell apart. The gentleman who took our payment (we ordered takeout) was very nice and professional. Clean place. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very very poor service. Extremely sweet food at first. On returning that extremely spicy food. Asked for yogurt and was again made to wait for good 20 minutes. Very pathetic service & poor quality food.
Never coming again."}
{"text":"Let me start with why I have given 2 stars. It's all about the customer service. I have been visiting this place for more than 6-8 times. Be it dining there or a pick up, the wait time is awful. If you really want to stay in the restaurant for an hour or more to get the food. Then go for it. There is no urgency what so ever. 

I have seen other customers waiting such long hours like me for dining in or a pickup while I visited on multiple occasions. 

I am writing this review while I wait to pickup my food for the last 45+ minutes. I think I am giving up on this restaurant just for this reason. I am not coming back again. 

Food wise, it is okie. Not the best of the best. I wish Paradise has never given them the franchise to run this place. They are spoiling their name. I have been to paradise biryani in California. They were good, food was good and so much options. But this place

If you really want to eat biryani, try a place called pastries n chaat. The wait time after placing the order is 15-20Min max. They serve biryani too. 

Note: I have no association to pastries n chaat in anyway. Just a biryani lover."}
{"text":"The only thing which was good was goat chukka, rest all the chicken and veg dishes was pathetic. Quality of chicken was very bad and not cooked, Veg appetizer is also bad.

Briyani chicken is not good. Goat is ok."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was so good! Service was attentive though a little confusing as to who our server was as it changed throughout the meal. Menu has a few surprises too - like Asian-style Hakka noodles and fried rice! The basmati rice has great flavor as did my palak paneer. Definitely recommend this place! Can't wait to come back to try more menu items and the Biryani!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Just lovely food. Best Indian food in this area. Naan could've been a little better, but everything else is awesome. Eat EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"One of the best places if not the best for biriyani in the Phoenix area.  Their boneless chicken biriyani is one of my favourites besides the dum biriyani."}
{"text":"This place is sometimes inconsistent, but always good tasty food! Would recommend the Madras chicken and the biryani. You could ask them to make the chicken dishes boneless too."}
{"text":"They have the best Biryani in the Valley! Hands down. Authentic Hyderabadi
Their appetizers and curries are delicious."}
{"text":"Outstanding biryani's and appetizers 
Strongly recommend this point for authentic hyderabadi delicacies  

The staff is very warm and welcoming, 
prices are great food is even more great"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite Indian food restaurant in Phoenix. We ordered samosas, chicken lollipop, paradise special chicken biryani and dum ka murgh. Oh and garlic naan. The flavors in the food were so rich and multifaceted and I loved everything we ate. But my favorite was the dum ka murgh. We ordered it medium spicy, which was perfect for us, and the heat really tasted like it came from the blend of spices and not just an addition of red pepper flakes. We will definitely be back. And we'll be bringing friends."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place with my friend.  First time outside of Chicago where I had a truly South Indian Hyderabadi restaurant.  I wasn't disappointed at all!
Loved the food but as usual for an Indian place, the service was lacking.."}
{"text":"I was told to come here from a co-worker and never even knew it was there but I am glad I went!  I have been here a few times now and have had their tandoori chicken, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, gulab jamun and I had never had it before but tried the Double Ka Meetha, which is like a fried piece of bread that is soaked in a syrup, and was very savory, buttery and sweet.  Their garlic naan is also pretty good.  The restaurant is small and I have only done take out from here.  The food does take some time to prepare but so far what I have tasted has been delicious so that is fine.  Their butter chicken is hands down the best I have had anywhere.  I have recommended this place to people I know and will continue to go back.  Very good!"}
{"text":"So I am judging by the experiences of having been to Bangalore several times in the past two years...and the verdict is that this is certainly authentic and the food is very flavorful. 

The restaurant is very clean and only 4 months old. It's kind of small with not more than a dozen tables. We went for the Saturday lunch buffet. There was enough choices to try along with few salad and dessert selections. 

Service was good and the owner was nice and didn't charge our two girls 5 and 7 years old as they were still new to Indian food."}
{"text":"Good food, ordered take out and was pleasantly surprised with the quality. Had veg biryani and gobi 65. Have been in multiple times and plan to do a catering order soon.

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Ordered(Pick up) Egg biryani on 11/25.
While having my Egg Biryani found CHICKEN piece
Later I figured out that it was actually a chicken biryani where these guys removed the chicken and  just added some masala topping with 3 egg pieces and made it Egg biryani.

PS: I'm a Egg'eterian.Never had meat in my life."}
{"text":"Came here and was blown away by the quality of the food. Ordered Chicken Vindaloo and Gobhi. A+++++staff was extra friendly. Will be back for sure .... thank you !"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Paradise to open in Chandler and I am glad they did.
Finally got around to writing a review for this location. The food and location are perfect! Best biryani in town."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Ordered pickup, which was ready within 30min.

The biryani rice was unexpectedly soft. Ordered the boneless chicken dum biriyani, garlic nann, and paneer tikka masala which were great.  Gotta love these hole in wall spots."}
{"text":"As a Biryani Enthusiast I went to this place and tried their food. Here are my Insights

Pros:

Cozy ambience.
Great food.
Perfect location( close to Asiana and I 17 freeway)

Cons: 

Since it is a new restaurant. I would give some more time and update my review in future.


Will try their Family Pack Biryani some time soon. Not alone though, they mentioned that it serves 4-5 people."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Hillcrest area restaurant scene!   The location is convenient and inviting with lots of parking and comfortable seating.  The menu offers many selections with many vegetarian and meat lover choices.  The cauliflower appetizer was DELICIOUS and the chicken tika masala and eggplant dishes were excellent with many levels of flavors.  The food is all made fresh and to-order, so don't come expecting a quick bite.   Allow time and enjoy the excellent variety of tasty Indian dishes.  The naan is moist, crisp and awesome!  Will definitely return to explore other menu options."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome! Attentive and great service. I've tried the weekend buffet, the two things that stood out are ginger chicken and double ka meetha. Also tried the chicken biryani on a weekday night and I'd strongly recommend it for all those who love the authentic flavor of the biryani. I would recommend the chicken/goat biryani over the shrimp biryani. 

This place is a great addition to the Mayfield area!"}
{"text":"I'm in town for a conference. I drove over to the University Area so I could get some alumni paraphernalia from the UNCC bookstore. My uncle had previously seen Paradise Biryani Pointe and had wanted to try it.   We were seated right away and the manager immediately served water and asked us if we were ready to order.  I helped my aunt and uncle order, because they hadn't been to an Indian restaurant before.  The food came out quickly and was amazingly delicious. We ordered vegetable biryani, chenna masala, spinach and my uncle got lamb chops. We tore through this food! The rice was light and fluffy, the food was so yummy that you smelled the fragrances before the food entered your mouth. I couldn't believe the place was empty, but the manager said they hadn't been there long.  You should check out this place!! I'm going back to DC on Thursday, but Paradise rivals anything I've had at my fav Indian restaurant on Capitol Hill."}
{"text":"Very limited menu, customer service is very very slow, prices are high as compared to the quantity you get. Biryani which is there main selling dish is also not very good, you get better biryani in Peacock and Persis Indian grill. On rush hours specially during weekends the biryani is very very ordinary. We went on Friday evening and ordered egg biryani, and it came after 50 mins and that too was not at all good, the dum was entirely missing so the biryani was very dry and you get just two eggs in all. We might not go again to this place."}
{"text":"Possibly the best and most authentic hyderabadi dum biryani in all of Cleveland. I have found places like this when I travel, but never in Cleveland. We finally have a great biryani place here! The veg biryani is served with a wedge of lime and raw onion, and the flavors are so so excellent. If you truly love Indian food, this should be your next meal out."}
{"text":"NASTY ... the smell from the food emanates to the apartments ... I thought, give it a chance, try the food, I did, NASTY.  Never again, can't wait until they go under and go bye bye!"}
{"text":"A true authentic Indian experience. When I walked in they sat me right next to someone else (even though there were plenty of open tables everywhere) just to give me a feeling of what India's population density is like. They served me lukewarm water just to simulate the inaccessibility of clean drinking water. And based on past reviews of this place, they nailed the homophobia part perfectly!

At least the food is cheap. The lunch special was very fairly priced and served as what I could only call \"a prison tray\" because of how miserably every course (appetizer, entree, dessert) was partitioned onto one plate. Okay fine, maybe I've never been to prison but the food was decent at best anyways."}
{"text":"Nice place. Mainly a take away joint. Over all Good food. Goat Haidarabadi Masala and Goat Biryani are too good. They have good Dosa and Sambar."}
{"text":"One thing that I always missed in Phoenix (since I moved here in 2015) was a good biriyani place. I came to know about this place last year and I must say it's the best biriyani I had in Phoenix till now. My personal favorites are paradise special chicken biriyani and goat biriyani."}
{"text":"I have met a dozen of my husband's single friends who kept raving about this place, I felt deeply compelled to try it out (never making that mistake again). We ordered home delivery of their famous Briyani and fried chicken, the delivery guy comes over 1.5hours later without the fried chicken. 
By then of course I have starving guests who would eat just about anything (thank God!), because the food was absolutely tasteless. The chicken in the briyani wasn't cooked well enough and it wasn't the least bit spicy. I have had mine and others fair share of biryanis to know that this was neither Hyderabadi, Pakistani or any type really. 

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, but if held at gun point and forced to do so- make sure you order 2 hours before you plan on having your meal."}
{"text":"I know this place just opened and they're going to have some kinks to work out but here is my first impression. First off, the guy waiting on us, which meant taking our order and not checking on us later for refills or anything for that matter was wearing a t-shirt with a half naked woman on the front of it. I could also have done without having to look at his feet (dirty) as he was wearing flip flops. That's was the beginning of my appetite loss. Then a gentle quiet lady was kind enough to drop off a couple glasses of water (Warmer than room temperature). This was followed up by us placing our order for lunch. Pretty simple, we both went for the chicken lunch special. After waiting quite sometime the place became packed with customers. After 30 minutes our food arrived. So here we go, The curry chicken was so cold it was unbearable to eat, and beware, the chicken is NOT boneless. The other chicken bits (fried) that came with it were burning hot. The rice/chicken dish was proper temperature but it had its own issues - Bones, Bones, Bones. Large bones, small bones, bones like needles that stabbed my tongue and gums. I am lucky I didn't break a tooth. When I finished eating what was edible, half of my plate was covered in Bones and gristle. (Notice I didn't even mention the gristle before, it was bad as well). The naan was good for about the first 30 seconds, then it turned rock hard and cold. I did enjoy my soda though, of course it was a can of Coke-Cola I was lucky enough to drink straight out of the can for $1.49. I hate to leave such a horrible review when the place just opened but the reason I am doing so is two parts, first off, I hope I don't get sick because the food was clearly not served at proper temperature and secondly I was there for an hour and ten minutes. This was supposed to be a lunch break. A couple others were also there as long but some got out much quicker. I had to ask for our check three times. We sat waiting 10 minutes with our food pushed away from us, clearly having been finished before we had to try and flag the guy down to get our check, then had to do it again, then finally a third time we got it. After paying for our meal the waiter looked at our plates, which were clearly covered in bones and gristle and said \"I hope you enjoyed the food\". Fortunately there are other Indian Food restaurants close by I can return to for a better lunch experience."}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  I doubt well be back.  The food is not bad, but the service is just odd and disorganized.  

The cauliflower app is pretty good as recommended by other yelpers.  Unfortunately it was the only thing that had any spice to it.  We ordered the Vindaloo, which is typically a spicy dish, and the server asked what level of spice so we said \"medium, we like it spicy\".  She said \"regular?\". Fine, ok.  It had NO heat.

We ordered the samosas and they were ok, but only had the tamarind sauce and no green chutney, bummer.  Also, EVERY plate had raw slices of red onion that were not so fresh as a garnish.  

When the server came to get the plate she asked if we had samosas before.  Yes, we have.  What an odd and condescending question.

I asked for chai and was told they don't serve chai.  Wha????  

The wife and I just wanted have a quiet meal and some atmosphere, but there was a large very loud group that made it hard to hear ourselves in their small dining room. The lighting is just dim florescent lights, not romantic even with the LED candles.

I'll stick with Taste of Kerala next time and get better food, faster service and better prices."}
{"text":"Confession: 3 days after my first time here, I was back for more. I don't know what more I can say than that... I have been going on a tour of Indian restaurants around this area, and this was the fourth place I have been. It does not compare with the others. I truly found it to be the freshest and most flavorful Indian food I have come across, and those were just the vegetarian dishes. I love their desserts. And the staff was so nice. I will definitely be coming here as often as I can whenever the mood for Indian food strikes."}
{"text":"Very nice food.. I have tried many items and all were upto expectation.. Staff is very polite and courteous."}
{"text":"Best Briyani in Phoenix!! Am happy I found something to satisfy my Indian tastebuds!! Would recommend this place to Briyani lovers !!"}
{"text":"Reasonable to mediocre food but extremely slow and inaccurate service. Ordered a dosa along with other non veg items. Butter chicken came with slivers of what tasted like tandoori chicken. Dosa arrived so late - the rest of the food was already consumed by the rest of the party. Sambhar arrived cold. Management needs to hire additional help, and train them better."}
{"text":"I have had bad experience on my first time visit. But, wanted to give it a try considering all the reviews and good word of mouth. 

Second time around I was impressed, they had increased their quality and service and catered to the requirements of public. They have various options added to their menu. 

I have tried their natu koli chicken biryani and gongura goat biryani. Both are impeccable and delicious. The only concern is their spice, it is over the top and very spicy. Even a mild spice is very spicy for any regular spice eater too. 

Other wise this place is recommend for their improvement and maintaining the consistency. Hope they don't degrade."}
{"text":"Excellent dishes.  I would definitely recommend this place. The spice level is just right.  My husband says it is his new favorite."}
{"text":"We had a buffet lunch and ordered shrimp Biryani from menu. I'd say 90% of what we ate are \"authenticly spicy\". I can tolerate some level of spiciness so I enjoyed it with reservation. Even the custom ordered dish was spicy, even though I emphasized to the server that my toddler can not tolerate any level of spicy ness. I asked for zero level of spicy ness. So the rice came out fine, not spicy. How every The shrimps are very spicy. They gave you a yogurt side sauce to cool down. 

This is the same with Taste of Kerala. I think the cooks need to be given very specific instructions by someone knowledgeable of Indian spices to tell them to not use mustard seed oil, and whatever else ingredients that's spicy. 

The naan was very tasty, slightly crispy, almost had a bisque -feel to it. The shrimps curry was very flavorful, reminds me of Malay/thai curry sauce with shrimp paste.

My husband and toddler, if we were to come again,  would eat naan, curd rice, and the desserts."}
{"text":"Hands down Best Biryani in Phoenix Area ."}
{"text":"I would have give a 5 rating for just the chicken biriyani. But giving only 4 after having their bed biriyani.  
If you love biriyani, this is the best place in Tempe chandler area. 
But I Was a little disappointed that their veg is not as great as their chicken biriyani. They have only one type of veg biriyani too."}
{"text":"Tried chicken dum biryani and dum murg... it was amazing and closest to Hyderabadi biryani.. i recommend."}
{"text":"Repeat visit yesterday in just more than a month. Biryani portions are good sized. I hope they dont become the next restaurant that reduces the portions and eventually go out. There two types of tasty Biryani in India. One that is soaked with oil and other one that is just about done right that you dont see the oil at the bottom of the container. This one is the second type and is very tasty. The spice level is very misleading and it wasnt spicy enough for me. I was very worried about getting old and stale Biryani for dinner take out , but it wasnt. My 5 star is purely based on Biryani.

Ordered Chicken 65 but it looked more like Onion 65 with chicken around it.. The chef needs to understand we are ordering for the chicken and not for the Onion. I assume Gobi would have been the same with more onion.

Someone on Yelp complained about the cashier peeking when we tip for the to go order.. Yes..happened to me on two occasion. The guy keeps looking at the monitor to check what we are hitting. Last time , I intentionally hit no tip just to send a message to him."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Everything to both the chicken and goat curries served with the rice and the garlic naan were just amazing ! Creating that spicy balance ! The mango lassi was amazing as well! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Great place for Indian food. When most of the Indian restaurants are serving medicre food, Paradise has really stepped up their game. Awesome taste, great portions. I went in with my family and had a great exp. And have been regular every week (the lady at front desk would vouch for it :))."}
{"text":"Great service for sure!  The food is good, but don't order hot unless you can handle eating a jalapeno raw...whew!  Food came out really quick and is super fresh--a certain plus.
We had the butter chicken which was delicious, so we heartily recommend it.  Also had a chicken biryani which was good--and I did notice that the native S. Indian types eating there ordered it, too, so it must be the common dinner food in India.  It was good, but mine was to be mild but tasted medium.  
The dosa we ordered was really good.  Looks like a huge pizza crepe with spinach and potato in it and 3 different sauces to dip it in.
We liked the place.  The food was good, the service was, too.  We'll be back!

P.S.  You know the place is good if you are the only White people in there and the rest are natives of their country's area."}
{"text":"Natukodi fry, hot spicy pepper chicken, paradide special biryani are teh items to start with. Their lollipos are also pretty good. Couple of times the food was high on salt but most of the times it was good. Biryani is closest you can get to hyderabadi biryani in Phoenix.
Donot try shrimp biryani.
Initially when they opened the place was crowded and they kind of messy but now they are trying to get it together and maintaining the place."}
{"text":"Delicious spicy authentic yum yum. Went to the lunch buffet around 12:30 and it worked out perfectly. There is other eateries around here so the parking lot is packed during lunchtime. The service was kind and as I said before the food was divine. Will definitely go he again in the future!"}
{"text":"We got the food online. Delivery was fast and good but the biriyani was not very authentic . Especially don't order the special . The chicken and rice are cooked separately . And no salan was given."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed authentic dum biriyani... We packed Biriyani to go and enjoyed every morsel during our visit to the Grand Canyon National Park. A must visit for every subsequent trip to the city..."}
{"text":"My second visit for dine in during weekend... No chicken biryani available around 8pm...They did not let us know when we entered the restaurant and made us sit for 20min.A person came to take our order and informed us no biryani."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian place the curries are excellent and the naans here are the best naans that I've ever had. The appetizers are also very tasty and the presentation of all the dishes is also very nice. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a casual and tasty meal"}
{"text":"Service is awful. Don't go when you are really hungry ,Food is average but be prepared to wait ."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and was very surprised that it was empty. I don't understand.  The food is wonderful. One of the better Indian restaurants in the valley. I haven't had a meal that wasn't exceptional."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place to taste traditional South Indian food. Service and taste has degraded gradually and is worse now. Owners should seriously bring it up.

Staff has changed and is pretty decent now. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Very expensive and service is also not good
Not attractive totally different not looking like
Indian ."}
{"text":"We ordered food for my little one's birthday party and food was great. Received so many compliments from guests for their biryani, veg kadai and babycorn manchuria.
Thanks to Mahesh, manager at this restaurant for taking care and sending delicious food to the party..."}
{"text":"What an amazing place to eat. I saw a variety of meat and vegetarian items at their lunch buffet station. The main offerings on the buffet are changed up a bit everyday.  Some of the standouts are their goat biryani, chili chicken and potato 65.  At another station they offer various accouterments of sauces and fruit.  If you never had Indian food there is no better way to try it out than by going to a buffet.

I haven't been here for dinner service yet but will give it a shot soon. I would recommend getting there before 12:00 PM for the lunch buffet to get a seat.  It's a small restaurant so you could be waiting if you get there too late."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying how excited i was when i heard that paradise had come to the valley.
I drove a good 30 minutes from Scottsdale just to get a taste of my favorite biryani.
The Dum Biryani is something that Paradise always gets right but compared to the others in California especially Santa Clara this one is a let down.
It tastes nothing like the biryani one expects from a chain like Paradise (no fried onions and the flavor of the rice was just average).The Spice level i asked for was Medium but the biryani was too hot to handle.
The raita and mirchi ka salan were fine.This is not the quality one expects from Paradise,the biryani tasted like something you would get at an average Indian restaurant.

Definitely not worth the Drive or the Hype.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  I've eaten here many times and my wife loves it, and she hates anything the least bit exotic or out of her norm. It is very spicy so we order everything very mild. I love the gobi califlower and the goat.  The naan is very good and generous.  The staff is very friendly and the service is good.  My only complaint is they need more ice in the drinks.  Otherwise, if you're in north Chandler this is a great place to enjoy East Indian food."}
{"text":"This is quite a paradise for biryani. Everything else though was inconsistent. We are here for lunch on Sunday and ordered the veggie lunch combo and a chicken Madras. 

The veggie combo came out first but there was a significant wait for the chicken to come out next. The veggie combo comes with two types of rice (Vegetable biryani and vegetable fried rice), naan, 2 vegetable entrees, 1 appetizer, and a sweet treat. The rice was superb. It was soft, fluffy, and well seasoned. The vegetables I had in the combo were a baby eggplant curry, paneer tikka masala, and a paneer curry with onion and black mustard seeds. Out of the three savory selections my favorite was the paneer curry with onion, although I think some of the black mustard seeds were slightly burnt from cooking because they had a bitterness to them. The curry in the eggplant was not very flavorful and watery, and the paneer masala only had a few pieces of paneer in it. 

My favorite part of the meal aside from the rice was the sweet treat off to the side, a beet halwa. I loved the blend of spices, beet and butter. 

For $13 I don't think it was worth it to order this combo. It sounded like a lot of food but the entree items didn't have a lot of substance to them and the meal was loaded up on the cheap carbohydrate items as filler. I personally think that naan and 2 types of rice is too much carb to go with the rest of the food. They could probably do away with one of the rice dishes and charge less and it would be more of a balanced lunch.

As for the chicken Madras, it was served in a rich curry, with bone-like chicken. It automatically came with a side of white rice. 

Service was very polite and they were quick in refilling drinks and presenting our check.

If I go here again I would order a rice dish since that is what they seem to excel in and skip the lunch combos."}
{"text":"Mediocre Indian Food with minimum chicken or meat per serving. Mildly spiced. Confused staff."}
{"text":"This place has many Indian curry that is as good as the biryani. I had Andra chicken curry with extra spice and was good. We had Tangdi kababs that was simply amazing and a must try. This place will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Our dinner at Paradise biryani point was an unforgettable experience, worth the wait.

We started with some chilli chicken and paneer appetizers, which were delicious and reminded me of my favorite restaurants back in India.

For my main course we had ordered chicken biryani and I must say i wasn't disappointed and the mirchi ka salan was to die for.

5 stars for the delicious food and impressive service. Best biryani and starters in Arizona hands down."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the food and selection they got. Over 20 dollars plus tips. The service is good."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian,  please avoid the place they serve chicken manchurian for a paneer manchurian ."}
{"text":"On first visit here we decided to call in an order for take out. They told us the food would be ready in about 40 minutes. That was fine, but when we went to pick the food up they asked us to wait for another 15 minutes. That was a bit irritating, but what can you do? When we waiting in the restaurant I noticed there were 4-5 other people there, but nobody was eating and everyone was just sitting around. Maybe the kitchen got backed up?
Anyway, this place was not a good match for our family. The food was so spicy! It has to be some of the hottest food I have ever eaten. Our family tends to like more mild food and this was just too hot for us. The food had really good flavor though and the restaurant smelled really good. Too bad they can't make more mild versions of their dishes."}
{"text":"Very bad service for dine in. For take away orders, they put your call on hold for ten minutes and finally cut it. Food is often oily and not up to the mark. I have had many instances , will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this restaurant as a colleague of mine kept praising the Biryani he ate here.. 
Their food is tasty and spicy enough to satiate Indian taste buds who are used to hot food.. I tried their shrimp manchurian  and it was fantastic.. then came the chicken biryani and I must say it met the expectations I had with it.. 
There is a good amount of seating space inside the restaurant and it gives a posh restaurant sort of feel. The staff is extremely professional and available to make your dine in experience amazing. 

I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"We ordered Express lunch. It took so time but trust me it was worth a wait.  Express lunch menu was Biryani , Andhra Chicken, Chicken 65 and apricot for dessert and bread.  The food was cooked to perfection. I would really prefer this lunch rather than going to a buffet.  The quantity is optimal for lunch and taste yumm. Definitely going next time when k crave for yummy Indian food."}
{"text":"I am from Hyderabad and know what authentic Hyderabadi Biryani tastes like. This is definitely the place, in Cleveland. My fav was the goat biryani and mirchi ka salan was on point."}
{"text":"My husband & I came here for my birthday dinner recently. We've been wanting to try an Indian restaurant on the east side. It's an easy location to get to, & nice inside. There's a good happy hour of BOGO appetizers, so we got a cauliflower dish & samosa. Delicious! Then we ordered garlic naan, & chicken & biryani dishes. My husband ordered the chicken spicy while the biryani was regular. Both definitely had a nice spice flavor & was really good. We deinfitely had leftovers, which we never mind! The only downside was service was on the slower side considering we were one of 3-4 other tables during the course of our time there. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service is spot on. The flavors are evenly balanced and presentation is beautiful. We love this place and recommend it for anyone looking for a modern take on classic Indian cuisine. Have I mentioned the music...Telugu. Definitely check this place out. They do a lunch buffet and the prices rock."}
{"text":"BEST food ever!!! Will come back again and bring my friends too! Service was excellent and the establishment is clean and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Good place for delivery. 
Fast service and competitive pricing. 

They accept all credit cards. 
However, do not order anything uncommon in the menu."}
{"text":"Quantity of the biryani is very less, the taste of the Salan can be better. Overall this place needs lot of improvement."}
{"text":"Went in with very low expectations after reading previous reviews. But I was pleasantly surprised. We had a good experience. The service was decent , dint take very long. Food was good. Really liked the chicken biryani and malai kofta. Agreed they are still in the learning stages of a new place but the staff was courteous. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very good chain Indian food. However unlike most national chains the menu varies from one location to another. For instance in Malvern PA, Hakka noodles is not on the menu. The biryanis are excellent as is the rest of the menu. The service is a work in progress. Cash payment is a 5% discount."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend Paradise Biryani Pointe. The food was amazing and the restaurant was very clean and pleasant. Our waiter Uma Mahesh was very nice and friendly. Go try them out!"}
{"text":"I have become a fan of this place now especially for their biriyani and Gobi 65. My usual order is veg/egg biriyani and Gobi 65. Very tasty. Please keep in mind they cannot do mild so it is only medium and spicy. Even medium ends up on the spicier scale. They also have lunch combo option which is pretty awesome. You get so much quantity for the money. For example egg biriyani order can actually feed 3 ppl. They also have 3 eggs which is also coated with their spicy masala. Yummy. 
So if you are craving for some biriyani then this is the place."}
{"text":"A contender for my favorite Indian food. Some traditional North Indian fare mixed with some less-ordinary dishes. The weekend buffet had more choices (and more spicy choices!) than most. modern decor, and open late-ish. Plenty of vegetarian choices; I'm not yet sure about vegan.

5 stars reduced to 3 because I've received some of the worst service imaginable, multiple times. Didn't see any problem at first, but now my friends refuse to even go here anymore. I'm the only one left! I'll still go because I like the food, but stick to the buffet to avoid problems like: wrong order, wrong bill, food never brought, and all around failure to be courteous about their own mistakes. The first time was a surprise. The third time was a pattern."}
{"text":"Ordered a plain Naan and chicken curry, order should have been under $8 and somehow owner charged &12.88 and after opening the meal(to-go) here is how the naan looks like - broken pieces! Also chicken curry I ordered was made with egg curry masala.

I hate to say this but they won't be here for too long."}
{"text":"Food is fine, but take out quantities are dismal for the price. They charge the same for take out and eat in, but skimp on the quantity when you take out - 60-70% of what you get when you eat in the restaurant. Not sure what the problem is, but no way I'd go here again for this reason."}
{"text":"Had takeout at a friends house. Best Indian in Cleveland - hands down."}
{"text":"Amazing biryani and can't really get better than this.

Although the wait times were high early on, the service on my latest visit has improved leaps and bounds.

I definitely recommend visiting this place for biryani and appetizers along with the best mirchi ka salan ever!"}
{"text":"Ok so here I am in the restaurant and I like I said before it's a nice new place. The service is god awful. The staff are in street clothes, not sure who's a customer and who's staff. 

It was at least 5 minutes before we got menus. The \"waiter\" walks over, places pencil to paper and stands there. I guess that means he is ready to take our order? You're a waiter, use your words! 

Dirty water glasses, lipstick stained Pepsi glass. Some of my family got dirty silverware. Mine was fine. Makes me really wonder how clean they are keeping things around the food I eat?? Really disappointed."}
{"text":"I paid the bill! Thats all i can say!! 
Congratulations guys you have saved the food."}
{"text":"Best chicken dum biryani ever!! Must try!! Paradise special chicken dum biryani is finished with chicken 65 on top and that delicious as well!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Probably the best Indian Food in and around Cleveland. But the service is very poor. And it's been going down hill ever since. 

The food is amazing. The best biryani ever! I have never had anything from them that was bad be it chicken or mutton dishes, appetizers, noodles or the rice. 

The service is extremely bad. I have been there almost 5 times now at different times of the day and they are always slow. Slow to take the order. Slow to serve water. Slow to bring out the food or the check. 

You have to be really patient when dining here.

Best is to take food out and enjoy it in the luxury of your home, even with that make sure you order at least 45-60 mins ahead of time as they will say your order will be ready in 30 mins, but it will take at least 60 mins."}
{"text":"Not impressed, food was fair.   Asked for saag dish and they were out.  It's Saturday night and out of food....hmmmm.  My  husband liked it  

For the distance we drove to get here won't come back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time yesterday, I've never ordered dine in or through the application. We ordered the chicken biriyani and malai kofta. Dinner doesn't start till 6pm but the  phone line was turned off for more than 15 minutes after opening. Paradise is located in a small complex which can easily missed due to construction road blocks. It is in the same complex as Flying Saucer and Cookout. Veg and Chicken entrees are mildly priced but anything goat or seafood is mad expensive, they should consider bringing the price down. Our order came to about $28 including tax, pretty expensive.  

The biriyani itself was a good portion though there were 3 huge chunks of chicken that took up half the container it was served in. I wish they would consider a boneless chicken or remove the meat from the bones. In order for biryiani to be good, you HAVE TO order DOUBLE MASALA, SPICY. Dish can be pretty bland otherwise. It also comes with raita and some other sauce. The other sauce was too bland for me, I didn't like it. The malai kofta was very good, the sauce was creamy and on the sweet side as it should be. The actual dumplings themselves were also very good, came with 4 dumplings in the container. I wish more dumplings could fit or the price was reduced, this dish was pricey for the size. 

Will be trying more items from Paradise. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I rarely ever review and I'm usually the one who will look past a bad review and give a place a chance, but this place is seriously bad! 
Tiny portions other than the huge container of rice.
I think others mentioned- everything tastes the same and what you order isn't what you get. We ordered a butter chicken and it was a few pieces of stringy fatty chicken in some very watery curry sauce, so spicy and no sweetness or butteriness- hence \"butter chicken\"
We also ordered the spinach and cheese dish and though there was a green sauce, it tasted nothing like spinach and the texture was gross because there was no spinach texture, it was as if they threw spinach in the blender. 
The mango lassi was tasteless also and I didn't finish it because I felt it may give me a stomach ache. 
The rice was ok, but that's not why you go to an Indian resto. It probably has potential and I hate reviewing like this but I wanted to leave this for the people like me who usually look past a few bad reviews, this really isn't worth it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Very poor service. They can get five stars if they can improve their customer service and poor attitudes. Absolutely love the food but hate the service."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the valley... great taste!! 

Place could have been bigger for the number of crowd coming in."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Takeout is the way to go. That way, you get the good food and don't have to deal with their nasty service. They're almost always short staffed, rude, fussy and unaccommodating. I asked for Eggs in my Biriyani instead of chicken and the waiter said it was $2 per egg! HOW. It's not they serve organic eggs either. Clearly, the waiter didn't just want to give me what I asked. 

Garlic naan, paradise chicken curry, Andhra goat curry are my favorites here especially when I can just order them for takeaway. 

I wish you Phoenix had a legit Indian restaurant with good service!"}
{"text":"Taste wasn't the let down as much as the service and quantity of food served .
I had to ask the server if he had got only half of the order .
The ambience seems like it's a make shift arrangement .
Either the price should be reduced or the quantity should be increased.
U cannot run a restaurant on brand name with other better options available in close vicinity .
Will give it a try again just to make sure I wasn't there at one of those bad days ."}
{"text":"Preordered my food showed up when it was supposed to be done and they told me it would be a couple more mins... a couple mins turned into 45 and still no food. Very rude about the entire situation I will never step into this place again."}
