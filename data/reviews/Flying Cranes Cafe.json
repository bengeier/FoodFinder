{"text":"Walked in. Ordered an iced chai. It took twenty minutes for the cashier to pour chai mix over ice and hand it to me. There were no other customers. The drink cost almost 5 bucks.   Maybe the food is good, but there's no excuse for that kind of service."}
{"text":"Hot damn, that was a good bowl of ramen - the real deal, not anything like the stuff in the package. The food was delightful and the garden is gorgeous. This place is one of Cleveland's hidden gems. Don't quibble about the price - you get what you pay for, cheapskates."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant's on Larchmere!  I think I have been a frequent customer for over four years or more nowadays. Really enjoy the couple that owns the cafe. They always know I am taking my order to-go and are very friendly.  It's a small cafe with a decent menu. Everything from Japanese cuisine to quiches are on the menu. They even have hot pot if you are looking for that kind of meal! Call in advance for hot pot."}
{"text":"Our favorite brunch spot; the quiches are amazing, accompanied by fresh green salad w/ homemade dressing and fresh fruit. The garden is a perfect outdoor dining spot that will make you long for summer.  Take home some house made teriyaki sauce!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Only have had the udon noodles but need to go back soon. Great ambiance - super comfortable place to hang out and drink tea and eat delicious food. Want to come back and try the high tea and hot pot!"}
{"text":"I love it here. It is an oasis! In the summer, I recommend sitting in the back they have patio furniture and a plethora of plants. While you wait for supper you can sit back and relax and watch the squirrels and birds. Smell all of the beautiful flowers. They make the world's best mac and cheese! It is oven baked with a thick layer of cheese on top which forms a crust. There is a hint of nutmeg amongst the tangy cheeses. My mouth is watering thinking about it. They also serve it with salad and fruit. Yum! If you are in the Larchmere or Shaker Square Neighborhoods it is worth a visit."}
{"text":"The name is sweet, the location handy, and the ambiance okay, but the menu selection is uninspired (fake crab, for heaven's sake!), the portions minuscule, and the service polite but incompetent.  Refills on decaf coffee are $1.25, which is charmingly European and all, but annoying.  I feel kind of sorry for them, because they seem to want to be wonderful, but I am unimpressed.  At least it's quiet enough for a conversation.  One tip: turn the menu over if you want the more interesting selections. I didn't, and wound up with a tiny and boring salad. Enough people seem to like them that I'm not worried that I'll ruin their rep, though."}
{"text":"Interesting B&B with Japanese comfort food. Ramen is actually decent. They only have tonkotsu ramen but I was impressed."}
{"text":"The only place I could find in Cleveland for real Ramen, the Ramen is fresh and delicious contains all ingredients you would want and is worth every penny. For $12 you can get a large bowl of Ramen and a can of pop which unfortunately is pretty limited in choice. There aren't free refills on pop/soda but trust me you don't want to drink any soda before your food comes in since it is a sizeable portion of food; I am sure glad I didn't.   Overall experience was great especially that I got to eat outside in a nice garden and the atmosphere was peaceful and nice. The owners are nice and considerate even if other people did not have same experience I am sure glad I had a good one.   Perhaps people with the bad experiences weren't so nice to the owners.   The only reason I took one star off was for no refills and very limited choice of soda."}
{"text":"The Flying Crane is a stellar example of unassuming greatness. Their uncanny mix of Japanese and Western cuisine just works, because everything they put on their plate is delicious. The owners, a Japanese woman and her husband a Birtish man, are usually around and are always lovely to interact with.  Aoart from the food, what sets this restaurant apart from others is the absolutely gorgeous garden they have in the back. This place is an absolute treat in the summer. Go ahead, support this little neighbourhood restaurant- because it deserves it!  P.S. : Their Yakisoba is mouthwateringly delicious!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in the cafe was nice, a well as the hot chocolate and the iced mocha. However, the couple that works there have horrible customer service skills. We went in and try to engage in small talk but the older gentlemen just walked away, didn't ask if we needed any water along with our meal. And as we paid and went to leave, the lady stops us and asks us if we paid our bill! The couple needs to be more engaged in conversation with he customers and kept track of each other and who does what! I'm never coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"The food was awesome.  I had quiche that came with fruit and a salad,  it was so good.  My husband had the egg salad sandwich,  he also loved the meal and commented on how great the texture of the salad was.  We did not get to dessert but everything looked so good.  A much added bonus was the outdoor cafe area, so big, so nice, and a great mix of sun and shade... I wanted to take a nap there!  We will go back when we are in town."}
{"text":"I have been to the Flying Cranes Cafe many times since its opening in 2007 and I can attest that it's an awesome place to study, relax with friends, or chill with a book. As a Japanese-American living in Cleveland, it has been particularly exciting that the Flying Crane has come to the neighborhood. The menu is extensive and authentic and everything I've tried has been excellent. The portions are quite large and each dish looks and tastes like it was cooked and prepared with care. My personal favorites are the Teriyaki dishes (particularly the Salmon and Seared Tuna), Japanese Eggplant with lemon-ginger sauce, and Chicken Udon. I've tried many of the sandwiches and always enjoy the Chicken Salad Sandwich (sooooo good) and Naomi's Ultimate Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  The brunch is a really great deal with plenty of food. I've tried the Broccoli and Goat Cheese quiche and Ham and Split Pea Soup (both homemade) for brunch and they were delicious. If you are lucky in the summer and spring, you can snag a table in the beautiful garden. This past spring, I had a wonderful meal under the lush Wisteria canopy.  A group of friends and I recently tried the English High Tea, where we sampled a few different black teas as well as some biscuits and other treats. It was elegant and a really nice experience, and something I haven't seen offered at other places in Cleveland.  All in all, the Flying Cranes is a great cafe that has a lot to offer and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place with delicious food, relaxing atmosphere, and good value."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Flying Crane Café is cozy, the staff is friendly and the food is appealing to all of the senses..  Although the café has a fabulous selection of Japanese dishes, the soups and sandwiches are unmatched in their flavor and quality - I strongly recommend Naomi's Grilled Cheese (mozzarella, ham, lettuce, tomatoes topped off with homemade pesto on thick bread) with a side of Chicken Noodle soup and any dessert of your choice - they're all good!"}
{"text":"We love this local establishment- it is such a nice change of pace to the many chain restaurants, and a very cute and relaxing place to dine. In the warmer spring, summer, and early fall, the tea garden is available for patrons to dine it. It is simply gorgeous, relaxing- you can tell the owner spends a great deal of time manicuring the garden.   We have tried various entrees, and their Japanese dishes are authentic and delicious. We have tried the chicken teriyaki plate, grilled chicken sandwiches, yakisoba (Japanese pan-fried noodles), and udon (Japanese buckwheat noodles). All have been delicious. Oh, and the curry udon is fabulous! I have been to Japan, but haven't been able to replicate the flavors until coming to eat here.   The now serve brunch- it is a full course meal, but without feeling too heavy. Comes with coffee or tea (with free refills), soup, entree, fresh fruit, and a homemade cookie for dessert. Delicious!  The owner is Japanese, and her food tastes fabulous. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Fellow yelper @/\/\`/ and I met for a leisurely lunch at Flying Crane's Cafe this week. I won't speak for her (primarily because I'm sure she'll want to do that for herself!), but I got a quaint, \"weird old-person\" vibe. We talked about it feeling like someone's house. Which is kind of cool, but kind of odd, because you feel as though you're intruding on their really peaceful, non-busy day in order for them to make you a sandwich or arrange some really sweet fruit onto a plate for you.  Not that the owner seemed the least bit annoyed that we were there. It's just that, for the first 20 or 30 minutes, we WERE the only people there. We sat in the garden, took in the atmosphere, and talked for a good 10 minutes about what this place reminded us of and what was unique about it.   It's in a neighborhood that I'd never visited before (Larchmere), which is kind of an oddity in and of itself. I enjoyed walking around before and after we met at Flying Crane. It kind of gave me deja vu; even though I knew I had never walked on that particular street before, it had a sense of familiarity to it.  So why only three stars? Well ...  For one, the food is way too overpriced for what you get. I got an iced chai (not terrible, but I've had way better at Loop for example) and aforementioned fruit platter -- which had a total of maybe 15 pieces of artistically arranged fruit -- and spent $9.75. @?/\/\`/ had chicken salad on a bed of greens and while it looked good, it was small, and it too was pricey. I guess what you're paying for is atmosphere and the added benefit of a garden setting. Which brings me to complaint #2 ...  ANTS! And a lot of them. Yes, we're outside, I get it. But there was an ant in my hair when we left, and I'm not too down with that.  So I'm glad we went, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  Now, the place down the street selling antique rugs for 30% off ... I may have to return just to check some of those out!"}
{"text":"Flying Cranes has wonderful, traditional Japanese soups, but the cheap lunchmeat used on sandwiches causes me to give it a less that favorable review.  In addition, the man that works behind the counter does not understand customer service and is extremely rude."}
{"text":"An amazing place for a slow paced weekend brunch, or an amazingly comforting plate of teriyaki tofu. Make sure to check out the garden out back. Felt like being in the French quarter courtyard in New Orleans."}
{"text":"I've been a bit lazy with my coffee shop explorations the past few months. I don't know what it is about warm weather, but I'm ready to try some new spots! On Wednesday I met up with my friend RBJ who is at home during the day (when not at coffee shops) with her baby daughter. Neither one of us had been to Flying Cranes Café on Larchmere near Shaker Square. Flying Cranes Cafe is not a coffee shop, but I'd heard it has a nice garden to enjoy a glass of iced coffee. We had no trouble finding on street parking for the café around noon. As first timers, we were super confused on what to do. What is it about walking into a new restaurant or café that can through you for a loop when it comes to seating yourself or placing an order? We wanted to sit outside but it took a few tries at communication with the owner to figure out we had to order inside and he would bring out our food. I think we were all frustrated, including him, by that interaction. I had intended on just ordering some iced coffee as this was a scheduled coffee date, but I had a crazy morning and didn't have time to eat lunch before I left. I ordered the chicken salad on a salad, one of my favorite lunches. The salad was the perfect size for me and delicious. The chicken salad had more of that mushy, creamy consistency, rather than a chunked chicken consistency. I did feel like I paid a lot for what I got. I don't think that a man would have been satisfied with it's size. But, I was full after I ate it, so I can't complain. I also ordered an iced tea, as I can't drink iced coffee with food (very important info for me to share, I know). My iced tea had mango juice in it! Let me repeat, my iced tea had mango juice in it! I had to ask for this variety, and I was glad it was offered because I don't think iced tea that isn't sweet is much of a treat.  The back garden looks like someone's backyard with a ton of patio seating options. Both of us commented on the \"homey\" feeling of the experience. It is quite lovely and we were joined by a handful of other patrons throughout our stay. We selected a patio table in the back portion of the garden, on mulch and under a canopy of flowering climbing greenery. I know you sort of have to accept the elements when you dine outside, but we felt a little invaded by ants. I had to flick one from her hair as we were leaving. I'm sure this had something to do with the fact we were seated on the mulched section of the yard."}
{"text":"Bf and I went on Saturday just before noon. We were the only two in the restaurant. I ordered the pork ramen, he ordered the ginger pork. The owner (older gentleman) explained that everything was made to order and it would be \"just a few minutes\". Our food came out 20 min later. I didn't really mind waiting but I imagine that if there had been more people in the restaurant, things could start to really take forever to come out.  On to the food: I appreciate the portion sizing- it really is just right. You won't be taking home leftovers, but you won't leave hungry either. The pork ramen was ok, not outstanding. Broth could have been more flavorful, and the noodles were mushy like when you cook instant ramen and leave it on the stove for slightly too long. The ginger pork was very tasty and the balance of flavor was just right.  I want to go back and try the yakisoba and katsu don and maybe their brunch menu sometime. And I'd like to give the ramen another shot, they don't have to change much to make it so that Clevelanders have access to at least one acceptable bowl of ramen!"}
{"text":"LOVE The Crane!! Definitely one of my favorite local eateries. I usually go for the home-style Japanese dishes but the soups and sandwiches are great as well.   The garden outside is a great place to sit and relax but make sure the chair cushions are dry before you sit down!!"}
{"text":"I am saddened by this review.  Captivated by the idea of finally getting a great bowl of ramen in Cleveland, I ventured across town to check out what others have been talking about.  Perhaps my expectations were too high, after enjoying NYC's Ippudo (wow, that is some amazing stuff) earlier last year.  http://nearme.seriouseats.com/venue/ippudo  Flying Crane is located about a block or so away from Shaker Square in a small storefront.  It is pretty cute- like a coffee shop, very different from what I'd expect a Japanese restaurant to be.  I ordered a ramen with pork belly and my friend ordered a rice bowl.  Prices weren't bad- $10 for the bowl of ramen.  I ordered another one to bring home to the Wife.  I was hoping to get a nice big bowl of rich, deeply flavored broth with chewy, plentiful noodles and perhaps a dallop of oil slicking the surface.  Perhaps a flavorful piece or two of grilled pork belly or something like that.  That's what I got for $14 at Ippudo.  Instead I got a medium sized bowl filled with noodles which were not that much better than good quality instant ramen.  The broth was, for me the most disappointing part, really not much better than what I could get from (again) a good instant ramen.  None of that, \"whoa, THAT's why people love ramen in Japan feeling.\"  When we were done with our meal, the owner brought a small bowl of pickles.  They were nice, but it would have been more helpful to have them with our food.  My friend's rice bowel was also \"meh\" and my wife agreed with my take on the ramen.    It pains me to leave a three star review, because I suspect this place can do it better, but I have to write what I eat.  Maybe I'll try it again in the future if I'm ever in the area, but I won't drive all the way there again."}
{"text":"I came here for the ramen that was so raved about below. Although the owner was pleasant and very accommodating the soup failed to awe me. We did however enjoy the curry udon. It was quaint and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Very mixed experience. There were 3 tables present, which seemed to completely overload their service. (My entree came 15 minutes after my partners). The appetizer (gyoza) was delicious, but they forgot the to bring the dipping sauce until we had eaten all but one of the gyoza. My entree (mac and cheese) was so overcooked that the pasta had melted into gloop, and was nearly unedible. My partner's katsu-don was good but slightly overcooked.  Really had high hopes after the gyoza, but the rest of the meal was either mediocre or outright terrible (and the price point was frankly a bit high, even if the food had been executed well). Combining the food with the poor service (which I could understand if they were slammed, but they weren't even half full), we won't be back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars. The food was great to okay: the grilled cheese left something to be lacking--rather bland, but the quiche was out of this world, so decadent and rich. The drink options are extensive: from smoothies to teas to fun fizzy drinks, but the service was poor. Every question we asked the server she had to shout over to the owner by the counter. In such a small cafe, the experience would have been greatly improved if you just ordered at the counter."}
{"text":"i love this place. the food is delicious, the atmosphere is perfect, and the owners are adorable. my only complaint is that you never know when they're going to be open. their posted hours are more like suggestions. sometimes, you can call and tell them that you want something to eat (they live above the store, so they're usually around), but other times, it's clear there's no one there.  if you're in the area and they're open, GO! just don't make plans and get your hopes up!"}
{"text":"One word to describe this cafe? ADORABLE!   The ramen, outdoor seating, cute British and Japanese owners just make this place a worthwhile visit :) I've been here a few times, and have only gotten the pork ramen. Why? Because it is THAT good! The broth is very savory, with just the perfect amount of seasoning. I definitely recommend this if you're a first timer!   If you come here during the warmer times, sit outside in their patio! The patio looks like someone backyard! You can definitely tell that the owners pour their hearts  into taking care of the beautiful flowers and plants :)   Another perk about this place is that they serve high tea! Yes, we can  be fancy in Cleveland too :) It's $22 per person, and you must reserve 1 week ahead of time so they can prepare everything for you. I'm definitely trying this next time!"}
{"text":"I just read Rachel B's review and definitely agree. It's kind of cool that it's a cute little place but then again it's so small that you do get the feeling that you're intruding. The food was pretty good. We got the chicken teriyaki and ginger pork on rice. It was really cold that day. I would like to try out the garden sometime. I'll probably be back again and write another review."}
{"text":"This is a cute, quaint little cafe along the main stretch of shops in Larchmere. They have a lovely garden patio out back, though both times I've been there, I've eaten inside.   The food is cafe/lunch food and features some Japanese dishes such as gyoza and ramen. They also have a good selection of cafe drinks that includes genmaicha tea and matcha lattes.   On my most recent visit there, I ordered a Japanese salad ($10) and a pot of genmaicha tea ($4). While I enjoyed both of these, I felt as though they were a little overpriced.   One tip if you use the bathroom there: it is located downstairs and you have to turn on a light to be able to see your way down the stairs. I didn't realize that the light was located on the wall before you open the door to the stairwell, so I almost tried to find my way there in the dark!  Overall, while I enjoyed my lunches there, I can't say that there was anything that I would particularly go back for considering the other lunch spots in the area with similar offerings."}
{"text":"Flying Cranes Cafe is a lovely little restaurant that I discovered during my search for ramen in Cleveland. It is run by a married couple, consisting of an (I'm guessing based on his accent) European man and his wife, who is Japanese. This explains why the dichotomy of their menu that serves both quiches and ramen.  The Food: +Ramen: This is not the most amazing ramen I have ever had, as the broth is a simple chicken base. However, it is authentic, and gives a comforting and homey tastes. I would say this is the best ramen I have had in Cleveland. It also comes in a generous portion! The first time I came here, the bf had made a special request for more noodles, which we found were unnecessary after the food came out. +Brunch: You pick an entree, and it comes with a soup (there were 2 options given), salad, and a cookie. Again, not the most amazing food I've ever had, but hearty and comforting.  The service can be quite slow, but I honestly don't really mind it. This is the kind of place that you come to just sit and enjoy yourself slowly. Plus, the owners are very friendly and they were very accommodating towards our requests!"}
{"text":"WOW, what a fantastic Cafe! It is so rare to find authentic Japanese food, and the owner is from Japan and has been serving these dishes ever since her children were very young. I've ordered numerous entrees there, and I love the variety. I really get tired of the burgers/steak/sandwich routines, and I love there are different kinds of food here- and not one  item has yet to disappoint me. Don't miss this gem of a place  I enjoyed sitting in the back garden with the pretty flowers and trellis. It was intimate and relaxing."}
{"text":"This is a charming cafe where you can receive high quality service, enjoy an intimate setting, and taste delicious and authentic food! I have only visited Flying Cranes once but I definitely plan to go back soon! My boyfriend tried the ramen and was obsessed. I had the teriyaki salmon. I couldn't believe the flavor and the texture of the salmon! It was true perfection. Because it was just the husband and the wife that own the cafe, the food did take a little while to come out but with the extremely high quality, I'd say it was well worth the wait! I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Somewhere way beyond the spectrum of hipster coffee and ultramodern lounge exists Flying Crane's Cafe. Time seems to stop in this eclectic little world -  surrounded by pastel awning striped-wallpaper and large potted plants, what could go wrong?   Cleveland is one of the last places I would have expected to find a fusion of British and Japanese comfort foods, but the couple running this joint clearly knows how to appeal to the heart and taste buds. I was intrigued the moment I spotted legitimate-looking pictures of ramen on the Yelp page. We found street parking on Larchmere and I had a good feeling about the location, which I hoped extended to the destination. Every second I spent inside, and the more strange facts I learned about Flying Crane, the more I felt at home. Which made more sense when I found out that the owners are also running a bed and breakfast out of this quaint space.   I mentioned ramen. But this is merely the tip of the multicultural food pyramid here. Scan down the menu and you'll see quiches, katsu sandwiches, lemon tarts, donburi, egg salad and green tea lattes. I haven't even gotten to the best part yet. Japanese style hot pot and English High Tea. Yes. You heard me - the best of both worlds in one cozy room. With advance notice, of course.   The adorable chef brought out our food herself, clad in smiles and a much used apron. I unfortunately only had the pleasure of tasting their Champon Ramen (an umami festival in slurpable form), and the Regular Ramen (a little too salty for my taste, but still good). But judging by all the regulars coming in and out, the rest of the menu has a seal of approval and Flying Crane can add me to their list of fans."}
{"text":"We came here to try the ramen, and we were very happy with what we had. The broth was very delicious, the noodles had nice textures, and the pork belly was delicious. The eggs were a little more done than what we like, but it's definitely not over-cooked.   The owners were also very friendly and nice. We definitely will come back and try more items on the menu, as everything looked delicious."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for the first time on a Wednesday night and ordered the terriyaki chicken plate. Now, at $8.50 this is a dollar or so higher than you standard terriyaki plate should run you, and I should know, I love terriyaki plates.  What you get is a good value on your money though. It was as though each piece of chicken was breaded and fried up just for me, which is different from your traditional grilled turkey thigh/breas smothered in terriyaki glaze. This joint had it's own sauce, which was actually pretty good, and the chicken was of a high quality too. The portion was smaller than I like, and the salad that is included was well presented, but thin.(The cutely cut my one slice of cucumber, and two tomatoes)  They Miso soup for $2, which sounds like a fabulous deal, because I also love miso soup.  The owner, is a friendly british chap in what I'd guess is his 50s. The place has a down home feel to it, the opposite of loathsome chain restaurants.  I look forward to trying other dishes from this slightly pricey cafe, and at this stage, would be glad to recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Beautiful garden, food is individually prepared like home cooking. However, owner is very uptight and makes me feel as if I'm going to be in trouble if I do mas much as move a chair out of place or, God forbid, ask for something like sugar or ketchup. I feel bad for the one waitress who works there. Also, somehow meal ends up being really pricey after you add up all the alacarte this and that. I can't recommend going back."}
{"text":"I think the ambiance of this place is better suited for brunch - which I think it is known for.  The food was good - no alcohol, though - but you can bring your own."}
{"text":"Real Mom and Pop operation, and that's a good thing.  Great fusion of English (Pop) and Mom (Asian).  Nice vibe, relaxing, good food (soups and quiche not to be missed), coffee/tea... great weekend Brunch spot."}
{"text":"Initially was a big fan of this place, and the curry katsu plates we got there. Until we went back a few times, and then it all went downhill. The second time we went, the curry was cold. The third time we went, the curry was lukewarm and crusted over, like it had been sitting out for quite awhile. The last time we went, we waited 30 minutes for drinks (cans with cups of ice), and an hour for the curry katsu plates that were, this time, terrible and salty and, again, lukewarm.   Like the other reviewer said, there's no excuse for this kind of service. It's also pretty expensive for what it is. Definitely wouldn't recommend, unless you were going when there are no other customers at all.. that's how it was the first time we went and it was pretty great. But if you go during lunch hour or something and there are other people around.. forget about it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the regular ramen so much. First time that I basically finished the whole bowl. The broth was perfectly seasoned, perfect amount of Pork belly that wasn't too fatty, and perfectly cooked egg. Loved it!  Also enjoyed some matcha tea. I would love to return for brunch one weekend"}
{"text":"Sorry. They really let me down when I was there about a month ago...  Food was not that great, so I would rate it expensive for what it is.  I had the chicken udon, and was really disappointed when I got what looked like a bowl of spaghetti with boiled chicken in a plain broth.  I paid for this? I've had udon before, and that is not it.  The couple who run the place may be charming, but with the reception I had I felt like I was in their home and in their way.  Didn't get great points this time for customer interaction.  Everyone can have an off day, sure.  Running a kitchen is stressful.  And I want to like this place.  It has so many qualities that I admire -- homey and unique, beautiful garden in back, and a simple but interesting menu.  But the experience was really lacking, overall a bummer.  I'm rooting for them to improve."}
{"text":"What an adorable little place.  The owners are kind and the welcoming atmosphere makes this a great spot to enjoy a hot beverage and anything from quiche to udon on their diverse menu.  I enjoyed the champon ramen with pork broth, vegetables and shrimp.  It's not like the ramen you would find in Chicago or New York but it was flavorful and perfect for a cold wintery Cleveland night.  I'm looking forward to taking my kindle with me and enjoying a latte and pastry sometime soon."}
{"text":"This elegant cafe on Larchmere is a bit of London by way of Tokyo in Cleveland. So it's a wonderful oddity. It's quiet and cozy, the food is delicious, and the presentation is really very lovely. I really enjoyed the quiche."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Japanese / English restaurant. The owner is English and married to a Japanese woman. I got the ramen which cured my upset stomach and my girlfriend got the teriyaki chicken. Both were top notch. I recommend it highly if you're in the area."}
{"text":"It's Ok.  Didn't know if it was a British tea room or Japanese noodle café.  Very nice people but service was a little akward.  The 5.00 \"corking\" fee is lame.  I bought a 7.00, twist off bottle of wine from Marcs and with the \"fee\" it costs me 12.00...and I don't even like wine.  I got a twist off for that very reason as to not put anyone out.  Both things we had were Ok.  The rice dish had very little flavor and the curry noodle dish tasted just like boiled noodles and the S&B curry cooking blocks I make at home.  33 dollars for 2 bowls of soup and I even brought my own booze in.  A bit much, Im thinkin'.  I could make it at home for about 6.00.  Very nice people and nice place but I cant see spending that.  I know a lot of other Yelpers think that's totally normal but they smoking crack.."}
{"text":"Exceptional Japanese comfort food in the Cleveland area. This place is definitely a hidden gem, and the best place to get ramen in Ohio. I've had ramen at Menya and Tensuke Market in Columbus. I've also had ramen at Pacific East and Noodlecat in Cleveland. The ramen here surpasses all these other places. The broth is really good, and has a lot of depth without using excessive amounts of MSG.   For all my raving about the ramen though, the best dish the restaurant serves is definitely chicken teriyaki. I normally don't order chicken teriyaki at Japanese restaurants, but this place's teriyaki excels. The chef makes her own unique teriyaki sauce, and the preparation is very good as well - using just enough sauce to give the chicken and rice a kick instead of drowning the dish in teriyaki sauce.   The other unique feature of this restaurant is that it is the only restaurant I know of in northeast Ohio (as of this review) that serves okonomiyaki. You have to order it 2 days in advance, and as it was my first time going here I have not tried it yet. I definitely plan on trying the okonomiyaki at my next visit."}
{"text":"Would rate a zero if I could. Service is terrible and you can tell it's very unsanitary. I almost felt bad for the staff because the owner was just treating them poorly. There were only three people in the restaurant dining but the staff were already overworked and my tip didn't go to the waitress just the owners. Food was mediocre, not coming back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding up because I am putting my foot down as the yelper in the relationship.  Here's the thing.  This place has gone and done it, and has totally torn us apart.    I ordered the ramen and I was absolutely flabbergasted.  It was very good!  Full-flavored and cooked with authentic ingredients, not too salty, not too sweet.  And the broth had a terrific aftertaste as I expect from good ramen.  I never expected anything like this to exist in Cleveland and I was ready to give this place a five, hands down, for filling the ramen void in my life.  She ordered the kakiage-don, a traditional japanese rice bowl with tempura vegetables.  She hated it.  Thought it wasn't authentic (I do admit, it wasn't really), did not have any real substance to it, and did not taste particularly special.  She did not finish it - though I did, and thought it was still a well-flavored rice bowl.  She wanted to give this place a two.  Long story short, I guess I'll be coming here by myself from now on.  Or perhaps with some fellow yelpers who would also like to try this amazing ramen?  I didn't have any issues with the service as other people have mentioned, but the portions are very small considering the prices.  I think the ramen is definitely worth it though."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the flying crane cafe! The chicken teriyaki and the tofu teriyaki are cooked to perfection. We have also enjoyed the yakisoba, oyako-don, and pork katsu curry. Be sure to get a pot of tea and to finish your meal off with a snickerdoodle!! The prices are good, the food is high quality, and if the weather is good you MUST sit on the back patio. Its beautiful and well landscaped. Perfect spot for a relaxing delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Flying Cranes - the food is fresh and delicious.  Such variety too!  Obsessed with their chicken salad and the miso soup!  My boys beg me to take them there for the mac-n-cheese!  The garden out back is the prettiest in all of Cleveland, and just so relaxing!  You can BYOB so going there for lunch today with some wine!  Then we are going to shop at the antique stores...so fun! Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So far I think this is a cute small shop.  They have 4 - 4 seater tables and 3 - 2 seater tables.  There is one couch in the back corner with a cute little basket weaved table for people who want to chit chat with their cup of coffee.  Some tables are very close together so there isn't much chair moving or elbow space.   There is no server here, so you need to come to the front counter and grab your menu and order up.  Once you order you can then choose whatever table you would like, in accordance to what is available.  This place fills up quickly so slim picking for some of you.   Now the wait. We ordered Ramen and Udon and we definitely had to wait awhile basically 30-40 minutes until we got our food.   Once we got our food it was pretty darn good.  The Ramen was delicious and they give you a generous portion of noodles.  The broth was on point and delicious since you can actually taste some flavor from the pork belly!  I just wish they gave us options for a bigger bowl since that was the only thing I was craving.  The pork belly was nicely sliced into bite size pieces so a knife was not necessary nor was it salty which made it fabulous!  The Udon was a total disappointment according to my guest.  He stated that it tastes exactly like the instant Udon mix that he usually buys from the Asian stores.   Overall 4 stars on the food and service!  Also, before I forget, you guys can also bring your own wine if you would like, just pay the cork fee.  They provide options to eat some dessert and have some coffee as well."}
{"text":"Cute family owned store! The set up is definitely a huge appeal here...and you know your food is home cooked!   Very eclectic menu which I'm intrigued to try...it ranges from udon to curry chicken  to shepherd's pie to smoothies to  mac and cheese. I tried the ramen which was pretty good, especially on a cold snowy day. The meat itself (I got pork belly) wasn't that great. But the rest of it was tasty.  I'll def be back, but will probably try something else besides ramen on the varied menu.  They are BYOB which could be fun for brunch!"}
{"text":"Why oh why didn't I discover you sooner?  I am in love with this small cafe.  It is a quaint owner operated digs with maybe 7 tables (and a couch).  I was there for dinner and ordered the udon and teriyaki chicken.  YUM!  It reminded me of the small restaurants out in the San Fran area.  I was definitely impressed.  Price was great and service was lovely.  I can't wait to go back and try their English tea service, coffee, or desserts.  It is lovely to have this place in the area."}
{"text":"The owners were super nice and helpful! I ordered the ramen and the noodles were good bu the broth was not complementary to the noodles because of the weak flavor.I enjoyed my experience there because we ate outside in the garden and the bed and breakfast looked super cute."}
{"text":"Have you ever seen a man shake in anger? Well I forgot that he had mentioned the 1 check rule for 6+ people and asked for individual checks. He proceeded to berate me for what he had told me earlier on the phone and basically made the entire table super awkward as he literally shook in anger. I told him I had just forgotten and said no problem, I'll just pay but really was that necessary? Food and all is great but this kind of service is really a terrible way to start a weekend."}
{"text":"My wife, a few friends, and I went here finally.  It had been on my list for so long and I was not disappointed.  I give a 4-star rating to great places that have a few downsides to them but overall provide excellent food/service.  The FC is a very small, warm place to be.  The British guy was so kind and helpful.  As far as service goes, the couple who owns it seems to be the only people who work there.  This means that even when only a few tables are full there will be a moderate wait time.  We were the 3rd table and we had to wait ~20 minutes, which isn't crazy long, but it's not that fast.  After getting our food we quickly realized that the wait is worth it.  I got the pork ramen and my wifey got the katsu.  Both were delicious!  This was my first time having real ramen but my friend agreed that it was pretty dang delicioso!  The broth was so yummy and everything was awesome.  The bottom line is that if you want some delicious food you can't go wrong here at the Flying Crane... Unless you're in a hurry.  Don't come here when you're rushed cause it'll spoil an otherwise awesome experience."}
{"text":"Flying Crane, why have I never heard of you before?  Stopped here on two occasions- the first time with a co-worker, the next time with the bf.   Nestled on the end of Larchmere, you wouldn't expect Flying Crane to be a Japanese place. Or...well, the place it is. It's a small little cafe with plants all over the windows, attached to this hip, cool little gift shop in the back.  And it's homey. Five stars for the homeyness.  I've had a dream for a while- when I retire, I want to own a cafe, where I'm that little old lady, making awesome coffee and has the pie in the glass case. When people I know stop in, I'll get them their \"usual\", slice them a piece of pie, and talk about life.   And this is how Flying Crane was.   There's this little old Japanese lady who bustles over to your table to take your order. And her partner? A little old British man. A British chap, is more like it.   And it was cute- old friends always stopped by on both occasions I was there, saying hello in Japanese or whatever, striking up conversations with the owners. Ooooh so cute.  And the food was so... comforting. And so homey. Sure, it's not the super best quality of udon/noodles you're going to get, but hey, it's good, not starchy, and just overall.....tastes like a home cooked meal.  I've gotten the curry udon, which I definitely recommend (wasn't too much curry, the noodles were cooked well, the broth was good) and the yakisoba (also very good, not too much oil, cooked well). My dinnermates have gotten the ramen and other udons, and they all comment how good it is. My bf and I even got an oatmeal cookie out of that glass case...just to get one out of a glass case. haha.  It's cute. Like reallllllyyyyy cute. Like, I want to be that little old lady behind the counter someday. Definitely my type of cafe."}
{"text":"Flying Crane's is definitely a hidden gem in Cle!  I have been craving japanese ramen like crazy recently and my bf and I have visited so many noodle shops/japanese restaurants recently and have always left with deep sorrow and disappointment. Today, we stopped by Flying Crane's after extensive online research and decided to give it a try.  This cafe is right around the corner of shaker square and it doesn't look that crazy at the first sight and definitely not what I expected it to be, like other asian stores, filled with japanese decors. Instead, the cafe is owned by an old couple - a japanese (I assume!) woman and a white guy. The lady was making her japanese ginger and the guy greeted us. The cafe sells lots of handmade bakery stuff and the guy was also making some breakfast per orders. The store smelled like chocolate cookies. Only three or four tables were around in the store. We looked at the menu and ordered the regular ramen and the champon ramen. He told us the patio was also open today so we walked through a narrow alley and found the back yard. It was a gorgeous backyard. There were some people hanging out there and we found a quiet corner and sat down under the vine trees. It was a sunny day and I felt so relaxed just sitting there, enjoying the flowers around me and the sun, while waiting for my ramen to come.   After waiting for a while, probably 15 or 20min or so, our ramen finally arrived! By just looking at the presentation, I already knew it was going to taste really good. The eggs were hard boiled eggs, sliced in half, placed in a way that egg yoke was facing up. Pork was also sliced and placed on top lying flat. A piece of seaweed was placed on top of the noodles with some green onions floating there. Exactly what I expected it to be. I took a big bite of the ramen. The texture was also exactly what I expected to be! Not too hard but also not too mushy. Very chewy and tasted just right. The regular ramen's broth although does not have the classic milky color or the classic japanese savory flavor, it was delicious. I was so happy that I finally found a place that serves decent japanese ramen!  I also liked the champon ramen - it has shrimp, mushroom, some baby cabbage, as well as eggs and seaweed. This one's broth does has the milky color but tasted more like hotpot broth.  For just $10 in Cleveland, you can get a bowl of pretty-good-quality home-made japanese ramen, I would say it totally worth the money and worth the wait. Plus, the owners are so nice and they are never gonna kick you out if you decide to chill in the gorgeous backyard for a whole afternoon. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"At long last, a restaurant that serves inexpensive non-sushi Japanese food, much like what real Japanese people eat most of the time.  This seems to be the closest Cleveland equivalent to Yoshinoya's on the west coast, except not fast food and much better.  I ordered the unagi don, broiled eel on rice, a typical summer dish.  The meal came with miso soup and a small salad, for about $10. My companion ordered the oyako don, chicken and egg on rice, another typical Japanese dish.  The rice in the unagi don was a little soft, and the soup was a little salty, but unlike many Japanese restaurants in this area the cook clearly understood authentic Japanese food.  In the garden seating area, we could actually see the plants where tomatoes for the salad were growing.  I'm coming back next time I'm at Larchmere.  Good, healthy, inexpensive food is hard to find, and this place tops my list in that category."}
