{"text":"Metcalfe's is usually where I end up grabbing something if I've forgotten to pack it when I'm flying out of Madison. They've got a small variety of bottled drinks, snacks, and pre-made items like salads and wraps. Things are a little on the pricy side, but that's not surprising considering it's 1) Metcalfe's, and 2) a store in the airport. If I remember right water is $2.79 and on par for the other vendors in the airport. My biggest issue has, in fact, been finding prices for the items - they aren't always labeled. The stand isn't anything to get excited about, but it's nice to have if you want something between restaurant food and a bag of chips."}

{"text":"There aren't many places to eat at the airport in Madison, but I doubt I would return here. The list of sandwiches was much longer than the one across the way at Ancora, so it seemed like a more attractive menu, but the service on our visit was incredibly slow. Maybe we just came at a busy time, but the line crawled along, and they kept submitting people's orders wrong. After we eventually got our correct order (the chicken parmesan panini), the sandwich itself (a breaded chicken patty on ciabatta with a slice of cheese and some tomato sauce heated in a panini press) was just okay and didn't have much flavor, and was also not very large in size. I could make better at home for far less than $11, but they can get away with charging that when there aren't many choices at the airport. Some of the packaged snacks do seem to be slightly cheaper than Ancora though, so if the line is short or empty, that might be worth it. I wouldn't wait for a sandwich again though."}
