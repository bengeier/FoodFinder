{"text":"I ordered a foot long sub and an Antiposto salad from them today and it was wonderful. I chose to have it delivered and they were super quick! The staff over the phone and the delivery man were super friendly. The best part is I paid about $12 and I was shocked at how much food they brought. I would highly recommend them!"}

{"text":"So far I'm not impressed, mainly with my interaction over the phone after ordering on GrubHub.  I called at the end of the delivery window because I thought I might have heard a knock at the door and wanted to make sure they didn't already try to deliver, most deliveries to my house take a little longer so that wasn't the big issue.    When I called the man immediately started talking about how it will be out in three minutes and that GrubHub doesn't allow them to change the delivery window, which that's why I thought I provided my number, so someone could call in case of a change.  I tried to explain that I was just making sure they didn't already try to deliver but was constantly interrupted by the man who kept going back to GrubHub not allowing them to change the delivery time and that it would be ready for delivery in three minutes, regardless of what I was try to explain or ask.    I had called at the end of my delivery time, which was 55 minutes.  My food showed up 40 minutes after that.  I ordered one bacon cheeseburger and one order of the Philly fries and I live 4 miles away.  Not to mention pre-tipping $3 on a $10 order.  My food arrived luke warm, the burger was a bit colder though.  The meat is tasted a frozen patty and the bacon wasn't really flavorful either.  I don't think the meat was seasoned.  The Philly fries also needed seasoned despite the steak and pepper toppings.  They also tasted a bit weird because I used to mozzarella, not cheddar on Philly items.  All in all, I am quite disappointed with every aspect of this place.  To top it off when the delivery guy did arrive, instead of looking at the large map as he drove into the complex, he called me from the leasing office and had me give him directions.  I have never had another delivery person do that, at ANY of the apartments I've lived in.  The only good thing is that it's relatively cheap, but the food seems to reflect the price.  1/5"}
