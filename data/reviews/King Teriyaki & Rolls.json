{"text":"Today is my second & LAST time coming to this place! I'm extremely disgusted that the woman handling the register also handled my food with the SAME GLOVE she just grabbed cash with. We waited 45 mins to get our order of 1 masubi & 2 burritos. We didn't mind the long wait as much but I saw the lady making faces at me, she doesn't realize that I saw her do it. When she gave me the food, I said to her \" Next time please don't handle the register & my food with the same glove please\" she taps my shoulder with the same glove & says ok. I will never return, what type of place is this! Someone can get sick from CONTAMINATION! I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW DISRESPECTFUL THIS \"Business\" was today!! Absolutely no respect for they're customers! The food was paid for but we threw it away, we couldn't eat it after what I just saw. I don't want to get sick. What a waste of money!! We drove to another sushi place, they are worth the money! We will NEVER eat at King Teriyaki ever again!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki plates/bowls are not complex cuisine, so the details of execution can be a big difference maker.  Both the Poke bowl and Teriyaki Chicken bowl had well prepared rice and proteins with the Poke bowl being the standout.  I appreciate the additional teriyaki sauce being served on the side rather than drowning the bowl in sauce as you find some other places.  Jackpot Roll also seemed well executed and is suited for those who have specific interest in salmon tempura.  A highlight for me was the presence of real crabmeat on many of their roll offerings - this is a rare find!  I look forward to trying some of their other rolls and non-traditional options.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"any restaurant that pads the tip deserves a low rating!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good !! Just wish the service was a little bit faster. Overall , really nice people & really good food. Will be back ! Maybe when it's not dinner time lol. It's about time Henderson has a sushi burrito type place . They should definitely come up with some new ones. Try it out !"}
{"text":"Good food, I like the rolls available accompanied with salmon bowl. Good lunch options."}
{"text":"I'm sad I didn't visit before the rebranding/ remodel but I got a chicken teriyaki plate to go and it was very good. Very quick, a lot of food. Chicken and rice cooked well with some teriyaki sauce on it and a cup on the side. A small salad with ok miso sauce again on the side. And about a half an orange in slices on the side. Less than a 10 minute wait for food that tasted fresh. I will come back for the rolls. There is sushi wrapped in cucumber instead of rice that I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Tried out this new place- Amazing!! We tried a little of everything...the sushi, the teriyaki, and the poke. It was all delicious! The poke bowl, though!! The best I've ever had, hands down. The owners and staff were all super friendly and nice. My family and I will definitely make this one of our frequent eating spots."}
{"text":"Got the Hawaiian burrito (cali roll with ahi) today and the Washington (cali roll plus salmon) yesterday. What I really liked is that they prepare the food when you're in there. You don't get rolls that were made hours before; you get a fresh made roll.   Service: 5/5 great people working here. Super nice and friendly and the food comes out pretty quickly.  Food quality: 5/5 ono food. I would come back here every day if I could.  Cleanliness: 5/5 seems like a relatively new place. It is spotless.  Atmosphere: 5/5 inviting and I love the layout. It is pretty small- only about 20 seats but isn't crowded.  Overall: 5/5 I really love this place. Food is great!!"}
{"text":"Went to Nevada for a nice vacation and decided to try this place out since it is a new business, and I really loved their food and how they thought of the idea of making a sushi burrito! I absolutely loved the food and the concept of it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this small restaurant! Very clean and the food is delicious. The rolls are very fresh and savory. The sauces compliment the dishes. My son, who is NOT a big sushi/fish eater lobes to come here to eat.  We plan on returning to try each item on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was good!  got a teriyaki combo with extra veggies and a salmon dinner.  Salmon was really good but it was a skimpy piece of fish.  Love that I can see them cooking my food.  Place is neat and clean and the employees are nice."}
{"text":"love this little shop, the food is good and the price is fine. i usually order for pick up and it isn't a long wait. the owners are friendly and make everything quick and easy."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious and won't break the bank. My go to spot when I'm in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Been a bunch of times now. Consistently good food!   The California and Tuna Rolls are bargains at $5 each.  I avoid the \"burritos\" for reasons mentioned in the earlier review. They are tasty but sloppy and hard to eat.   All of the other food I've tried has been really good. Service is always friendly, and the place is spotless."}
{"text":"Wow. I am very impressed with the quality of the food as well as the quantity included in my order. I got a beef and chicken teriyaki combo plate. It comes with a generous portion of both meats, rice, salad (with dressing), and some orange slices. The meat was tender and the veggies fresh. The establishment was clean and the staff was friendly. They will be seeing more of me."}
{"text":"Went to try this place after a friend told me about it. The reviews were also great and they were not lying! This place has great food. I got a spider roll and it was so good ! No fishy taste at all which is a winner ! It also had a little bit of soft shell crab which was delicious ! We also shared an order of chicken katsu which was also delicious. This place has soft music in the back round so you can hold a conversation and the food was ready in no time. It was about $30 for me and my girlfriend for a roll,burrito, and katsu so prices are great as well. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great sushi place that isn't super fancy and expensive."}
{"text":"giving them a 5 star, restaurant is clean, good music, food is fresh and hot, prices are reasonable, staff is friendly, I recommend this place and the teriyaki dishes"}
{"text":"We headed here after going to another sushi place nearby which was incredibly disappointing (almost all of their rolls had deep fried elements to them - yuck!).  We walked in and noticed this is not a fancy place. It is very casual with walk up to counter ordering.   Many great varieties of rolls.  It was hard to decide.  Prices were reasonable.  Service was super friendly and quick.  Easy parking.  The sushi was delicious - all three rolls we ordered were great but we loved the Hulk the most.   The only thing we didnt like was that they serve the rolls in syrofoam take out boxes.  It seems wasteful and unnecessary.  It also felt like we were at a picnic instead of out to dinner.  Other than that - great place for Sushi!"}
{"text":"Poke bowls and riceless rolls are some of my favorite things. There aren't too many options on this side of town to get either of them, which earns King some bonus points. Recently remodeled, the location is clean and modern, with a menu of teriyaki and sushi, as the name implies.  Poke bowl ($7) was okay- poke was nicely flavored with a bit of spice, but had a touch too much onion. Rice was regular white rice instead of sushi rice, and served piping hot, which warmed up the poke a little more than I like. They have a few roll categories on their menu (simple, special, fried, and burrito), but I opted for the Green Valley ($10)- seemed to be what other spots call the \"rock and roll\", with salmon, tuna, and crab, wrapped in cucumber.  Location has a nice condiment station, with sriracha and teriyaki sauce in pumps with cups for easy takeout. If you're dining in, they have dipping bowls for soy sauce, as well as peppers available. This business appears to be run by a couple, with the Mr in the kitchen and the Mrs up front- they're friendly, polite, and thankful for your business."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem....good fresh food for a decent price . I got a beef teriyaki plate and a chicken teriyaki plate along with a crunchy roll and paid around $25 and was very pleased I will keep this location in mind when we are looking for quick fresh sushi ...I wish they had mochi ice cream and appetizers that would make this place complete"}
{"text":"This place is quick and reasonable prices.  I usually get the plate because it comes with more food and seems like the better value. Clean, fast, friendly."}
{"text":"Swung through for the first time this Friday evening after work with my wife and some friends. Dined in and split a few of the specialty rolls, along with the poke, and some teriyaki. Everything was very impressive. The prices are all reasonable and the service was super fast and beyond friendly. I will 100% be back here with my coworkers for lunch and will definitely be doing carry out next time I need a quick dinner fix for my sushi craving."}
{"text":"They remodeled the restaurant nicely. While I will miss the Korean restaurant, it will be nice to have something so close that my son will eat.My husband and I had two rolls burrito style, it was my first time. They made a great dinner, I will be back soon to try their teriyaki and poke."}
{"text":"First time here and had the teriyaki plate and salmon baked roll.  Both were soooo good.  The chicken is skinless and the meat is flavorful.  The salmon on the roll was just cooked but not over cooked.  It was a meal in of itself.  We're from Los Angeles visiting so this is a nice change from the buffets and casino restaurants."}
{"text":"Food and prices were great! Cute little place to dine in or take your order to go! I got the chicken teriyaki and it was a pretty decent size. Tasted delicious! Will definitely be returning! I'm glad to see a place like this open up in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sushi burritos were excellent!! Also their lettuce wraps. Place was clean and simple. We live on the other side of town and just happen to be in the area, but we definitely will be coming more often just for them.   The young girl in the front was ok but could be a little more cheerful and welcoming. She was more on the monotone soft spoken side (which can give off a not so friendly vibe) and that's not really what is best for the first person customers encounter.   All in all great place to go :)"}
{"text":"Excited to try a new place to find out it is closed Sundays... need to update hours of operation... will try again when they are open. For now we are disappointed. No Sushi Sunday."}
{"text":"This was a really good place to eat but it's kind of pricey for the portion of what you receive."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so badly!!!! It's right down the street from me and it looked delicious...too bad it wasn't. I ordered a salmon bowl and it was the tiniest/fattiest piece of salmon I've ever had. And to make things worse it was over cooked and dry!! Such a disappointment. There was a ton of rice under it with a light layer of teriyaki sauce. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because of the decent crunch roll that I also ordered. I've definitely had better sushi but it will do in a pinch when I'm really craving sushi and don't want to drive far. I guess on a positive note, hubby ordered the spicy pork teriyaki plate and he liked it. Maybe salmon just isn't their thing."}
{"text":"First time there a few days ago and their unagi burrito was soooooo good. I will be coming back, the only thing that made me upset was that they were kind of stingy with the eel sauce and spicy mayo sauce but other than that, it was delicious."}
{"text":"They cleaned this place up nicely.  Sushi was decent but teriyaki chicken bowl had no veggies.  They also serve dine-in food in styrofoam containers which was a little tacky."}
{"text":"I ordered riceless rolls, paying more for fish, I received more crab meat instead. it's food is decent"}
{"text":"yum yum yummy so deliciously yummy!!!  i love this place and the service is wonderful?"}
{"text":"Need a quick place for lunch?  Try King Teriyaki & Rolls.  It's not \"fast food\", but it is reasonably fast and tastes great!  They have a good variety of Japanese inspired rolls and bowls at reasonable prices.  The place is always clean and food is consistently good!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give them a better review because Teriyaki anything is basically my favorite food group. I ordered the Teriyaki salmon which was very small portion and not all that flavorful. The place is nice and the service seemed good. Also to note: they say they close at 9pm however they closed early (around 830) while I was there, so don't expect to show up after 830 and get service every time."}
{"text":"I love this place ! They got some good baked scallops dish and the crunch roll so yummy and poke bowl my fav would recommend place give it a try"}
{"text":"WORST customer service! I probably go here to get to go orders once or twice a week... today I had left overs from home for lunch today and needed soy sauce for it and the owner( cook) told I have to pay 1$ for one go to pack of soy sauce! After telling me they didnt have any to give out for to go orders. I asked to pay for it when he thinks and says 1 dollar. Treatng regular customers like that is horrible!"}
{"text":"Saw the grand opening sign and dropped by,  and if was surprisingly great! The food was delicious and the staff was so friendly. The place itself was very clean and nicely decorated! Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Great sushi hot night nd volcano roll favs .always friendly lady is always smiling nd remembers me"}
{"text":"Surprising that this small, easy-to-miss place had such great food. The sushi was so fresh and tasty and the teriyaki chicken bowl was great!"}
{"text":"Recently ate here with the family.  Decided to come here based on the good reviews, unfortunately we didn't feel the same.  The good - chicken teriyaki, very tender (not dry), large quantity for the price.  The average - beef teriyaki and salmon teriyaki.  Both okay at best - Not as flavorful.  Salmon a bit dry, slightly over cooked.  The tiger roll wasn't too bad either.  The bad - spam musubi, nothing like standard spam musubi elsewhere, color was a bit off as well.  The volcano roll and California roll's were below average.  Spicy tuna just not prepared correctly.  Price was a high for the quality of food.   Wouldn't recommend for sushi, but not too bad if just wanting to grab a few teriyaki dishes."}
{"text":"Whoohoo!! Finally a sushi I can order without seaweed!! I could cry with joy!  I never could stand the smell of seaweed so I requested a roll without it and they suggested getting the rolls with a soybean wrap instead. Hesitant, I said ok, I'll try it. and BOOM!! My tastebuds have exploded and there's a party in my tummy! . Great job!!"}
{"text":"I think 2.5 stars is more accurate but will lean towards 3 because- the employee was very helpful, the restaurant dining area is clean and I feel the prices are very fair. My order was 1 spicy tuna roll which I found to be very good and the proper size so I was pleased with that. However the teriyaki chicken bowl was dreadful. Couldn't even finish it because of the super rubbery chicken. The teriyaki sauce has little flavor and the bowl itself is simply chicken and rice with no veg. Probably won't come back since there is a Teriyaki Madness down the street that is so much better that its like comparing a 7-11 hot dog to a prime rib at a steakhouse."}
{"text":"Yum!! I got the chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies and it was really good!!! The building is nice and small. And you don't have to wait so long for the food to come. I recommend this place to people who like sushi or teriyaki bowls."}
{"text":"Had the beef teriyaki plate a few days ago.  They give you a good amount of food for the money--more meat than I expected on a base of white rice, with a salad and half orange (in a to-go box, even though I ate in).  The meat was tender and flavorful, but I'm only giving 4 stars because it was only marinated, not sauced (no sauce on the side), and didn't have what I'd consider a traditional teriyaki flavor. Pretty sure it had ginger in the seasoning, and I don't think sake was used.  But still very good over all."}
{"text":"I decided to give this newer business a try with a carry out order. I'm sad to say that I cannot recommend this place and will likely not return. The wife liked the concept of a sushi burrito so she got the spider roll burrito. I opted for a poke bowl after being told their salmon bowl was a cooked teriyaki bowl and not a raw one. We also got a green valley roll because we are big fans of the rice less cucumber wrapped rolls.   \"Poke\" bowl - the rice was warm, this is a big no-no especially if you're going to throw raw fish on top of it. Strike one. It was also overly salty and drenched in soy sauce. The \"poke\" was spicy, which I don't mind but other people should be made aware of it. I may not be Hawaiian but this is far from what poke is supposed to taste like. I'm sorry.   Green valley roll - this roll takes some good knife skills to pull off correctly. The cucumber was sliced way too thick and uneven, resulting in a very soggy mess. Strike two. (See picture, I didn't put any sauce or anything on it) The fish inside was also quite discolored and not fresh tasting at all. Very disappointed.   Spider roll burrito - wife ate it and all she had to say was \"it was ok\".  I gave them 3 stars because I did not want to skew their rating one way or another.  I feel that they can improve if they want to. I really think they need to step up their game especially for a take out order that was damn near $30. Strike three.  Just for the record, the food was consumed within 15 minutes of me picking it up."}
{"text":"After moving here and hearing about it constantly I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl along with the Vegas roll and the crunch roll as said in other reviews they serve their sushi in styrofoam which is kind of weird but the sushi was delicious as well as the chicken bowl I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Awesome little sushi spot tucked in a corner. Any of the tools can be made into s burrito. Everything we've tried has been delicious. Definitely recommend if you're looking for quick, affordable sushi."}
{"text":"Everything is always so delicious!  Our favorites are the poke bowl, spicy chicken teriyaki with veggies, and the cucumber special.  Ice cold filtered water if you don't want a soda.  Everything comes out reasonably fast.  Thanks for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for recommending King Teriyaki and Rolls!! I have been waiting for a sushi burrito type place in Henderson! They are very friendly and welcoming and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a pleasant environment. The person who took our order was ok. She wasn't exceptionally emotive but she was professional.  Our food was tasty and I got two small containers of teriyaki sauce for free (some places charge 25 cents or what have you).  Overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I've driven by so many times and didn't realize this gem!   The spicy pork...my first time having it and like I said I can't get enough. It's even just as good the next day. Their rolls are nice and light.   The restaurant is clean!  I will mos def return   So yourself a favor and treat yo self here!!!"}
{"text":"I like this spot. I've never really tried poké with rice, but it was actually pretty good. I also had the spider burrito and I liked it. I'll most likely return and try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been living in Green Valley for about 6 months. Hunting for a sushi spot near me has been difficult, this place recently opened and I love it! Great to go spot in between my studying. Only reason for the 4 stars is because of the girl at the front... She seems like she's high! On cannibis of course."}
{"text":"Got some take out from here from lunch today.  Environment: the restaurant is small, but very clean. It is located in a pretty popular area next to Trader Joe's and mothership. The inside is pretty quiet also.  Service: the cashier was friendly and the chefs cooked the food fresh as soon as it was being ordered. The food didn't take too long to make also.  Food: today I ordered teriyaki chicken and spam masubi. I liked that the chicken tasted fresh and it was over well made rice. My teriyaki sauce was in a separate container which I appreciated so I can add it as I wanted. The spam masubi was also good and warm, not sure if they used sushi rice though.  Overall, this spot was great for lunch. It wasn't too busy and the food I ordered was light so I didn't feel too sleepy after lunch. They package it nicely so you can take it to go."}
{"text":"I came here today for a quick lunch to go. I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki bowl and an a spicy tuna roll.  They were both good and came out to 11 buck......can't beat that.  This place is kind of out of the way for me, but if it was closer to my house I would hit it up often.  Great service and good food and not breaking my wallet!."}
{"text":"This place is fresh and pretty good. I got the chicken plate. I feel like they could have added a LITTLE more chicken though; not very filling. Really, how expensive is chicken? I can get wayyy more food at L and L BBQ for pretty much the same price. This place is fresher tho so I dunno, you decide.   Overall good dough : )"}
{"text":"Tried the H.o.t roll and it was good. Kinda like a fast food sushi but you pick what you want and either take it to go or sit down. I wanna try the sushi burrito next time. Great new spot for Henderson."}
{"text":"I went to King Sushi to order a few rolls at 7:50 and they were closed.  Google says they close at 9 but there is a sign on the door saying they close at 8.  This has happened several times. Their hours are very inconsistent and they would rather turn away customers than stay a few minutes late.  I will be looking for a new sushi spot.  It takes 2 minutes to update your hours on Google!"}
{"text":"Im a big fan of their chicken teriyaki plate. The combo comes with salad and half orange. Yummy. The food is great. Ambient is nice and clean. The owners are friendly as well"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, nothing special and service was TERRIBLE! I will won't come back and don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. First time didn't realize that the teriyaki bowl doesn't automatically come with veggies, but this time ordered it with veggies and it was really good. The girl behind the counter was super nice and was helpful. This is a great spot to pick food up from."}
{"text":"The food is good all around and there customer service is great. Since their opening my family & I have been there numerous of times already.  Plus if you spend $20 you get a cool water bottle"}
{"text":"This is an okay place for quick rolls and eats. We came in on our way to Ethel Ms. I asked for cucumber in my roll as an add on and was told it couldn't be added on. I ended up with a rainbow roll and my husband had a Katsu bowl that were average at most. No rolls could be modified which was unusual for me.   We probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Fresh clean delightful gem of a little place! Especially loved the riceless cucumber rolls and the pickled jalapeños! Ordered the green valley and #2. Kids loved the California roll and the teriyaki chicken"}
{"text":"This place is so good. 5 star flavor for your flavor hole. What else can I say.Everything I have eaten there as been awesome! Its such a bargain and everyone that works there is super nice!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident, and I have been here practically every day since. 99.9% of the time I will order the spicy BBQ pork bowl, I've even turned all my coworkers on to this place. I've had the poke bowl and volcano baked roll which are absolutely delicious. This is my favorite spot for lunch, hands down!!  Food is ALWAYS fresh."}
{"text":"The rice less rolls are huge and so filling! I was worrying that one roll wouldn't be enough but I was stuffed. Very cute on the inside don't let the outside fool you."}
{"text":"I love this place! I love that the food is cooked and prepares fresh fast and tastes amazing. Also the price can't be beat for the quality and quantity of food you get. I have ordered almost everything off the menu and have never been disappointed. I do have to admit that the steak is a tad on the dry side that's why I couldn't give them 5 stars. I am also a bonefied sushi snob and I love the sushi from here and I'm not a take sushi home kind of girl so for me to say this it's got to be spectacular! This place is the real deal and worth every stinking penny you want to give them!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd reviewed this place but I guess not. I've eaten here 6 or 7 times in the last 6 months, and its always been good, quality food at a decent price. Their sushi rolls are very good. I normally get a teriyaki chicken or salmon bowl, a little extra $ for veggies.  Service has always been good, and the owners are nice people. I am happy to recommend King's...and will be back often."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. The price is very reasonable, the employees and owners are super nice and friendly, the place is super clean, and the foods taste great!! My husband and I had Port Katsu Bowl, Chicken Teriyaki Bowl, and Hot Night Roll. Port Katsu was super tender and juicy. Chicken Teriyaki was marinated well enough that I don't need teriyaki sauce (I personally like it this way), and Hot Night Roll was super fresh and tasty. I will definitely go back to this restaurant whenever I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden GEM! When it comes to sushi burritos (the new craze) this is the SPOT! Their sushi-rittos are by far the best I've ever had. Other places can pack way too much fish into one bite making it almost gag-worthy, or adversely at some places I've had a mouth full of rice which defeats the whole concept all together. But the sushi burritos here are amazing. All of them! I've had them all, so I can actually say that conclusively. It's a laid back, quick stop sort of joint, nothing fancy or overpriced. So if you're looking for classy sushi, don't expect the world here but the taste and delivery is totally worth the stop in."}
{"text":"I always order take out from here I like the sushi burritos , except the miso soup was horrible tasted like a cup of hot water with salt never got tofu or anything just plain salt water lol"}
{"text":"Very surprised! I came upon this place by mistake while actually looking for some Teriyaki food! Small location and reasonably priced food."}
