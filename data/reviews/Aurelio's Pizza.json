{"text":"Everything was great. My family had a great time..The food was great  I like the thin crust.. I really recommend... My favorite super six pizzai"}
{"text":"We eat at alot of pizza places in Vegas. I take my clients for meetings for dinner alot
Tonight we ordered tow home delivery pizzas and let's just say I was far from pleased with our food.
First of all...COLD.Pizza cheese was cold like it had been sitting .The cheese was hard and was cheddar not your typical mozzarella cheese 
SALTY.
It was so salty you couldn't even taste the ingredients of the pizza.
TOO MUCH SAUCE
Pizza looked like a red messy sauce pizza. No taste to what we ordered.
VERY LITTLE TOPPINGS 
The toppings were so small you didn't taste them .
THIN
Pizza was so thin you could read a newspaper threw it

Overall I can't even rate this pizza or the service. This is the second time we have tried the food and had same issues as the first time.

There is alot of great places to eat in Vegas . This place I do not recommend based on our experience.
Person on the phone didn't even try to offer and replace with fresh they expected us to come pay AGAIN for better pizza.
If you can't get it right after twice we will not come back.
 I'm glad others have had paid service and food with this establishment but our experience has been very poor we will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible,  first I asked them when I placed the order twice if the price was 25 including delivery and he said yes then I get a charge for $38.59  on my card and the pizza was burnt and hard and not hot it took them over an hour to get there and when I called to inform them that they over charged me for one medium pizza 2 toppings and 8 wings. He said I didn't understand him because he had a strong accent I said no I repeated the price back to him twice to confirm that was including delivery and he said  yes.  Then said you signed the receipt this place has robbed me and they have horrible pizza and lie to their customers I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Have been going here for a couple of years now, thin crust pizza, very tasty, good comfort food. The service has always been very good as the owners are there every night and make sure everything is running smoothly. Good prices on beer and wine. The listing on this restaurant shows that it is closed, but it is certainly not! Just ate there tonight and it is alive and well."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. Being a native Chicagoan, I know my pizza! Thin, crunchy crust with tasty sauce, flavorful cheese and real Italian style sausage with fennel. Just like home. Chicago style decor, casual and comfortable. Service is fine- not great, not bad. Most importantly, pizza was served piping hot. I don't know about the other food, cause the pizza is the only thing we go for!"}
{"text":"they have awesome pizza... incredible.. can say much but have go an check it out... they got the chicago deep dish.. wow.. the chicken wings... an they always have sports team from chicago playing on TV so...  im a Chicago Bulls fan.. so come down an get a pizza..!!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, ordered the pepperoni mushroom and sausage thin crust but it wasn't too thin, the only reason why I didn't get 5 stars is because it took over an hour to get delivered and I only live a half a mile away."}
{"text":"Most pizza is either okay or really good. This place is the rare occasion of just plain bad pizza. Not only does it taste bad but it is highly over-priced. There are plenty of other good pizzerias around. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Very happy with my drop in here. I tried the stuffed pizza and it was amazing. The service wasn't great but the food was. My friend ate a sandwich and enjoyed it and he like the stuff mushrooms. Service was slow but only one person serving for lunch. Other than that I'm definitely going to go back. :)"}
{"text":"This was the first time we ordered a pizza from this company. It was not good the sauce was sweet and tasted like it was from Chef Boyardee. It had no flavor to it. The pizza was burnt and so was the crust. We will not be back it was very salty to"}
{"text":"The Look of Chicago - Check!
The Feel of Chicago - Check!
The Pizza Flavor - ok - Its missing something from home. I can't tell you what exactly what is was, but in any case its 3 starts for me."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service. Really nice casual atmosphere that is family friendly."}
{"text":"Four stars, if you're an average thin crust pizza pie eater i.e. someone who has not visited the original Aurelio's. 

Three stars if you've been indoctrinated by the original homewood location in IL, only because it's not made in \"the oven\"! 

Either way, I'll force rank it the second best pizza in Vegas. Nom, nom."}
{"text":"Greatest pizza on face of earth,  the gods of pepperoni, cheese and sausage live beneth the streets of Homewood Illinois.  As word spreads, temples such as this poo up if far off places.  They deliver the heavenly delicious message of sweet sauce thin crust chicago pizza. Treat yourself."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town! Had pizza and the salad bar for lunch. The one in Henderson was bought then closed down. Well worth the 40 minute drive!  We will be back again."}
{"text":"We used to go to the other Aurelio's in Vegas but it closed. Some friends suggested we try it last night after being at the Drag Races all day. The Pizza was edible (not great). However the was maybe the worst place for service anywhere in the USA. Everything took too long. We sat there for almost an hour before they came to take our order. Then it took forever for the food to come, and it was almost all either burnt, over cooked, or undercooked and cold. Two of the people in our group got six, and the staff (of only one), could not, or did not understand English. After a 90 minute wait for food, some of it not even close to what we ordered. We had to eat some of it, but we won't ever go back unless the owners have some great explanation to why everything was so awful. Dicken W."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a pepperoni pizza and it only had one pepperoni. When we told the server she said there it is you have pepperoni.  You mean to tell me you charged me an extra $1.50 for ONE pepperoni.  As a business why not eat the $1.50 so your customers are satisfied mistakes happen that wasn't the problem. The problem is lack of customer service with a smirk as you point out the ONE piece.  We will not be returning here we hope the $1.50 was worth it.  
Business need to remember customer service is vital."}
{"text":"The pizza is ok, not great. It is also a bit over priced. However, customer service is pretty bad. The young girl that took my order was impolite and acting as she was making me a favor. Anyway, try it out, not bad but be cautions of people working there."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.

I went here on Saturday afternoon. There were maybe 3 other booths occupied when we came in, not too busy. There was one girl working so I expected a bit of a wait but what happened was unacceptable. We sat ourselves and the girl came by with menus and took our drink orders. I ordered mine and turned to my girlfriend to ask what she wanted and the waitress WALKED OFF WITHOUT SAYING A WORD. I thought it was kind of odd but let it go. She returned about 5 minutes later to take our drink orders again ONLY TO WALK OFF AGAIN AND NOT RETURN. What the fuck?? What kind of service is that?? At this point another small family walks in and goes to the register. They talk to the girl and go have a seat. She then proceeds to TAKE THEIR ORDER IMMEDIATELY. 

WHAT.THE.FUCK.

She totally blew us off. If this is what they consider customer service, then I have no clue how they stay in business. Ill never return and will discourage anyone else from wasting their money at this horrible place. STAY AWAY, GO TO A RESTAURANT THAT KNOWS WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE REALLY MEANS. I would give this place negative stars if possible. She had the chance to take our order and move on to the next customer, but she just ignored us entirely like we were never there. We walked out, and of course she didn't say a word. Something as simple as \"Ill be right with you\" or \"I apologize for the wait\" could have been the difference between gaining and losing a customer. Not that it matters to them anyway."}
{"text":"awful !!!! do not be fooled by the good/great reviews ...$45.08 large deep dish =7 slices + 1 antipasta salad. pizza is really salty, greasy and small. horrible..very disappointed !! i don't mind paying if the product is worth it, this was sooo not."}
{"text":"this so far has been.best pizza I have had in Vegas but.then again most is horrible.  the apps where sub par but the service was the worst part of the whole thing.  the waitress doesn't know customer service at all and had no.clue about the tell them.Joe sent you thing.  I would eat it.again but try.carryout so don't have to deal with horrible service"}
{"text":"I was a little scared reading the reviews here but went on the food comments. The food reviews are true. Pretty good stuff and I'm from the east coast. One of the best plates of spaghetti and meatballs I've had. The salad bar is okay. My husband enjoyed his pizza and Samuel Adam's. It was obvious to me and not in a bad way that the server is trying honestly to improve. She was genuine and nice. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with a small town feel. Very good thin crust pizza. I have tried a few different pizza places in vegas, but this one has been the best so far. Love the tomato sauce.  Tonight I tried a pepperoni, ham, bacon, and salami pizza.  Cooked to perfection again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Friendly service.  We come here at least twice a year (we are from out of country). Love the new location, worth the drive.  Come here hungry.  Their sauce is the best I have ever had.  Went there tonight with friends. We all ordered different pies, and they all looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful.  Hopefully they get their liquor licence soon. Beer with pizza is a must have."}
{"text":"Pizza quality is always different. No consistency. The people answering the phone have a hard time handling English it seems. You can't charge 33 dollars for a pie and have limp soggy crust. Common, I've had too many bad and good pies here. You never know what your gonna get."}
{"text":"For those who think Rosatis is good you obviously haven't been to Aurelios.  The best thin crust pizza I ever tasted!  It's not that cracker thin crap and they make sure it's loaded with sauce and toppings.  Not to mention the wings are the bomb.  The service is awesome too and the staff works very hard.  Nicole is awesome...tip her well!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for mind blowing, amazing pizza, look no further! We ordered the combo appetizer with breaded mushrooms, toasted ravioli, and poppers. The breading was good, not too much and the right amount of crunch. We also ordered a medium \"the works\" on thin crust. The crust seems to melt in your mouth. The marinara has a good balance of sweetness and spice and ties in the fresh ingredients wonderfully. We had leftover pizza which was amazing cold and even better reheated by using an air fryer. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The atmosphere was great and the place was clean. It's a little expensive, but totally worth it!! I think I have a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Aureilo's is one of the better pizza joints in the Valley. It is straight forward Chicago pizza. Being from Chicago, I may be a little biased, but it also means that I know quality Chicago-style thin crust when I see and taste it. I live close by, so I always do carry-out. The setting inside is nothing to write home about, but it is clean and fresh. My only knock on the pizza is the consistency is not always there. Things like the amount of sauce and how long it stays in the oven vary from pie to pie."}
{"text":"This pizza place offers an excellent thin crust pizza. I live near their location on Craig and frequently order delivery. Always on time- no mistakes on orders. My favorites are pepperoni, mushroom, &onion thin crust and honestly plain cheese is quite good!! So much better than other options in North Vegas. Before I discovered them I was a papa Johns guy. Not so much anymore.  I cannot speak about eating in, but delivery is spot-on!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. It reminds me of other locations. Except the air was off. Not cool for a restaurant in Las Vegas. (No pun intended) No air conditioning, no tip. Order to-go. My brother and I were the only people in the restaurant. About 3 or 4 to go phone calls though."}
{"text":"I was the only customer, service good, the spaghetti sauce must of been out of a can plane as could be. Meatballs hard no taste. The Italian combo sub was like eating the sole of a shoe. The appetizer tomato.and garlic toast was very good. The atmosphere was nice. For $31 left very very DISAPPOINTED will NEVER GO BACK. I hope the owner reads this."}
{"text":"The thing I always enjoyed about Aurelio's was that even though it was a little more expensive, you always got a much better product. Lately it seems that they are really skimping on the quality, and still demanding premium pricing. 

I used to eat Aurelio's pizza as a kid, it was always my favorite part of visiting family on the South Side. When I lived in Chicago I would regularly enjoy the lunch buffets in Evergreen Terrace and a few other locations. I also used to love watching games at the Cheyenne location before it closed. 

So my aunt got me a giftcard for my birthday, and I figured I'd drive across town to check this one out, hoping it would be worth the 20-minute drive. When I called this afternoon, they said there was a dinner buffet tonight from 5-9pm, which was perfect, I thought, because you can enjoy a few different topping combos and some salad for a reasonable price. 

I drove 10 miles, and got there a little after 8. I walked past a giant sign on the building advertising the buffet on Tuesday nights from 5-9. I walked in, and there was no buffet. I asked the girl, and she said there was no buffet, went to the back and came back and offered me a special that was basically a small pizza for $12.99, and said it was the same as the buffet. 

I don't really know what they do for the buffet, or how much it costs exactly, but there are two mutually exclusive possibilities, either: 1) The special was the same as the buffet, which seriously undermines the quality of the buffet, or 2) The special was not the same as the buffet, in which case they were lying to me. 

It says a lot about a place if they are not willing to offer you even the bare minimum that they are advertising. I understand that the restaurant was slow, and that's probably why they didn't offer the buffet, but maybe more people would go if they could count on the buffet to actually be there. I know I'm never going to drive 20 minutes for the mere possibility of a buffet again. And why do they only offer the buffet on Tuesday nights? Maybe people would come if they didn't have to think about what day it is before deciding what to eat? If you can get $13 per person for the buffet, are you seriously unable to offer it on every night of the week?

There is way too much great food and great value in Las Vegas that this place really doesn't deserve your business. 

I also just found a recipe for their sauce online, so maybe I can just make my own."}
{"text":"First time coming in, lovely cashier was extremely nice..I have a wing preference, this lovely woman had the cook show me two raw drums to satisfy my needs! I had the small cheese za, and 8 wings all above par for the money! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti is delicious. 
The sauce panther right amount of tomato with a little tinge of sweet.  Paid 1.99 for the meatball.  Not sure if it was worth the $2.  I guess I was expecting it to be amazing since it isn't super large.  Garlic cheese bread is amazing.   Some
Of the best I've had .  Sausage pizza was also delicious.  Nice relaxing casual atmosphere.  Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I was soooo disappointed :( I had high hopes for this place. I lived in Chicago for a few years and was happy to learn there was a Chicago style pizza place. Sadly, it does not compare to the pizza I would eat in Chicago. The sauce on the stuffed pizza tasted like it was just tomato sauce out of a can. There was absolutely NO seasoning in it. The spinach was fresh, but it wasn't completely covered by the sauce, so many of the pieces were dried out. The cheese was okay, but not great. The crust was pretty nondescript. I definitely won't get another stuffed pizza from here. If they use the same \"sauce\" on the thin pizzas I definitely won't get pizza from here again."}
{"text":"A little on the fence, we love the pizza and delivery is always fast. We have ordered three times, however, this last time, the wings were supposed to be naked with sauce on the side, all 16 wings cakes smothered in hot sauce. I called back after delivery to tell them, because the two out of three of us won't eat them, and the lady on the phone said oh ok, sorry about that, I know which order you are and will have them remake them. We waited and waited, no wings ever came. Tried to call back and phone just rang and rang... I know it was super busy, so maybe it was just bad timing, but was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pizza. the Stuffed pizza is what gets me. they have some what of a sweet sauce put on top. and stuffed inside is cheese and your choice of toppings. Bosco sticks, were amazing. bread sticks stuffed with mozzarella. filling meal. a definite must visit if you are ever in the north las vegas area."}
{"text":"hi im from tinley park  ill. there has been a aurelio's pizza in tinley since i was a little girl. the thin crust sausage, mushroom and onion is the best. im now retired and go to aurelio''s on craig for their lunch buffet. george is a great guy. its a little more expensive but worth every penny.  the beef sandwich is killer also."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, love the beef. Only gave 4 stars because we ordered pizza with light sauce and it definitely wasn't light sauce. Went a second time for the beef and it was tasty. I like my beef sliced much thinner, but it was good. Again, 4 stars for my second visit due to the price. $32 and change for 3 beefs!?!?! None of us wanted the fries (but it comes with it anyway) which is why I would guess that it's so pricey? I did see a lunch special that's cheaper, but when you gotta have a real Chicago beef, you can't wait for the special! Either way, I'll be back and super excited to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"When Aurelio's Pizza relocated to this spot I was hoping that it would be better. Inside there was a funky ass smell and the girl at the register was nice but she didn't speak English very well so it wasn't easy to understand what she was saying. The food is way overpriced in my honest opinion. I shelled out $20 for a medium pizza which isn't what I would assume most people would expect to pay at a pizza chain..... I mean it doesn't say Wolfgang Puck on the building so come on! The cheese on my pizza tasted rotten and when I took a bite all the cheese and pepperoni pulled off together leaving just the crust. I'm not sure if the funky smell inside the restaurant was from the funky tasting cheese or not but all around this wasn't a great experience."}
{"text":"Aurelio's is a wonderful Chicago tradition and I am so happy they came to Las Vegas.

My husband and I have come to Las Vegas twice so far from Seattle, and have made it a point to visit Aurelio's for our pizza fix. It is 10x better than Papa Johns or any other random \"chain\" pizza place. 

My husband grew up in Chicago (that's about 18 years of his life that he ate authentic Aurelio's pizza) and not only does he think it's just as good here in Las Vegas, but he's turned me into an Aurelio's addict also. Their ingredients are fresh and perfect! 

I also have no idea why people come to a pizza place and complain about other things on the menu. The pizza is what Aurelio's is known for, so at least rate that, and give it a chance. 

By the way, in Chicago they often cut their pizza into squares. It doesn't change the taste of the pizza, and it isn't just for kindergardeners."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from Seattle, but he is originally from Chicago.  Aurelio's has always been one of his favorite pizza places, and he thought this one in North Las Vegas was no exception.  

The sauce is absolutely what makes the pizza one of the best.  They also use very good ingredients and high quality cheese.  We ordered the garlic bread with cheese and a large thin crust pizza with sausage and green peppers.  The green peppesr and the Italian sausage were both fresh and very tasty.  We did not take advantage of the specials, but they were offering two salad bars, two drinks and a medium (two topping) thin crust pizza for 20.99.  They also had two mediums with two toppings for 19.99.  There was also a family special that was 25.99 which included wings and pizza.  

Overall, this has been one of my husband's favorite pizza places growing up in Chicago, and he says it is the same here in Las Vegas... Just as great as the original. Aurelio's pizza has truly become one of my favorites as well."}
{"text":"New location in front of Lowe's on Craig and Jones.  I ordered the works number 23 on the menu 10in perfect size for one.  This is one delicious pizza - thin crust puffy dough and no grease at all.  More expensive than the cheaper joints but this pizza is worth it."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and I had a great experience. The food was great and unique (most pizza places taste the same to me) and the service and atmosphere was good as well. I think I have a new favorite pizza place in town. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant night out to a pizza joint.  We went about an hour before closing, so the one person working the tables was less than thrilled to see us, and it was evident.  We were the only table during that hour, though some carry-out customers came in.  

The food was really pretty good!  We ordered salads, three pizzas, and breadsticks.  It was all tasty, though the appetizers were slow coming out, especially considering we were the only table.  

I wouldn't rush to come back, but I wouldn't avoid it either."}
{"text":"Was there in the past and it was good, then I had 2 bad experiences in a row...one witha carry out pizza, one with the buffet and an indifferent waitress. 
Today, I am happy to say that the help was nice and the food good. Pizza and a little salad bar for the lunc buffet. Tasty Chicago pizza, and when we requested that they make more cheese pizza, as my daughter is vegetarian, they did so...without a complaint.  Thanks Aurelio's for redeeming yourself."}
{"text":"When hubby and I first ate their food we thought it was great and promised to come back.  However, we were dissatisfied when we ordered a pizza on football Sunday for delivery.  We waited an hour to call for the status of our delivery.  We were told the place was busy and they wouldn't be able to deliver!!!!!  Then they put my husband on hold on two separate occasions for a total of 40 minutes, claiming there was a manager there to refund our money.  However, they came back on the phone, first said the manager was too busy to get on the phone.  Then, we found out there was no manager on site, and they were going to call back sometime in the near future to tell him his money was refunded.  While we wait eagerly for that phone call, it is highly doubtful that we will return or recommend this establishment EVER."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here and overall it wasn't too bad. I ordered a 6 inch pizza with mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were very good, nice and gooey! The marinara sauce was alright, wasn't too good to me. The pizza was obviously small, but the sauce was a bit too sweet. The service, not good. We sat ourselves down and the waitress saw us, but didn't come to us until 10-15 min later and it wasn't busy. Only one or two other tables. Also took her a long time to get us a refill. But since the mozzarella sticks were awesome, three stars."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but spaghetti was AMAZING! The meatballs were delicious and the pasta was perfectly cooked. The only reason this place lost a star for me was that we paid almost $70 for pizza, pasta, and a salad. Good stuff and they deliver though."}
{"text":"I ate here again recently on my Vegas trip. Met the owner who I will say was very nice and friendly. (He was my server as well.)

However, once again, the pizza I got (this time just sausage & pepperoni) did not have enough toppings on it. At least half of the Large pizza I got had one chunk of sausage per slice. THIS IS NOT HOW AURELIO'S IN CHICAGO DOES IT. And that's ridiculous, given it's supposed to be made the same way.

I brought this to the attention of the owner, who said Aurelio's has a set amount of ingredients that go on the pizzas. I asked what that amount was. He said he'd check. Little later he came back with a placard for other items. I said, what about the pizzas? He said he couldn't find it. Okaaay...

Clearly, the chintzy toppings is to save money. But having worked in the restaurant biz at one time, actual food costs should be about 25% of the food item's menu price. The Large pizza I got cost $23.50, and I can guarantee you that the actual ingredient costs of what I got were seriously less than $5.88.

I also pointed out, that there was TOO much cheese on the pizza -- it was drowning in cheese. I mean, WTF, this isn't supposed to be Domino's. This is not the recipe Aurelio's uses in Chicago. Far from it. He told me he's been working for Aurelio's for years and was trained in Chicago, before he bought this franchise. That's fine, I don't disbelieve that. But he/his chef are NOT following the original recipes for their pizzas. And this saddens me. Because I will not go back to this location. Just can't do it. I'll save my Aurelio's cravings for when I visit Chicago."}
{"text":"This is probably the best customer service I had in a while! Went for a raffle got a few prices 25$ gift card and NFL gear & at the end of eating calamari and a larage 2 topping pizza and drinks we got our whole meal for free! I would like to thank joe for being so kind! And of course our waiter!! Lady with black glasses is awesome!"}
{"text":"The only Pizza place in Las Vegas I'd rather go to for many reasons. I'm from Chicago, IL, which is where Aurelio's is from originally. Only a Chicagoan (or a New Yorker) knows good pizza, and anyone else doesn't, sorry but that's the way it is. Las Vegas stinks for it's pizza, until I searched and found a \"Chicago\" pizza house. All the ingrediants are shipped from Chicago, including the water! My girlfriend and I have the $20.99 special which is 1 Med Pizza w/2 Ingrediants, 2 drinks & all you can eat salad bar. It is always good, and a meesage for the person who had a bad  comment on the cheese, that is what Wisconsin cheese on pizza looks like, not this California crap they call cheese. Go Aurelio's and thank you for the excellent service as well!"}
{"text":"We went back to Aurelio's a few nights ago with my parents. This time I had spaghetti and meatballs. It was okay but the meatballs were a little overdone (i.e., bordering on burnt). My wife had the spinach calabrese which is similar to a calzone. It was pretty good. My parents split a pizza. I tried a couple of small pieces, and it was fine, but again not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but the service was crappy or else it would be 5 star. We got a thin crust medium pepperoni and cheese ravioli with Alfredo which was honestly the best thing ever! Too bad the service wasn't all that great :("}
{"text":"just had sausage pizza at the new aurelios 6010 w craig. fantastic!!!!! it was exactly like a great chicago pizza. their new place pretty good size.really nice in there.next time gonna try a italian beef owner says they fly it in from chicago.lunch special any sandwich and salad bar $7.99. salad bar tiny but that's a good deal.will be back soon.[next week?]"}
{"text":"0 stars. 

Understood that it's 4th of July, but we were craving Aurelios so we called early to make sure they'd be open. They told us they were closing at 9:30 as opposed to the normal 10 pm so we showed up at 8:30 only to find lights off and doors locked after a trip all the way up to North Las Vegas. 

If you're going to close early for the holiday, that's fine, but don't tell customers you're closing over an hour earlier than what you really were. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Work buddies and I used to eat here all the time when it was in the old location...now it's even closer to my house!!!

Super convenient  location on Craig road now ... Way more accessible to the base on this location!!!

Walked in staff created me warmly and brought me a ice (ICE COLD) Sam Adams... Yum!!!

Are the buffet for $7.95 which consisted of several different delicious pizza pies and salad bar...

Relaxed atmosphere... Great to meet a buddy on a Friday afternoon before a long weekend!!!"}
{"text":"Heartbroken to find out that the one on Cheyenne is closed. They truly had the most amazing pizza ever. Rest in Peace."}
{"text":"There used to be an Aurelio's store close to my house and that was my first experience with Aurelio's.  In my opinion it is the best pizza on the planet.  So when the store near my house closed down a few years ago (boo) we started going to this location.  It is worth the 20+ minute drive.  The service is good too.  There's a waitress that is usually there when we are (name is Trini?) and she is really nice.  Our food always comes out fast and accurate.  My only complaint is I wish they had a kid's menu and kid's cups.  The location by my house that closed down used to have this and the fact we have 2 small kids that go out with us- it would be nice to be more kid friendly."}
{"text":"Me and the wife went there one night. They had no wings they ran out! The salad was plain. The young kid that work there was very nice with good service. The pizza was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Almost 40 years I've been on the westcoast SoCal and Nevada.  I couldn't find a decent pizza until this place. Kind of remind me of the original Kracker's pizza in Massillon Ohio. 
Anyway the place is just right not too big or, too small very clean and cozy with the aroma of a bakery. The thin pizza crust is almost pastry like you could eat it plain but, on my last visit I chose to top it with Meatballs, Sausage and, cheese....AMAZING!!!
Definitely the best west coast pizza by far."}
{"text":"3 star average.  Eek.  \"I don't even want to try them!\", I say as I read the subpar reviews on this place.  

It was the only non-run-of-the-mill pizza joint around the place that was open, so whatever, let's try it.  You know what they say -- even if the pizza isn't good, it's still good.  

We ordered the hawaiian pizza with bbq sauce, thin crust.  They cut their pizzas into squares, so if you particularly don't like that - say something in advance.  I don't care, and I actually kinda liked it.  It was fun to eat. 

The pizza? It was one of the best hawaiian pizzas I've ever had.  The cheese was delicious, the sauce was sweet, tangy and just oh so good, and the ham & pineapples were loaded on but not to the point where it was falling off in a heaping pile on the pizza box.  

It was darn good.  That's all we had at Aurelio's, and we want to try some others.  Maybe at that time - if the quality is consistent, I'll rerate them at 5 stars.  But seriously - this place is good.  Really darn good."}
{"text":"I went to support the 2nd day they opened. Walked in hungry , walked out hungry. Waited over 12 minutes for our waitress to return and take out order especially when we were the only customers in there. Place was completely empty. On our way out we saw our waitress chit chatting with other employees behind the counter. Didnt even ask us why we were leaving since she was busy talking about her personal life. I wont be back. Good job guys. What a great way to start!!!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious pizza. I typically do not care about the sauce, but their sauce is so good. The sandwiches are pretty good too. Customer service was nice as well."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for pizza places in my area and found Aurelio's through a quick Yelp search. The 2 of us came in around 7pm on a Saturday night and the place was dead. Although a lot of people came in for to go orders. 
Our server was friendly and she did a good job of taking care of us that evening, but again- there was only one other table of customers. 
I ordered the dinner house salad which was huge. He ordered a medium stuffed pizza w/ sauce on the side. 
I just not a fan of the stuffed pizza idea, but I tried it anyway. It was just ok- it had a lot of dough. I'd rather fill up on the toppings. The sauce was very sweet to me. Not a thumbs up in my book. 
Was shocked to see that the pizza alone was 24$ ouch! 
I wish Aurelio's the best of luck, but it won't be on our pizza places rotation for this family."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza growing up. I grew up going to the original in Homewood, Illinois. I was excited to have my own kids grow up on our family favorite pizza. The new location is a little bigger than theist location. It is usually empty but lots of returning customers take out. We celebrated my birthday dinner when my family from Chicago visited and they were pleased minus the no liquor licenses just yet. The staff is always friendly and remembers us. Authentic Chicago thin crust is always cut in squares and of course you can't complain about the sauce!"}
{"text":"As a former Chicagoan who grew up eating at he original Aurelio's in homewood from the old oven, it fills the void until I can get to Chicago. The service is mediocre, they need to make their customers feel welcomed"}
{"text":"Been here before. But this time I brought a big ass group of people. Family from out of town really loved it. And once again I was taken care of by marcelo. This guy knows how to do customer service. I'm in customer service, and I gotta say this guy knows how to do it. Took care of my family and I, we will definitely keep coming back. Pizza is the bomb, but the service makes it even better. How often does an employee remember you? Well this guy remembers me by name and all. Good sh.. lol"}
{"text":"\"Chicago\" pizza? the sauce was weird  and the cheese taste like cheese nips. They aimed for Chicago but it wasnt anything like Giordanos. Service was good but the food wasnt. I wont be going back."}
{"text":"Thin crust Chicago pizza...WTF??  I thought that Chicago was all deep dish...but it isn't...and guess what...it should be.  The thin crust is good, and the ingredients are fresh, and the pizza is cut interestingly...but in the end...it is not special at all.  It is also a little overpriced for what it is...average pizza...maybe slightly above average...but not enough to warrant 4 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered today but was reminded of why I did not order from them for almost 2 years. The sauce tastes like something from the can without any seasoning. The saving grace for this place are the appetizers. 

The pizza sauce? Bland.
The cheese? Generic.
The customer service? Nice.
The price? Overpriced.

I will not order from this place anymore. I was honestly thinking of ordering from Monte's Pizza but couldn't remember their name until after my boyfriend got home and the pizza had been delivered."}
{"text":"Chicago pizza at its best!  Grew up with Aurelios in Homewood, IL and let me tell you the Vegas One got it spot on.  New place on Craig/Jones Lowe's plaza is bigger and nicer.   With no disrespect to the deep dish, stay with the regular.  It's what Aurelios is known for.  Service was great.  Pizza sooo good.  Brought back 6 half baked/frozen to CA and that should ride us over until next Vegas trip.  Worth every cent!"}
{"text":"The help is super friendly. It's in a good location. The pizza was burnt so we came back another day and same thing. Over cooked crust. The salad bar was good.  I think it's too expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"We finally ventured here after quite some time going to other local Chicago style pizza places. We were not disappointed. Both of us ordered the 799 lunch but Cheryl each coming with salad bar mine came with a 6 inch small pizza which was perfect sized for lunch and my wife had an Italian beef. The server being herfirst week of work did a great job and everyone was really friendly thanks guys we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering at the Aurelio's on Craig (we didn't know it was there so we'd been going to the one on Cheyenne). 

I'll give them 2 because the pizza was delivered quickly and it was hot, but the two thin crust pizzas we ordered were garbage. The crust was not that thin and the texture was awful. Both pizzas were very salty, especially the pepperoni (the other was tomato, spinach, mushroom). We also had a coupon for a free appetizer and got fried mushrooms. They were bland, not worth actually paying for. We will go back to the Aurelio's on Cheyenne. Their pizza is much better. 

My husband's comment: \"Ouch-Elio's thas right cuz it hurt my pocket and then that nasty pizza hurt my mouth, it gave me bad breath and had people calling me yuk-mouth for a week. Ouch-Elio's should make dog food cuz my dogs loved their pizza....my dog chubby loved the pizza so much it had him licking his paws.\""}
{"text":"Gross.  Super salty, super mushy, just all in all a gross Pizza.  Have had it twice now.  First time I swore it off forever.  Second time my girlfriend ordered it thinking it was a new Pizza place.  Got the same soggy, gross, salty, disgusting pizza that they served last time.  They like to say real pizza is cut into squares.  Well real pizza doesn't have the consistency of bread left out in the rain.

Just really gross avoid at all costs.  Also very expensive for low quality food."}
{"text":"I freaking love this pizza!!!  I personally like thin crust pizza because I don't feel like I have a gut full of dough after eating one piece.  It is pricey but if you like thin crust, totally worth the money."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. The pizza was delicious. I've eaten at many Aurelio's franchises over the years, and this is easily the best you will get outside of Chicago."}
{"text":"Aurelio's Pizza recently moved from Craig/Commerce to this one at Craig/Jones in the same parking lot as Lowe's. Same high priced pizza with many misses in the flavor department. I called to order a medium 1 topping pizza and the girl who answered was friendly and let me know the order would be ready in 15 minutes. Walking inside the tables all looked clean, but the floor was filthy and there was a smell that wasn't appetizing in the air. I walked to the counter and let them know I was picking up an order and then I was rung up. The total shocked me because I only ordered a medium 1 topping how could this be almost $20??? 

Thin Crust Pepperoni ($17.75 for a medium) - With tax my total was $19.21 which is outrageous for 1 pizza of this size and toppings. The sauce was sweet and actually, I liked it. The sauce was the only thing I liked. The cheese tasted spoiled which completely ruined the pizza. The pepperoni couldn't even be picked off, it stuck with the spoiled tasting cheese that wouldn't even stick to the crust. With each first bite the cheese and pepperoni just slid right off in all stuck together in one piece. I somehow made it through a square and a half (it's cut in squares) and then had to throw the rest on my plate out. The taste of that spoiled cheese was just too much. Aurelio's Pizza might be a long loved pizza chain, but for me there was nothing to love and it wasn't worth the money at all."}
{"text":"Tried the Super Six \"The Works\" pizza last Saturday. The ingredients were fresh but the cheese tasted like it had turned. For a $25 medium pizza I would expect the toppings to be spread around instead of dumped in one place. They didn't even slice it, they criss-cross cut it into little squares. Why would you do that?"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I grew up eating Aurelio's. It was always my favorite thin crust pizza in the area! When our family went back to Chicago last summer for a visit, we made sure to have Aurelio's. It was delicious, as usual.

My parents retired in Las Vegas so we were all thrilled when Aurelio's opened there. We would always pick up a pizza on our way to visit them from the various Aurelio's locations. We even picked up one over Thanksgiving from this sole surviving location. Last week was the first time we sat in the restaurant to eat the pizza rather than having take-out.

The best part about our experience last week was the very friendly and attentive staff. We also enjoyed looking at the Chicago memorabilia displayed on the walls. And, the antipasto salad seemed much more generous when served on site rather than taking it to-go.

But, the taste of the pizza was somewhat disappointing. It did not taste like the pizza we have at the Aurelio's in Chicago. It really was just ok. However, I imagine we will still stop by here again when coming through town for nostalgia's sake."}
{"text":"One of the real, original Chicago pizzerias. Franchises can always be a little hit or miss, but so far this location hasn't let me down. I grew up with the original Aurelio's since the very early 80s, and this place gets the good right. 

This location is new, clean and comfortable. Service is just ok, but when the pizza is done right like it is here, I couldn't care less!

Get the Bosco sticks, and order your pizza with light cheese, extra sauce and well done."}
{"text":"Good tasting pizza...cheddar taste,  sauce is awesome.   The lady cashier could be more friendly.   And the inside is ok.  TV' s to watch game.  The teriyaki wings are ok..I asked for extra crispy for better flavor.  Its a good pizza option when you want a different taste."}
{"text":"This is some of the worst food I've had in a very long time. The salad on the salad bar was wilted and the pasta salad smelled terrible. The pizza was dry and tasteless with thin crust, hardly any toppings, and cut up into about 30 squares as if it were about to be served to a group of kindergarteners. The tortellini was gluey and dry. We also ordered wings which weren't half bad, but considering how rude the hostess was (you'll know her by the ten pounds of makeup she is wearing), I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love their pepperoni and jalapeño pizza!"}
{"text":"Eh....we had heard from friends that the wings were good and my Dad was in town for a visit and was craving Ital. food, so we gave it a whirl. 
Eh.
The wings were good, the cheese stuffed bread (Bosco sticks, i think?) were good, garlic bread good, fried cheese, fried raviolis all good.
BUT notice....those items all dont take much prep.

We ordered a pizza, I don't mean to 'brag' of sorts, BUT i truly think I KNOW thin crust pizza....this was not 'it'. The cheese defeinitely tasted strange (cheese nips, from another review is 100% accurate). I honestly can't belive this has become a chain of sorts. Rosatis IS bettter, by at least 100% and they are friendlier.

Would I eat here again? For beer and bar food, sure, pizza and pasta-no way."}
{"text":"Always love eating pizza from here. When I go back to Chicago, I don't usually eat Aurelio's cause there are some many other Pizza places to eat at, Like Giordano's. Not that I wouldn't but It's like a Pizza maze and you can't eat them all, besides White Castles consumes most of my eating binge! But Aurelio's is top notch, and if anyone wants a little sample of a Chicago Style Pizza place then you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent prices on their lunch specials. The salad bar is great with all Italian meats and cheeses to add on your salad. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food! We've eaten here many times and everything we have tried has been amazing! We definitely love having this little gem in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very good Chicago style pizza. They load the toppings and the crust is amazing. They should bring the lunch buffet back but other than that its the best chicago style pizza here in the Valley"}
{"text":"So here is the deal, the owners are not the best customer services representives and the lunch buffet can be a hit or miss at times.  however the pie is good when ordered fresh and they have cheap beers."}
{"text":"I love pizza and Aurelios. The pizza itself always fresh and delicious. The wings are crispy and I LOVE their hot wing sauce! Friendly staff and atmosphere also, great specials."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza with just sausage is the best in this town It is not a cheddar pizza. It is made with 4 cheeses and a sweet pizza sauce. I am from Chicago and use to eat at the Homewood Illinois one. The problem with this one is the people working there!!! Everytime we  eat there they NEVER give the correct change and are hard to understand. Last visit, I had, buy a pizza get the 2nd pizza half off. Well, the pizza was $25.50...I got $10.00 off that is not half off!!! And When I paid they cheated me like they always do...If the bills $43.22 and you hand them $50.00 your only going to get $6.00 back. It happens everytime with them, and when you confront them, they look at you like they dont understand english or american money, and I'm sure they dont!!! Suggestion to Owner/Corporate fix this problem you may get better business. P.s the garlic bread for $3.99 is good, but u get 4 tiny pieces!!! Not worth the cost!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I eat here it always taste like true Chicago food, from their Italian Beef to thin crust pizza amazing!"}
{"text":"I ate at the restaurant about a year ago and thought it was okay, but overpriced. It took a free kids meal from my kid's school to get me to try the place again. I actually liked the pie more than I did the first time, but because the certificate was expired by one day, they wouldn't honor it. ONE DAY....REALLY? I asked the young waitress if she was sure the manager wouldn't honor the certificate and she reconfirmed he would not. 

We would have ordered more food and perhaps even cocktails and they would have made more than the 5 bucks off AND made loyal customers. Instead, we will never go back. Bad way to treat neighborhood locals. Clearly not savvy in marketing and building return customer business.

ps.......the joint was empty. Wonder why."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok nothing to run home n tell mom about, walked in was not acknowledge had to get up n ho ask for a menu got the pizza wings special nothing came out together"}
{"text":"Best 'za in Vegas. Great place to watch da Bears game. They open up early on Sundays and you can buy a square in the pool. Efficient delivery service too..

My boy Dahmer and I would sometimes grab a pizza and eat it outside after a rough day in the dives..."}
{"text":"Yea, just A-OK., unfortunately! I paid for the salad bar, which was good, I love salad. Then we ordered the Calabrese stuffed with cheese, spinach, mushroom, and pepperoni. At this point you would think yum that must have been full of flavor - but it wasn't and that is why I'm giving them only 3 stars. 

It was good, don't give me wrong, but it could have been so much better. It tasted like one big flavor of ..... I don't know, I couldn't tell - cheese, maybe? And then the ultimate turn off for me at a pizzeria - Canned mushrooms!! Really? How hard is it to buy a pack of fresh mushrooms. Canned mushrooms are gross, don't do it, please. 

I was a little disappointed, since it looked very appetizing but it definitely lacked freshness and flavor. I hope they will work on it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times. I'd honestly be giving this restaurant at least 4 stars for their food but the telephone service every time ruins it for me. First I called and spoke with a women who told me there is a 3-4 min wait for making a delivery order so I said ok. I was fine with this until I was on hold for 15 mins. I hung up called back and the same lady had picked up she then took my order to interrupt me while paying over the phone that she is going to put me on hold again because she has customers.... I'm sorry. Am I not a customer? I called back in 5 mins to just say may I please just pay so I can get my food. She took my card information and address after repeating myself over 5 times. Skip the hassle of the phone service and just walk in. The cooks make good food but this lady every time ruins their credibility."}
{"text":"Good pizza it's all in the sauce which is excellent.  Don't let the looks from the outside fool you. It's a big place inside and clean.  I would not get the salad bar it wasn't that great. The pizza was really good."}
{"text":"Went back to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke, not at all. By far the best pizza I have had in Vegas. The only reason for 4 stars is that I live on the west side and a bit of a drive for me. but it is worth the drive. Wish there was one on the west side."}
{"text":"The past year we have gotten take out pizza numerous times and they have been very inconsistent. Most of the time my pizza is undercooked, crust is way too thick for thin crust, cheese is not to edges and lately very salty. They just raised their prices. This Aurelio's  pizza taste nothing like back in Chicago. I can't wait for Giordano's to open on the strip, so I can say good-bye to Aurelio's. I hope someday soon Sanfratello's Pizza will open a franchise here in Las Vegas so we can get some REAL Chicago thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Aurelio's has a pretty good pie.  It is walking distance to my house.  And with the option's around where I live.  I would order Aurelio's.  It is a Chicago thin crust spot.  Despite what you think of Chicago Style Pizza it is very good.   It's like New York but squared.  To tell you the truth they have plenty of promotions to match there pie's. 

If your in the Northwest area looking for a good pie and chill place Aurelio's has you covered."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this a higher rating...but after having food from the original location in Homewood, Illinois. 

This location just LACKS...it lacks reasonable pricing, it lacks the taste and freshness the parent location offers.  

Hopefully they get some better deals other than a large pizza, 16 wings and a 2 liter for $40."}
{"text":"Super delicious!! The stuffed pizza is so good and their hot wings are amazing. Their marinara sauce is really good."}
{"text":"STUFFED PIZZA. The only 2 words you need to know. They weigh like 9 pounds and 1 piece is dinner. $20 bucks feeds a family of 6 or easily feeds 4 hungry men. Overpriced? I think not. Average? No way....

We came to Vegas from NW Indiana and used to drive over 1.5 hours to the nearest Aurelio's. How excited were we when we just stumbled onto a VEGAS location. We couldn't believe it. Story is, one of their customers liked it so much they talked the company into letting him open one here. All the ingredients are shipped from Chicago daily, and it's exactly like Chicago!"}
{"text":"I had this review on their other location (which shows \"closed\" but really it's just \"moved\" to this location)....

{"text":"Ended up at Aurelio's again for a dinner. The boyfriend wanted pizza and ordered the \"AYCE\" buffet, which includes their pizzas as well as a salad bar. 

On the other hand, I did not feel like pizza so after going over their menu, which didn't offer much more than pizza, I decided on a Chicken Parm Sandwich. I opted for the grilled version over the typical breaded chicken parm.

Sandwich - meh. Not great, not bad. They serve up their sandwiches with a huge heaping of bland fries. They also give you an extra container of marinara sauce. My sandwich was dripping in marinara though, so I didn't need it. 

Overall experience - OK. Again, this place is just one of those pizza chains hanging around town."}
{"text":"Aurelio's is one of the best pizza places I have ever had. Something about the cheese on the top that kind of bubbles just makes such a unique flavor and the sauce has a pinch of a sweet flavor to it that it makes it amazing!!"}
{"text":"Finally an Aurelio's Pizza in Las Vegas that is doing it right and following the rules!
Great pizza when they are made the way that Joe made 'em! 
Well done guys, well done. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The best pizza place in town you guys were the best thank you so much joe for the gift cards and giving us our whole meal for free the food was amazing you don't meet nice people like this anywhere this was the best customer service and some of the best food I have had in years !!!"}
{"text":"No one felt like going out in the heat, so we ordered in a pizza - thin crust, mushrooms, pepperoni and garlic. The phone service was great, the delivery time SUPER-fast,even though it was the lunch rush.

But, unfortunately, the pizza wasn't really all that, in my opinion. The toppings and flavor were alright, though quite salty -- the sauce was sweeter rather than zestier, but the garlic was cooked well and the pepperoni was sufficiently savory.

The cut it in squares (like Marco's, which is way better, IMO) and I do like that kind of cut.

But I didn't care for the crust. It's definitely a Chicago-style crust -- not chewy, not crispy, kind of airy and bready, even the thin crust. I think if that's your thing, you'll like this pizza -- it's just not my jam.

They're pretty pricey for pizza, so beware.  $17 for a large, plus $2 per topping. By the time we were done (added on cheesebread at the last minute, but received cheesesticks), it was a $33 pizza.

Meh."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER* !! I have NOT tasted the food here! My review is based solely on a phone order I tried to make for delivery. 1. They should probably hire people who can actually hear wat your saying ! The lady on phone was horrible, she can't hear when yur trying to tell her yur address, I even used police talk (p as in Peter, z as in zack lol) and she kept getting the letters wrong no matter how many times I yelled it out to her! Mind yu, It wasn't even loud in the back and they didn't seem busy! It took her 13 mins just to get my address correct! 2. I finally told her what I wanted (shrimp Alfredo) and guess wat! THEY DONT HAVE SHRIMP! Why the hell is it on the menu then?? 3. I'm still hungry! Thanks for ruining my lunch !"}
{"text":"my husband ordered a med pepperoni pizza and a bucket if chicken fingers (around 16) and tue total was $48 and change! for a digornio size pizza(store cost $6) and a bag of tyson chicken fingers(store cost $10) they had the nerve to charge me 3x face value! this is ridiculous and will not recommend and will put them on blast every chance i get! unable to return and get money back bcuz i didnt cancel delivery b4 it arrived! didnt no wat cost bcuz husband ordered! kicking his butt!!!"}
{"text":"This new location is very inconsistent. Service is either things or decent at best. 
Staff is always friendly enough, but items, such as fries have changed... The fries the old location had were fantastic, these are not good. 
Have had to remind to fill up items on salad bar a couple times, such as lettuce. 
Today, ordered a need sandwich, only to be told they're out of beef. Really? How can an Aurelios be out of beef... 
As a regular my whole life from the Homewood location, this location has a lot of opportunities.
Changed star rating until increased service."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day. I don't think I'll go back.

I paid like $11 for the all you can eat, plus a soda, and a tip for the guy. Really not worth it, friends. 

The pizza was super thin crust, the toppings were sparse, and it wasn't too hot. It was actually kinda cold considering how \"fresh\" the guy claimed it was. Plus the salad wasn't the best. Also, it took the guy forever to refill my drink. He spent the majority of his time chatting with some guys there whom he apparently knew. 

The worst part is that once I sat down and started eating, I kept on thinking \"man, there's a Subway like three feet away. I'd much rather be eating a hot sub...\""}
{"text":"Even if your pizza is good, if your customer service is non-existent then you were only worthy of a one star rating. I ordered delivery to my hotel in Vegas, Which included pizza, spaghetti with meatball, And chicken wings. The driver shows up with my food gives it to me without any utensils, napkins, Pepper flakes, etc. so this begs the question how my supposed to eat my spaghetti without any forks? Well my kids and I had to improvise after the manager told me that he could not send the driver back to give me any utensils and napkins because the store was \"out of stock\" on those items. He suggested that I go downstairs and get those items from the hotel. So, for that you get a one star. After all, the whole point of ordering delivery so I do not have to go out. As far as the food goes, the spaghetti and meatball were clearly microwaved. I know, because me and my kids had to stick my fingers in there and they were called spots and hotspots. My suggestion is eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"I must begin by stating i am proudly FROM CHICAGO!  I have never had the opportunity to try Aurelio's there. I am happy to find one here in Vegas near my house. I have been on the look out for anything Chicago and this is is the closest i found (so far).  
I ordered a STUFFED pizza with 4 additional ingredients. Sausage, spinach, onion and garlic.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!  We also got a spinach and cheese Calabrese. which was.... not bad. The decor is cozy. All four Chicago sports teams represented, old photos of Joe and his family and and a cute little salad bar. 

My only complaint. BEWARE IT CAN GET EXPENSIVE. 
But the pizza was very tasty so I WILL try them again! (on payday).  ;-)"}
{"text":"As a Chicago Native  I grew up knowing what authentic Chicago Pizza and Italian Beef is, that being said, this place is on point. Toasted Italian beef wth cheese and sweet peppers dry and they nailed it! Hubby ordered a small Pizza, only downside?, they didn't cut it in squares! Lol.  But the pizza was amazing!! Sauce is more on the sweeter side which is my favorite kind. 
When I lived in Chicago we had an Aurelio's down the street, and this one is very much like that location!! Can't wait to go back!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Aurelio's before and had the buffet. For the price, it was decent. However, I brought my husband here and the owner hardly acknowledged us at the door and told us to \"Give him a minute.\" There was one table occupied in the restaurant and we stood there with no acknowledgement for at least 5 minutes. We have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant and if it were busy, I would understand. We saw there was one pizza on the buffet line and asked if they would be making more to put out. The owner said he didn't know. After being ignored for a few more minutes, we left and will not return. I will not be treated like an inconvenience for average pizza."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious! Had antipasto salad and the works pizza! Great flavor and a lot of sauce. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to our first pizza joint in Vegas and had an awesome dining event. This place was so holiday festive, clean-clean-clean, with a very efficient and friendly waitress (Nicole). We ordered the thin crust-6 topping which came out hot and oh so yummy. Fresh bell pepper, sausage, cheese, and a sweet and slightly salty tasting paste. It was all so delicious. Dessert for us was the cheesecake, which was just perfect. This is a very family friendly place, two big screen T.V.'s, holiday music, and not to forget, a very fresh small salad bar. We are going back next week to try their French Dip. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"All I ask for in a Chicago style thin crust is a crunchy crust, melted cheese and a great sauce.  If the toppings are of great quality it just makes it that much better.  I asked a guy I met at a gas station in a Chicago Bears ensemble with Bears and Cubs stickers all over his car if he knew of a good Chicago style pizza place here in Vegas.  He turned me on to this place, if I ever see him again I'm going to kick him in the baby maker and take 30 bucks out of his wallet.   I worked in Chicago for a year and definitely tried all the big names Lou Malnati's, Uno's, Geno's East and many mom and pop places... First of all I had it delivered so I can't comment on the restaurant itself.  When I called the gentleman was nice and informative of his product however told me I was out of his delivery area by a mile.  He did say that he would do it this one time to get me hooked and that they were really slow anyway.  I now know why they were so slow...  Food sucked!  I got a large pepperoni and meatball for my buddies and I, on the phone he said 30-40 minutes for delivery time, it took over 60.  Once it arrived I noticed the delivery driver was holding the container at an angle and thought maybe the handle was crooked or something.  OH NO!!! He was holding my pizza at an angle because when I opened the greasy bottomed box the pizza was actually so discombobulated I had to pull slices off of each other.  The pizza was so cold that it was like trying to pull a grilled cheese apart.  The meats were burnt and the meatballs were just chunks of beef, not little balls or thinly sliced actual meatballs.  The sauce was flavorless and the only taste that truly resonated throughout was the burnt cornmeal that they used to keep the dough from sticking to the oven.  If you want good pizza; stay far, far away from this place."}
{"text":"Geaux Saints!!! I mean Bears...

There are a few Pizza joints in the same vicinity as Aurello's but in must admit hands down some of the best pizza in the neighborhood. 

I stopped in last night and ordered a Small Spinach pizza with Alfredo Sauce and it was pretty tasty.

The restaurant was pretty empty and the food came out quick which is a double bonus!!

Aside from the Calamari I could definitely see myself ordering again soon especially from the UberEATS app!!! 

Bill $32.00 

Small Spinach Pizza 
Calamari I don't recommend*
Cheesecake Slice delicious** 
Fries"}
{"text":"My order was made pretty quick and it was at a decent price. They have an excellent chicken parm sandwich. They also have a really good appetizer option, they were fried ravioli that were filled with a jalapeno cheese and served with marinara sauce. I will surely be back to try everything else."}
{"text":"A pretty good Pizza, I live near the North Cheyenne location, but think the South Eastern store s better. Try them both and decide for yourself"}
{"text":"Great SAUCE!  We had the Spicy Ravoloi and the Cheesey Garlic Sticks to begin our meal.  The pizza was awesome.  Service was a little slow but the FOOD was great."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the WORST pizza, and worst food I've ever had the displeasure of trying to eat. I ordered a \"stuffed pizza\" with a sampler appetizer plate to go.

Being from Chicago,  I know what a stuffed pizza should look like and taste. This monstrosity of a \"pizza\" looked more like a pan pizza layered in red sauce. 
And for the sampler platter, the onion rings were cold, frozen and uncooked in the batter. The 4-cheese ravioli was uncooked as well. 
And as others have mentioned, the crust was doughy, crappy and inedible.  
Please avoid this place at all costs. There are other \"Chicago Style\" pizzas in town that are miles better than this slum. And the service from the counter help was, at best, lousy."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this is a nice, clean, and quality pizza place. Probably, if I never had had it before, I would have given it 3.5 to 4 stars.  However, I set myself up for failure as soon as I saw the sign.  I was born and raised back in the 60s & 70s with the original in Homewood Illinois, then in Joliet, then in NW Indiana, etc..  Service her was good, atmosphere was nice, salad bar was a little challenged at best, and the pizza was just not of the standard and quality it once was; sorry Joe!  I'm starting to look at the great food that I once grew up with like funerals.  I don't do funerals anymore as I would much rather remember those as I last knew them.  It's the same with a lot of the food, especial pizza, that we grew up with in the Chicago area.  The old generations are long gone, as is that work ethic, personal pride, and the loss of \"quality\" ingredients that was used back then.  The new generations are attempting, and doing a pretty good job of it with the younger generations, to recreate a product that I feel cannot be, but life must go on. Those same ingredients, hard work, personal pride, customer service, etc., is something that cannot be bought or reproduced. I was better off with the memories on this one!  It is better to have had the original and loved it, than to have never had it at all! :("}
{"text":"Worst place ever! I don't eat pork my husband order out food I went to pick it up. I asked to check the pizza there was pork on it I asked him if he could we make it he said no I asked him if I can get a refund he said no the cook dicks his fingers through the pizza takes the ham off hand me a pizza that looks like a two-year-old just played in it they didn't care that the pizza wasn't what I wanted they didn't care that I have religious reasons and allergies to pork they didn't care at all I will never ever eat from here again"}
{"text":"Note:  I am a huge fan of the original Aurelio's in Homewood IL and the \"old oven\".  We went to this N Las Vegas location with high hopes.  Good food! The pizza is good but did not try the deep dish pizza.  The only real draw back for me is the location as I live on far southeast side of the valley, but if I were closer I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is easy. No Strombolesies, no calzones. Pizza is way overpriced. Service staff knowledge of product or is marginal at best. They had to refer to the menu to answer my questions. We have lots of pizza places in this area this one will not survive."}
{"text":"Overall this place is a nice Pizza spot. I have tried many things from this place and of course most important is the pizza. The sauce is really nice and tastes homemade and much different than the other pizza around town. The cheese is nice and has a great taste as well. Overall I would give it a 7/10 which is pretty good seeing I am fairly picky with pizza. 
I tried the toasted raviolis and those were fantastic. I also tried the Antipasto salad which was fair but nothing special. Overall give this place a shot if you want to try a good pie."}
{"text":"The hubby had their pizza at a friend's house and couldn't stop talking about it so I had to try it for myself. I wasn't disappointed. The sausage on their pizza is nothing short of amazing, I believe it's homemade. The crust and cheese are the perfect amounts of crunchy and gooey. I've yet to dine in at this location but will do so in the near future! The interior is very kitschy old school pizza parlor looking."}
{"text":"Best thin crust sausage I've found in Vegas. I'm willing to drive from Mountains Edge for it.  Om nom nom"}
{"text":"After wonderful reviews from a friend who calls this his home town pizza and a sweet gift certificate, we had to give this place a try.  So happy that this one opened up closer to home and one lazy evening we went and ordered a medium super six, dinner salad with hot bacon dressing and the appetizer platter with bread sticks, calamari and wings.  
LOVED the hot bacon dressing and with the bread sticks it was AMAZING.  Wings were ok, your typical pizza joint wings and the calamari was ick, rubbery and lacked any flavor.  We both thought the sauce was great but the HUGE chunks of sausage and probably 3/4 of a green pepper on our pizza was a huge turn off for us that's all you could taste  Admittingly we prefer sausage on a pizza that is very tiny and pretty scattered all over....so this place may not just fit our tastes.  We've agreed that we will go back and try the pizza/salad bar one time to give another chance as the Mr has had a bite of the Ham and Cheese Calabrese and said it was wonderful.  
All in all service was outstanding and the place was super clean, but at 830 on a Friday night I expected it to be more busy...new location or ah just another pizza joint? Only time will tell."}
{"text":"Pizza quality has gone down since it has opened!  We used to be regular customers on Sunday to watch the Chicago Bears play!! Since the 2012 season has started, a family has come in to take over the place! They get there and hour and half before the game to claim there table and decorate the place like there HOME! ( by the way they don't take one table they take up five to six tables)!  They save the tables for there friends and family who show up an hour or two after the game has started!  You cannot walk around to get to the pizza buffet without them in your way!! The owners don't seem to notice that a lot of customers have stop going since these people have taken over the place!  We will no longer be eating here or going there on Sunday to watch the Games!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, and great service! There's only ever a few people working but they get the job done. Don't be put off by the mom and pop shop look, this is debatably the best italian restaurant in town. HIGHLY recommend you try the Chicken alfredo and the thick crust pizza."}
{"text":"I love it when I stumble upon a Chicago themed restaurant by accident. Tonight it was only the second time since moving to Vegas That I was surprised in that fashion.

I was a little concerned since there was only one table seated and I was only the second and it remained that way for 3/4ths the time I spent there. 

I was also concerned since Chicago is known for their Deep Dish pizzas and New York is known for thin crust pizzas. 
Having Seen all the reviews loving the thin crust I should have given it a try but dining alone I went for the The Original! Aurelio's Italian Submarine Sandwich. 

It was pretty darn good. Great combination of flavors and portion size. Fries I believe were frozen but had a great crunch and were perfectly salted.

I may have to stop by the next time I'm on this side of town for paintball (only 2 miles away hint Hint)"}
{"text":"This place took over the dim sum failure from last year. Looked forward to a good pizza place in that location.
The staff was very friendly and courteous. It was 4:30pm and we were the only ones there. 
We ordered a medium thin crust pizza with mushrooms olives and onions with a side of calamari. 
The calamari was pre-manufactured frozen variety with a freezer burned batter.
Hoping the pizza was better- well after one bite we preferred the calamari.
I can't really explain the flavor- but it was one of the worst we had ever have. First it was cut Chuck Cheese style, square cut, and served on a wire grate which is possibly the only way you shouldn't serve gooey pizza. 
The cheese was a bizarre blend of a grainy texture even melted. The sauce was a very thin tomato sauce. The mushrooms were good ! 
We eat  two square pieces and boxed it up for the kids to try. They looked at it and didn't try it- so no review.
Too bad ..a really nice store and location."}
{"text":"I ordered from UberEats on 2/11/17 and ordered the create your own pasta dish. I asked for the mostaccioli (which was an option) with Alfredo sauce and chicken. Placed the order and paid. I got a phone call shortly after saying they no longer offer the mostaccioli as an option for UberEats so I was forced to pick between spaghetti and fettuccine. Food came, and it was decent.

I convinced my boyfriend on Sunday 3/12/17 to re-try this restaurant because he wanted pizza. I ordered off their menu the create your own pasta again, the way I wanted it back in February. The waiter had to \"run and check\" and of course they just ran out of mostaccioli. I don't understand why you can't re-stock the pasta you offer on your UberEats menu and your standard menu in a month. 

We also decided to do their trio appetizers, and they didn't have the four cheese fried ravioli. So we decided to just do double cheese sticks and wings. Well, before our appetizer came out, my food was brought to the table. So we asked that we cancel the appetizer order since we ordered it to eat BEFORE our meals. Shortly (about 3 minutes) after my food arrived at the table, my boyfriend's pizza did. Also, the mushrooms I added to my pasta... weren't cooked. So I had cold, raw mushrooms on my fettuccine and Alfredo sauce. 

The food isn't bad here. But the service and the inventory / menu selections aren't accurate. I don't like to eat stringy pasta and love that the option is written in two places to have a different pasta.

This place needs to get it together. We won't be returning."}
