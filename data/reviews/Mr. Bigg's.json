{"text":"Excellent food and drink specials for everyday of the week! Kitchen is open until 1am and there is an awesome rooftop bar. Bartends are easy on the eyes and very entertaining. Mr. Biggs is a must!"}
{"text":"We purchased the yelp deal which we attempted to use mid March but when we arrived a woman behind a locked gate informed us there had been a recent mass exodus of staff and they needed to hire and train new staff before reopening.  We just happened to be driving by on our way home Saturday at about 8:00pm and noticed a lighted open sign.  We thought we should go in to use the yelp deal for fear of another closing.  We walked into a large space with no patrons with the exception of my husband and I.  We sat at the large bar where two female bartenders stood behind waiting to serve.  Carissa waited on us.  She handed us a sticky dirty laminated menu that pictured bar food.  We ordered a couple of drinks passing on the food.  My drink was weak and served in a plastic cup.  I get the plastic since it's a concrete floored warren of filthy stairways, hallways, rooms filled with stacked tables and chairs, dead ends and locked exits.  But we didn't get an opportunity to look around until we had finished our drinks because Carissa, our bartender, did not stop talking about herself the entire time.  We gained more knowledge about her than we ever wanted to know.  She hardly took a breath...what an ego.  We finally got a word in and paid our tab. We walked up to see the afore mentioned space.  On our way back down we heard loud arguing from the staff concerning bar duties.  When we turned the corner and they saw us they lowered their voices.  In the words of the incomparable Betty Davis, 'What a dump!'"}
{"text":"Finally somebody has taken over this giant castle of drinking. We ended up wandering over on St. Patrick's day, but this bar did not get the message that it was a holiday. Even despite that and the crowd of ten total people inside doing semi-lousy karokee, Biggs has some potential. On that Tuesday night, they were featuring 2 for 1 drinks and discounted bar food. The two pizza slices and sports bar style tacos were forgettable, but they would hit the spot for any  budget friendly drunk person. They have a full menu, so I will need to try some and most nights they have drink and/or food specials. The $1 cans of Bud Light seem to be a great deal on Wednesday? This is another new place that did not seem to renovate much from the last tenant, but I would be happy if the crowds never found the place and it stays open. Bartender was nice and rooftop bar was featuring a steady cooling breeze and a great view of the action down below."}
{"text":"The all you can eat wings on Wednesday were an incredible deal and they were so delicious! Very crispy, not too dry or drippy, my girlfriend and I highly recommend! The burger I had was good. I think it was the buckhorn. The fries were not the best in town but the onion rings were great! I can't stop about the wings though, you NEED to get them! We sat on the rooftop and the atmosphere was perfect. Not too crowded, very calm, I'm sure this place will pick up soon. The yelp deal brought us here and I'm glad it did. It was very much worth it."}
{"text":"This place just opened up a little over a month ago but I love it already!
There's three floors each with a full bar- this place is HUGE! My favorite is the rooftop patio on the third floor. Downstairs is nice too though, on the weekends they clear out dance floor space on the first floor.
The food is GREAT! So far I have tried wings and a burger with fries. Both were very tasty.
Everyone who works there always seems to be in a good mood! Even when they're swamped with customers they still smile. I really appreciate that because a lot of the \"best\" bars in Scottsdale really have sub-par service. Mr. Biggs definitely stands out in terms of service."}
{"text":"Ryan was our Bartender, it was his first night working there and I thought he had worked there for years! He was nice, fun, knowledgable, and definitely made my experience better! I would never have come to this bar but I got a buy One get one drink card so I checked it out and I'm so glad I did! Him and Brianne were amazing! They were very talkative and friendly! I was scared
At first to check this bar out because it was dead but everyone was super nice and I will most definitely be back!!!"}
