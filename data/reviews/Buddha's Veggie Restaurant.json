{"text":"Definitely had better fake meat/veggie buddhist experiences. Mostly things were overfried and greasy, and mainly batter instead of the actual protein. I hope this isn't the best Calgary has to offer the fake meat enthusiast!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed coming here last night. The food was really good. We had the veggie dinner for two. The only thing I wasn't super crazy about was the soup. I subbed hot and sour soup instead of the creamed corn. I despise creamed corn and corn in gerneral. The soup was gelatinous not really what I expected. I didn't love it but I still finished it so I didn't waste it. My significant other didn't even touch his he smelled it and passed it over to me.

My favourite part was the veggie ginger 'beef' it was really good and filling. I really enjoyed branching out and trying a new place."}
{"text":"Fantastic faux meat dishes!  The black bean sauced green beans are to die for.   Service is ok, portions are nicely sized, food is great, prices are a bit steep but I'll be back.  I'm addicted to vegan chinese food.  

BV now serves meat dishes too though.  Kind of perplexing, but I imagine being a veggie restaurant in calgary was kind of a hard sell.   Oh, and there's a $9 min. order/person--the waitress was kind of abrupt about it, but if we hadn't ordered another dish it would not have been enough food."}
{"text":"Awesome vegetarian place... great food, good service, fast and clean. I take my friends here everytime!"}
{"text":"We've been going here for years for the vegetarian menu. Nice flavours, even though all the dishes are made without onions or garlic.

I recommend the black pepper \"beef\" Shanghai noodles. Much better than a lot of conventional western-style Chinese places in the city."}
{"text":"I love vegetarian food, especially when it's a celebration of vegetables and grains; whole, natural foods cooked to perfection.  Buddha's Veggie has some tasty, tasty food, but I just can't get over the fake meat thing.  

The first time I went to BV was a few years ago and I was blown away - it was tasty stuff - and meatless!  It's a novel idea.  But each time I have it, I think more about just how much stuff goes into covering the fact that you are eating overly processed soy (seriously, just look at the ingredients listed on soy \"meat\" products!)  Or maybe BV is serving up tofu...but you never can really tell because they try so hard to mimic meat that they've masked what is actually in your food. 

The things I do like about Buddha's Veggie are, well the veggies!  The vegetable dishes are fresh and yummy and often less commonly used produce.  The rice is cooked to perfection.  And, for some people, there is something to be said about being able to taste \"ginger beef\" when you don't actually eat meat.  

I kind of chalk Buddha's Veggie up to a tasty novelty - but  it's not something I'd want to eat regularly."}
{"text":"I love this place. The vegetarian and vegan options are plentiful and great quality. Sunday dim sum is my favourite."}
{"text":"I recently dined here with a friend. So not impressed. We tried phoning four times before going to see if they were even open. No answer. Then we had to wait ten minutes even before being greeted. We ordered our drinks and then our food. I will give props that the food came out pretty quick, all was well until the bill came. The server dropped the bill and then told us if we pay debit or credit we have to tip. Didn't ask how everything was, or offer a dessert menu.  Excuse me? I work in the industry and that is not acceptable. A tip is given based on service given. We were never quality checked while dining over two hours. No wonder there is a hand written note looking like garbage on their door saying \"short on labour\". Also the air conditioner was blasting. Its January and in winter."}
{"text":"Finding restaurants that have a good variety of vegetarian and vegan food on offer can prove difficult in Calgary. But at Buddha's Veggie they have two separate menu's, one with your usual meat dishes and one menu entirely devoted to veggie dishes! It feels like there is almost too much to choose from (we are talking around 70 dishes!), this is a strange feeling to a vegan when it comes to dining out! 

I chose three items from the veggie menu, 'Veggie Ginger Beef',  'Veggie Lemon Chicken' and my favourite, 'Veggie Beef in Black Bean Sauce on Rice Noodle'. All three dishes were delicious, and the 'meat' was succulent and tasty, it felt eerily similar to the real thing! The 'Ginger Beef' was amazing, it was slightly chewy as the texture mimicked real ginger beef very well. The batter on the 'Lemon Chicken' was light and crispy and the sauce very lemony and yummy! The 'beef' in the 'Black Bean Noodles' was my absolute favourite, it was just spectacular, the right texture, taste and colour, no words can describe how tasty it was! The vegetables in the dishes were all very fresh and cooked perfectly too. 

The staff were very friendly and politely answered any questions I had with great  knowledge of their menu items. The atmosphere was lovely, the restaurant itself is clean and bright and furnished in a nice modern yet warm and comforting style.

I will be back again very soon now that I have found this gem of a restaurant, next time to try a few different items from the veggie menu, I have quite a lot to get through but I am sure none of them will disappoint! Yummy!"}
{"text":"My traveling partner and I stopped in at Buddha's Veggie right before we headed for the U.S. border, sadly ending our adventures in Canada and returning to the land of Canadian entertainers. We were there on a weekend day so we ordered dim sum instead of regular dishes because vegetarian dim sum is as rare as a cast of Saturday Night Live sans Canadians. Their haw gau (shrimp dumplings) were a really good imitation. They even got that yellow paste inside the wrapper (what the hell is that anyway?) tasting like the real thing. Their siu mai (pork and shrimp dumplings) were decent as were the steamed pork buns. Most dim sum dishes were $3-4 but you must order at least 3 per person to feel remotely full. If I lived in Calgary I bet my gf would make me come here a few times a month but instead, she has to suffer disappointing dim sum experiences in California where she can only eat jielan (Chinese broccoli) and the occasional egg tart. Vegetarians never get any love during dim sum (except at Buddha's Veggie)."}
{"text":"If you're a long time vegetarian like me and still get those meat cravings sometimes, Buddha's Veggie is the most satisfying \"fake meat\" out there. I know some might be put off by the concept, but order the ginger beef and you'll be converted for life. Super friendly and cute staff -  the place is truly a vegetarian's most delicious guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"I loveeeeee this restaurant. Every time I vist Calgary I make a point to go here. Nice decor, many many veggie  options, nice staff.

I have not eaten meat in almost 15 years, and have tried many fake meats. This restaurant has some of the best \"veggie meats\" I have ever had. I have sampled many dishes from their menu, but my favorite has to be the vegetarian sweet and sour pork.

Highly reccomend"}
{"text":"I like this place. Haven't had anything even approaching a bad meal. 
Still as good, after the move to the new place and the addition of carnivorous food; note that they even keep the frying oil segregated between the meat and veggie sides for purists. 
A chance to try all the weird things carnivores eat like stir fried eel in vegetarian format, as well as the vegetarian  classics."}
{"text":"Buddha's Veggie = possibly the worst meal I have ever ate in my life. Normally, I don't feel comfortable writing such a scathing review on yelp, but the meal was inedible to the point where the food was actually disgusting. EVERYTHING WAS FRIED! EVERYTHING! We ordered four different dishes: the beef, chicken, ribs - ALL FRIED, and deep fried at that. You can't even taste the fake meat...the oil dripping off of every single item disguises the crappy fake meat that Buddha's Veggie serves. After realizing that our entire meal was deep fried shit, we payed the bill and just walked out...the first time that we ever had done that at a restaurant. 

Normally, a waiter will try to salvage the situation - after she asked why we didn't want the rest of our food, she simply said, okay that's fine. No \"can I bring you something else...or what could we do to make this better?\" Absolutely no service, no appreciation for the customer, and a god-awful meal...STAY AWAY from Buddha's veggie at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"Went today for Sunday Dim Sum. Out of vegetarian dishes we got, some were really good, some were so-so. I'm a big fan of the barbecue ribs and the gluten (even though its really weird texture). I think as I get a feel for the dishes I like, it will become even better. Also, the dishes are really cheap, a big plus.

Not sure about whether the meat and veggie food are prepped together, but I guess that doesn't bother me much.

Also, in contrast to Tiffany N's issue with waiting forever, there was almost no one in the place when my friend and I got there, and service was very fast."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Even though I'm not veg I still love coming to this place. So yummy! Great service too! The 'spare ribs' are by far my favorite, followed by the ginger beef and the lemon chicken!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch for the first time in years, and was pleased to see that it's still a great place to eat!

The menu has changed so it's now got meat options (a bit confusing when one person is looking at the vegetarian menu, and the other is looking at the meat-eaters one, and you can't figure out why they're so different), but otherwise it's still the place I used to love.

Although we had one ommnivore (me) and one vegetarian (my sister) eating, we both ordered the (fake) Ginger Beef lunch box special. Steamed veggies, non-meat Ginger Beef, and steamed rice - for $8.50! 

The flavour and crunch was good (even with the veggies), although I wouldn't have minded the ginger sauce being a little more gingery - it was good, but could have packed more punch.  Portion size was huge, the service was extremely quick, and we left sated, with leftovers, for just $22 (including tax & tip) for the two of us!

This is definitely going to become a more frequent lunch spot for the two of us!"}
{"text":"Carnivore? Vegetarian? Vegan? Somewhere in the middle? It doesn't matter, everyone should try Buddha's Veggie Restaurant! 

I've been doing 'Meatless Monday' for a while now as a way to expand my comfort zone by trying some new food and recipes, lessen my environmental footprint and the health benefits are obviously a nice perk. 

So this Monday, a quick Yelp search for vegetarian restaurants lead me to Buddha's and it did not disappoint! You have the choice of ordering either from a meat or a vegetarian menu, both of which spoil you with choice. It is very much a fusion restaurant, serving dishes inspired by Thailand, Malaysia, Szechuan, Peking and more! 

We decided on the Menu For Two, which included the following dishes:

-Tofu cream corn soup... it was delicious.
-Water chestnut soy roll... it had an almost sausage-like texture, also delicious.
-Veggie ginger 'beef'.... OMG this one blew me away. Delicious! 
-Stir fried mixed vegetables... exactly as the name describes, and delicious.
-Steamed rice... enough said.

Now before I make this restaurant sound too much as a hippie's delight, I should put it out there that I am not generally a soy / tofu eater. But this meal made me forget I was eating vegetarian and was a delight to my taste buds. And if you prefer to stay away from 'fake' meat and eat veggies instead, there are lots of options for that as well. As a bonus, they even highlight gluten free options on their menu as well! 

The food blew me away, but the only thing keeping this review from being 5 stars was the atmosphere which could be a bit more unique. This certainly didn't impact our food experience, but atmosphere plays into the overall dining experience. 

I'll end by saying that I'll be back... and not just on Meatless Mondays!

{"text":"Just wrote my first review which covered a terrible experience I had.  I wanted to balance things out so I thought I would review my favorite restaurant in Calgary.

Me and my family have been going to Buddah's Veggie for about 10 years.  It really has everything you want in a restaurant, and even real meat since they switch over to \"Fusion\" cuisine a few years ago.  If you're a vegetarian but you still like the flavor of meat, you won't be sorry.  We usually get take out and the food remains hot and yummy after a 15 minute ride home.

We have on occasion ordered real meat dishes for my wife's family and they got good reviews as well.  One rather rare (these days it seems) that they have is consistency.  95% of the time the food is good and essentially the same as it has been previously.

Our \"core\" order is Veggie Dry Rib (regular spice), Candied Pepper Veggie Chicken, Veggie Beef & Broccoli.  Our second tier includes Satay Veggie Beef with Gai-lan and Assorted Veggie Meats in Coconut Curry Sauce.  Some times we get steamed rice, sometimes we make quinoa at home.  Reheating it is a breeze as well...we usually have two-three meals out of an order.  

On the negative side, a few things that we don't order include the coconut rice.  We love coconut rice but there's hardly any flavor there.  Anything that's got a heavy breading on it shouldn't be ordered for take out...just doesn't hold up well.  The Deep-fried Veggie Chicken Balls are just okay.

The last thing I will say is that the servers are very friendly and have always been that way since I've been going.  Try it out..."}
{"text":"We came here for Dim Sum with a vegetarian friend! We were able to order the usual dim sum options as well as veggie versions.  Everything was delicious!!! The regular options were just as good as the places down in Chinatown, and the veggie options were really tasty! Service was wonderful, the girls who worked there were very attentive and sweet. Loved it! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"As the restaurant's name implies the food at Buddha's Veggie is vegetarian but one of the things that Buddha specializes in is faux meat. You read correctly - faux meat, meat made from vegetables and grains. The ginger 'beef' doesn't really taste like ginger beef but how ginger beef should taste -mouth-watering and gingery not greasy and stringy. The dry ribs are better then any real dry rib I've ever eaten. And it's all trans-fat and MSG free.

Squarepeg's Tip of the Week: 
Buddha's Veggie is a perfect place for a first date. The conversation is guaranteed never to lag because in between discussing politics/weather/towels (or whatever it is you discuss) you will be talking about how amazing and interesting the food is."}
{"text":"Was brought out with a couple of potential coworkers during a working interview.  One of the girls and I decided if we were going to a vegan restaurant, we wanted to try a full vegan meal (even though the manager reminded us there was a meat menu) 

I was very pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoyed the \"ribs\" in orange sauce,  \"beef\" and veggies.  As long as you know you are not actually eating meat, and keep an open mind - you will really enjoy it. 

Only thing that turned us all off (including the vegan in our group) was the braised tofu and mushrooms.  I have had tofu on many occasions and usually enjoy the dishes.  But this was silky tofu and very off putting.    They need to use a firmer tofu (maybe fry it beforehand to give it a nice texture)."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where, upon trying it, you tell yourself \"I should have tried it a long time ago.\"  This is the best Chinese cuisine in the West.  The Won Ton soup alone is worth going for.  Friendly, human service that is never rushed yet is blazing fast.  Just go there."}
{"text":"My meal at Veggie Buddha was a bit of a mixed experience.  I am not a vegetarian and I found the faux-meat to be not very convincing, I had the dry ribs some Shanghai noodles with mixed peppers and \"beef\".  The ribs were tasty, but strange, and the \"beef\" in the noodles was evidently tofu based.  

Overall I left the restaurant wishing I had ordered meat dishes instead of dishes that tried to mock meat.  The service was quick and efficient, and interior of the restaurant seemed ok, but not overly clean.

If you are a vegetarian in the mood for \"chinese\" food, this might be a place worth checking out, but meat-eaters should check out 'Dragon Gate Restaurant' on 33rd AVE. SW"}
{"text":"If I wanted to eat something that tasted like beef I'd eat beef.  The fake meat at this place is pretty terrible and much more expensive then real meat which also tastes batter.

 If you want to eat over priced, chewy and flavourless vegetables this is the place to go.  If you want to eat real food then your best bet is to go just about anywhere else"}
{"text":"Coming from Vancouver, we were expecting mediocre veggie Chinese. Lucky for us, the food was really great. We ordered the veggie beef and veg in black bean sauce and in the first bite, my bf was worried, and wanted to make sure we actually ordered from the veggie menu, which we did. The \"beef\" looked and tasted very similar to real beef. We also ordered dim sum, and was really impressed as well. The restaurant is on the smaller side, but the service was great. Has a real mom and pop shop feel and authentic as well. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Indeed interesting!! Full marks for the innovative style...we had the combo for 2...soup, rills, ginger beef, stir fried veggies & 2 portions of rice for $29.99...super cool!! Food was yummy too...even my 19 months daughter liked. Family friendly & ample seating."}
{"text":"Okay. I've been here three or four times now over the past three or so years, and have a couple comments on how things were and how it's changed.

First of all, the first time I went here it was veggies only. I was honestly hesitant, and usually still am, only because I am not a particularly adventurous eater. I won't necessarily just try something just because it is there. But the spicy dry ribs and the ginger \"beef\" are really good.

When I went back one time last year, my friend and I were surprised to see that they have meat on the menu.  I decided to be adventurous and ordered something for me.  Big mistake.  All I remember is that it was a chicken dish, and that it was really greasy.  It was certainly not a nice dish, and I did not enjoy what I managed to eat of it.

Bottom line, I would recommend Buddah's if you're vegetarian or vegan.  If you're going for the meat dishes, go somewhere else.  Perhaps Buddah's needs to adopt a UNIX-style philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well.  Stick to the vegetarian dishes that you have become known for.  Don't try to branch out excessively by adding meat dishes to the menu.  I also can really see why so many people would be upset with the addition of meat dishes.

Oh yeah - one more thing.  Get rid of the televisions!  I know there are \"only\" two of them, but they are a MAJOR distraction while eating - the eyes get drawn to them as a moth to a flame.  There really is no reason to even have them in the first place.  If I had a TV-be-gone I certainly would have used it!"}
{"text":"Trying to be Vegetarian was impossible in the Chinese department.  

This restaurant is amazing.  How the heck do you make ginger beef without the BEEF!!!????

Amazing!  I am on the road to becoming fully Veg and this place makes my day.  Everything they serve that is mock up meat is 100% vegie, and 100%  AWESOME.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS like 5000 stars."}
{"text":"Okay. This place has finally redeemed themselves, in my eyes. True, they may not be solely vegan anymore, but seeing as how I'm the sole vegan in my group of friends or when I'm with my family 99.9% of the time, I'm glad we have a place where we can all be happy. 

I didn't stick around this time, just grabbed some takeout. The corn chowder was like a soothing balm on my nauseated tummy. Also... vegan dim-sum! Hooray :D. Ordered vegan versions of what I see my friends order elsewhere all the time; Siu Mai and little \"shrimp\" pouches. The \"shrimp\" pouches were my favorite of the two. Those four bombs of deliciousness disappeared first. Also, I had to order the dry ribs again because it's my favorite thing on their menu. Got a meat dish for my companion (so he wouldn't gripe and accuse me of forcing my \"hippie food\" on him again) and they lovingly labeled and separated it from all the other food. The lady taking my ordered was in a cheerful mood; a complete 360 from the bitter-beer-faced sour puss I dealt with the last time I was here. 

Buddha's Fusion, I am no longer mad at you. Disappointed that you couldn't fight the good fight and remain vegan, but if that's what you had to do to continue making those dry ribs that I love so much... I forgive you."}
{"text":"The veggie ginger beef is deadly. It's better than any real beef one in the city. Everything is non-greasy and of such quality!"}
{"text":"Greasy, unappetizing food. I'm allergic to dairy and eggs but my family eats everything. I called prior to reserving and was assured there was ample variety to order from that did not contain eggs/dairy. Upon arriving, they said they could only guarantee one item. Family ordered a few meat dishes and I ordered the only vegan option. Terrible service (didn't bring us water the entire time we were there.. Asked on four occasions), inattentive and rude. Food was over priced and lacked flavour. Just don't go... Especially if you are vegan, just don't go."}
{"text":"You've gotta love fake meat. No, seriously, you have to, because it not only looks like (and kind of tastes) that bloody slab of flesh you're craving, but it's way better for you. 

That being said, Buddha Veggie is known for its use of the fake stuff, and they use it to great success. The ginger \"beef\" was way better than other ginger beef in this city (although the ginger beef from the Chinese place at the U of C comes pretty close). I also had the deep-fried tofu which didn't come out as I expected, but was pretty tasty. 

If you've never gone veggie, this is the place to try it out."}
{"text":"Only went for dim sum. Veggie meat dishes were fantastic. Thought it actually was meat. Will come for dinner another time to check out other dishes."}
{"text":"Inconsistent food. Horrible service. This place use to be good. Veggie ginger beef is now just fried batter. Owner didn't care when we let her know. Oh well. No need to support this business anymore. We also waited for 30mins for our fried batter food."}
{"text":"Food is good, very good dor vegitarian... You don't even realize it is not meat. Ginger beef is especially awesome! 
 Prices too high though."}
{"text":"Good service, and great food. My family is vegetarian and we love the won ton soup, ginger beef, sweet and sour pork, and the lemon chicken. I was disappointed when they added a meat menu, but they keep the meat separate from where they cook the veggie food."}
{"text":"This is one of the original veggie places in cowtown and I remember it being this special treat my grandmother would take me to as a child for my birthday (as I was the only vegetarian in my family and no one wanted to eat veggie with me - gasp!).   Times have changed - this place has moved and also has morphed into a half veggie and half meat place (and more people support veggie places with me - awww)

Anyway  this place is always great for double dates with other half veg and half meat lovin couples as no one has to compromise.   This place also has two whole kitchens and the food is prepped completely separate from the meat  for those who are very concerned with cross contamination. 

I enjoy:
veggie ginger beef
veggie crispy peppered eel
weekend dim sum in it's sum total
bubble tea

I find it interesting when I've there in mixed veggie and meat lovers company and we order regular ribs and veggie ribs and they meat lovers sample the veggie ribs (substitute whatever other dish)  and the reactions range from \"that's amost the same\",  \"oh that's good\", or \"this is even better\".   Big veggie win particularly given how meat loving some of my friends really are.     BTW for the meat lovers reading this,   the dishes that are better are because they are often less fatty or greasy in the veggie form. 

This place relies heavily on meat stimulants (for better or worse other veggie people) but they have EXCELLENT products.  I like some meat simulations but not all and I try to avoid them but these are good.    The little shrimps are even white with little orange stripes painted on them which is cute. 

I also don't usually like Chinese food at all not only because of lack of options but also because it can make me quite sick feeling (a combo of MSG and grease?)  so this is one of the only places I will eat.  I still sometimes feel a little unwell from here but it's far less likely than MOST chinese spots. 

This place is a bit pricey but good and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Being a vegan couple isn't always easy when you live in Cowtown, Alberta. Luckily for my Wife & I, we came across Buddha's Veggie. The restaurant is cozy, the atmosphere comfortable, the staff quick & polite, and best of all - an amazing veggie menu full of all vegan meat replacement meals. My wife had the \"Beef\" & Black bean with Rice Noodles, the Ginger \"Beef\", and the Lemon \"Chicken\", and were blown away by each dish. Tasty & affordable, this place is a \"must-see & must-eat\" place for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters alike (meat eaters will be shocked at how closely the tastes, looks, and textures mirror such favourites as Ginger Beef! Trust me, as a meat eater previously for 25 + years, I know my meat) - we will definitely be back & can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"A Chinese Vegetarian place with a massive massive vegetarian menu.

There is a separate menu of Canadian-Chinese-fusion  dishes for those people who insist on eating meat. Order off this and get what you deserve.

If you behave yourself and stay on the vegetarian menu - you get

a) a massive menuload of choices

b) very very fresh cooked just perfectly al dente vegetables

c) a realization that the menu is not really as big as you think because 48% of the menu is taking those vegetables and putting a different sauce or stock on them and 48% of the menu is taking various forms of Chinese veggie meat and putting the same stock or sauce on them.

 d) some oddball sauces. We had 48% of the menu veggies in a \"Portuguese\" sauce - which turns out to be a chinese white sauce with massive amounts of turmeric in it to make the sauce traffic light yellow. Like any Chinese white sauce dish the food is bland and comforting. Chinese white sauce's job is to moisten the food to help it go down while maintaining the original taste ... sort of like a more all natural  more socially desirable form of msg. the strategy really worked and the veggies were mild but yummy. The yellow color was a constant source of amusement.

e) a few really really oddball dishes. we also had vegan spare ribs with strawberry sauce.

vegan spareribs are tempura batter made really really thick so the \"sparerib\" is two to three inches high cylinders of pure fried batter. Inside is a very thin very small rectangle of vegan pork. the strawberry sauce is a very restrained only slightly sweet only slightly strawberry mild drizzle. my bet is they took strawberry jelly and mixed it with white sauce at the rate of 1:30 or less so the strawberry adds just a soupcon of sweetness and a bit of color.

vegan spareribs are not at all \"good for you\" the way dishes in an asian vegetarian restaurant are supposed to be. i chowed mine down quite happily.

f) a chinese vegetable soup which was the same 48% of the menu vegetables in a mild vegetarian stock. the soup was fine.

***

if you like your Chinese food to have massive taste sensations - so you like Szechuan red vegetables with 900000 tons of chinese pepper, or American-Chinese orange chicken with an overpowering comforting sweet and orange taste -

i.e. if you are a chinese food rock and roller and you like your food to blast you away - then this is not your restaurant.

if you like subtle flavorings on very good vegetables, then this is a fine place.

Sometimes we eat vegetables to calm down and restore ourselves to our purer nature.

You can do this here without having to go macrobiotic veggie pious spartan."}
{"text":"I remember Buddha Veggie came into the scene over 20 years ago when they originally opened on Southland Drive. Now they're in the Chinook area. I'm not vegetarian but I can see how delightful and freeing it must be for a vegetarian to be able to eat everything and anything on entire menu. My favorite dishes are the vegetarian salt and pepper squid (essentially deep fried salt and pepper julienned shitaki mushrooms) and the fried rice noodles with veggie ham. 

I have to warn you that this place caters to Western palates, which means prices are jacked way up and  portions are small. Hence, you won't see very many dining Asians here. Although they are mostly authentic, they sometimes bastardize traditional dishes with horrible results. We ordered congee one time but it was gooey with very little rice. Fun fact: congee normally takes an hour to make and is supposed to be soft with the consistency of light porridge. Theirs was gooey, sorta chunky and obviously thickened with corn starch. Even the token white person in our party (who is married to an Asian) complained the texture was unauthentic. If they can't fool a white person, how can they expect to fool Asians? 

Other than this hiccup, the food and service is generally good. The restaurant is quiet and rarely ever packed. Buddha Veggie is a treat to enjoy once in a while but I'll stick to my Shanghai Classic for more authentic Chinese fare."}
{"text":"I was in town, planning a dinner with a vegan friend. We decided on Buddha's Veggie for obvious reasons, and met for dinner. Since it was just the two of us, and there were plates already on the table, wee figured it would be best to order one plate and split it. That's usually what I take the plates on the table to mean at asian places; you are gonna get a lot of food on one order. And that was so! We got the stir fried veggies and shanghai noodles. Well, shortly after ordering, the server returns, and tells us that there is a min charge of $9 per person. Our noodle plate was only $12.50 (which I did think was a bit pricey) and our tea wasn't gonna make up the difference. I was surprised they would have a min charge so high, especially at a sharing place. Well, we got spring rolls too, and that seemed to satisfy the woman.

The noodles were bland, and the veggies sparse. The spring rolls were good. The tea pot was not refilled.

Overall, I was rather disappointed. This was on a rainy Thursday night, so it was not very busy. I do not think I will be going back, unless a veggie friend really wants to go there."}
{"text":"It's such a treat when you're vegetarian and there's an entire menu dedicated to vegetarian eats!! The veggie chicken menu items are particularly tasty. Veggie chicken chow mein, Kung pao veggie chicken, veggie chicken and black bean sauce... All very yummy. Quiet at lunchtime and they have specials. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I think this was the third or fourth time I've ever eaten dim sum. So if you're a dim sum specialist, you may or may not have differing opinions, because so far I think it's all pretty darn tasty.

I met up with some other yelpers for a Sunday brunch. Once upon a time I read that Buddha's had changed their menu from just vegetarian to half regular, half vegetarian. And their menu is exactly that. Half regular on top, and vegetarian dishes on the bottom. 

It wasn't busy on this particular Sunday, which was great, we had our pick of one of the great big round tables with the spinny plate on top to move the food around in. The service was good, and we ordered so much food, I could barely waddle out the front door when we finished. Even then, it was a cheap meal.

Standout dishes for me included the Chinese donuts, the deep-fried bread to go with the Conji, the Chinese broccoli, and of course my all time favourite BBQ buns, though this one we ordered from the veggie menu. We also had a plate of something that was supposed to resemble BBQ pork I think? And by resemble, I mean it didn't contain any meat. It was a little odd, like fatty pork, but overall not bad to at least try.

There's no cart service here, you order off a menu and they bring it all out for you. But don't worry, if you didn't get enough, or you want something else... you can always order more!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I are vegetarian and wanted a place where family (meat eaters) could take us out for dinner but still be able to have a great selection of food.

We easily made a reservation for 7 people on a Friday night just a few hours ahead and we were easily accommodated.

I was surprised to see two different menus, one vegetarian/vegan and the other with meat. I thought this was excellent to see so non-vegetarians don't get scared off. They also happily removed bell peppers from an item I ordered due to my sensitivity/allergy.

The other 5 people in our party decided to split one of the pre-planned Meals for 6. The dishes seemed a smaller than I expect, even for 5 people to share. The dishes were served one at a time and each person had a chance to try each dish. They were very full at the end.

The only downside of the whole meal (which is why I removed a star) was that one of dishes in the Meal for 6 had a crazy crazy hot pepper. Watery eyes, burning mouth, and sweating ensued. We even started daring people to eat the pepper and we all did cause why not... Many regrets.

I will definitely come here again in the future and bring vegetarian and non-vegetarian guests with me."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night here and the food was great! It gets a 3 out of 5 as its nothing special inside and the AC was jacked.. I hate eating in sub zero temps. 
All their food is vegetarian yet they mimic every classic chinese food dish ie: ginger beef, lemon chicken . As a fan of seitan ( the wheat meat) I can honestly say it tasted almost identical! Super fresh veggie in the chow mein to and i asked... No MSG!"}
{"text":"To Buddha's Veggie:
You used to be super rad and I used to go to you on special occasions (you are pricey compared to other vegan chinese 'round town) such as my birthday when I was still in junior high and high school and living in rural Alberta and it was like a treat. I came to the big city JUST for your vegan ginger beef.
However, last time I tried to hit you up with my mum, we ended up walking out. WHAT IS WITH THIS VEGGIE FUSION THING? And now there is MEAT on your menu? What the hell. After years of being a quaint little vegetarian chinese food place, you sell out like this? Sorry Buddha's, but I am holding a grudge against you.

{"text":"So I have a love-hate relationship with places like these. I mean the types where 'everything is vegetarian friendly even the meat sauce.' That is because I was a vegetarian for years and I *hated* fake meat. I like vegetables and legumes and all of the wonderful things you can do with both. I am not just trying to eat fake bacon and 'chicken' nuggets. I do like tofu and seitan but because of their own flavor or diversity, not because I think they are meat substitutes. 

Anyway, I love places where I don't have to wonder what's on the menu, it's obvious. However, this is also the sort of place that does vegetables and the such well. The dishes have tons of flavor that isn't just based in salt and sugar. Things are made well and there are a variety of dishes, not just fake meat. They have truly vegetable-based plates and they have things like ginger 'beef.' 

The prices are a little steep, I must say. The entrees were between $13-$17 and the appetizers ranged from $6 - $10 ( if it wasn't the veggie platter). There were also quite a few desserts and some beer/wine on the menu.

Something to be noted: there are two menus, vegetarian and meat-friendly. There are also notes about gluten free options, which means this is a great place for a mixed group. I would definitely recommend the double-fried tofu. It's about $8 but it's definitely the sort of appetizer you can split with a group of about four."}
{"text":"This was fantastic! We are from out of town and went as as group of Vegans & Omni's which can be tricky. Everything was very fresh and super well seasoned. The pineapple rice and black bean sauce with sautéed beef were to die for. 
Our only issue was that there was a drastic delay in time between dishes being served (20 min between the first and last) which left a cpl members of our party a bit frustrated. Otherwise very friendly service and quality food."}
{"text":"If you love ginger beef, come here and try this vegetarian version! It's good for the environment, good for your body, good for all the teenage cow tippers out there and best of all .. it's delicious. 

The consistency of the ginger beef was spot-on. I couldn't tell I wasn't eating meat. It was delicious, filling and fresh.

This is a comfortable cosy place with kind staff who love to serve vegetarian food and do it well. That's the impression I got after my first time eating here. I came at lunch time. I ordered a lunch special. For those men out there who don't want to come... Hot chicks eat here. I saw them.

Ginger beef is to Calgary what General Tao chicken is to everywhere else... It's like orange beef or sesame chicken... Meat with a crispy coating tossed in a sweet/spicy syrupy sauce. 

And this restaurant does ginger beef well... extremely well! Except it's not beef if you don't want. They serve beef and real meat here as well, so perfect for those who want to ease into trying the veggie delights slowly. For those of you who are vegetarian, have just watched the documentary \"Hungry for Change\" or just want to eat less animal products, this place is for you. 

Normally I would take off a star for serving vegetables that look frozen to me. But my entire lunch meal was so delicious and so well-made that I can't give it less than five stars. A totally satisfying delicious lunch under $10. For this I got hot steamed white rice, ginger veggie beef in a sweet spicy sauce with finely sliced green pepper, and some steamed vegetables including fresh broccoli which was delicious. 

Minnie was my server. Big smile, great service and hope to see her again."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a place where I hope I don't have to go back!!.. Everything was fried... And greasy!!..  I felt like I gained 3 pounds in less than one hour eating there!!.. I ordered the ribs, and the meat was almost impossible to see.   The rice was not awful, but I have tried better!!.. And the price of this place is not cheap. I think it is better to go to the food court in the chinook mall and the food is going to be much better!!... The service was ok, but not great. Unfortunately, I have nothing good to say about this place!.. :("}
{"text":"We attended the CMYE at Buddha's Veggie Restaurant for Dim Sum.  It was nice with 7 people attending.  Did you know that Buddha's Veggie Restaurant has both veggie and meat dishes now?

We sat a nice round table with a lazy susan.  We ordered lots of food - both vege dim sum and meat dim sum.  I liked the Shrimp Dumplings (Har Kow), and BBQ Veggie Bun - steamed (supposed to be pork but made to look like pork).  The Seafood and Chicken congee (choke) was a little pricey for such a small bowl.  I was surprised that the congee came in such a small bowl.  

The surprise items that the other yelpers liked were the Chinese donut (yow char kway) and Chinese donut rice crepe.  The donut tastes best when eaten with congee.

Service was pretty good.  The waitresses spoke pretty good English.  

We were all so stuffed after our delicious dim sum lunch.  It was so nice to meet new people at this yelp event. 

Thanks to Wendy P. for organizing!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat vegetarian, however I would recommend this place if you want to try something new. I started with the curry pockets and those were a fantastic way to begin, it started with a crunch then a light hit of curry.

I also had a special which was fresh mango chicken on veggies. I was very impressed with the flavors and the chicken was consistent and made me second guess if it was a chicken ball.

I also had the sweet and sour pork which reminded me of what you would get in a more western Chinese style location.

The texture and flavors of the dishes were good and the facility was very clean and could work for business or fun, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I love these guys. One of Calgarys very few veggie options. I would definitely go back. The lemon \"chicken\" is to die for."}
{"text":"The second time I have been here. Last time was over 10 yrs ago.
Very clean and updated...service was very very good...Ordered Ginger beef which was very good although too sweet, and had to use the pieces dry rather than sauced up. Also Drumsticks and dumplings and Chicken fry rice. Everything was Vegan. Seperate MEAT menu!

I would recommend it highly"}
