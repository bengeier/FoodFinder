{"text":"Hero burgers!!!
I love hero burgers!
This joint is relatively big compared to others I've been to.  Their burgers are 100% angus beef. Very juicy and delicious. I'm also a big fan of their fries. You also get to pick your own toppings in the burger and the sauce.
The wait is a little longer than your usual burger joint, but its worth it.
Although it is kinda pricey, I don't mind as long as they deliver a quality burger.
Great place to drop by and have a burger."}
{"text":"I had high expectations when going to this place because every one talks so highly of their food, and it's suppose to be \"healthier\". 
But I felt that their burger was raw and not cooked properly. And It didnt have any taste. I only went there once, and never again. 

I prefer Johnnys burger or bad boys burger, now that's real tasteful burgers."}
{"text":"Very good Burger. Beef is good quality . 
The fries is a bit salty and too soft. 
Maybe Hero style , 
Next time I just stick with the burger. 
Service is nice. 
Will be back"}
{"text":"Hmmmm, one of my faaaaaavourite topics....  Over the years, I've had some fantastic burgers...  In recent years, THE BURGER has become quite hyped in the fast food community and places like The Burger's Priest has really given burgers a great deal of creativity & flare.........  

That being said, for me- Hero Burger is still the Gold Standard as far as I am concerned...  A couple of my friends recently came by and brought their kids to visit me.  They brought me a huge burger from a place called \"Five Guys\"- fully dressed..  THE VERDICT......?!?!  Hero Burger WINS by a mile!!!  How so......?!?!

*The quality of the beef
*Freshness of toppings
*That gorgeous Hero Bamboo Charcoal Bun
*overall juiciness & flavour

My only only minor gripes with Hero Burger are:  we need more great toppings FREE OF CHARGE (saut√©ed onions) & better savings when we make adjustments to our combos...  Example:  it's too expensive to upgrade from fries in our combo to a Poutine as well as upgrading from a regular drink to a shake....  If they can give us the customers better deals, then I'm certain their business will grown even more exponentially, because they can more than back-it-up in taste, quality and presentation.....  Bravo Hero"}
{"text":"I am more of a chicken person so I like to come here for their chicken burgers, which are delicious. It's just pure chicken breast goodness. The price isn't too bad either.

Their sweet potato fries are also very good!"}
{"text":"Hot dog bread was so soggy and looked nasty! Their poutine  tasted horrid and their tables  WERE SOO STICKY! !!!!!!! NOT GOING TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN"}
{"text":"Employees were anxious to go home it was around 10 pm and rushed my order. Felt very concerned. I also got my brand new car, It was the only thing that made me happy that night! Sigh."}
{"text":"In my opinion, these guys have the best fast food hamburger around. Great topping selection and an incredible patty."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out their veggie burger. Their website has an allergen info page which lists what's vegan friendly. Though it would have been even more convenient if their main menu was to indicate that as well. They sure don't shy away from mentioning whats gluten free. I guess the V-word is too controversial.

I do have to say their veggie burger is pretty tasty. For more info refer to my older review when I wasn't vegan. Overall worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went here last week. I've been to a different Hero Burger before and it was pretty good.
It wasn't busy at all and the guy working was absolutely not friendly when I decided to add a condiment to my burger. 

My fries were soggy and undercooked. I saw other people with crispy fries and my burger was really lacking, wet bun from the grease, very little sauce on the burger and small piece of lettuce. I've had better burgers at any other fast food chain. Either the quality control slipped or this was on purpose because of my need for ketchup on my burger, but it doesn't matter because I wont be back. Awful experience. Bad service and bad tasting food."}
{"text":"Yummmm! Yummm! Yumm!

It was crazy busy when we went and a bit overwhelming for our first visit.  I could barely hear the answers to my questions. So if you are trying it for the first time, don't visit during a peak time. Pricey but good."}
{"text":"This has to be One of the better locations!
After 2 visits I am happy with the service and quality of food. Doesn't take too long to get our orders, Gluten free every time with no mistakes. Good portions, good quality meats, buns and produce.
Although, I had the turkey burger here the other time and it was awful! 
But the beef, toppings, buns, fries, and pouring are great! 
 A little over priced (but that's not due to location) overall restaurant chain pricing."}
{"text":"Solid place as far as chain burger shops go. The patty is definitely a step up from anything the big three usual suspects can offer however, compared to gourmet burgers at places like Bamburger or Holy Chuck Hero comes up short which is understandable and reflected in the price point as well. The portions are just above average but very manageable.

What I really liked about this place is the variety of choices you have as far as toppings and bread choices go.

Service was also prompt and excellent as we were greeted as we walked in and our two-burger order was cooked and served in about 5 minutes with the correct toppings."}
{"text":"A little pricey but burger big enough for two meals, Love the choice of putting my own toppings on the burger, plus it's HALAL.  Btw Chicken isn't Halal/zabhi"}
{"text":"Hero Certified Burgers has arrived to Richmond Hill on Yonge NEXT door to Nando's Chicken, Tomo Sushi, and Kazan Teppanyaki.

I've had Hero Certified Burgers at most other SUBURB locations and this is pretty much the same Semi-Gourmet Burger that is from time to time a HIT or MISS scenario.

It seems to be a POPULAR spot for the teenage crowd as I see some hang out just outside the door and from time to time go in and come out.

I wrote this review mostly to display the MOO COW!  See other Hero Certified Burgers reviews for more details."}
{"text":"Great food :) polite owners, friendly atmosphere, and with a big table for larger parties. A \"most to try\" if you are in the area and enjoy burgers..."}
{"text":"This place the food and service is beyond mediocrity. I used the $5 coupon to order through the app, it was painful because the crew didn't know how to use the app & order the right thing,  they keeping making mistake after mistake.  It was such a waste of money to eat there."}
{"text":"There's no Coke Freestyle machine at this location!!! Big bummer.

The food was average Hero Burger standards. A little expensive as usual, and you have to pay for a lot of premium toppings/cheese/buns. A meal here could get pretty expensive. 

Honestly, I just wanted to use the Freestyle machine, and that's why I chose to eat here.. but I was really disappointed :("}
{"text":"Went here the other day for lunch. Though the service was standard, the food and atmosphere was top notch! Everything from the burger itself, to the toppings to the condiments was top quality. You can tell that the franchisee owner of this location takes great pride in his store. Will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Lately i feel like i only come on yelp to complain which is bad, but this burger was not good at all, super dry and chewy. If i had a fork i could of literally made mashed potatos out of the fries because they were so greasy and mushy.  I ordered side gravy and the guy put it in the bag upside down so thanks for all the gravy over everything, SMART....."}
{"text":"Burger is good here. Clean atmosphere. We were the only ones eating in there and it was very quiet which is nice. Got $5 off using the app."}
{"text":"At first I rated this 3 but decided to give it another shot. It was definitely worth while the 2nd time. I am not sure which experience is more common but I will go once more and see how they are again.

The zucchini relish and the hero sauce was a must and the burgers was well worth the wait the 2nd time around. The sweet potato fries were a lot better the 2nd time as well. Overall nice juicy sauce dripping burgers so I will go once more at least."}
{"text":"Owner would not honor Yelp combo offer! Hate it when companies are inconsistent like this. Don't bother having these promotions if you are not going to honor it.  In general I did not get a good feeling from this location, I think this is where franchising can tarnish your brand and image when you don't keep things in check.

Food was what I would expect, but just the attitude towards me trying to use a promotion really turned me off."}
{"text":"Here Burgers are organic lean beef burgers, and they are HALAL, with various locations mostly in Richmond Hill/Vaughan and Mississauga. The first time we tried Hero Burgers we fell in love with the juicy burgers and toppings. They have additional toppings you can add at a cost, if the charge toppings are the only ones you add, you burger will get pricey! Their fries are also the thick cut fries; milk shakes are also amazing and fairly filling. 
All in all, it is one of the best burger joints I have found in a while, minus the grease. It can get on the pricey side; it is above the price point of the mega giants - McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King. Then again you get what you pay for! I wish they had more locations locally, although I have heard they are planning to open up a lot more locations in the next 1-2 years."}
{"text":"Not bad if you want a step up from mcd's but with all the gourmet burger shops popping up, not great. 

Service friendly but slow. Took us 20 minutes to get two burgers and two fries. 

Burger is dry and tastes pre made. Their signature burger style is really good but with dry meat it kinda ruins the whole thing. 

Stingy on ketchup and fries were cold and dry when we got them. 

Southstreet is better and five guys is much much better. And same price."}
{"text":"Good Hero,
All of them follow a same recipe and menu obviously, so there is no question about the taste, but the service here is a little bit on the negative side, usually some amateurs behind the cash, so you wouldn't get an actual answer if you need some help with the menu for example.
Location is very convenient, parking is very accessible and easy.
Other than the service part which can be improved, it's a good spot"}
{"text":"Not a good burger. 

However, it is not the franchisee's fault, or the staff, or the cook. Hero franchises just do not provide an appropriate product for their franchisee's to sell. The burger is consistent across all locations, meaning that it is something wrong with corporate. 

The fries are good, as is the poutine, which is what bumps this place up a star, however, if this review were based solely on the burger, it would be a 1."}
{"text":"Absolutely Love the Hero certified burger. Ask the awesome staff for the Hero sauce on the side for your Fries, the best combination ever"}
