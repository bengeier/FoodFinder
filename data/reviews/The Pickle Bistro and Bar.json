{"text":"Had dinner at The Pickle tonight and had a great time.  The staff was very friendly and the food was just awesome! We started with the fried pickle chips which were very tasty. I had the Brisket with fries and baked beans. A great choice.  Their sauce is a tasty vinegar base that's really good.  Everything is home made. The fries are cut and cooked to order with a little mozzarella cheese sprinkled on top just to kick em up a notch ( as if they needed it). The baked beans were good. Tasted the Mac n Cheese as well.  I'll be  getting that next time.   I also tried the smoked chicken wings. You guessed it... I'll be getting that next time too. Go try this place out. You'll like it! Great place to eat and relax. Going back when we can stay longer."}
{"text":"Okay. First off, this is a bar. There is no bistro. Ignore that bit. I read the name and figured it was a bistro with a bar, not a bar. So ignore the name. Everyone else is here to drink. This is my penance for not reading yelp first.   It's also a private club with a short bottle beer selection. There is plenty of liquor for those who want that and a short list of five or so wines. No, your kids are not coming with you.  Still with me? Good. Because here is where it gets unique. There are shell on peanuts that have been brined in a dill pickle brine then roasted. Threw me for a loop at the first one I had because the taste is faint and I was unsure if I was tasting it. Not bad, but unique. It's a signature bit. Good idea for a place named the pickle.   So remember that bistro bit? I wandered in here for dinner. People raved about the burgers. The one I had was definitely smoked on a grill and was a solid performance. A good, dense standard hardware burger. The fries with it are better. Fresh cut and seasoned with a nice herb and spice blend that was just right. I say better, because they outclassed the burger. I'd almost eat these all night. I say almost because there is one thing better than the fries.   The wings. These are dry rubbed then smoked until they nearly fall off the bone. No sauces, except a cup of ranch on the side. You must eat these before you die. Then eat more of them. The magic of smoke permeates the wings, leaving this crisp smokey skin with that pink layer just under it. The level of smoke gives them a depth of flavor that I can still taste hours after I have tasted them. I can eat these and die happy.   So yes. I am ditching my kids, wandering into a bar and joining a club just to have these wings. If you leave this place without having the wings, you either hate yourself or hate chicken."}
{"text":"A really cool neighborhood bar in a historic building nestled in the city center of Dallas, NC. Charming, divey, unique and very southern. The smoked wings are killer and I'm obsessed with the pickled peanuts. There are plenty of TVs, a huge outdoor space with another TV. They have a BBQ smoker on site, wheelchair accessible ramp and plenty of street parking around."}
