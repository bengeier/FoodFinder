{"text":"Every Friday we go there for lunch and sometimes breakfast! The food is very good. and  the owners are wonderful people! You feel very welcome and they ALWAYS aim to please!!"}
{"text":"This is our new weekend brunch spot. The food is delicious and reminds me of a good home cooked meal. I've only tried the breakfast food here, and the coffees. They can make you any kind of coffee drink you can imagine. Some people stop by just to buy coffee. I always get good service and the food tastes delicious. Will definitely keep going!"}
{"text":"Milo and Nancy are the best, food is awesome! Support this local cafe you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is awsome! Very friendly staff and great food! If I lived in Arizona i'd come here everyday. Great experience."}
{"text":"cozy atmosphere, service was ok, my burger and fries were pretty good.  my mom's breakfast was not what we expected. she ordered bacon and over easy eggs...the pancakes were a bit over cooked and the bacon was very, very crispy and eggs were very runny.  the woman who waited on us said that's how the bacon is always cooked.  it seems like a nice place, but if you go there for breakfast and don't want extra crispy bacon, you must be sure to let them know.  and if you don't like runny eggs, order them over medium and not over easy."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant breakfast on the patio. I had the breakfast sandwich and my wife built her own omelette. We enjoyed both. I especially liked  the special thought they took to serve my fidgety five year old before everyone else. She loved her scrambled eggs. We will be back again. Thanks Yelpers for letting us know about this place."}
{"text":"Because of the prices and the food quality, I can't recommend this to anyone. I won't be going back.

This was the first time I came to this cafe. A friend recommended it because his dad likes it. I thought it was very clean and nicely laid out. The food prices are above average. The food itself is just ok (not okay, but just ok). I make much better sandwhichs for myself at home.  With better quality ingredients, and better construction.

One more thing. They allowed a large dog to come into the restaurant while I was there.  I love dogs, but not at restaurants. The worst part is when our server went up to it and gave it a big petting right after my food was served. Thanks for that.."}
{"text":"Service is great. Prices are fair. Food is delicious. I love the quiet local vibe this place has."}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood breakfast joint.  GREAT cup of coffee, and my girlfriend thinks they have the best fancy Frape's in town.  The Quiche of the day with a cup of tomato bisque served with Goldfish is the perfect light brunch.  For lunch the strawberry chicken salad or classic Chicago Style Italian Beef are great!

The staff is friendly and remembered me after my first visit.  I love the charming decor and comfortable atmosphere.  I consider myself a foodie and anyone I bring with me always leaves happy."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I waited 45 minutes for my food and the resturaunt was at maybe 50 percent capacity. I also witnessed the cook plating ready to eat food without gloves or washing his hands I will most likely never come back"}
{"text":"Good food nice atmosphere. Small cafe with hometown cuisine. Just a little higher priced."}
{"text":"Nice little place that is close to where I live. Service has always been very friendly and pretty fast even when busy. I love plain black coffee and the joe here is strong enough to keep this camper happy. Have had several breakfasts now and all have been five stars.  Nothing too fancy here, just great food and service that makes you comfortable and full."}
{"text":"I've had both breakfast items and lunch items here everything I've tried is delicious my favorite breakfast is the chicken fried steak and my favorite lunch is the philly cheese steak. Don't forget to try their muffins too. Mmm! The service could use some work but the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Quiet and friendly with delicious food. My husband and I have been regulars since we moved here 2 years ago and they always make us feel like family.
 
Order a hot Chai tea (even if it's hot out). Then, try to get the person you are dining with to share so you don't have to feel too bad when you order both the Eggs Benedict and the Chicken Fried Steak. Home fries are crispy and well seasoned.

I always end up ordering breakfast, but their lunch menu is proper too. Great sandwiches and soups. I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"YIKES! Avoid this place! I was a little wary because of the mostly bad reviews, but was really astonished at getting yelled at!! WOW. Starting at the worst, I ordered a corned beef sandwich (yeah, cold cuts, should have only taken a few minutes, since there was no one else there) and a coke (that was the wateriest coke I've ever received - it must have been sitting there for hours). After sitting there for well over half an hour with my husband (we're on our lunch break and expected to receive the sandwiches long before then). Keep in mind, there is NO ONE ELSE IN THE CAFE - let that be a lesson to you! The sour-faced old man comes outside, tells us that the sourdough bread is a little off and that he wouldn't eat it, then when I explain that I don't like wheat or white), he tells me that if I want to chip my teeth on it, be his guest. Then when I say that I've decided I don't want to even eat here, he literally starts yelling at me, \"C'mon, lady!\" I don't put up with that kind of behavior. A few exits back towards the 101, we salvaged a few mins and ate at Silver Mine (or City?) Subs, which was pretty good. Avoid this \"Temptations\" cafe at all costs. Horrid service, and with stale bread, I can't even imagine the quality of the food, but thankfully we didn't get that far."}
{"text":"We need more places like this. This coffee bar/cafe/ice cream shop has a nostalgic feel without feeling like a knock-off of a 50s diner. Personal touch+good food=awesome."}
{"text":"4stars based solely on the dish I had. Stopped by before heading back home to L.A......Country Fried Steak... YUuuuuuums!!! And I Loved the bathroom decor!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere. My sister and I stopped here on out way to a massage. Didn't know the area but saw this place next to the gas station we stopped at. Was not disappointed. They have breakfast all day, the food is fresh and made to order. Would absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! It was a very friendly and inviting atmosphere. You can tell it must be a family owned restaurant and they must love Chicago! It is a very small space that maybe has about 6-8 small tables and a bar top. 

We came and sat down and the waitress immediately greeted us and gave us suggestions as well as answered any questions we may have had. While waiting for our food the cook came out and asked customers how everything was. And while eating our food we had our server as well as another server ask how our food was and if we needed anything else. 

The food was also just as good as the service. We had breakfast food and I had a delicious coffee (Milky Way). 

The ticket was brought out while we were eating and plates were cleared as soon as we finished. My fianc√© and I both worked in customer service for years, and we were both so impressed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It was my hope that this would be a great new breakfast place for my guy and me... Yeah, no.  Not going back even though I have the coupon. After reading previous reviews, I went in with hopes.  I could easily identify the good waitress from the previous reviews and the grumpy one.... To be fair she was a tad better than grumpy and when pressed to engage in talking she did loosen up more.  Upon entering you think I was crazy looking or a tad the wrong color by the glares I got from almost everyone there. Awkward!

I decided to ignore that and proceeded to order.  I ordered one egg, sausage and French toast.  I looked at other food for customers around me and noticed their food was either burnt looking or raw. I decided that perhaps that was the way they liked it... Until I got my plate with burnt French toast and raw looking sausage. The egg was cooked well though!  

For one that loves hidden breakfast treasures, this place? Yeah no..."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant!  If you're a Cubs fan this is the place for you!  The drink menu is large and it's the first time I have seen an espresso machine in a spot like this.  Coffee flavor is great and food was delicious.  The owners really take pride in making sure you are taken care of. They were a little short handed and it was busy, but worth the wait.  Good food takes time!"}
{"text":"Cute local cafe with great coffee and superb service. My husband and I went here on our last day in Scottsdale and wished we had discovered it early. The Loaded Scramble was full of flavour, freshness and whole heart goodness. The girl who managed the till and took our order was sweet and more than eager to make sure our experience was great. She tailored made my coffee to meet my needs (and honestly it tasted better than my daily Starbucks!) friendly environment with happy go peeps."}
{"text":"Looking for breakfast after a long flight in from Hawaii. Cozy neighborhood restaurant. Unassuming storefront and you'd have to kind of look for it if you don't know where it is but well worth your effort."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is friendly and the food is great. The french toast with fresh strawberries is my favorite."}
{"text":"Really delicious food! It's a cute mom and pop type place, went for lunch one day and it was sooo yummy! had quite a bit of options for vegetarians and a variety of menu items! Would recommend giving it a try"}
{"text":"I love this place. You can drive by and barely notice it but there food is fantastic and the employees are very nice. Try the pancakes, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a cute Chicago family owned and operated neighborhood breakfast spot. It's a place where everybody knows your name. It's a cafe full of regulars, Chicago sports memorabilia, great food, and fantastic service! The loaded scramble and the breakfast burrito are my favs, although the last time I ate here I had the French toast with strawberries and that could easily be a new favorite. There's bar seating with a tv showing sports. Feel free to ask for the paper! There's also a handful of seating inside and out on the patio. The food is yummy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went here for the 4 star review on Yelp.  Was rewarded with:

Poor service.  Took initial order quickly, but everything went down hill from there.

Long wait for the food, that was cold when arrived.

Ordered three egg omelet.  Let's just say those must be some tiny eggs.  No question this was actually made with two eggs (as an avid omelet orderer)

Coffee barely tasted like coffee.  Very very weak and came out late and cold.

There is really nothing special here at all.... Suggest you go pretty much anyplace else."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food! They cooked my eggs perfect. Very casual, homey style service."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!   It's a cool local spot.  Super nice service and awesome food.  They are dog friendly on the patio and it has a cool diner feel inside.  Always playing sports on the tv too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service , meet my dad here once a week for a nice quiet break from work."}
{"text":"We love this breakfast spot. Beth gives us great service, and always gives our puppy fresh water in their outdoor patio. Amazing home style breakfast, try the egg sandwich with rye!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was lacking. 5 tables of two people and three servers and did not check back once to see if I needed anything or if everything was okay, would have been nice to have gotten more water."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast. Read other reviews before going. A. Little nervous that we would get yelled at or regulars make us uncomfortable. This did not happen. Regulars welcomed us and great service. Can't wait to go back. Small but cute. Back again and everyone is super nice again. Great food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how good the food here is, but definitely staff is maybe overworked and not friendly.  We arrived on a Saturday morning expecting for sure to be crowded.  But, when I ask for a table.  The girl in the cashier responded: \"honestly I don't know, maybe you can check outside\".  I waited for the waiter outside to ask and her respond was: \"if you don't see a table then there is none\".  \"Sorry we don't take seatings\".  I was friendly asking but I guess they are not."}
{"text":"I love this hidden Scottsdale gem. Ive been going to this place for years and it never changes. Service is fast and friendly, its the perfect spot to just relax eat a great breakfast & relax. Super small home feeling and all the whole staff is awesome. Never a complaint in my books."}
{"text":"Wonderful, quaint and subtle American diner espresso bar. Filled with snow-birds and tucked away in an isolated strip mall. Enjoying a triple shot vanilla latte. Obviously going for the Chicago esque neighborhood vibe. 

Vanilla latte was decent, nothing too amazing but also nothing inherently bad.

Will come back and I'm glad to of been a patron here. 

Doing 4/5 stars because nothing screamed unique or out of the normal. Overall I'm satisfied and will finish enjoying my coffee.

Update; no WiFi was strange BUT after the chef, owner and cute little barista introduced themselves I was really pleased. Bump it up to 5-5 stars.

-Thanks"}
{"text":"I struggled between giving this place 2 to 3 stars. This seems like a great place if you're a regular and they know you, but if you come in as a first time customer you may not get the same treatment. To mimic what other reviews have said, we first walked in and were not greeted by anyone. No clue if we seat ourselves or wait to be seated. We decided to go find our own table out on the patio. We had trouble finding a table that was clean. Finally someone comes out and I ask if she can clean a table where we wanted to sit. She kindly obliges and we were finally settled in the table where we would eat our meal. The lady (who I assume is an owner) helped us out with the rest of our experience here. I have to say she was very nice and was really the only element that made this experience pleasant. At the end of the meal we never received our check so we went to the counter ourselves to pay. All in all what occurred here wasn't terrible, but I am really big on service at restaurants and this place was really lacking. Although the lady I mentioned was really awesome throughout our meal it wasn't enough to make the whole experience outstanding. Had the place been busy I feel as though the service would have really gone down hill even more. My food (the green chili burger) was good, but not above average. The quality of the food was something that you could get elsewhere and with probably a better customer service experience. If first impressions are everything, then Temptations Caf√© failed at making our first impression a positive one."}
{"text":"Quiet, clean, friendly service, perfectly cooked fried eggs, homemade sausage gravy not the canned stuff, love the sourdough toast but make sure you ask for 2 slices as they only give 1 slice if you don't ask...apparently a lot of it was being wasted in the past by customers. Coffee is really good too. Prices are fair. Great for a quick diner type breakfast not overly greasy. They have some healthier options on the menu for those not wanting the usual fare. Their pancakes are pretty good too only tried them once because I'm not always a pancake guy. The only thing maybe holding them back from 5 stars is the price and smaller sized menu but overall a solid 4 to 4.5 stars if I could give it."}
{"text":"Great home made food. Device is excellent. Ordered what I wanted and they made it happen.  Perfect food for breakfast and the coffee is fresh and the best. You have to try it."}
{"text":"This is the epitome of an A-OK kind of restaurant.

It's nothing like a lot of other breakfast spots in Scottsdale, and that's good and bad.
It's very much a diner at heart.  A handful of tables inside, a few tables outside, and some seats at a counter.  

The food is fine.  It's nothing you'll rave about, but it's fine.  My Burrito was good (though a bit lacking in Ham), and I was a bit surprised the side of Bacon only came with 2 pieces (though they were very tasty).  My wife got an omelette and said it was good, but something she could probably make at home.  

The service was good, but you could definitely feel how small the restaurant is since you could overhear every conversation the staff was having with one another.  

It's around $7 or $8 per entree, so overall I'd say if you're looking for a fairly inexpensive, simple breakfast, this is a good choice.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"For those of you who grew up in the Midwest, I think you will enjoy this place. I grew up with old diners and places where the servers were scurrying around behind the counter and making fun of the customers, talking sports, and locals coming in and the cooks automatically seeing them and just start cooking their favorite meal.

If you're looking for some sort of out-of-body breakfast experience, you won't find it here. This is old-fashioned breakfast cooking. No frills. With that said, they also aren't back there pouring eggs out of a carton either - no - they are back there cracking eggs just like you'd do at home.

They are fast at getting you your food out too.

In general the servers aren't going to chat you up a lot, but don't be surprised if when you walk in people at the bar do talk to you, especially if you are sitting at the bar.

I'm guessing the owners are from the Chicago area and transplanted here. Lots of Chicago memorabilia on the walls that is peppered with Arizona gear here and there. So if you have a problem with the Cubs, Bears, Blackhawks, or any other Chicago sports team... this is clearly not the place for you.

NOTE: Each time you check in you get a 10% coupon."}
{"text":"This has a great diner atmosphere with some of the best coffee I've ever had. You'll feel like you're in the Midwest in this place."}
{"text":"My son loves the BLT.  Good Fries. Nice People, Cute Bar.

Nothing exciting, just basic breakfast. Sometimes that is hard to find."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and tried it out a few weeks ago.  Two things happened that we were not happy about.  Doesn't mean we wouldn't go back, but nonetheless we were not happy.  First, the Eggs Benedict.  Not really.  They used shaved ham, not Canadian Bacon and I wasn't thrilled with the sauce either.  Second, I asked for my potatoes to be fried crisp.  They weren't.  Waitress made some excuse I didn't understand.  But no effort was made to correct it nor was an apology even given.  Like I said, I would try this place again, but know what and how to order better now."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and the people that work there are very welcoming. I come here when I can. Eggs Benny is on point"}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! Everyone who works here is so nice. Breakfast is great! Make sure to use the 10% off coupon they have here on yelp!"}
{"text":"When I wrote my first review, I had just started dining here, and now I'm a regular! We go almost every weekend for at least one meal. My 2 year old is the unofficial host every time we're there, haha. What an amazingly friendly place, the staff (and the customers!) are all so amazing. The food is definitely worth the trip, everything from the omelettes, club sandwich, burgers, and fantastic coffee makes Temptations Cafe a stop for any local or tourist looking for a great place."}
{"text":"I was passing through Scottsdale and needed some food so I pulled into a parking lot to yelp the best place in the area. I was parked in front a strip mall \"Cafe\" while yelping and almost just went in and tried the cafe food. Turns out \"cafe\" had good ratings so I went in. The place is very comfortable and the staff is nice. I ate steak and eggs, and it was delicious. The iced tea was tropical... Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I have only been to this cafe once, which is important to note, since I think if I could visit more often over time, I would bet that my experience would be better.

This restaurant is absolutely charming and feels to me like a neighborhood diner probably once felt.  Both the people behind the counter and the people in front of the counter seem to know and like one another.  The staff is VERY friendly.  The restaurant is spotless.  And the food arrived quickly, which [being impatient] I loved.

I ordered the BLT, and it was average, nothing too special.  But the price was right: $6.50, including chips/french fries and coleslaw.  Gotta love that.

Again, I want to return because the menu is large enough that there probably is a sandwich or two that they do REALLY well.  Maybe I just picked a bad one."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast stop in Scottsdale. Small inside but patio seating is available too. Good food and the coffee was very good!"}
{"text":"I took my grandson here because we were waiting for his mom to finish some business she had nearby. We sat at the counter. The man who waited on us offered my grandson a Coke...Dr Pepper...root beer?
The boy wasn't sure. I was really hoping the man would mention the shakes, because the picture (in another Yelp review) looked fantastic. But, the man left. I finally broke down and showed the boy the photo, and when a woman came to serve us, my grandson settled on the vanilla bean shake. He was quite pleased. I had the coffee. It was okay--but at noon, I'm sure they'd brewed it hours ago.
We didn't eat. I enjoyed the ambiance but wasn't hungry enough to pay $8 for anything. They didn't seem to have any lighter meals. I was a little disappointed in that.
The ambiance, though--so peaceful and Mayberry. Like a nice 50's diner without the cracked vinyl seats.
The menu had all the best brekkie and lunch options. No lighter selections, as I mentioned, so I'd like to go back sometime when I'm starving.$$"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a colleague on Friday and I wasn't super impressed but if you're hungry, it will get the job done!  You can tell that it is a locally owned, family run business and the staff was extremely personable. They get 5 stars!  I got the parmesan chicken salad sandwich and it was good, not great. It was served warm with chicken salad and cheese only. It was very basic. The salad was also super basic and the Italian dressing tasted like Wish-Bone from the grocery store. My colleague got the turkey club and it looked good! I wished that I ordered it when the food came. His looked much better than mine! There aren't many restaurants near them so i'm sure they get business from the nearby corporations!"}
{"text":"This place is so tasty! My mom and I love coming here for breakfast! We've never had a bad meal in the years we've been going! It's also nice to know you're supporting a local business."}
{"text":"So the atmosphere here is a nice throwback to an old-school diner which I liked. You can tell that this is a family-owned business that have traditional breakfast and lunch offerings, also they seem to bring in a consistent crowd of regulars here which is always great to see.

I ordered the club sandwich without bacon, however when the food arrived it still came with bacon. That doesn't bother me too much but it would have been nice if they followed through with any special requests. The sandwich was just okay I thought and the fries ushered a similar response from me. Unfortunately none of the food really stood out to me but that's not to say that it was terrible as the meal was still satisfactory.

Other than that there's nothing much to really say about this place. Not sure if I would come back though, but I might have to give it another chance and order something else."}
{"text":"Great food, super fast. Don't sleep on the biscuits and gravy. Good coffee and espresso lots of food not on the menu just ask and they'll make it."}
{"text":"If you like dining in retirement home cafeterias then you'll love this place. Bland food, Folgers quality coffee, dirty dishes, funky smell, haphazardly decorated with random sports memorabilia. Gets the 2nd star because it was cheap and quick."}
{"text":"Little mom and pop diner style place for some non-trendy free breathing!  Food is good, I loved the crispness of the country potatoes with my chicken fried steak.  The coffee's pretty good too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite diner in Arizona. Earlier this week I had a quick 30-minute lunch break, and I colleague of mine suggested that we all go eat at Temptations. Right when we walked in I felt very welcome and impressed with the overall 'feel' of the place. 
We sat at the bar top and ordered our meals, which took less than 10 minutes to come out! I got the Breakfast Burrito and it was delicious!
Customer service was fantastic, too. The waitress was down to earth which made the experience even better.
I recommend this place to anyone who likes good food and good people! It's a very relaxed and welcoming place that will always leave you satisfied.
Thank you, Temptations!"}
{"text":"Very nice little cafe. They have a simple menu with about 30 items on hand and they all seem great. There is  Something for everyone at this cafe. 
 I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it caught me off guard at first because the breast was sliced up into pieces on top of the bun, but I then I took a bite and again I was caught off guard... It tasted great!  well seasoned and juicy. The fries I got with the sandwich were great too. 
 I was just visiting from Los Angeles for a few days and this cafe caught my eye and I was impressed with all the Chicago spirit and most importantly the food!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, but I recently went here and the quality has diminished. I ordered a heaven sent omelet and they put globs and globs of cream cheese on it to the point where it was inedible.They placed coffee stained napkins in the bag as well. Not a big deal but it's gross. I ended up taking 1 bite and throwing it in the trash. The owner seems like a nice person and I hope he can make some adjustments."}
{"text":"This is a good spot that I nearby for a quick bite to eat. 

There is an ok amount of room and even some patio seating for the nice weather. The decor is kinda of all.ober the place but you can see it's a collections of favorites from picture to teams etc. Everyone was really nice and the service was pretty quick. They offer diner fare and all you would expect for that, so breakfast dishes in thier classic forms and lots of choices for sandwiches at lunch. Everything was good that came out. The fries were frozen fries but ok....nothing was really outside expectations so they are a reliable place to go grab some grub Solo or to catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"The wife wanted to try this place and I am very glad I agreed.  This place was great and was quite busy.  We were lucky to get a table but the counter would have been okay too.  Reminds me of an old soda fountain shop.  I had the Reuben and it was just wonderful.  If its on the menu, I will order it.  I have some weird obsession with Reubens and when I find a good one, I cherish it and order it over and over again.  We will be back to this place as there are quite a few other items I need to try.  It will be hard to stray away from the Reuben though.  Oh, the cole slaw is pretty good coming from someone who is not a huge fan of it."}
{"text":"A wonderful little place have never been disappointed in service or food. My favorites so far are the Tuna sandwich and Green chili burger. It's also nice to have breakfast that is served all day."}
{"text":"This is my breakfast joint. Yea it can get crowded and the service can get a little lost in the weeds but they are nice folks and they apologize. Just have another coffee & surf on your phone and before you know it a great breakfast will arrive. My hash special was indeed special with nice chunks of corned beef and my over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. Nice folks, great breakfast, oh and really good coffee. Be prepared to wait a bit on a Sunday AM...."}
{"text":"I stopped at Temptations Cafe today.  I love the locally owned businesses in Scottsdale and had heard good things about this Cafe.  I was pleasabtly surprised and left 100% satisfied.  I had the Country Fried Steak which came with 2 eggs and a delicious biscuit.  Coffee was great.  Friendly attentitive staff could not have been nicer and was interested in my happiness during my visit. The owner Nancy came out and spoke with me and made me feel like I was a regular.  She has that right as we will be back every weekend."}
{"text":"Great little cafe! Best eggs and hashbrowns ever. Wonderful ambience felt like a beachside caf√©!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast find... We ordered an omelette and biscuits and gravy and it was yummy, quick, and the service was excellent and quick."}
{"text":"Decent diner style cafe food, good service and nice couple that owns it.  Have had a ham steak and omelet for breakfast, but as a diner I really feel they should be open at the crack of dawn.  Last time I was there, grill wasn't fired up by 7:30am."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, friendly staff. Pet friendly patio! Reasonable prices fresh food tastes like a home cooked breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have been to this cafe a few times and it has been ok nothing special, the only thing I've ever ordered is a 2 egg breakfast, how can you screw that up right? Ok so today I want to order something more substantial so I get the Loaded Scramble and it comes with toast so here it comes and I can see that I will still be hungry when I leave. Also there is only 1 price of toast and I knew if I was going to get half full I would need that other price of toast so I ask doesn't this meal come with 2 slices and the girl tells me if I want the other that I have to ask for it um ok so I asked for it. This was a 9.00 breakfast and I don't think it would fill a toddler. So I ate and when I was at the register cashing out I wanted the lady to ask how everything was but she did not so I asked her if she was going to ask so the owner came and said\" I'll handle it what's the problem?\" So I told her what the problems were and she said \" next time your here you'll have to ask for your other slice of toast\" oh the toast that I payed for I have to ask for! She was extremely rude and unfortunately I had to give 1 star and that is 1 too many. I hope this negative review gives her negative results. There will not be a next time."}
{"text":"With its Chicago roots, this is a nice family owned and operated breakfast spot. It's tucked away in a nondescript strip mall, yet holds lots of charm and some great morning options. For seating, you can watch TV from the bar or pick from the handful of tables inside or out on the patio. When the weather gets nice, I love sitting outside with a fresh cup of coffee. Did I mention they have an espresso machine? Sometimes it can get busy, but I've never been turned away despite the quaint size.

You can choose a traditional breakfast option (all of them are good) or go with a fancy selection from the whiteboard in the front. The eggs are cooked really well and the biscuits and gravy are always a smart choice. The food comes out fast and I'm never disappointed. I've never ordered lunch but my friends' dishes looked pretty tasty. The french fries are solid."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe. The people that work there always so sweet and kind. A perfect weekend breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome locally owned restaurant. Great service and yummy food.  I eat the a couple of times a month and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service. We both got the eggs Benedict mine with hashbrows his with country potatos both great. Went on a Saturday morning and say down right away!"}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere. Reminded me of being back in Chicago at a neighborhood diner. I will be back."}
{"text":"I struggle to find what people like about this place. Food is mediocre, service is typically slow, prices are nothing special. It doesn't have a local/quaint atmosphere to help it along either. 

Everything about this place is completely shruggable. If there is no place left on your list to go, by all means eat here. But for me, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Average cafe fare. 

With few reviews and not enough detail, there was not much to go on for making our food choices. The reuben was ok. Not great. The breakfast burrito the same. Nothing wrong but nothing that I will remember tomorrow either. 

If I wasn't in Phoenix Scottsdale area but rather a small town, I would be thankful. It felt small town good. Unfortunately I will be tempted to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cute place.  Large variety on menu. Excellent coffee.  So very smooth.  Bought a pound of Heavenly Bliss. And another as a gift."}
{"text":"I like this place. The people are very friendly and its just good food. It's like, stuff I'd like to make at home but am too lazy to do. I really appreciated the staff's attentiveness as well. It get crowded too. Good food, great prices,  good people - not hard to see why."}
{"text":"Love this place, try the Quiche of the Day or the signature Eggs Benedict!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I would come here every morning when we lived in the area. They have a wide variety of espresso/coffee flavors to choose from, fresh veggies and fruit, and even something as simple as a bagel with butter was still amazing. This place does it right and the owners and staff are very friendly and welcoming. I'll definitely have to make the drive to that side of town soon to visit again!"}
{"text":"Stopped to get some breakfast to go. I'm pretty sure I received Salisbury chicken fried steak and eggs and the wife's, who's allergic to dairy,  burrito had a huge chunk of cheese in it. Both meals we didn't finish and both made us ill. Had high hopes for this place. The folks inside seemed very sweet but the food was some of worst we've had."}
{"text":"This is clearly a family-owned business, and I love supporting family-owned businesses, but... I was not that impressed. We saw Temptations Cafe on Yelp so decided to stop by for lunch. I had no idea that the restaurant was sports themed, and it honestly felt like a sports bar (minus the booze)! The walls were covered with sports memorabilia which I think is a little tacky, but what really irked me was the tv playing sports. The restaurant is way too small to have a large tv, and the volume was much too loud for a Sunday afternoon. There was only one other family eating when we were there, and they clearly weren't watching sports. Why is the tv on? Who is watching it? Please mute it, or put the volume on low.

I ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. The menu says \"add tomatoes for 50 cents\" so I asked for tomatoes on my sandwich. I also asked for a side of hashbrowns because who doesn't love all day breakfast? My boyfriend got a breakfast plate with eggs, bacon and pancakes. Sadly our waitress forgot my hashbrowns, and she also forgot to add the tomatoes to my sandwich! Not a huge deal, but annoying since she obviously didn't write down my requests. 

The food was good and filled us up, but it was nothing spectacular. Definitely tasted like a home-cooked meal, and you can tell it was made with love. I will be back for breakfast at some point, but this won't be my go-to spot. I will sit outside next time to avoid the sports on tv. (I think the patio is dog friendly, so that's a plus!) 

One last note - our waitress was eating lunch behind the counter. The restaurant wasn't busy so it's not like she had anything else to do, but I found this unprofessional.

5 stars for being family-owned, 4 stars for the food, 3 stars for service (friendly but forgetful), 0 stars for decoration, 0 stars for the giant tv playing sports loudly."}
{"text":"Expectations fully met and then some.  My definition of 5 stars!  Temptations Cafe just really great breakfast food, with super friendly service (owners mindset, come to think of it, that probably was one of the owners!).

Nice menu with a bit of everything to cover the breakfast scene.  Eggs, pancakes, oatmeal, espresso drinks, etc., etc.

Most important, a nice patio with some shade that is dog friendly!  Staff immediately brought us a nice cold bowl of water for our pup.

Highly recommended for breakfast anytime of day."}
{"text":"Good service. 
Solid diner food. 
I'm a regular. 
The chicken fried steak and eggs is one of my favorites. The club sandwich with homemade chips is one of the most popular items."}
{"text":"I love a family style dinner!! This joint has never disappointed me!! I always get the same thing for I'm pretty boring the biscuits and gravy!!! I'm from a small town in Texas and I love family run businesses with a smile!!"}
{"text":"I just had brunch here. The cafe was much smaller than I anticipated. The prices were decent enough but I feel that I could have made the food myself. 

The coffee was served in a small-average sized mug but costs $2.75 which is more expensive than it should be. I also got a water with my coffee and the class was filthy *see photos*. The service was average and the food was okay. I would like to see this place with more than 2 customers in it. I'll consider giving it another try on a weekend."}
{"text":"Small homey feeling. Great service. Definitely family owned. Good food at good prices."}
{"text":"We just discovered this great little breakfast joint down the street from our house. Amazingly friendly service, diner type feel, affordable, and yummy food! No grease. Will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable cafe and the food was amazing! Not to mention the people were darling too! I got the Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend got Biscuits & Gravy, and they were both freshly made to order and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is great. It's a small little cafe hidden in a strip mall type building. The biscuits and gravy are awesome. So was the crepes it's a local favorite and is rarely busy. I've been here a few times and have never been dissapointed."}
{"text":"Simple, down home food @ a good price. Friendly staff, dine at the diner style bar, a table or on the patio. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Really cute little cafe and espresso bar with beer, wine, and booze.

I just went to grab lunch real quick, but I decided to stay and eat since I had a few extra minutes.  The iced tea was really good, unsweetened with a hint of some fruit, maybe peach.  I ordered the portobello sandwich and substituted a side salad for the fries or pasta.  The sandwich was a grilled mushroom with cheese and pesto on grilled bread.  The salad was a garden salad with romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, shredded carrots, shredded cheese, croutons and my requested balsamic vinaigrette.

Simple yet tasty.  I enjoyed my meal but I would make one suggestion: put a piece of lettuce between the mushroom and bread. My bottom piece of bread got a bit soggy.  It still tasted good, but if I took it back to the clinic like I planned, it would have become mush."}
{"text":"What a great little cafe! It is small and has the old time diner feel to it. The food menu is simple but thorough and all the breakfast food I have had was great. They have one tv right in the middle that everyone can see which is a nice touch. My only problem is that it is very small and a few times I've been in and then left because there were no seats. The staff is excellent and the food is perfect. They should expand a little because every time I've been in it has been at full capacity. If you looking for a local, tasty, homemade tasting spot, this is the best."}
{"text":"Awful! My sisters and I didn't even get to eat there because the manager, possibly owner, yelled us out before we even sat down in our seats. We had never been before and we were excited to try it out.. However, I guess lunchtime was almost over, which obviously weren't aware of.. He yelled at us to leave screeching \"come onnnn\" and  screamed that they were closing. He treated us like a total nuisance and was extremely rude. He didn't even say sorry or inform us of their hours. However, knowing the hours wouldn' t have changed anything because none of us are EVER going back. I will speak nothing but bad things about this cafe. 

Very unprofesional!"}
{"text":"A cute little cafe in south scottsdale that you probably drive by every day and never pay attention to.  We stopped in after searching Yelp for breakfast, and were pleasantly  surprised.  The decor is cute and clean (not diner, but not chic...just comfy), the staff is friendly and the food is solid.  The average age in the place is pretty high, probably considering it's next to an elderly residence center (what's the PC way to say that??).

The menu is standard, so don't expect any surprises, but their specialty coffees are great."}
{"text":"Egg sandwich is delish. Service was great and speedy. Prices are fair. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe that was busy when we got there at 11, but there were seats at the bar. I ordered the French toast with fresh strawberries and it was yummy. The employees were nice and kept apologizing for the wait and how busy they were, but we were fine. Checking in on Yelp got me 10% off which was an awesome surprise because I didn't notice that before. All in all, cozy spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch and great service."}
{"text":"Food was not so fresh.   I ordered the chicken fried steak (confirmed as being prepackaged frozen),  the home fries were not homemade either but here's the clincher... the biscuit was microwaved!!!  The top was rippled, it was spongy and the perimeter was hard.  

The negative review is due the waitress' response.  I said it seems like my biscuit was microwaved and it not very good, can I get another fresh biscuit.  She actually huffed at me saying \"we'll our Chef makes them fresh at home and brings them in.  We have to warm them up somehow.\"   Wow.  She was totally giving me a 'tude.  

I asked another waitress and she kindly said they would make me another (hense 2 stars instead of 1) but off site food is concerning.  The second biscuit was good but I was already thinking about why the food wasn't made fresh on-site and why microwave bread, rookie no, no.

I love to support local fresh made food but unfortunately this missed the mark."}
{"text":"This is definitely a south Scottsdale hidden gem that has turned into one of my favorite places to grab lunch during the work week.

The first time I discovered them was due to the fact that they had breakfast all day. And well, if you know me, you know this usually brings a place up a notch in my book. I love my breakfast. Their heaven sent omelet is spectacular.

Their italian soda comes with cream on the side so you can add as much as you want. Yum!!

Additionally the grilled cheese is to die for. I am *not* a fan of tomatoes at all but for some reason their tomato bisque I actually somewhat enjoy. And it comes with cheddar goldfish. Oh yes. And this isn't a kids meal either.

If you're a Chicago native or Chicago sports fan (which I am not), you will be especially impressed."}
{"text":"When we attempted to eat here, the bar was nearly empty, but every table (each could seat four people) was filled with one person. This was during breakfast time, around 9am. Maybe they shouldn't allow one person to take up a whole table during breakfast time? They offered to seat us outside.... in the 100 degree summer. No thanks. We went elsewhere. Who knows, maybe the food is good, but I'm unlikely to find out :/"}
{"text":"Milo & Nancy's cafe is a cute little gem.
it's a family owned business and we were served by Milo himself.
Most people inside were regulars.

~ Iced Coffee $2.75
~ Heaven Sent $9.25
Cream Cheese Herb Blend with Spinach & Mushrooms. Served with country potatoes 
 and Choice of Toast
~ Custom Omelette $9.25
 Hash Brown, Choice of Toast, three eggs with onions, peppers, and mushrooms

Both omelettes were delicious as were the country potatoes and hash browns.
In house cream cheese herb blend was exceptional.
The food is hands down 4 stars but the service is slow and relaxed.

Patio is dog friendly.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yum! Chicken fried steak was awesome, the gravy was like frosting....so, so good. Small place, comfortable, indoor/outdoor, we sat at the bar. We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have weekend breakfast.  Outstanding coffee and service, nice patio.  This place has a real small-town, comfortable atmosphere and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience even when there's a wait. It's worth it. Food is definitely home cooking and the prices are fair. I like the two egg breakfast with country potatoes (with saut√© red onions), bacon and toast. I can never finish as the portions are so big. I look forward to their coffee all week and it's very smooth and fragant, nothing like these doctored drinks you get at franchises but if you're in the mood, they can do that too.

Milo, the owner, is very polite and fun to strike up a sports conversation with any day of the week. We are always looking to support local small businesses and this place is a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoys this little, special neighborhood place. Food and service are great and staff and customers are all very friendly. Inside and outside patio dining for breakfast and lunch, traditional food plus the daily specials. Just a great place to eat and chat!

{"text":"My boyfriend and myself are regulars here, I absolutely love the omelettes and the mushroom and Swiss burgers. My boyfriend is a very picky eater and he had their Philly cheese steak and he was telling me it's the absolute best cheese steak he's ever had. He's convinced we have to go every afternoon now just to get one. I would honestly recommend it to anybody. But all in all, if you want some good food, with nice people. I recommend going to the temptations cafe!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We always turn to Yelp when needing to find a place while traveling. This place did not disappoint. The potatoes and Eggs Benedict were so yummy. My husband said the country gravy was delicious. The owner was behind the counter taking orders and talking to us like he knew us. We would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood caf√© for breakfast. Been driving by for a few months and decided to give it a try 8 AM and not busy. Had the two egg breakfast with sausage and potatoes  $6.99 good price. The quality of the food was good and service decent, but considering I was the only one seated hard to judge. 

I probably won't go back because I didn't find any distinguishing qualities to draw me away from my usual spot Jims Coney Island Caf√© on Scottsdale road. I found the chairs to be uncomfortable inside the caf√©. And I was perched at the edge of the chair to eat and read the paper, important to me as I don't eat out that much and like to feel comfortable when I do."}
{"text":"I entered the cafe for the first time and was unsure of whether to take a seat, so I approached the cash register.  After a period of between five and ten minutes, I placed my order.  After ordering, I was asked whether I wanted fries with my order, and that, my friends, was the first verbal communication I was granted.  In case you missed it, no one spoke to me until after I placed my order.  Not even, what would you like; just a look.  So I took my food to go, and don't plan on returning.  The reuben was actually quite good, but even that does not compel me to give a rating of more than one star."}
{"text":"The eggs benedict is the absolute best, mainly due to their absolutely delicious homemade hollandaise -- PLUS they cook perfect poached medium eggs which is very hard to find, as so many restaurants cannot get poached med to eggs right and serve runny whites or hard centers... the ONLY reasons I havent given them 5 stars is due to their extremely slow service - which is a trade off because the food is freshly cooked and delish"}
{"text":"OMG, I love this place. It's very close to my house, and it's been there all along - I am writing this as a reminder to myself to go here more often. The owners are the sweetest people ever. Best iced coffee within a mile of my house. 

My girlfriend used to pick up breakfast for us from here on weekends, but then Pesto Prima opened up and we started doing that. Well, we are going to have to start alternating. The food here is fantastic. 

I feel kinda guilty for not going here much over the last year, but I'm definitely glad I rediscovered this place. I mean, if you want to roll up to Breakfast Club in the clothes you slept in and wait in line for average eggs and bacon and sub-par coffee so you can be \"seen\" out to brunch - that's what you're going to do - if you want awesome food and coffee in a sweet little cafe, then come here.

The owner said they might start delivering soon - if that happens, holy cow. *crosses fingers*"}
{"text":"First time here. But the food was great!!! Everything tastes like its homemade. Even my strawberry shake I ordered for dessert. Definitely have to say it was 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  One of the best cups of coffee i have ever had.  I tried the Southwest scramble and it was delicious ... loved the atmosphere of the cafe good amount of seating and very good prices...will def be back anytime I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Bay area transplant and avid foodie. I rarely post on my breakfast spots but felt the need to do it here. Very home made feeling with a very attentive staff. I believe most people who come here on Sundays are regulars. 

Really like the diner atmosphere here and love the coffee."}
{"text":"I waffled between 3 & 4 for a bit... but I'll give it the benefit of there not being a 1/2 star rating. 

Plain and simple, this is just a rock-solid breakfast option. It's not going to be the fanciest, or the most gourmet, or have the biggest servings... but it's always going to be good, the waitresses will always be nice, they'll rarely (if ever?) mess up your order, and they're perfectly reasonable on price. 

I realize I'm not making this a very sexy review, but honestly... sometimes 1+1+1=4. For me, i like supporting a family-owned place that i know is going to be dependable, and that i know won't have a line out the door.  This is by no means a \"destination\" place. (sorry Temptations.)

A couple of tips; check the whiteboard at the far wall by the kitchen; it has daily special items listed that the waitresses will never mention otherwise.(i came here many, many times before i ever noticed.) Also, I typically sit at the main counter, but i have noticed that service seems to get incrementally worse the further you get from bar seating. Sit outside if you want peace from your server and don't care about coffee refills."}
{"text":"When my girlfriend and I moved to Arizona from Pennsylvania, this was the first food/customer service experience we had and we couldn't be more PLEASED! Milo & Nancy (adorable Chicagoans) stopped to chat with us about life, love, sports and barbershops. They gave us some great pointers and EVEN BETTER FOOD! Our breakfast was DELICIOUS and affordable. One visit down...a million more to go! Check out this sweet little diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Friendly, cute and small cafe. I had the half order of biscuit and gravy that was pretty good and a side order of sausage patties with great flavor and crispy. My husband chorizo breakfast burrito and tapitio (his favorite hot sauce). Nice quick place for us to eat before a business meeting."}
{"text":"I go here often because it's walking distance from my house and has a dog friendly patio. I've never had lunch but the breakfast menu is typical, fast and inexpensive. The little ol lady's who run this place are extremely friendly and genuinely want to provide a good experience. Very quaint and quiet vibe."}
{"text":"I went in today for breakfast. 3 guys were sitting at the bar, the rest of the place was empty.
The one server brought us a water. She then ignored us for 40 minutes.
Everyone else who came in after us got their food and she still ignored us.

Very lame!!!

Plus it looks and feels like a dumb. It's probably best it didn't work out. 

She had zero reason for ignoring a table for 40 minutes. When she wasn't tending to the other guests she was up at the register with her back to us fiddling with her phone."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, however when I called to place an order the lady on the phone yelled to the cook in the kitchen, got back on the phone and said their kitchen closed at 2:30. I looked at the time and it was 2:28. I'd be willing to bet this lady was just an employee, an owner of a small mom and pops establishment would be stupid to turn down customers. You lost potential customers here!"}
{"text":"I don't review much but thought I have to give this place the time. Originally saw them on bringfido.com so I can bring my dog and have breakfast someplace. From the moment my dog and I walked up to the patio the ladies that work here were amazing. Brought a bowl of water and coffee so fast- and made us feel so welcome. They have huge moveable umbrellas and the whole patio is covered by a wood roof overhang so even at 10 am in scottsdale it's not too Hot. Oh and the food-awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, fast service.
I usually get in before the bustle, but I know it gets busy. These Chicago fans have always been friendly and quick with their service and I keep coming back for the egg sandwich and hash browns. Can't go a weekend without."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our breakfast burrito and cheese omelettes.  Staff is very friendly.  Place is very small but they do have a dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"GREAT service! Super cute inside. The house chips are yummy and the cole slaw was delicious (I'm a big fan of cole slaw and super picky too). The menu is simple and just right. I ordered the BLT and the bacon was perfect!We just moved here from South Carolina and we were pleasantly surprised to find this gem, not far from where we live!"}
{"text":"Had Eggs Benedict on special.  Done with shaved ham and very tasty. Poached eggs cooked perfectly, hollandaise sauce very good and hash browns with the perfect crispness."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Been here a few times with my boyfriend and we are always pleased! We are gluten free so there isn't much for us there but so good when we want to cheat (on gluten free) or for a continental breakfast. 

Oh ya and great coffee drinks!"}
{"text":"What a crap hole! The waitress was pushy and not very friendly. My wife ordered coffee with her breakfast. When the coffee came, my wife asked for cream. The waitress barked, \"oh, I didn't hear you ask for cream!\" That's odd. Most restaurants automatically bring cream with coffee, or at least ask if you want cream. Then my wife went to take a sip of coffee and noticed that there was lipstick on the rim of the cup. NASTY. 
Asked if the orange juice was fresh and not from concentrate. Crabby Pants told us she didn't squeeze it but it was fresh. Guess what. Sure tasted like from frozen concentrate to me! NASTY Food was ok. Staff was crabby."}
{"text":"This is a quaint neighborhood cafe. Friendly atmosphere. The food was solid, not fancy but tasty. The service was great. We loved Carol!! It's pretty tiny inside there are about four or five tables inside with a long bar. They have a decent sized patio. May go back because it's in the neighborhood. I wouldn't drive for it though."}
{"text":"I adore this little restaurant! I love the employees AND the food. The service is impeccable, it's fast AND friendly. My boyfriend and I love coming here for breakfast on the weekends. Don't ever leave! :)"}
{"text":"I always like to give a spot a second chance and I'm sometimes still disappointed and sometimes not and this time, I was not! Service was way better, even though it was the same lady as last time, and the food was great. I had lunch last time and breakfast this time so maybe that was the difference as well. The quiche, even though a small portion, was really good! I ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes as well and they were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Fresh fruit to boot. Pretty awesome breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is quaint and cozy. The staff is extremely friendly and the best customer service I have experienced in a long time! The food was delicious and Carol helped with recommendations. We had the French toast and Heaven Sent omelette . They were gracious enough to suggest using one piece of toast for the French toast because two pieces typically goes to waste but they would be happy to make another piece if we needed it (which we didn't :) the Heaven Sent omelette came with a delightful cream cheese herb blend on top of the omelette and a side of country potatoes. Everything was delicious!!! The restaurant isn't very large but they utilize the entire area they have with a wrap around bar with full seating and 4 tables inside. There are Chicago Cubs memorabilia all over the walls with hand signed framed jerseys and pictures of old Chicago. I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice for breakfast and enjoyed it greatly both times.  They make an awesome latte and the fried egg sandwich is yummy.  Both times we visited the staff has been extremely friendly and attentive.  The menu is fairly basic, but everything we have tried was made perfectly.   We will be going back."}
{"text":"Comfort food at a low price. This place is packed consistently for obvious reasons so be prepared to wait because seating is limited."}
{"text":"Great people, great food, what else can you ask for? I recommend the egg sandwich or the heaven sent omelet. Their coffee is also amazing."}
{"text":"This is a very simple neighborhood homely breakfast/lunch diner with a Chicago Theme with a Cheers kinda feel to it.  

The owner, Mylo, is a typical Chicagoian with all the Midwest swag.   He's one big flirt I tell ya and is honestly lovable!   My personal favorite on the menu is the BLT.  I like to order my sandwich with a side of fries, but they have homemade chips or a side salad as an option for the sandwiches.  One of my issues with this restaurant would be the fact that they also serve home fries, but you can't order a side of home fries with your sandwich.  I've never been able to understand why.

They always offer various specials, soup and dessert of the day.  The coffee at Temptations is very good.  One Saturday morning I stop through there and the owner suggests that I nab a cup of the coffee.  It was very good.

If you stop in here, you will really enjoy it.  Look for the word, \"Cafe\" on the building and you'll be there."}
