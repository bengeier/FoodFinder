{"text":"Literally the worst AYCE place I've been to. The seating and decor is fine but the food is not fresh and very bland. I'm convinced they add water to the soups and soya sauce. The service is slow and one server even kissed her teeth as she cleaned off our dishes. The dessert selection is a joke and when we got our dessert over 20 minutes after ordering, they gave us the dishes without utensils and we had to wait again to get a server's attention. Mind you this all happened on a Thursday evening when they were not even busy. Take my advice and go to Ten Ichi instead."}
{"text":"Came in here with high expectations from the reviews on Yelp, walked (actually waddled) out but unsatisfied.   Food was not that bad and can't say it was really good but, i still eat a lot.  I eat to a point where i actually skipped dessert!  That is pretty amazing for me.  I don't skip dessert ever.  Food in general was (in my opinion) not as good as tenichi or sushi legend.   The beef tataki was over cooked and the service was a little disappointing as well (lots of dishes were not served).    Price was not bad, 10% off if you pay by cash.  Bill worked out to be $25/person.   Will i come back... unlikely.  I am still trying to figure out how i eat so much.  Lol"}
{"text":"Actually if i get to pick,  i wont even give this place a single star!  I have been to lots and lots of ayce places,  i am telling you this is the worst place i have ever been to. First of all,  the place smells like bleach.  Chairs are dirty,  table is sticky!! NONE of the sashimi and sushi are fresh.  Tempura is gross.  Miso soup has weird taste. Service is horrible , the servers are so rude!!  I kindly tell you my friends,  dont waste your time and money in such disgusting restaurant. Please take my advice."}
{"text":"A great find.....Have been to this place for a couple of times....turning into my new favorite sushi place..... Sushi bar has been great as ever.....lots of items I have never tried before in other ayce restaurants.....yuzu salmon has been my favorite so far... Kitchen has been massively improved since my first visit....as it was one of the few disappointments....good to see them putting efforts to improve this place.....can never miss out their rock shrimp....really amazing.... overall....have seen lots of improvements over the first few months since its opening......I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service needs improvement . The be mad at me if you're busy . If you can't support me with all you can eat that's not my problem"}
{"text":"i went there with my bf for ayce grand opening and you get 10% off.. The sushi and sashimi were really fresh and good, friendly service.. the oyster and uni shooter were really really amazing...lovethem and the presentation was really good as well...better than yamamoto i had ever been to..but the kitchen food need to improve though for sure...i will go there again... forgot to take picture and i will do it next time..."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap average sushi. If you're looking for a high quality and exceptional meal you're better off looking elsewhere. The service is slow at best, and the waiters don't drop by the table enough. When I went in around 8pm on a Saturday night the place was practically empty. I'd imagined it be a lot more busy, maybe they focus more on takeout than sit-ins. But the restaurant is somewhat nicely decorated, and best of all it's a good cheap price for normal sushi.  I've ordered their take out before and while the delivery is amazing fast, they like to tack on a lot of small additional expenses which to \"boost\" their profit."}
{"text":"Food was good... especially the pad thai and dragon rolls.  There wasn't any wow factors in this place though. It's extremely similar (taste and interior wise) to the spring sushi right across from eaton. The attitude from waiters was just horrible. They took way too long to get our orders to us and didn't even bring some.   But I gotta say... The rolls were really good, and the pad thai is worth paying the full price for."}
{"text":"I probably come here every weekend because I crave their sushi all the time. Food is fresh and tastes really good. Whenever I go to other sushi restaurants I find the taste and quality is not even close to here. Only thing I find the waitresses' service isn't good. They walk around to look busy yet they really don't come by your table as often as they should to see if we ordered more food for all you can eat buffet. Twice I waited over 20 minutes just for them to pass by the table to receive my order. They need new waitresses that are more aware of serving customers and not looking like clueless airheads."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Good staff. Quick service. Loved the food options. Sushi and maki rolls are nice. Especially the dragon fire roll and the tempura roll.  I do wish however there would be more desert options. Would love some mini cakes or creme brule or tiramisu."}
{"text":"When It first opened, We went for Lunch, buffet and was literally the only table in the restaurant. The service was great and so was the food. Food arrived quickly, beautifully presented, and the fish was well portioned. They have a great variety of foods and appetizers.  We went back a few times after, and it seems the quality of the food and service slowly declined. The last time I went for the lunch buffet, the place was full, seems like business is catching on. They hired more people and they seem somewhat clueless, and we ate for 2 hours because it took them so long to get the food to us. Sometime's they'd neglect entire orders. They also changed the menu into a big mess, much more confusing.  I haven't been in a few weeks since time of review, but I'm guessing it's not getting better."}
{"text":"Horrible. Bad service. Bad food. Below average Chinese owned ayce place.  IPad was annoying to use. Regret."}
{"text":"I really like the lunch special. It's good stuff. I come here mainly for take out. Not so much dine in. The takeout 3 roll special is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Been to a few ayce joints in the Scarborough and Markham area and hands down this is the best Japanese ayce I've tried so far. Makes me not want to continue to explore further more. Every single thing I tried was absolutely tasty with so much flavor, everything was fully cooked. I love this place man. Great sized portions. Huge banana tempura. Just go and believe me.  Great joint. Will Be a frequent customer"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was terrible. Every time we asked them  a question, we would only receive attitude in return even though we were asking politely. Not only that, but we didn't receive half of our food and when we asked them about it, they just gave us attitude, scoffed, and insisted that our food was already brought out.  We could have just ordered more food ourself since it was AYCE, but the last call for the lunch service already ended. So the only thing we were able to order was dessert. Maybe I'd return if I was desperate for Japanese a la carte nearby, but the service there just makes for a bad experience."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad.  It's not too cheap but the prices are still reasonable. I come here when I crave the rolls or the unagi don. I've been here for at least 5 times now. 3 times were AYCE. AYCE is ok. There are much better AYCE locations elsewhere but I come here becaus it's close. The non AYCE was good. I actually prefer the non AYCE. I got that one sushi combo to eat at their restaurant, and another set of the same combo for takeout. They were good."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is affordable and comes in a good portion, would recommend the chicken teriyaki!"}
{"text":"Decent for an AYCE sushi restaurant. They have pieces that aren't available elsewhere (dragon on fire roll, spicy salmon tower) and they have daily specials (uni shooter, fresh oysters, crab legs) which is nice. I only go when my mom and brother wants to binge on sushi (better than Ten-Ichi) but other than that, I would not return especially since I don't even get my money worth at AYCE."}
{"text":"I have to say I like how Uoshiki rolls. I'm not a big fan of ayce but with a big family and kids, we seem to end up at one. Uoshiki is definitely A - OK!   I've only been to lunch here twice. First was Mother's Day, they saved our reservation even when we were a half hour late. Service was slow tho, but totally understandable since it was a packed house. Second was less busy and everything was a lot faster. Each time service was always with a smile and they do check up on your table frequently.  Food is good, not the best sushi, but better than the usual ayce. Portions are small and this is a good thing so I can try a few different dishes. My top picks are the rolls wrapped in cucumber, seaweed or mango salads and their teriyaki. There are some nice items on the dinner menu I might try next time...  And yes, I wouldn't mind coming here another time.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi AYCE. Lots of vegetarian options. Definitely a good variety of rolls.  Good service, pretty fast with certain things. I've never had a problem with them forgetting our orders."}
{"text":"I've been to Inada which was what Uoshiki used to be so I was interested to see what it has been replaced with. Came here for AYCE dinner on a weekend with some friends. the price for adults on weekends was $24.99 I believe but you get 10% off if you decide to pay in cash! They also have the ipad order thingy but I noticed that the servers were less quick in sending our orders than the staff at spring sushi were.  In terms of food the cooked food was very meh. Flavour and quality was nothing special. I did really enjoy my salmon sashimi though which tasted very fresh and was served on a bed of crushed ice to keep it cool. I also really recommend their specialty sushi rolls! One that stood out to me was the flaming dragon roll (not sure if that's the exact name but I think you'll know it when you see it). Awesome combo of flavours in this roll and the rest of the rolls too!  Overall not sure if I would come on a weekend to pay the weekend price but I'm totally down to come here on a weekday for AYCE dinner OR to try out their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"The waitress has the you-owe-me-money face that we weren't expecting to be treated. You enjoy a \"discount\" for any all-you-can-eat order, so ordering 9 will give you only 6. The sashimi taste just so so, not fresh, not tasty, no comments. Oh, remember to ask the waitress three+ times only for more wasabi."}
{"text":"Came here by accident with my wife and kid. Tried it and came out enamoured with the beef rolled around some kind of champignons. The beef cooked rare was amazing; the maki rolls entrée with cucumber was something different and refreshing, never tried before; the OCTOPUS was AMAZING, chicken wings were juicy and tender and the sushi had creative combinations which were always tasty! yummy! Generally speaking the food was really good.  DID NOT LIKE: sushi pizza was served by pieces instead of full (misleading images). Kimchi is not something to recommend. The yogurt is served in hyper small containers...  I would give 4.5 because of not being the fastest on serving and with some orders not arriving and/or confusion but nevertheless, is the best sushi we have been so far (better than Aji Sai Plus, 168 sushi buffet, Yamamoto and anything else I could remember) and the service was really nice.  PS: If you pay cash, they will give you 10%off... unluckily I did not bring cash... for the next time!"}
{"text":"Went there on Tuesday night (Jan 14, 14) in a party of 6+baby when they still have the grand opening 10% off with cash. Was about 23.50/person post tax+tips (drinks not included).  ==PROS==  It's an ayce jap restaurant, but they they have 5 special dishes that are not ayce. Oyster was one of them, but I forgot the others. The presentation and taste of the specials were great.  They also have the standard jap food (sashimi, sushi, rolls, hand rolls, teriyaki, etc). I'd say those were above ayce standards.  They have a couple of unique dishes that werent available at Tenichi/Matsuda. These actually tastes good (unlike other places).  They also have a 'wok' menu where they have kung pao chicken and Chinese cuisine dishes. Those werent bad.  The presentation of all the dishes were good. Most had lettuce+carrot strips as decorations with them.  Decor of the place is good. The lighting is not too bright and not too dim.  Washroom is clean.  ==MEH==  They had a 'fruit' salad, but only had honeydew (no peach, watermelon, peach, apple, orange, etc). The veggie salad had too much thousand island dressing.  They have the mango yogurt like Tenichi/Matsuda, but it tastes different than Tenichi/Matsuda. Not as delicious. Cant figure out what's lacking.  The ice cream isnt freezing cold. Just cold. It's a bit too soft for ice cream.  The mango pudding is a bit bland.  We had baby (1.5yo) with us. We cleared an area on the table since babies like to randomly grab stuff. Annoyingly, the waiters prefer to put the food in that open area. Could be a CON for some; wasnt too bad as we intercept the dish before it even touches the table.  The efficiency of them collecting finished dishes were a bit on the slow side. We had 3 extra spots so it wasnt a noticeable issue for us. If we didnt have the extra space, we'd probably just stack it a bit more neatly.  The wasabi wasnt as intense as I thought it'd be. I had to keep adding more. Although, that could just be me as no one else seemed to have that issue.  ==CONS==  I order kimchi. Since it's fermented cabbage, I thought a bit of spoiled smell was normal. Nope, the kimchi actually went bad. Unfortunately, I swallowed it already. Will find out tomorrow (or tonight) how bad it is.  Portions (most teriyaki dishes and grilled dishes) are small. Like tiny small. Normally for fried scallops, they'd give 4-8 per dish when you just write the order number down. Here, they only give 1 scallop.  .... Even for ribs, when you write 151(x6), they'd still only give you one. Really hate those places that dont follow what I wrote and assume I cant eat that much.  The beef tataki was warm. Not sure if it was prepped properly.  ==OVERALL==  I'd say the pros balance out the cons...for now...not sure how my stomach will handle the spoiled kimchi and warm tataki. Service was acceptable. Price is decent...though that was with the 10% off. Location has ample parking so that's good.  Will I go again? Ummm...not sure...50/50 chance? I wont say no, but I also wont suggest the place initially either."}
{"text":"I want to give it a 3.4 stars. I thought it was decent for an AYCE, but once I add the price in, I feel like the value decreases for me. It still cost $30 after cash discount of 10%. Service was fine, cooked dishes were good, but I think the sushi was not as tasty as I would have liked. Not jumping at the chance to go back for AYCE, especially dinner, but their lunch boxes are reasonably priced and it seems like you get a good portion. The variety of dishes is definitely there if you're looking to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for weekend AYCE lunch.   Arrived at around noon and there were a lot of tables available. The place only really started filling up at 12:30.   The iPad ordering system is pretty convenient as it makes sure each dish arrives.   They have a decent selection of dishes, the takoyaki, tempura, and the steak teriyaki stood out. The only thing I did not really enjoy was the chicken teriyaki, it lacked freshness. Overall, the food was pretty good, you can't be too picky about quality when it comes to AYCE imo.   Service was average at best, it's better than Matsuda's. They're really quick at clearing dishes.   It cost 14.99 per adult, with a 10% discount cause we paid in cash. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Just came back here again to grab some sushi! Easy sushi ordering with the iPad as usual.  I've made reservations via the phone, under my name. Due to my uncommon name, I actually spelt out my name because of how similar it may sound plus spellings of \"Terry / Terri\"... But apparently it became a \"Sherry\" and some of the group who came in separately were confused with this.  I have to say, their food quality dropped - their takoyaki tasted so horrible this round. Sushi rolls were dry, noting from the spicy salmon or spicy crabmeat sushi rolls.  Portions of food were bad. We ordered 2 orders of Seafood Fried Rice and got this (see picture). We were also given less than we asked for. Not unusual in a Japanese AYCE setting but it was pretty distinctive this time. But for a group of 7-8 people, we ordered about 20-25 salmon sashimi pieces but only got around 10..   The oysters with house sauce was still good - probably my fave part of the meal.  Their dessert was a problem as well... They were missing half the items we wanted because they \"ran out\". With an iPad, won't updating be easier to cancel off the app? Not sure how that app works, but either way... They can still notify us when they checked our order or in the beginning when we came in. So half of what we ordered for dessert wasn't available - which led to a disappointment as I got excited to eat the chocolate mousse cake. It is also not the first time they \"ran out\" of something from the dessert menu.  Service was slightly slow because the waitresses don't pay attention to you that much. They're either talking to each other or cleaning(??) of sorts. Having to make eye contact to get their attention is hard. Even when I've raised my hands quite a bit... They somehow just don't notice.  So, I'm not impressed at either of food or the service this round. Might be time to hunt for another close-by AYCE Japanese sushi place."}
{"text":"15% cash discount for AYCE. Nice decor, decent selection and \"somewhat fast\" service.  Every order placed through the iPad requires a server to confirm it at the table. But that took quite a while on several occasions. Once confirmed, the items arrived quickly.  Sashimi slices were awkwardly thin (unlike other Sushi places). Not to say that you'll get less at the end of the day, because you can always order more. Just weird.  Presentation of the rolls were also disappointing, loose and sloppy, but this is an all-you-can-eat place after all.  At the end of the day, if you're after quantity this is the place. No missed orders and food arrived fairly quickly. But if your after quality and presentation, than try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the AYCE lunch menu. i had previously been here before for an a la carte, and it was not a good experience. However after hearing some comment on the improvements i decided to give it another shot. The lunch menu we had ordered quite a bit, and i have to say it is a mixed bag at best.   The sushi portion, the Salmon tartar, and the dragon on fire specialty roll were both highlights and good. i would definitely recommend the dragon on fire roasted roll. However the rest of the sushi, has left much to be desired. the problem with the rest of the sushi was that it was simply not fresh, the red snapper we did not even dare to eat it because the colour had tinges of green on the fish. which screams not fresh at all. The only two reason are either they are serving the leftover fish from the night before, or this place in general has fish that is not fresh. Because of al the sushi we ordered, a large portion of the sushi, contain fish that just taste like it was left over for a while.   The Cooked food portion was however much better, the flounder teppanyaki was very good, they did a great job with it, and the tempura was decent, the grilled eggplant was very nice. Overall the cooked food portion most of the food was done properly and was either average or slightly above average.   The desert did contain all the usual selections, however the Mango pudding was definitely not good at all as there was no taste. the yogurt was decent however, and the fruits they served was fresh.   The service was definitely a huge weakpoint for them. even though it is an ipad ordering restuarant, the services seem to purposely not collect empty plates, as if to discourage you from ordering more, because you might have no room.   Overall with so a mixed bag of good and bad the best i can give it 3 stars, and would not recommend people to go out of their way to come here. if you live in the area then it would make more sense, since there aren't a lot of Japanaese AYCE in the area."}
{"text":"This is my new fav AYCE, the iPad ordering system is very clear. The pictures are very good! I can keep track of what I ordered and what I like. They never missed one item that I ordered.   The waitress/waiter comes around very quickly and often and always clearing out the empty dishes  The specials we had was the fresh oyster and uni shooters, the oysters was delicious and fresh, the uni was really nice and big and fresh (too bad it's limited to 2 per person)   The rest of the food was good, there wasn't an item we did not like or did not want to finish. I don't understand why people complain about portions being small / it's 1pc per order. I love the fact that it's small and 1pc per order, that way we never over ordered / had anything left (I hate wasting food) it's all you can eat! If you know it's 1pc and you want 10pcs of it then just order more, what's the problem? It's just a press of the button.  The desserts are good, they taste like other desserts I have been to at AYCE places, the banana tempura is big and delicious and perfect w/the ice cream together.  I have been back and I would come back here again because there is a lot of variety, even some thai and dim sum dishes! And the sweet shrimp sashimi was unlimited. Actually, I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on Good Friday. They still serve their lunch specials. I like places that serve their lunch specials regardless of what day it is. The restaurant can be slightly cramped (not much space between our chairs and the chairs of the table behind us). Oh. They did do separate bills for each of us (party of 8). One other thing is that they do give a 10% discount if you pay cash.  Had: Chicken teriyaki bento ($7.99) - comes with miso soup and salad, six pieces of California roll, two shrimp and five pieces of vegetable tempura, chicken teriyaki, and rice. It's a very good amount of food for that price. The miso soup was standard. The salad was a tad watery (please dry your lettuce before trying to add dressing to it). The tempura was crispy and the vegetable pieces were large. The chicken was tender and there was a good portion of it. The California roll was quite fresh, although the pieces weren't all uniform. I have no idea what the rice taste like. My brother and I ordered the same menu item, and didn't ask for any substitutions, but his had rice and 6 pieces of California roll. I had no rice and ten pieces of California roll. Two other people in our party ordered the same thing we did, and the same thing happened to them. One of them had rice, and the other had four pieces of California roll instead of rice. I have no problems with that, because I prefer  the rolls, but there's some kind of consistency issue going on there.  Oh right. It also comes with dessert. Dessert is a small scoop of ice cream (green tea, vanilla, mango, or red bean). When I say small, think a round tablespoon, but as a scoop. Perhaps a tad larger than that. It was a tad stingy, but it took care of the sweet tooth cravings.    All in all, a very good meal for value. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here in the winter for all you can eat dinner and it was not bad, they had fresh raw oysters and plenty of sashimi options.   However I came here on the weekend for lunch and it was not the same at all. The ipad system like other sushi restaurants now a day is good love that you can keep track of all the items order, but the ipad just didn't feel clean enough and a bit sticky (yuck!)   The rice on the sushi and rolls were also warm and just didn't taste all that great. their mango salad is literally just chopped up mangos with tempura bits. Their salmon nacho thing - was also just a very very tiny blob of chopped fish on 1 pringle chip. Their specials rolls and spicy salmon sushi was not that bad though if I had to pick something to eat again there. For dessert the fried bananas were good but avoid the strawberry yogurt - it was sickeningly artificial like eating slightly berry flavoured chemicals.   The wait staff was your regular no expression waitresses, the manager didn't seem to want to do anything when we asked her for something she always scolded at the waitress to come over at times loudly."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. We had reservations at 12:30 and got there at 12:30. The first thing I noticed was the fact that many of the customers were wearing their jackets. I don't know if they didn't have the heat on or if the insulation was horrible, but the place was so cold, many wore jackets. Giving the place a chance, we sat down for AYCE. After placing the first order, food (from the kitchen and the sushi bar) trickled over the next 2 hours. And when I say trickle, I was being generous. The food that came out was cold, and we had maybe 15% of our initial order during the 2 hours. Whatever the reason was, we left at 3:30. 3 hours for an AYCE lunch while eating only 70% of what you ordered is unacceptable Forget about the 10% discount, I wouldn't return even if it's free."}
{"text":"Our group had a wicked craving for sushi. We were drawn to them for their sweet shrimp and octopus sashimi. Items that not all AYCE sushi places have. Also, for their raw oysters.   I don't even really know where to start. From beginning to end, this place was a disaster. From food, to service.. it was a huge disappointment.  We came around 5:30pm, so it was not busy. Still, the service was bad. The waitresses were rude. They handed us the iPad so we could make our orders and did not explain anything to us. So, unknowingly, we ordered a few more of the special items than were allowed. She said \"is it your first time here? there is a limit of 2 per customer for these special items\". Okay, well yes, it IS our first time here. Maybe you should have let us know before being rude about it?  The food starting coming in. The pictures on the iPad looked delicious and amazing. What came to our table was nothing like what was shown in the pictures. The tataki for some reason looked like it was all put into a platter and then microwaved. The beef was grey, and the tuna was completely cooked through.   The seafood soup came and there was only 2 pieces of shrimp in it with a whole bunch of mushrooms and seaweed. Not what it looked like in the pic..   The sashimi was only okay, it was a little bit closer to room temp and unappealing.   My sister and I ordered the uni shooter as one of our special items. It came in a little cup with what looked like a raw quail egg yolk. This thing was floating in a bunch of vinegar, and that's all you can taste. I wonder why they had to serve this in vinegar? (most likely to mask the lack of freshness???) The oysters were only okay.   We had had enough of the main dishes so we decided to get dessert and get out of there. The mango yogurts we ordered weren't even solidified! They were just liquid.. like milk. It IS okay to let your customers know if you don't have something available. I would have rather them tell me they weren't ready yet, than to serve something so disgusting. Also, a few of them came in a cracked glass shooter glass. We did not touch those. Also, the servers did not even give us spoons. We had to ask for them.. hahaha maybe she knew they were completely liquid, and that is why she did not offer us spoons?  The one highlight of the meal was the tempura banana. That was pretty good.  They did offer 10% discount if paying by cash. But a lot of places do, so that is not a draw. Also, the prices are pretty high, $26.99 for bad food.  Well, if you're looking for mediocre Japanese food and subpar service (the server basically tossed the food onto our table, and didn't take away our emptied dishes) then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and I have to say I was plesantly surprised. I ordered the kalbi bento box for $8.99. Comes with miso soup, salad as appetizers and ice cream for dessert. The bento box came with 6 piece avacodo sushi, tempura veggies and shrimp, white rice and a really good portion of kalbi. I didn't think that a simple bento box would fill me but it did. Everything tasted good and I have no complaints like I usually do.   The restaurant itself is very spacious and most people there had the AYCE option using ipads. Did they ever invest alot in those ipads. There was like a whole pile of 20 or so ipads. Service was pretty decent and the place was clean.   This one gets extra points for the great options that are available for the lunch menu. You can get ramen, sushi rolls, stone pot rice, bento boxes and even AYCE. It also gets exta points for the great value. $8.99 for all that I ate is a sweet deal in my books."}
{"text":"I came here for the AYCE dinner buffet at around 9pm on a Saturday, and it was about 75% full. One of my dad's colleagues recommended me this place, so I figure we give it a shot.  First of all, you order food via an iPad. This seems to be a trend now amongst newer AYCE restaurants. However, what's confusing is that there's no automatic order button. You have to get a waiter/waitress to come over and they would send the order in. Rather confusing.  What was even more confusing was that we got some items that were different from what we originally ordered, and we had some items we ordered that never came. Since it was our first time here, I didn't care about it too much since I wanted to try as many items as possible.  Some highlights include the raw oysters and the sushi counter (particularly impressed actually). However note for the raw oysters and some of the stuff in the top row (five in total), you can only order up to six orders combined before they charge extra. Definitely go for the full six, cause some of the stuff tasted very good. Stuff I probably wouldn't order again include the beef tataki (too overcooked), ribs (too thick), scallop on tofu (tofu tasted weird), mango pudding (bland), and ice cream (too icy and had to wait before i can eat it).  Service was rather disorganized. I mentioned about how many of our orders got mixed up and how some never came, and even if we called someone to follow up our orders we never ended up getting some of our orders at the end. Perhaps it's a new restaurant and they're still working on line management, but it's something they should work on.  Free wifi! Ask for password."}
{"text":"I would give this place 2.5 stars.  I came here for AYCE lunch, which seemed to be a better deal for a group of four, as we could try a variety of dishes. The whole iPad-ordering seems to be a new trend nowadays with many sushi restaurants. I like the concept; however, I find it unappetizing that you have to run your fingers across a screen that everyone else has touched.  Anyway, the lunch AYCE was $13.99 on a Thursday. It had a good variety of special rolls, sushi, appetizers, cooked meat dishes, noodle dishes, and rice dishes. No sashimi on the lunch menu, which is typical of most Japanese AYCE places.  The cuisine ranges from Japanese to Chinese to Thai. The food itself was decent enough. However, the rice on the rolls were not flavourful and the cooked Thai dishes were mediocre. Wasn't the worst I've had, but certainly not the best.  It was comparable to most other average Japanese AYCE restaurants in the area.  Would I return to Uoshiki? Only for lunch with coworkers, as it is the closest decent AYCE sushi restaurant around."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav all you can eat places to go to. If you love sushi,they have a good selection and fresh.But if you don't eat it at all,it still has LOTS of good cooked food to eat. tampura,chicken and beef dishes,fried rice,noodles,ect.all very good. The only thing I wish for is more desert options.The servers that work there are very nice and friendly, all though when it dose get busy, mostly jus on weekends,you have to flag them down to get someone's attention.  The iPad menu is my faaaav,I love the idea of having dinner out with little interaction with the servers, its faster,and leaves more time to interact with your loved one or friends.Plus I work in a restaurant all day everyday,so when I go out iv had enough interaction for one day.lol. I can't get enough of this place, and the price is GREAT with %10 off if you pay cash."}
{"text":"Service with an attitude.  Sushi was strangely warm.  Dishes were dirty.  They don't give you then portion sizes they have in the pictures at all.  Tempura is soggy.  I won't come back"}
{"text":"Uoshiki started off by losing our large group reservation that was booked a week ago. Awesome. Told us to break off into smaller groups to sit. Hell no. After much confusion, we finally got seated.  Food is not bad for AYCE, but still not the best in the GTA. Service is friendly and courteous. Price is okay (cost me $28 after tax and tips on a Friday night). Canned beverage do cost extra though.  Interestingly, we can order food through an iPad. I like the techy idea. It is user-friendly, easy to track items, and has nice visuals and clear description of each item. It definitely saves a lot of time. Wrong. It cancels out when it took so dang long to flag the waiter down. The order doesn't automatically go to the kitchen when you send it off through the iPad. Waiter needs to come and do it manually.  One thing to note is that there are limitations on how many \"special\" appetizers you can order per person. Items include: (1) 2pcs raw oysters, (2) uni shooter, (3) tofu topped with scallop, and (4) 3pcs cold crab legs. Adults can order 2 of the 4 items. Seniors can only order 1 of the 4 items. Odd rule.  The highlight of the whole meal - Deep fried bananas with chocolate sauce. Other than that, you can pretty much skip the entire dessert menu. Usually dessert excites me and it is the one thing I look forward to at AYCE. I'm not impressed with this one.  Overall, 2.5 stars. Will I come back for AYCE again? No. For cheap lunch specials? Yes."}
{"text":"Have the lunch special   Avoid the ayce. Thin slice of fish too much rice.  They do have a dimsum option which is cool"}
{"text":"Pro - fancier sashimi options (sweet shrimp, octopus, uni, snow crab, oyster). Servers were very friendly.  Cons - food did not taste that fresh. Restaurant felt sticky and dirty through out. Was very worried in the restroom when I saw a sign for \"do not stand on the toilet\"."}
{"text":"This is the most tasteless noodles I ever had... The soup base tastes like water *not exaggerating*.. I mean if the instant noodles I make at home are better tasting than this I dont see the point of you guys putting noodles on your menu LOL"}
{"text":"came here on a recommendation and reviews on  yelp.  I was pretty disappointed at this place.  When we came in, there wasn't enough Ipads, so that was a bummer.  Not a super experienced sushi eater, ipad would of helped.  Things that bothered me the most was the service.  Not enough waitresses, you have to ask for something 3 or 4 times, and that's not a exaggeration.  When you order, you have to be careful, you would think it comes in 3 to 4 pieces, but it only comes in 1 peice.  This confusion causes a backup, but saves the owner money for wasted food i guess.  Another complaint is about 25% of the stuff we ordered never came.  I am not kidding, not just 1 or 2, about 6-7 items, hand rolls, crab rolls...  What was the point in ordering then?  We were there for almost 3 hours, because everything  took so long to come.  The ice cream took 40 minutes to come after asking 3 times...  Would not come again, food wasn't the greatest, taste was lacking, service is terrible.  The waiters speak mandarin, i wonder if we didn't get stuff cause she didn't understand English.  They only good thing is that there is a grand opening special, 10-15% off if you pay by cash."}
{"text":"- Cheap and filling Bento Boxes  - Wide AYCE selection for dinner  Dinner AYCE is $25 before tips and tax on Thursday. Their non-sushi dishes are amazing. Their lightly cooked sashimi is amazing (idk what its called)."}
{"text":"Been here twice with my family for dinner AYCE.. Both times with big groups- service is 3.9/5. Food is average, not bad. But sometimes sashimi may not be fresh, as well as the oysters........ Beware the possible ache in your stomach. One dish on the ayce tablet was pretty good.. I had the chicken pad thai.. which was good. I recommend this place only if you're gonna try the pad thai. Hahah. I rate this restaurant 7.5/10"}
{"text":"We, party of 4, came here for dinner. Glad this place is AYCE and the 15% discount offered here through WeChat. My wife made a 7 pm reservation to this joint. When we got here they said there's no table and told us to wait for 30 minutes. What the hell did they our reservations for?!  Meanwhile there's two long table that can seat approximately 12 ppl were empty. I ask nicely if you can split the table. The waitress said no!  She didn't even ask the manager. I said to her get the manager for me. When the manager came we explained our situation. The manager split the long table for us to seat.   Finally seated, the waitress brought an iPad over. You order food on the device, therefore whatever you order should arrive on your table. Say you order 12 salmon sashimi, you suppose to get 12. But no, I got 8. I ordered 4 flounder teriyaki, I got 2. I ordered 4 salmon roses, I got 2. This place is all lies and no consistency. The table next to us seated 2, they got 8 oysters (which was limited to 2 pieces per person for the whole night).  We got 8 oysters and we have party of 4. There consistency sucks!  Oh by the way, they don't clear your empty plates. Their excuse was \"oh we are busy\". That is no excuse.  The food wise is meh. This place cannot compare to Ten Ichi, it is like night and day!    With all of my review, I always ask will we come back to this restaurant?  Flat out NO!  Food:  3/5 Ambience:  3/5 Service:  1/5 Cleanliness:  2/5"}
{"text":"$6.99 for sushi lunch at Uoshiki? I am not complaining!  Cheap sushi fix and it is quite decent too! Good fish selection!  If you not into sushi, there are other cooked item to choose from Ramen, Udon, Bento Box. They even have good vegetarian combo too.  Just shut up and eat!  Lunch Special till 4 pm comes with Salad, Soup and Dessert (pudding, yogurt or ice cream)  Grand Opening 10% off with cash payment.. AYCE menu available.  Really $6.99 and 10% off for my lunch...."}
{"text":"came here for lunch ... thinking the lunch special would be good.. ended up hungrier than when i came... dont bother ordering the sashimi lunch.. its not even enough to serve a 2 year old child.   price isnt the best.     I really want this corner spot to do well.. but it just keeps failing.  what a shame."}
{"text":"For the pricing, this place is great for lunch specials and the portions are very generous. The quality of the lunch menus are not bad either; although cannot compare to some other Japanese/Korean restaurants in terms of freshness. However, the lunch specials are very generous, including soup, salad and ice cream for a very low price. Restaurant is very clean and service is great. For a quick lunch, this is a good place to go and incredibly affordable. I often come here with my family as it is a good place for a sushi fix that includes other dishes."}
{"text":"Competetive Price, I came for ALYE, and nothing so special.  Service is 2.5 some server dont speak english well that they dont know what you are asking."}
