{"text":"I'm quite surprised the reviews are so low... I haven't gotten their take out so maybe that's why. It also helps this my native language/food. I've tried 4-5 dishes and everything has been great. The cuisine is can be described as Russian/Central Asian so expect a lot of dumplings as well as lamb dishes. If you've tried Xinjiang food it's very similar as they have pilav and lamb skeweres as well. I had cheburek, kazakh dumpling, pilav and lamb skewers. My friend tried borsch which was also good. The service was alright, can be slow at times but I didn't mind as I wasn't in a rush. It's located inside GoodLife building which can be a bit hard to find. Decor is nice, it's a casual place. Location is a bit far at Finch West but close to Russian stores and other Russian restaurants. Will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"I'm only giving Chaihana 2 stars because I feel bad for all the hard work the chefs have put in. Other than that, the restaurant and service were awful.   When my friends and I first walked in, the restaurant looked nothing like the pictures online. We waited 10 minutes for the host until we decided to seat ourselves upstairs. There was nobody to welcome us, or to seat us and let us know about the restaurant and Tajik and Uzbek cuisine.   The waiter was especially lazy and completely disorganized. Not only did he get our orders wrong, but we had to constantly flag him down for cutlery, or water, and new orders. A simple dinner turned into a stressful ordeal... and it was impossible to enjoy our food because something was always missing. He didn't even bother clearing our plates or taking away our menus. He could have cared less that we were eating at the restaurant.   Overall if you're going to get food here, order out if you must. They were missing a lot of items from their menu, even the pilaf which is what I had originally come for.   At the end, my friends and I were left disappointed and annoyed. Honestly such a bad experience."}
{"text":"We spent 10 minutes just trying to find the place, it is inside the office building and there are no signs whatsoever. Yet, when we found this place we were really surprised, the interior is very high end, not sure whether it's authentic or not. The food is delicious. It is mainly Uzbek cuisine with many Russian and Middle Eastern choices. We shared shakarob salad and meat kutabs, I had shurpa salmon soup and my husband had lagman soup. We also shared lamb kebabs and khinkali. Everything tasted great and the prices were very reasonable. The service was friendly but slow even though the restaurant was half empty. It took 15 min before our order was taken and almost 30 min before we got our meal... Yet, we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party on a Thursday evening.   Pros: - Decently priced  - Relaxing/casual ambiance   Cons: - Waiters were very unprofessional. We had to ask for water 3 times before they brought it. We were served food on tiny side plates and were only given regular plates when we asked for them. Our dinner plates weren't removed when dessert and dessert plates were brought  out. We had to stack them up for them to realize that they should take them. (We were the only table there so it's not like it was busy).  - Food was average"}
{"text":"Overall, this is a very traditional restaurant. So don't expect a westernized setting with westernized food. The food, the service, and the price are all very reasonable, compared to other similar places. I found the decor amazing and the food tasted good and fresh. There are some minor issues such as lack of free parking, hidden entrance, and perhaps an unnecessary giant TV/DJ table, which don't fit the decor as well, but if you are into good, homemade style food, this is a must try. I also do think their menu can be shortened and some photos added for clarification."}
{"text":"High price... Food varieties is bad .... In general if you wan to enjoy Uzbek food don't go there .... It is not even restaurant .... It is like some sort of banquette place with very overpriced low quality food..."}
{"text":"This place is alright. We ordered take out from Just Eats. Wanted to try something new and it doesn't get more rare than central asian cuisine. Actually it's a mix of central Asian cuisine with some Russian/Georgian dishes. It's like Kavkaz or Suliko but even more menu options.  We ordered Beshbarmak, and beef kebob dinner with fries, and cherry dumplings. The beshbarmak was a bit disappointing. Not much flavor to it. It came with a soup which was sort of like a lesser version of Pho. The beef pieces in the Beshbarmak were like stewing beef. The noodles are similar to some Uyghur flat noodles I had elsewhere. Overall if I want beef with noodles, got to stick with pho. This dish was lacking.  The beef chunk kebob was just ok. 2 Skewers for $15 with fries is alright. Compared to all other kebob flavors I've tried (Iranian, Turkish, Afghan, Lebonese, Pakistani), this has to be the least flavorful kebob I've ever had. It's edible but it just isn't special.  The cherry dumplings I enjoyed very much.   The whole experience came with a salad and 3 sauces (sour cream, ketchup, and another red sauce which we could not identify).   I'm not sure why this place gets $$$ as the rating. $15 for a main is pretty fair to me. Should be 2 dollar signs.  Would I order again? Probably but I'm not dying to try again."}
{"text":"This is what I just emailed them... I just had your food delivered for the 1st time. Although the food is very good, I was quite disappointed in the order of dark meat chicken kabob. The menu states 2 skewers of chicken with potatoes and you filled the bottom of a small round container with potatoes so full that you could only fit about 1 skewer of chicken. I do not like to pay the price for chicken only to receive mostly potatoes. You should rename this dish 2 skewer of potatoes with a side order of chicken."}
{"text":"Upon entering I found the high ceiling and central Asian, Uzbek prints & decorum to be lovely.  The restaurant was spacious, clean and had a homey feel. Sadly the experience only declined from then on. Our waiter was great but the food was not. The meats were tough and although served with a bed of onions ,you could not taste it nor the seasoning (cumin etc) . The samsa, non and lamb tasted microwaved.  My company and I left disappointed. It's a new restaurant so hopefully there is a turn around in a positive direction."}
{"text":"I order their food as take-outs once in a while when I'm craving a tasty pilaf or chicken tabaka."}
{"text":"Well, you guys were not exaggerating.  Most reviews here contain a warning of the subpar service at Chaihana, but I figured it had to be blown out of proportion.  It wasn't.  We arrived right at noon on a Saturday and the place was empty. I mean, completely empty. There wasn't a customer or staff member in sight. After standing around for a few minutes, we noticed that someone was arranging cutlery behind a curtain in the back, so I walked over and asked if the restaurant was indeed open. The guy looked supremely annoyed by this interruption, grabbed a couple of menus, and told us to sit where we wanted. We did and he pretty much threw the menus on the table and went back behind the curtain.  Not the best start to the meal.  Our surly waiter returned a few minutes later to pour us some water and take our orders. I decided to go with the Pilav (\"Ancient traditional Central Asian meal prepared with lamb, round rice, carrot, onion, peas and barberry\"), to which the waiter asked if I wanted one or two. Baffled, I said one. Why would I want two plates of food?  The food arrived about 10 minutes later and it was good. The meat was very soft and flavorful, while the rice contained some spices I couldn't quite identify but which were pretty tasty. But the dish had been cooked with an almost overwhelming amount of oil, to the extent that the plate was practically swimming in grease. Needless to say, I felt quite full afterwards.  It was an interesting meal that I don't regret eating, but that horrific service and overly greasy food preparation means I'll never return."}
{"text":"Finally, a Central Asian restaurant in Toronto!  This place is located in a non-description office building at Finch and Dufferin - it occupies space inside the building and is not visible from the street.  It is a large bilevel place with a huge adjoining banquet room.  The cheerful orange decor has a pleasant oriental flair.  The food is excellent.  It is mostly Uzbek with a few dishes from other countries.  Try the delicious spicy carrot salad, the shurpa soups, the semi-flat leposhka bread and the little kutabi pies.  We all had the plov (rice pilaf) as a main dish and it was wonderful.  They also have a wide assortment of kebabs, which we have not tried yet.    It helps to have a Russian speaker in your party, as English is somewhat limited.  But the service was very gracious and friendly.  I hope they will add a few more main dishes to their menu in the future - would like to see a bit more variety of non-kebab offerings.  But would highly recommend this as a new addition to the diversity of cuisine in Toronto."}
{"text":"Kazy horse meat was very good. Normally horse meat is expensive. This one is reasonably price. Lamb kabob is usual. Everything is tasty but a bit oily. Samsha is the best."}
{"text":"I recently had the immense pleasure of visiting the wonderful/beautiful \"Chaihana Bar | Restaurant | Lounge\" and enjoyed a very delicious, nutritious, hearty, and colorful Uzbek dinner, and will definitely keep coming again and again. I loved their comforting Kharcho as my appetizer, which consisted of succulent, boneless, and yummy chunks of lean beef, with walnuts, rice, and fresh herbs. It was an awesome powerhouse of sumptuous nutrition. Another delicious appetizer I enjoyed was their Kutabi with Meat, a soft patty containing tasty ground beef and fresh herbs. For my sumptuous main course, I savored their yummy, healthy, colorful, and hearty Plov, which was a generous serving of rice mixed with various all-natural and fresh ingredients (eg. chick peas, carrots, onions, garlic, etc.) and topped with succulent, boneless, and yummy chunks of lean beef. The wonderful Plov was served in a beautiful and ornamental bowl adorned with majestic art. Orders were taken by a very courteous, cheerful, efficient, and sweet young lady, who also brought the wonderful food right to my table, with a smile. All the staff members were very hospitable and efficient. The Uzbek culture is famous for its tremendous hospitality and generosity. Many yummy items to choose from. Large variety. Very high quality food in very generous portions at very good prices. No wonder the place was packed, with many dine-in patrons as well as take-out patrons. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed. Majestic ambiance. The decor is magnificent, with beautiful Uzbek art adorning the walls and ceiling. Feels as if one is in a royal palace. Even the washroom was way nicer than the ones in 5-star hotels in the GTA. The dining area is immaculately clean and tidy. Plenty of tables. Two floors. All forms of payment accepted. Prime and convenient location in the Finch Ave W and Dufferin St area of Toronto. Within easy proximity of Highways 407, 401, and 400. Plenty of parking. Bus shelters/stops at doorstep for many local and express routes for TTC, YRT, and VIVA transit systems. Only 2 stops, about 10 minutes, to and from York University (Keele Campus) on board TTC's 196 Rocket Express, which travels along the York University Busway, a dedicated bus-only road. The starting point of this Busway is only about 500 metres north of the restaurant. Only 2.8KM from York University (Keele Campus), 2.6KM from Downsview Airport, and 5KM from Toronto's famous Yorkdale Shopping Centre. My sincere thanks to the wonderful staff of Chaihana for making my first visit a very enjoyable one and I look forward to continue dining at your great establishment on an ongoing basis. God Bless."}
{"text":"That place does the job for a good meal, nothing more, nothing less.  The menu offers a decent variety of options and all the breads, soups and meat dishes were great. Adding to the fact that the portions are generous and the prices very affordable.   The setting is interesting ; it is attached to a banquet hall that you have to go into if you want to use the washrooms. There's also a huge television and sound system that makes you feel you eat at a friend's place rather than being in a restaurant.  I would give this place a 4 stars if it wasn't for the service to be slow, slightly cold and it took a very long time before we were greeted."}
{"text":"Let this be a warning to all that want to try this place (Trust me, you will thank me). I had ordered the chicken tabaka, which came out to around $14. When the food arrived... the chicken looked like it had been run over by a truck and the truck had reversed and ran it over again countless times. The \" Georgian herbs and spices\" advertised is just 1 ingredient - GARLIC. If vampires did exist, this would definitely be my weapon of choice. I felt like the garlic was to cover the taste of the meat, which may have gone bad. I felt extremely sick after and wanted to throw up.   You have been warned! Who needs stakes for vampires when you got Chicken Tabaka?!?!?"}
{"text":"Food 3/5: blended, simple, small portions, no flavor except for 1 sauce.  Service 4/5: the are friendly and attentive. Personal using wireless headphones to pass your order but it looks funny and not necessary in empty restaurant.   Location 2/5: its an addition to a night club. Its not an stand alone restaurant. Paid parking. No good view.  They have 2 levels. 1 its like you are at cheap ugly mall and 2nd is so high and there is so many loud sounds coming from club rehearsal. Its not comfortable. Looks like whole restaurant just an \"who cares\" addition.  Price 2/5: $$$. other \"Russian\" restaurants are cheaper or better.  Will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and so do my parents who are very picky and like the food to taste like \"back home\". The girls who work here are very nice, food is always delicious."}
{"text":"It smells funny when you walk in.  They had a 10 year old taking our order.  I personally did not enjoy any of the food items but it could possibly be just a personal preference.  The vinegar on our table had about 10 fruit flies floating around in it so we told one of the waitresses who then went around the empty restaurant replacing all the vinegars.  I will never go back."}
