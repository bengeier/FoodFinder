{"text":"Authentic food at a reasonable price!  People are extremely nice. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the Steeler game and walking the burgh when we decided to stop by for lunch Sunday. What a treat!  Loved the food and the owner who was very friendly and welcoming. Very clean, too!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, I got the falafal entree.  The owner and his waitstaff were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Now called Madonna's.... This place is incredible.  The food is fantastic. The portions are large.  The prices are very fair. The people who work there are sweethearts.  Hummus is perfect.  Get the Shawarma meal with meat grape leaves and Tabbouli as sides.  Extra Garlic sauce.  THE BEST."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and reasonably priced.  Only negative was that there was a language barrier since I don't speak Greek and they didn't have everything on their menu at lunchtime.  Now that I know the drill Id definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing Shawarma And Manakish. We stopped in for a layover from the Amtrak and I'm so glad we did. One of if not the best garlic sauce I've had on a Shawarma in many of the large city's I've lived in."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place twice a week in a last month. Food is very delicious. If you like lamb meat with potatoes then go there for lunch on Wednesday, but be there before noon cause it's usually over by that time. They cook lamb only on Wednesdays. Chicken shawarma and chicken kebab is also very delicious. Owner works there himself everyday and he is nice to everybody who walks in through the door."}
{"text":"I've been eyeballing this restaurant for a couple of weeks now. I finally got the courage to venture in and I am so excited that I did! The owner is a sweet man who took the time to explain my options and what everything was. For $9 you get a protein with two sides. I got the chicken with garlic sauce, rice with lentils and hummus. Everything was homemade and amazing. And the restaurant was clean and inviting. He asked me to write a review if I like my meal, turns out, it was the best lunch I've had since working downtown! Highly recommend stepping out of the norm and trying something new, like Palmyra's!"}
{"text":"The food here is really fresh and well done. Samir is a very friendly man and he makes delicious food. I especially like the meat plates and the Middle Eastern hospitality provided by the owners. I've been to many Mediterranean restaurants and this is one of the better ones for sure. The prices are reasonable as well. Ask Samir for the garlic sauce with the shwarma. It is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Good portions and friendly people. Be sure to say \"yes\" to garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I came in intending to use a $10 Off Certificate on an order of $20 or more, but when I went to use it the guy who was in charge points to a picture of the Certificate and says \"it can only be used on a group of 5 or more\". On the picture on the wall it shows it handwritten in sharpie. However, it does not say this on my certificate - nor does not say anything on the issuer's website.   The food was good, even late at night their food is still very good. However, this Certificate issue makes me reconsider coming back here - because it is outrageous to make a random claim that you must have 5 or more people."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and homemade. The chicken shawarma is beyond delicious and juicy. Such a good value for your money!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Mediterranean food I have had anywhere.  The chicken shawarma is amazing.  Hummus, falafel, and grape leaves were so good!The owners are so friendly and we had a great time!!!"}
{"text":"Came with my two grown kids for lunch.  I had the Deluxe Salad with chicken tawook; meat was tender and the portion size was generous. My daughter enjoyed her lamb and beef shawarma with a great tomato and cucumber salad and rice. The lamb was juicy and perfectly spiced. My son ate a bit of most of the menu, his favorite was the chicken shiskabob, although he enjoyed every bit of it. The owner brought us, gratis, delightful pistachio topped bits of sweetness for dessert, called namoura. I have gad a lot of Mediterranean type desserts, but this took the cake (pun intended). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday noon.  They were open but most tables had food on them (looked like they were preparing for a catering delivery).  Nobody greeted us, nobody asked us what we wanted or welcome us to sit.  I asked someone if I could order food and they said yes, however when we ordered they just pulled two or three plates out of a fridge, and heated in the microwave.  Needless to say we weren't able to eat a bit of it.  It looked disgusting, was dry and hard, and the service was terrible.  Tried to point out or concerns to the staff but they were so 'busy' they didn't pay attention.  I decided to just trow the food away, pay and leave.   IDK if it is always like that but regardless of how busy you are, you don't give your customers old, reheated food, period.  I would've been Okay if they told me \"sorry, we're busy and I can't take you now\".. or at least if they had given me good food."}
{"text":"4 stars based on food. I particularly love their beef and lamb shawarma which is different than other establishments who use gyro meat as their beef/lamb shawarma. It's delicious! Food tastes very authentic and homemade. The downfall to this place is there is not much organization or a regular process for how food is ordered/made/paid for. It varies each time causing confusion and longer waits. Luckily each time I've been there it has been during off-hours otherwise I think it would be chaotic. Overall, good food and prices!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean in the city. The shawarma cannot be beat, and the garlic sauce takes it to the next level. The portions are large, the prices are low, and I recommend this place to people I meet both in Pittsburgh and when traveling as someplace to check out in the burgh.   No frills, just fantastic flavor. Easy to park nearby. Great for a quick bite, but beware you might need to take a box home since you get so much."}
{"text":"The best shawarma you will ever have...I've tried it in a couple different states but this has always by far been the best - I have to get it every time I come to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"so delicious food,and good for diet.Samir and his wife always nice with customers such a nice atmosphere inside"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma and garlic sauce , trust me is super delicious . everything is clean . staff there are friendly and respectful."}
{"text":"I had the Lamb & Beef Shawarma Sandwich (really a wrap) delivered for lunch, and it was fine. The lamb was delicious, but the overall taste was just decent. It's a little on the small side to be a full meal, but not overly so. It was also cool by the time it got to me, so I'm not sure if that'd due to the delivery company I used or the cold ingredients mixed with the meat.   Its good but not great. If I was hungry and walking by, sure, I'd stop for a $7.49 wrap. Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"This places is 6 blocks from my office so it is not somewhere I would normally stop for lunch. It I happened to be in the area of town and boy am I glad I did.  Half of my lunch break will be taken walking to and from but I will be back.  I ordered the chicken shawarma with rice and tabbouli.  The chicken had a garlic sauce which was heavenly. But beware it has a very strong garlic flavor so might want to stay away if you are worried about garlic breath.  The tabbouli.... wow.  I wish I could get that at a side everywhere.   I have never had that anywhere before and I just want more. You definitely can't go wrong with stopping here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is very nice and the food is delicious. Reasonable prices as well. I tried gyro, the meat stuffed grape leaves, and the cheese, meat pies. My favorite so far is the gyro, just perfect, the chicken is not dry and not oily. They make their own garlic sauce which is the magic touch to the gyro. Unbeatable, it's the best I've tried in Pittsburgh so far. The place has enough tables if you want to eat in, I usually grab my gyro after work and eat it on my way. Restrooms are neat and clean which is impressive! They can be very busy, and they run out of food pretty fast as the place gets packed during lunch time and evening."}
{"text":"The place has amazing food. Everything is fresh and the portions are perfect. I went here with my colleagues on a client visit and they absolutely loved it.  I ordered the shish kabob entree which came with 2 skewers and 2 sides of your choice. I got the salad and hummus with pita bread. This place has the best hummus in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Everyone is so so nice and the portions are perfectly matched to the price. The food is amazing and it's easy to eat healthy here!! Love it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the food here!! They have the best falafel in the 'burgh!! Samir, the owner, is the best and so friendly! He remembers me and my friends when we go in and makes our sandwiches with love. I can't say enough about the service, the restaurant itself, and, most importantly, the food! You HAVE to try it!   LOVE YOU, SAMIR!!! :)"}
{"text":"I had my once a year, completely random craving for falafel today.  They have some damn good falafel!  The inside of the restaurant is clean and nice, and the owners were really sweet and let me try a piece of falafel before they gave me my sandwich.  A falafel sandwich and an order of vegetarian grape leaves were $8.  Not too bad!  I will definetly be back!  Their hummus is fantastic!"}
{"text":"After a meeting in this neighborhood, at the foot of the Smithfield bridge, I decided to pop in for a quick lunch. In addition to getting a DELICIOUS lunch, I met the nicest people. The owners were lovely! I had a schwarma sandwich and it was the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh. I look for Schwarma everywhere I go and this was BY FAR the best I've had since leaving Washington DC.  Delicious cake and desserts!  This is my new favorite place. Great food, great people. Exceeded my expectations!  You must try it!"}
{"text":"The place is simple but it clean and smell nice. The food is fresh and daily prepared. The service was great and the staff was friendly and lovely. They serve very yummy saj spically the cheese one and also they serve the cleanest and the best chicken shawarma ever I really love it so much my husband choose the shawarma Arabi and it's also delicious I recommend it for every one.. yum yum"}
{"text":"I've finally found the best casual Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh (in my opinion). I can't believe I didn't know about Palmyra sooner than now - and it's right around the corner from where I live and work!! It's incredible. The tabbouleh is fresh, no unnecessary adds to it, not too much wheat bulgar. The chicken is done just right. Not dry. The sides and sauces are delicious! Can't say enough good about this place!"}
{"text":"So even though I like this place better than Madonna's down the street, I will say that it you should only go if you know what you want. Their English is a little lacking, the flavor of their food is definitely better, but they are much slower in service."}
{"text":"What makes a great restaurant is definitely in part the staff. Everyone here was incredibly friendly and welcoming. I visited with a friend who eats here frequently. I knew it was going to be good when I asked her for a recommendation and she responded with \"everything I've tried has been delicious!\"   I went with the chicken shawarma. One of my biggest concerns is dry chicken. Quite the opposite experience here. The chicken was juicy and delicious. I also got a side of the garlic sauce. THIS IS A MUST. I had rice, tabbouli, and green beans as sides. All were excellent. My meal also came with pita.   For the price (under $10), the portion size was very generous and filling. My friend also got the spicy hummus, which she highly recommended for my next visit.   I can't believe I've been working downtown for many years and this was just my first visit. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We use them for catering all the time, the food is amazing. Authentic and delicious middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service! No frills, but comfortable & clean atmosphere. Overall awesome spot.   I always get the chicken shawarma entree, which comes with two sides. I usually get the cucumber/tomato salad and one of the rice options. Oh, and remember to get the garlic sauce!   During my most recent visit, I got my usual and my partner got the lamb and beef shawarma pita. Both of us were pleased. The owner even made me a mini lamb pita while we waited. Yum!  I'll be back. Over and over, I'm sure :)"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much but I like it a lot and I come here pretty regularly. Hands down better than Madonna's! Best middle eastern food downtown for the price. Pretty good deal too. Try the lamb sheesh kebab, sleek, falafel, hummus. Everything is well seasoned, made with care and very flavorful. They have some good specials for their entrees too."}
{"text":"Wow, the food was delicious!  We decided to try Palmyra on a Sunday and was lucky enough to park on the street right in front of the place. I don't know where else I would have parked but I was prepared to circle the blocks looking for a place so totally stoked that I got a place right out front.  We were a bit early but it didn't bother anyone, we just sat at a booth at the window.  There were apparently friends or family there with a lot of small kids which added to the friendliness of the place.  We were there for lunch so we got a hummus appetizer and falafel pita.  The hummus was fantastic, I think the creamiest I've ever had.  The falafel was also wonderful.  I really enjoyed my meal, and the friendliness and authenticity of everyone working there.  So glad they're open Sundays!"}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Pittsburgh for Mediterranean food. The owner, Samir, is so so welcoming and makes a damn good pita sandwich. He chops up all the ingredients perfectly uniform so every bite is perfection. Best sleek I have ever had, so much flavor and made with the freshest kale. His spicy hummus is so creamy and delicious. He happily hands out a falafel dipped in hummus to patrons waiting in line. I would (and sometimes do) eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"Went back several times, and had a bit more to compare with.  Had the Shish Kabob dinner and sandwich.  The sandwich was prepared with great care, and for some reason, it was better than the dinner.  The dinner, well, it so happened that the lamb wasn't really skewers of lamb meat chunks, but rather lamb minced meat and then clumped together, as from a gyro.  So on this latter experience, it was a disappointment, as the quality of the meat was much lower than I would expect for a $10.69 lunch bill.  Also, the Baba Banouch didn't feel exactly as what I expected, and it looked uninspired, and felt more like cream of wheat.  The Fattoush salad was also uninspiring, but that may be because it is not season for tomatoes yet, and these tomatoes from the industrialized agriculture source all taste bland."}
{"text":"This is excellent. Great food, very authentic and not pricey. If you want to taste real Shwarma, you ought to go here. The grilled Kabob and Taouk is great, too. The hummus is delicious.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here because of the rating, but was slightly disappointed. To be fair, I came for the sfeeha but they said they only serve this Sunday's and Mondays. I decided to go with the lamb shawarma and a side of fries instead. The shawarma was good, but not great. The meat tasted a bit more gamey than I prefer. The fries were deliciously golden, but nothing special. Everything is decently priced. The staff were very friendly! Overall I'd give this place a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"They are so good to me here. I always ask for extra pita and nine times out of ten I'm not charged. I've been a regular for quite sometime and that might have something to do with it. If you ask me I say it's just good old fashioned customer service. OMG the kebabs are so damn good. I just can't even handle it. The marinade makes me want to do tumbles down Smithfield. And the tabbouleh is enough to make me want to free base it. I kid, of course. But it's that good. So good. The best."}
{"text":"One word, get the SFIHA (pronounced ess-fee-ha). They're Middle Eastern-style meat micro-pizza. They're phenomenal here!. A hungry dude or a Steeler could devour probably 3 or 4 or 5 of them. Nibbling 1 or 2 of them might be sufficient to fill a small to medium sized human. If you're vegan, they got you covered too.   In every town there are few gems you keep frequenting for consistent favorite things. In Pittsburgh, I recently discovered the sfiha at Palmyra. Sfiha is an open face pie which is baked freshly inside a brick oven. They make it every single time right in front of you. It's topped with seasoned meat (beef and or lamb) and pine nuts. The sfiha here is huge, so tasty, so hearty and filling. It's about $4 each. It's best consumed with yogurt or salad. The lady there bakes them with love! They have vegetarian options like cheese or chilis or thyme (it would be called man'ousheh). This is a family owned restaurant located at a busy difficult-to-find-parking area of Downtown Pittsburgh. Tried so many items here and by far the best order was the SFIHA. Their falafels are good. Shawarma was the least favorite. It's sad that they use mayonnaise instead of home made garlic sauce.  Interior is very humble and probably needs renovation. Staff are super sweet but service can be very slow. This place is perfect to order sfihas to go. They did make me come back again and again and will do again."}
