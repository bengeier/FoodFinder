{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside - but I was told to try it so my family did this past weekend.  We were greeted right away & everyone seemed very pleasant.  We ordered... and even though the place wasn't busy at all (on Saturday night) we barely ever saw anyone again.  I've worked in restaurants and bars most of my life & this service was way below what should be expected.  When we finally got someones attention to let them know my food was still freezing in the middle - they took it - someone came back to tell me the reason was because of the guacamole on top - however, I explained that I understood...but couldn't buy that that was why the middle of my tacos were ice cold.  Regardless... I was not interested in having them recooked...by this time my husband was finished with his meal and my 2 year old was ready to go as well.  I've had to send food back at other restaurants before... no big deal...but this was the first time I had been somewhere and it wasn't removed from the bill.  After another 30 minutes trying to get someones attention it was taken off - but not very willingly.  I had high hopes for a great Mexican restaurant... guess we'll just have to keep looking."}
{"text":"We will never go back after we saw the owner \"Manuela\" pouring cheap tequila to a \"Patron bottle\", this is not honest because If we pay for a shot of Patron, we want to get patron, also my neighbor said that she ask for a shot of Gran Manier and was not gran manier, we know the owner and she is changing expensive liquor for cheap liquor,  we already called to the liquor department, they already went there. Also I know that she is employing illegal immigrants to underpay them, they work more then 55 hours weekly and Manuela doesn't pay overtime, I know this because a friend of mine works there, I won't say name because I don't want him to get fired, but yeah we will call immigration services to investigate this restaurant because what's Manuela is doing is absolutely illegal. Good luck"}
{"text":"Why the hate? I see a lot of bad reviews on here and do not understand why. The place is no 5 star eatery by any means. But its good mexican food if in the area, again not great like some old fashion joints make it but it's at least a few steps above Filiberto's. Staff is friendly, place is never too packed. I reccomend the carne asda burrito with cheese sour cream and hot sauce only. Even the bean and cheese burrito is pretty good with a large chicken taco. Give this place a chance but don't go in expecting to be blown away."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, staff was nice, service was prompt.....a hidden gem.  We were there half hour before close and they were very welcoming, did not rush us or the other couple that came in after we did."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  I had the enchiladas suizas and my friend ordered the chicken fajitas.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Ordered camarones al mojo de ajo, for $14.99. I was given 10 shrimps with too much butter. They were slightly warm. It didn't not seem like they were recently cooked or cooked all the way through. I was only able to eat 4 before my stomach started feeling queasy due to all the butter. The side rice was also cold, and had little flavor. Definitely not worth the price. I will not be returning to this restaurant!

My sister ordered fajitas. Again hardly warm, not even sizzling in the plate. Little to no seasoning. She couldn't even get through half her meal due to the bad taste."}
{"text":"We've been going to Las Cazuelas for about 8 years now. The children's menu is only $2.95 per plate, and that includes a drink too! They have 99 cent margaritas on Tuesdays & Thursdays! Fantastic service! Just love it here!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant. I'm from the northwest and wish there was a restaurant as good as this. Excellent service and fresh food. They have two different salsas and both are out of this world delicious! So flavorful! And the tortillas, so perfect! If you're in the mood for Mexican, this would be the spot to come! I will most certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"I have lived in phoenix all my life and seeing as mexican food is one of the main dishes here it goes without saying that i have tried numerous places both good and bad. This unfortunately was a bad one, the flour tortillas and salsa were the best thing of the 2 dishes I tried. The beans though they were creamy and smooth seriously lacked flavor of any kind the rice was also just as bland as disappointing. The chips they serve when you first sit down are ok, but they only serve 1 basket free where 99% of other places will serve you as many as want. this isn't a huge deal but it adds to the experience. All in all it was not the worst mexican food ever it just didnt meet the standard that has been set by the south phoneix classics which are Carolina's, Poncho's, and Rito's."}
{"text":"Have ate here a few times and have never had any complaints...til now!!! Went in on Saturday night to the karaoke bar which is the next room over. My friend ordered a Corona (bottle). I being the designated driver ordered a Coke & was charged $5.00 for it! Total rip-off!! When I went back to complain as to why a Coke costs more than the alcohol? The only answer I got was prices are different after certain hours. Needless to say I will not be returning!!"}
{"text":"It's one of those places that can either be amazing or \"Meh. I've experienced better\" They didn't understand that I didn't want corn in my rice (no big deal) the chips were hard and dry like they were from Costco (you could still eat them, and we did) the food was \"ok\" and inexpensive. Service was adequate."}
{"text":"Mucha variedad de comida Mexicana...Mariscos Combinaciones y mucho mas!!! Les recomiendo visitarnos...exelente!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, good service,  good food. It's also a good place to go if not everyone in your party is in the mood for Mexican food as they have other more American options on the menu. Fish filet with butter-garlic sauce is one of my favorites, great authentic ceviche and shrimp cocktail,  as well as non-seafood dishes.  They have a bar area that's semi-separated from the dining area with a bar type menu, hot wings and what-not."}
{"text":"Food was okay, the carne asada salad was good, but the lettuce and other parts felt as if they were store bought and not hand sliced/cut. The rice was good too but it felt microwaved/old a bit. The oysters were cold and tasted fresh yet most were super small. Average food but great atmosphere, and good music!"}
{"text":"It's been almost 2 years since we had visited Las Cazuelas (4-15-14) but my wife wanted to try it again but mostly for the .99 cent Margaritas.  Cold poor quality tasteless food and horrible service.  If you want the cheap margaritas then go for it but don't say you weren't warned about the food."}
{"text":"This small place is great . Food is always great happy hour is from 4to 7 every day. Nothing fancy . A casual place that serves good authentic Mexican food. I love the cevichi  tostada"}
{"text":"The food is by far the best ever, however if is illegal to fry your food in one fryer for cross contamination purposes. I have a fish intolerance and could not eat the shell for the taco salad because it is fried in the same oil. Then, not thinking, I ordered fried ice cream. After two bites we remembered what they said about the shell and I had to stop eating that. The side effect is, I did get sick. But I shouldn't have ordered the ice cream. But they shouldn't be doing that. But best Mexican food ever."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!!! I had the camarones a la diablo! It was something I had been lookin for at a Mexican restaurant for a long time now and they definitely hit the mark on that one! My husband had a big wet carne burrito (the way he liked it) with sour cream, cheese, beans, rice and he said it was the best burrito he's had in ages. We LOVE Mexican food, and they did such a great job, so this is something we will have to venture back to Phoenix for! The margaritas not only were huge, but absolutely tasty and had a nice bite! The waiters and waitresses were very nice too! All around great place to eat. Just don't get there late on a Friday or Saturday night, as it turns into a \"night club\" type place. (Unless you are wantin a little karaoke Mexican style) ;)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican spots I've ever been. Nothing fancy, just a nice, homey restaurant, bilingual staff, excellent drinks, and amazing food. Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"We had a large party of 10. They put us in the backroom and pretty much forgot we were there. No refills offered on chips or drinks. The room was cold. My daughter actually put back on her coat and gloves while we waited. It took over an hour to get our food, which was also cold. I had the special, a taco and a tosada, which was soggy. The chips were over cooked. The flour tortilla on my daughter's bean burro was crunchy.  You couldn't pay me to eat there again."}
{"text":"Fuimos a comer el pasado domingo al que está en 51 av y McDowell, pensando que ahora si me iban atender bien nooo!! Como siempre la mesera perdida se le olvidaba todo y me cobró cosas de más!! La comida ya no es tan buena como antes no se sí cambió de dueño! Mal servicio! Mala comida! Y me cobraron de más!!! No regreso más a este lugar!!!!!:-("}
{"text":"We go here fairly often, usually on Tuesday or Thursday when they have 99 cent margaritas.  The food is very good, nice portions with a good variety.  The staff is friendly.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Went for a nearly dinner. Food and service were really good. My only complaint is nothing at the fault of the restaurant -- way to many little kids. The crying of babies was over whelming. Next time we will try to sit in the bar."}
{"text":"Horrible service was waiting to be seated and server says there are booths in back open and after asking for a highchair for my one year old I had to get it myself. Waited 15 min and still didn't get asked for drinks. We then left. HORRIBLE SERVICE"}
{"text":"Great food! REAL Mexican food.  go early on 99 cent margarita night-- it is packed!  I go weekly"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be a great place to go and the meals were always good. Seems that they have new owners and the food is terrible. Went tonight and ordered two shredded beef tacos. The tacos came and the shredded meat inside the taco was so crisp you couldn't even taste what it was. I returned the tacos and explained the problem and was told they had a new cook and he most likely left it in the deep friar too long. 
The server suggested I order the soft shelled tacos, so I did and when I received them, the shell was so wet that I could not fold it over without it falling apart. Total mess and waste of money. Never heard of a Mexican restaurant that couldn't make tacos!
We used to visit the restaurant all the time and take our out of town guests, but we now need to find another place as we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yuck! How do you call yourself a mariscos restaurant and not sell fish? Also they have this picture of a big refreshing margarita and it says $.99 happy hour but when you go to order it its as big as a shot glass with ice filled to the rim and it actually costs $2.99! It's the worst Mariscos restaurant I have ever been to! Please don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place, food is pretty decent but the prices are a little high for what it is. I would eat here again because it is close to my work and is convenient to stop in for lunch. The tables are really close together and the place could use a little clean up. Not exactly the place I would like to sit down at and eat with my family."}
{"text":"Have eaten here at least 2 times a month for the last few years.  Over this summer all staff is new, menu changed, portions got smaller and prices went up.  Restaurant use to be crowded on Fri & Sat nights but last night it was nearly empty. SERVICE WAS GOOD.  Food was only fair.  Last week was about the same.  Won't be going back.  RIO MURAGE & MACAYOS are nearby so I  will be trying them."}
{"text":"I've never been to Surprise Arizona before so I had no idea where to go eat when we were out here for a Rangers spring training, so as always I relied on Yelp to help me and my co-workers find a spot! We were searching for Mexican food, so as soon as I found the reviews for Las Cazuelas, we immediately headed that way. 

It's located in a strip mall next to a gun store but don't let this deter you. Once we entered the place we saw that it was packed, which is a really good sign. It seems as if the locals as well as all of the out of towners frequent this place. The restaurant is divided into two sections so we took a seat in the rear in ne of the booths. I looked at the very large menu and ordered the vegetable fajitas. When I asked for no cheese or sour cream, they said it wouldn't be a problem at all. They brought out my plate of fajitas along with a side of cheese covered beans. The portions were huge and real good too. I hate the fact that they bring you a basket of only three tortillas, yet you have a whole plate full of food to fill them with! The grilled onions and peppers were good, the only problem that I had with it was that they included tomatoes as well. This kind of made the plate runny and soggy. I really wish that they would have given me a little more guacamole as well. But overall it was a good meal and I'm glad that we found this spot.

Great food, great service, what more can you ask for? I definitely recommend Las Cazuelas if you're in the Surprise area. Venture a couple of blocks off of Bell and the tourist area and try it out, you won't be upset that you did"}
{"text":"I live in Surprise and have been wanting to try this place since we don't have an abundance of Mexican food choices. I'm sorry I did!  
The chips were overdone and the salsa was bland! 
I ordered a simple meal (#1) taco and enchilada with rice and beans.  The description says \"taco and (beef or chicken) cheese enchilada\". I ordered the beef taco. When my plate came, I really tried to like it. I'm generally pretty easy to please but nothing about this was right!  The taco was as skinny and skimpy on the meat as a jack n the box taco, the beans, rice and enchilada sauce were cold. And the enchilada was beef, not cheese. I'm talking a sweet tasting mushy beef! When the server brought my margarita I told her I was expecting a cheese enchilada and she rudely said, \" You need to tell the server when you order or we make it all beef.\"  I politely told her I asked for the taco to be beef but didn't expect that to apply to the enchilada. She just stared at me and repeated you had to have told the server when you ordered. So I just replied \"ok.\"  I managed to eat maybe 1/3 of this sorry $8.99 meal.  Would it have been too much for her to have switched it out for me?
As far as drinks, we were NEVER offered refills of our water or tea. (And the place was almost empty on this 6:00 pm Monday evening dinner.). The $2.99 house margarita was in a tiny ice filled glass. I expected small for that price but I also hoped for some flavor. This was basically watered down lime juice. My husband's bottled Corona was fine. 
My husbands enchilada style burro was fine and my sons chicken taco salad was fine. 
Unfortunately, I was the one who loves Mexican food and was excited about trying it. Sorry Las Caquelas...never again. Taco Bell has you beat by a long shot!"}
{"text":"Asked around and a few people on facebook recommended this place for \"really good Mexican food\". I would not recommend this place to anyone, the service was not inviting, soda was flat syrupy water, I only had a few bites of my food (breakfast burrito)and could not finish it. Very disappointed with this place and am still searching for \"really good Mexican food\". I gave it two stars because it was my first visit, maybe it was an off day for them, not sure, maybe their dinner menu is better?"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican (NOT TEX-MEX) food!  I may be biased as I grew up in Southern AZ and have been living in the mid-west for the past couple of years where it's really hard to find good sonoran style Mexican food.  But this place was delicious!  And you knew just walking in, that later that night the place was turning into a discotec!  I had the Chile Relleno plate which was perfect!  I loved that the beans came in a fried tortilla bowl.  Margaritas were large and refreshing!  Loved the entire experience!  It helps if you know a little spanish when you go there as well!  Our hostess didn't seem to know English, but our waitress did.  Can't wait to go again! (When you are ready to leave, you pay at the register by the door.  You will wait all night for someone to come take your card for you haha)."}
{"text":"Dollar tacos de cabeza! Can't beat that, small joint that's clean and staff is respectful. I'd recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Food,and service has been very good.  The serving portions are quite good.  We have been there 3 times recommended by friends, and in all times been very satisfied. We will be returning there often."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gem places that you may pass by as its kind of hidden in a small strip mall. It's not a big touristy place, but it is always the place I recommend if you want the best Mexican food in surprise (and I've tried them all) I always get the chicken burrito, it's the best there is. Enchiladas are great as well. And of course the $1 margaritas on select days. It gets VERY busy on margarita days, seems people are finding out about this place these days. Ignore the (strange) bad reviews. I've been here probably 50 times and it's always fantastic."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. My husband and I are currently eating here as I am writing this review.  We ordered the queso fundido.  It's disgusting.  It's just a bowl of melted shredded cheese.  So greasy. We were expecting a dip type of appetizer. Not a melted block of cheese. Luckily they were nice enough to take it back.  

We both ordered chicken chimis. Also gross. Food game out barely lukewarm. Also if you are going to put sauce on a chimi at least make sure it's on the menu that it comes smothered in some sort of enchilada  sauce.  Rice comes in a pile on plate like from a ice cream scoop and your beans come in a tortilla bowl which is now completely soggy because of the river of enchilada sauce.  

Service was decent. But I will not be returning. 

PS.  They still tried charging us for the melted cheese bowl that we didn't even eat and sent straight back to the kitchen.  

Ridiculous."}
{"text":"went here for lunch with Rand H. and the service here was terrible.I found the food to be OK so i was going to give them 3 stars but service is so bad a-ok goes down to meh. I've experienced better.So if your looking for a good Mexican lunch I would suggest looking a little further.

{"text":"The food was excellent, large portions and very tasty. Wide variety of menu items and they all look great. My only issues were with my waitress. My drink,  appetizer and dinner all came out at the same time. Finished the wonderful meal and haven't seen the waitress for about 20 minutes. Place isn't that busy. Finally tracked down the waitress and asked for the check......waiting....waiting...waiting. Just ridiculous at this point."}
{"text":"Have been coming here many years.. don't know what's happened lately but something has changed. Food is just OK and service is terrible. Even with hardly anyone in restaurant and four employees they all appear to have better things to do than wait on you. All this at increased prices.? I will be eating elsewhere in the future.. too bad, so sad"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall with simple & fresh Mexican food.

There's a full bar and happy hour from 4-7 everyday!  I'll admit, the shopping center this place is in may put you off... don't be scared.  The restaurant is a bit dated... continue not being scared.  Total comfort food awaits for those not easily deterred."}
{"text":"I ordered the Taco salad with chicken. When I started digging down in the Taco shell discovered I had beef instead of chicken. Turned out I was glad of the error. The beef was very well seasoned. I really enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Yaah! you get your first three margaritas for 99 cents! Do you know why you have to pay full price for your fourth margarita? That's because they have to now use their second ounce of tequila! I had three margaritas and had less of a buzz than if I had a slice of rum cake! Do you know why the first three margaritas are 99 cents? They need something to attract customers into the place because the food on its own will not do the trick. Start with the chips- mine had a burnt taste and  were so salty I could feel my skin cells begin to shrivel up. The salsa had the consistency of tomato juice- not a single chunk of anything- no onions, jalapeño or tomatoes- the only way to eat the salsa is to find a concave chip- otherwise you get no salsa- just a damp chip! Moving on to the carnitas- there a very few things in my life that are worth living for- and good carnitas is one of them. If the carnitas I had tonight were the best I could ever get then Lord- you might as well take me now! Some chunks of pork were well seasoned and moist and some were so dried out that they broke apart like dog biscuits when I stuck my fork in them. It's like they took the left over chunks from lunch put them under a heat lamp for five hours then mixed them in with the fresh batch cooked for the dinner crowd! How can half  an entree be so good and the other half be so stale? What saves this rating from getting a two star review is the service- not a lot of friendliness but prompt and got my order right as well as the check. Also the atmosphere is upbeat colorful and clean. Finally the prices are reasonable. I only recommend this place if you want a cheap meal, don't want to drive far, are staying at the hotel across the street and do not have a car and you want a 99 cent margarita that was only introduced to tequila. Otherwise - keep driving. My fellow Yelpers for the most part got it right- this is a solid three star place!"}
{"text":"Get me once.  Never get me again.  I live in Mexico and know great Mexican food.  We are all looking for Alka Selzer.  This is neither good nor authentic. Everything tasted like last weeks food reheated in Microwave. On the good side was the cold bottle of beer"}
{"text":"This place  W A S  great. We took all of our out of town friends here.  NO MORE....
New management or whatever happened, last week it was 25 minutes to order food and  45 minutes more  for it  to arrive, and OH, all ground beef in ALL our entrees was burned and inedible.  Waitress said she couldn't help it. She also \"overcharged for burrito  and never delivered an ordered side dish. and NEVER refilled drink glasses. 
Asked for mngr, she  wasn't there, was  told to call back tomorrow, ask for Veronica. I did and they said Veronica Who ?? then hung up on me.This place is a JOKE !  Don't waste your time or money here. Sad...."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow - 15 minutes to order a drink. The waitress was not very pleasant and seemed to be just going through the motions. The food was average, except for the salsa which was horrible. The place seemed dirty and not taken care of well. 

A few of the things that really bothered me about this place;
1) Tortillas wrapped in tinfoil rectangle, huh?
2) The glass jars that held the salsa - very dirty looking and I am sure were used on the table before us.
3) Giant oily, greasy spot on the bench seat.
4) Limes were wrinkled along the edges, which tells me they were not freshly cut or came off a previous customer's table.
5) Carne asada that appeared to have taken a bath in a deep fryer. Can't say I have ever had deep fried carne asada.
6) We had to go find our waitress in order to pay.
7) Hostess yelling instructions to us from across the busy restaurant.

Seems to be popular with the retired folks, however I am not sure if that is a good or bad thing. Once was enough and I won't be going back to Las Cazuelas."}
{"text":"Staying at the Holiday Inn for work and decided I didn't want hotel restaurant food. Walked across the street and am sure glad I did. The carnita's were some of the best I've had. The shredded beef taco was good but the medium sauce you get with the free bowl of chips is the best I have had in a long time.

The waitress kept checking on me ensuring everything was good.

I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this restaurant was a very pleasant experience. The food was excellent and the friendly servers were extra excellent! I should have asked all their names so I could thank them all, here in the Yelp App but I only got one name, Nancy. 
We will definitely return for the good food and hopefully make some new friends while we are at it.
Don't hesitate to try this restaurant!!

Particularly the churros- heaven. Go during happy hour to enjoy more discounts because this place can get pretty pricey quick."}
{"text":"Very bad experience this past Friday.  Service was very slow.  When our food was finally served, one of the orders was incorrect, and one of the orders was of very poor quality.  They corrected the wrong order, but by the time it was finally served, the other three in our party were almost finished with their dinners.  I asked to speak to the manager (Tere) who was also very slow to respond.  When she did finally come to our table, which was equally slow in response,  she was very apathetic, had no interest in hearing what our concerns were, and only offered the excuse that they were \"very busy\"; as if that should be an acceptable reason for the poor service and food preparation.  Actually, about one third of the tables were empty.  I understand that mistakes can be made, but how those mistakes are addressed can make all of the difference in assessing the quality of the staff and management.  We were very disappointed in the total experience, and will probably not return."}

Glad we did because it wasn't bad at all. My husband had the carne asada quesadilla and he enjoyed it. I had the ceviche tostada and it was very good. The guacamole was a little bland but other than that everything was good. Our server was very good also. We will definitely try this place again so don't count it out in Surprise if you are tired of Macayos."}

Ordered:
Whole Tilapia
Carne Asada Plate (food poisoning) 
Machaca
Shrimp Cevice (this didnt get me sick)

But then one day... I ordered the carne asada plate and everything on my plate was hot... except for my meat!! Oh they warmed it up for me... 
But, the real question is WHY DID I EAT IT AFTER THAT? 
I got food poisoning. 

Never will return"}
{"text":"Visited this place in Surprise, AZ on a busy Valentine's Day evening, because we didn't want to do the \"overpriced no reservations\" deal.  Pleasantly surprised, even though we did not expect much since we are Northern NM natives, and our region wrote the book on tasty Mexican food.  The chile rellenos were good, refried beans were good, and so was the shrimp cocktail.  We would visit again.  The red chile sauce was quite bland, but I'm sure they can't source the Chimayo red that we are used to.  The restaurant is in an ugly strip mall, so don't let that put you off.  The price is right too.  Good place for Gringos, and we'll try it again for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"We love this place. We eat here probably 2-3 x month.  The chips are the absolute BEST, i cant explain it. Portions are big, food is awesome. Margaritas are pretty cheap, like $2.99 I think, and they DONT SKIMP on the tequila. Love this place."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood \"go too\" restaurant. I have have the Menudo and the Caldo de Res soups. They are very good!
The servers are all very attentive including Tere, Rosy,' Leonore and others!"}
{"text":"My friends have excellent taste in dining! And tonight's dinner credit goes to one of my best friends from the west side, who recently recommended Las Cazuelas Mexican & Seafood.

I've driven by this location before and may not have noticed it due to the number of competing Mexican restaurants in the vicinity. According to my friend, Las Cazuelas has been at this location a long time. That's music to my ears! And no, it's not the karaoke coming from the other half of the restaurant. (They seriously have karaoke.)

Compared to other Mexican restaurants, Las Cazuelas has a laid back atmosphere. Decor is typical for Phoenix, but not gaudy or over done. Tonight though, I noticed the music. It was contemporary Mexican music which didn't distract like a mariachi band would. Perfect ambiance!

I discovered a new way to size up a restaurant too. If the menu is printed in a second language (in this case Spanish) on the same menu, you might be on to something.

We decided on a sit down meal so we could catch up and relax after work. To begin, I selected the Ceviche Tostada Cameron. The amount of shrimp was way too generous for the single corn tostada shell that accompanied it. We shared and used the corn chips as well. Plus the chips and salsa with a side of fresh guacamole got this meal off to a great start.

I chose the simple Chile Verde, and I'm glad I did! It was a popular dish tonight as I heard a couple nearby tables also order it. This may be the best Chile Verde I've ever tried. The sauce had a slight sweetness to it, rather than heat. And the pork was tender and flavorful. Besides the excellent rice, the most creative touch on the plate was the fried flour tortilla which held the refried beans. So delicious!

This was a very enjoyable meal! The only flaw may have been the service. While the food came out quickly and our drinks were tended to, the servers disappeared toward the end. It wasn't bad enough to ding one star. We weren't in a hurry after all. Muchas Gracias!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this is the location I went to when I went to this restaurant but they have this amazing cold Mexican seafood soup. I haven't been here in years or had the soup in years but I look forward to my next visit. I have been craving this for a long time now. And I definitely recommend people to try this soup. I can't think of the name but when you go, you should ask for the cold soup with seafood in it. :)"}
{"text":"Very surprised by this place. While visiting the Gun store near by. I was in the mood for some tacos. I have always seen this place but never tried it out. I thought it was just a little taco joint. To my surprise it was actually a restaurant! 
I ordered the carne asada quesadilla. Guess I wasn't in that much of a mood for taco's? Service was great, the waitress came by plenty of time to make sure my water was full. And made sure the food was fine. My quesadilla was very good. Plenty of meat, cheese, guacamole. Chips were good, and I really enjoyed the two types of salsa. 
Overall it was a very good visit, planning to come back, but this time with my wife."}
{"text":"Sonoran style Mexican food fit for a drug cartel kingpin! 

Pre-dinner chips and salsa are deliciously different. Unlike other chain joints, here, the chips will remind you of your last trip to Sinaloa; thick cut and deep fried to dark brown perfection, not the lightly golden chips served at most chains.

Salsas are unique too. A red and a green with surprisingly good (and different) flavors. At some point, I started mainlining the green with a spoon as my wife looked on in horror.

My spouse ordered some kind of combination dinner plate, number something or other. Who the fuck knows. I never listen, being much too focused on my own order and what delicious goodness awaits.
I should have listened.
My machaca plate was good, but hers, hers was the shit, causing me to break-out out the puppy dog eyes in hopes of a few mercy bites.  

Another thing I'd like to point out; this isn't Scottsdale. It's Southwest Phoenix and not a great neighborhood either.
Here's some cheap advice from someone who was born and raised in this hood:

If you come here, taking-in the experience much as a tourist visiting Mexico for the first time would, do yourself a favor.
Don't look around all judgy at the wannabe fashionistas, and don't EVEN look anyone directly in the eye, particularly the men.
There's always going to be some guy on a Friday night who's perro-borracho and all too willing to yell at you from the next table, solemnly inquiring as to just what the fuck your problem is.
Your 'problem' is you're not Mexican. You're a gringo, affluent and sticking out like a teen dining at Golden Corral. 

Affluence of any sort doesn't play here. 
May I suggest jeans and a Tecate t-shirt for the gentleman?

For the lady, a pair of skin tight jeans, and a clingy, all-cotton stretch top.
You might wish to suggest these makeup guidelines as well: 
 
1. Pencil thin eyebrows, the apex nearly touching the hairline. (Use medium tip black Sharpy for best results) 

2. Pacific blue eye shadow, covering the eyelids and extending well into the crow's feet. Go ahead, be generous. 

3. Tons of eye liner, extending well into the temple area and finished with a nice curly cue.

4. A faux tatoo on the back of each finger. L-O-V-E on one, P-A-P-Y on the other.

Think of this event as dress-up night. A themed party with some great Mexican food. 
It'll be an absolute hoot!

Note: As a consolation for making mama dress-up like Rosalita in 'Latina Sluts 7',  allow her to bring her Louie bag. No-one will have a clue what it is or how you paid their combined annual wages for it."}
{"text":"Food was good. I think the food is slightly better at the Surprise location. Gave 3 stars instead of 4 because of the price. $7 for a well vodka is a little steep at 2pm on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"As usual consistently delicious and super friendly. Had the queso fundido con chorizo.. just awesome! Melty goodness with bits of chorizo thrown on top.. the flour tortillas I think are made in the back because they are so tender and delicious.. also had the Swiss Enchiladas.. dynamite! Tender shredded beef laid into corn tortillas covered in green sauce and cheese.. yum! Also they make wonderful refried beans.. you cant go wrong.. real deal Mexican food here!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place doesn't even deserve a one star. Based on the manager, their employee, the waitress pays the  customers bill if the food is returned. We ordered taquitos and the guacamole was a dark brown. The cook covered it with tons of cheese. It was obvious that the guacamole was old. The rice had no flavor at all. They only took 10% off our bill because if they took anymore off their waitress would have to pay the remaining bill. The practice in this establishment has to be against labor laws. If there's even such an actual policy."}
{"text":"Not happy here, will not return.  The chips and dip were GREAT, BUT.  Food was OK, nothing special at all. The taco shell the beans came in with the dinner was too greasy for me to eat, and the Enchiladas (2) were made the right way with shredded beef but there was very little of the filling.  The rice was JUST warm not much taste.We also have an entertainment book and there was a $10.00 coupon for them.  I had this coupon on the table from the minute we sat down. When we got the bill I said you forgot this and she took it came back and said we aren't taking them anymore. Said there was a sign on the door. We said OK, no problem, we've had that happen before, BUT they tell us when they see the coupon. When we left I checked the door and couldn't find a sign for the coupon, but I did find a sign that said 10% off for seniors, looked at the bill and NO 10%. My husband and I are in our 70's and we do look our age. Lol  Service was slow and not very friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, but I'll write it on Yelp.

I figured that I'd be able to get a better dinner at the mexican restaurant across the street from my hotel than at the hotel. Given that good mexican food is hard to come by in Washington state, I figured that I could get good mexican food anywhere in Arizona.

The service was friendly and the food wasn't very expensive.  But it wasn't all that good either. My carnitas were very dry, like they'd been prepared earlier in the day. I was hoping for something that was moister.

I don't think I'd eat dinner here again, but since my hotel has pretty poor breakfasts, I might give them a second try because I'm a sucker for chorizo."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to my office, so it is a regular stop for either a great Mexican breakfast or lunch. Never been dissapointed, nor have any of my co workers. Try the Huevos Rancheros or the Chiliquiles ( With the Green Sauce ), it is a favorite."}
{"text":"We were traveling from Texas to California and stopped in Phoenix for the night. We chose this place mainly because of its proximity to our hotel. It wasn't busy, and the waitress was very nice and attentive. When we got our meals our jaws dropped...there was so much food! I ordered the supreme nachos, my husband ordered the chimichanga, and my son preferred the supreme quesadilla. None of us could finish our meals. I wouldn't say the food was exceptionally delicious, but it was fresh and very good. For the price, I would definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"We came with my husband came there in the evening, around 9:45 pm. We wanted to have some drinks and food. So, my Margarita was very sweet!!! He was lucky to choose a beer (bottle). We ordered a food number 19 (I don't remember the name, sorry, it was rolls with a beef).... We tried one and couldn't eat... Music was so loud and crazy! This place was empty... just a few tables was busy with drunk customers... Never come back!!! Village style, nothing match and a food and a drink was very bad..."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE
Las Cazuelas  is so very consistent with their food and service.  The food is reasonably priced and soooo flavorful.  I had the stuffed shrimp.  Couldn't eat them all.  They were stuffed with jalapeño and cheese and wrapped with bacon.  YUMMY.  My wife had her usual.  Shrimp burrito with white cream sauce.  Her burrito was loaded with shrimp...as usual...inside and out.  She couldn't eat all hers either so we get to bring the white boxes home to enjoy the meal again.  We really appreciate this quaint out of the way restaurant.  Betty our hostess makes our visits there always special.  Always first class.  THANK YOU BETTY.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Back this year, last year not good was hoping the got there act together, very good and enjoyed the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We were so loud and they were wonderful.  Homemade tortillas, bacon wrapped shrimp.  Love to see the tortillas fluffier like #alamocafe, San Antonio."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to try this place because we live real close and always see vehicles here. Big mistake, huge. The salsa was absolutely watery and bland, chips were hard and not even warm. Should have just left at that point but we decided to give it a try. Hubby ordered Jack n Coke for $7.50 a drink and it was the weakest drink ever, he had two and wasn't even buzzed. I ordered the tortilla soup because I wanted something light. Another huge mistake! It tasted like pure watered down hot sauce, no seasonings at al, it comes in a huge bowl and would be better in a smaller bowl for a lower price like how most places serve soup. Hubby had the burrito and it was also awful, disgusting he could only stomach a couple bites. The waitress was very nice and polite so none of this was her fault. We will never, ever come back here again!"}
{"text":"Shitty service, the drinks took forever to come out. Then the manager wouldn't take my 1988 fifty dollar bill cause obviously he isn't educated enough to know the difference in money from back then to current.  Not to mention that their drinks are Scottsdale prices in the HOOD, you would think the AC would be on a decent temperature considering the prices, the place was hot and a joke!!! I will never return or recommend AnY one to this shit hole."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and today something was off. My enchiladas we're so hard I couldn't even cut them! How do you mess up enchiladas?? Needless to say we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Love going to this Mexican restaurant! The food is great, they always hook it up with extra shrimp when you get a shrimp cocktail. The place is always clean the times Ive gone and love going Friday nights when they sing karaoke (they mostly play old Mexican music but hey the classics are the best, also they mix up reggaetón sometimes)."}
{"text":"Overall the service was great, we came to celebrate Mother's Day weekend and the waitress was friendly and fast we will be coming back here that's for sure."}
{"text":"Off the hook.  Just forget about all the other corporate chains in the area this is the real deal.  And as another reviewer pointed out this is not Tex-Mex.  this is authentic souther Arizona.  The salsa is spicy, the beans and rice delicious.  Highly recommend the machaca burrito."}
{"text":"One of those \"hole in the wall\" places you will drive right by if you don't know whats inside. No, the food isn't to die for, but its very good, especially the tortas (flat bread sandwich), and these are HUGE sandwiches for the price. All the portions are large, and prices are extraordinary. They have football (NFL) games on during the season, and have a nice, again inexpensive, happy hour. So it was always nice to stop in for a couple margaritas and eat chips n' salsa while we watched the games. The salsa isn't great, but they provide a green and red in separate containers which is nice. And the tortillas are not the best either, I don't know why they don't purchase from the tortilla factory right down the road, those are awesome! Service is friendly, they always fill our glasses up without us noticing, but can sometimes be slow if its busy."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best Mexican food in Surprise.  Never really had a bad meal here.  The problem with this restaurant is that it is always packed with senior citizens and therefore getting in is always a hassle here; especially on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings.  We don't come here anymore because of the crowd.  The servers are also not the most personable either."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! They were really nice and the food was good. They were very attentive and the seating arrangements were amazing"}
{"text":"Great prices, good service, and food. I'm traveling from California for work, and these servers have been pleasant. Good salsa, and rice."}
{"text":"This is a family owned business I am always impressed by cleanliness and how the wait staff is always dressed crisp and ready to work. I read some of the comments and this is not a fast food restaurant it's a lovely true mexican restaurant where everything is homemade from chips to salsa. I love coming here with my 78 yr old mom and reminicing of when we 1st moved to Az from Chicago and have loved true Mexican food and culture for the last 45 yrs shopping local is so important in keeping the culture we moved here for and enjoying fantastic mexican food."}
{"text":"The portions are huge! The food was good. Not the best Mexican resturant we've been to, but it's cheap! Just wished our waitress was attentive.. probably not coming back"}
{"text":"Yet again they let us down and now we remember why... We knew we had not been back in awhile. While we love the cerviche, (we get the one with the abalone/oysters/octopus/shrimp/clams) YUM! ut all we like... The rice is yuck with corn and carrots in it, beans are not much better, chips,, blah... nothing special... but after ordering a margarita special... Serious??? Thats a margarita?? Pretty watered down and flavorless...(it was not the .99 cent special ) When I spoke to the waitress she could have cared less... We shared THE ONE sppon that came with our cerviche for over 5 minutes till we were able to wave down someone for anotehr spoon... Sorry to put the waitstaff out.. next time I simply will not bother coming..."}
{"text":"It seems like their recipe changes all of the time.  I had a piece of fish and they put so much lemon on it, I wanted to add sugar and sell it on the corner."}
{"text":"Love Las Cazuelas since I was a little girl. Service is good and food is even better. Their mariscos are fresh and rice/beans are yummy. The drinks are your standard beers, dont expect a difficult mixed drink list as it isn't readily able to be made."}
{"text":"Not bad! Very friendly staff. Good prices and generous portions. No, it is not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it is good enough to go back twice a month. I usually get one of 3 items, Chicken Torta, Chicken Burrito Enchilada Style or the Fish Burrito. My wife usually gets Caldo, 3 Rolled Taquitos or Chile Rellenos. I can honestly tell you I seldom finish everything on my plate and I never leave hungry!"}
{"text":"I travel between California and Texas fairly often and I always make sure to stay overnight in Surprise so I can eat here twice. 
I've never had a bad meal here and the service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Muy buena comida un ambiente familiar y con  un personal muy amable y sirven un rico menudo los fines de semana sin duda recomendable."}
{"text":"Cold chips and poor salsa (salsa like you get out of an el pato can). Had to wait a while to get seated. Waitress was taking our order and stopped halfway through to answer her cell phone. We ran out of chips and had to chase a waitress down to get another basket of cold chips. I ordered an Arnold Palmer and it tasted like seltzer water. I had the #3 which was two enchiladas with rice and beans. The tortillas were hard, cheese tasted spoiled and rice was cold. They had a sign on their door to yelp them so here it is my first ever Yelp review. Want good food and service go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is good! Carne asada fries were good and the oysters are spicy but delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to get the Costa Brava seafood soup and it was the best part of my visit here. Unfortunately the last few times I have come here the soup has been extremely bland. What used to be prepared with pride and care lately seems to just be thrown together. I don't know if I attribute this to the changing times, new management or a different cook."}
{"text":"This places sucks 
As you walk in it's smells like cleaning supply 
Which I hate about any restaurant. 
Food is"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great food, AWESOME staff. I go here all the time and I'm always welcomed  with a smile and they take GREAT care of me."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times but tonight's experience is very upsetting. The restaurant has created a digital coupon, but won't let you use it unless you print. When I ask to speak to the manager she wouldn't come talk to me, sent another staff member to explain to me they can't accept digital coupons cause staff members have given discounts when they shouldn't and now they need proof. When you issue a coupon using digital media stand by it!! Your staff misuse is not my problem!"}
{"text":"ok, i have to admit.  went there 2 days in a row and don't regret it!"}
{"text":"Omg this place has the best authentic Mexican food ever, the food and taste are consistent.  I had not gone in about 6 years until last week my husband and I went and it was the same great tasting food."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, accommodating and great tasting food. Server provides free chips and salsa. Both the green and red salsas are tasty. The chilaquiles with eggs are tasty fresh. They're crunchy and the sauce goes great with them."}
{"text":"The prices are little higher (still way cheaper than in Hawaii) than Zef's but the portions are HUGE! I had a fish burrito $4.75, rolled tacos $5.50 (YUM) and my MIL had the carnitas plate (enough for two) and my husband the al pastor burrito. Their menu is a lot more expansive as they are a full restaurant. They even have senior discounts too! 

I love the guacamole here, it's nice and chunky and they gave a lot on their rolled taco order. 

The location is kind of out of the way from my In-law's place but not far. Its kind of in a dusty shopping center. The restaurant itself was clean, but not the newest in decor. However, it seems they have a steady following of patrons as their staff is attentive and friendly. I'll come back here and sit down to eat and try something else, as I only did take out and did just quick food (burritos). My recap:

Pros:
-Huge portions for pretty inexpensive prices
-Happy Hour and Senior discounts
-Good food

Cons:
-Their take out is SLOW. Call in a head of time to avoid waiting 20 minutes or so. We should of done that, we just walked in and ordered and tho there wasn't a full house of people, I wondered why it took so long. Other folks just walked in and picked up...smart."}
{"text":"This place is so so on price. I mean the lunch/dinner specials are really not a deal they are full price to me. The chips were ok a bit hard like over fried. The carna asada torta was good but wasn't happy about the beans in there. I even asked the waitress what it had and she never said beans so I only ate half. This place is ok."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I was surprised at how disappointed I was with the food. I went at around 11, so it wasn't super busy but while my food came fast, I hardly saw the server. That may have been a good thing, because I struggled through my meal; the chicken rolled tacos. I love nothing more than a fried tortilla, but these almost cracked my teeth they were so hard.

On top of that, the chicken did not seem at all seasoned. The red salsa and beans saved the meal. I picked at the dry-looking rice. 

I will never go back, except maybe to get the cheap margaritas. I'm thinking the meal would have been better with a couple of those under my belt."}
{"text":"Las Cazuelas is looking for an experienced cook and I hope they find one soon.  Apparently this used to be a good restaurant, but the dishes I had were nothing to write home about.  Greasy (not in a good way) and not that fresh.  Even the margaritas were bad (pre-mixed).  Service was extremely slow: we waited almost 10 minutes before anybody even greeted us and our food orders took a great deal longer.  Avoid if possible!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Mexican food place. Very good service.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Average Mexican restaurant.  I went there for lunch today.  The food was good, but nothing unique."}
{"text":"It's an ok place to get some ok mexican food.

This has been my 3rd time here and each time the quality of the food and service has been lacking.  The place use to be full of customers and on my recent trip, there were only 7 of us in the restaurant.  Evidently, this did not increase our chances of receiving a hot plate nor the correct order."}
{"text":"Love their $.99 margaritas available every Tuesday and Thursday! Service is always friendly and food is always amazing!! My favorite mexican restaurant by far!"}
