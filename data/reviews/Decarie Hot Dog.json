{"text":"A quaint little \"Hole in the Wall\" The owner was a hoot! Lots of entertainment.. Poutine and hot dogs were pretty good too.."}
{"text":"Good hotdogs and good poutines! However, the restaurant needs to be more clean. If you like greasy food smell, this is definitely the place to be. Very friendly workers. Overall, the experience is amazing!"}
{"text":"Its a classic place for the some amazing old style fast food. You never have to wait long and the service is fast and amusing."}
{"text":"I've tried the poutine all over Montreal and definitely Decarie's is one of the best. It's the sauce that has some zing to it. Check out the chicken club sandwich that's made with real chicken breast and not that pressed garbage..."}
{"text":"There's something comforting about a freshly assembled diner dog, could it be the fact that your fingers dimple the soft bread? These franks aren't homemade, aren't imported from some artesian deli somewhere in the Southwest area of the city; they are the same kind you buy, as the buns are the same as the ones next to the sliced white bread in your local grocery store. So why is this meal of steamed hot dogs and french fries so popular? It's the tradition of it, the ritual of going out to get a hot dog. Whether it's a treat, a quick bite, or even a moment that's shared between a father and son for the first time in the course of a busy day, there is always time for a hot dog."}
{"text":"Hi Johnny Mou here for another old time review from years ago. I went there with all the Laval and Verdun Hogs ,Maple leafs ,Scorpions and 1 of the most interesting scoffs was me Cliff and Alcade ,trashed at 1 am coming back from some function 25 hot dogs between us and diet cokes,.   hahahahaha  heluva job Decarie and keep cranking out the steamers"}
{"text":"best poutine in Montreal!! small little place.. not like a fancy resto.. but its the sauce on that poutine that u get cravings for!!!"}
{"text":"Good cheap food. First time trying poutine so nothing to compare it to but it was good. Workers are very friendly."}
{"text":"It's 2016 and who doesn't know Decarie Hot-Dog, a true long-standing Montréal institution. Situated almost right outside the Cote-Vertu metro station, it is almost impossible to miss.  Since everyone knows this place, I don't need to go into détails, save for the fact that there have been changes over the years. Aside from the obvious price hikes which plagued every single business in existance, they also moved to having an actual digital cash register since the city's law requires every restorant to give a bill. Still, most of the time the guys behind the counter still calculate by writing the items ordered on a paper bag or directly on the counter.  They are considered one of the best low-brow steamy hot dog places in the city, and with the demise of \"Montréal Pool Room\" a few years ago (re-birthed on the other side of St-Laurent street but it's not the same place at all) probably are still at the top of the food chain. They do a mean club sandwitch, and decent burgers to boot, although for a short while their ground beef seemed to be mixed with way to much Pepper, but that changed not too long ago.  Their fries are of those limp, fat, greesy fries - you know the type, and the genre most \"poutine\" lovers prefer. They are often very generous in the fry department so usually one regular sized potion is enough to please two. I also should mention their poutine which can only be described as \"very typical\", which is far from a bad thing. In fact, if you are looking for a \"real\" Montréal poutine, it doesn't get more down to earth than Decarie Hot Dog.  Service Wise, that's the problem. Depending on what time of day/evening you go and who is working at that time, you may be served by a very warm and charismatic person, or almost need a translator and math skills for others. I admit that on more than one occasion I poked my head in to see who was working there and that influenced me to either go in or walk away. Also some key times are maddeningly full, and it can take up to 20 minutes just to place an order (yes, TWENTY MINUTES!).  But all in all, this is \"the\" greesy spoon spot of the area, and still stands after all those décades while other businesses on Decarie keep opening and closing."}
{"text":"So many folks love this place and honestly I just can't understand why.  It's a greasy spoon with questionable hygiene practices. Cash and food often handled by the same hands. Cutting board looks like it hasn't been cleaned for ever and the frying area always looks like it desperately needs to be cleaned.  The steamies and fries are the same you can get at many other burger joints. Which reminds me...don't get a burger there. Last time I got a cheeseburger I had to throw it out. The meat smelled and tasted bad.  There is almost no room to sit inside and outside there are 4 picnic tables on a noisy commercial street.  Aside from the sweet owner and his staff I don't see why anyone would go out of their way to eat there.  Sorry Decarie Hot Dog fans...I just don't get it!"}
{"text":"This place is another institution.   About the size of a lunch counter, there's room for no more than 10 people at a time, including the four people working the kitchen.   The fare is straightforward: steamed hot dogs covered in coleslaw, greasy fries, and poutine. You can also buck the trend and get a burger, and I hear they do fried fish? I don't know about that, if they really do I would avoid.   Anyways, one thing you should know is that if you set foot in there, you'll come out smelling like a greastrap. Just sayin'. Your best bet is to find a kid and send him/her in with your order. That way you get your cake and eat it too."}
{"text":"I lived in Montreal for 20 years and from as far back as I can remember I, and anyone who grew up or went to school in the area loved their food. Great food at a reasonable price and a great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Below average burgers, hot dogs, poutine and breakfast.  There are much better poutines in many places in Montreal.  This place's only saving grace is the late hours and it's cheapness.  I don't think this place is worth even the cheap prices as you can get better food with similar prices elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Montreal hot dogs and fries. Almost literally a hole-in-the-wall, open well into the night, it's staffed by friendly, efficient, and devoted family. If you can grab a stool and eat there, the atmosphere is both authentic and historic in Montreal. Grabbing a bag with a couple all-dressed dogs and heaping casse croute fries to-go takes seconds, and is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Just two weeks and I'll be home, making a pilgrimage of sorts to, in my humble opinion, the best steamie joint in the city of Montreal.  My first visit was in the sixties, almost weekly in the seventies and everytime I've been back to Montreal since I moved.  Back in the day I never had to order as the owner and his kids knew what I craved. 2 all dressed extra chow, frites and a snow white cream soda.  Used to take the #117 bus from Cartierville, until I had a car that is, in anticipation of the delites to come."}
{"text":"There are much better hot dog joints in this city. Food was average.. Place is stuffy snd dirty...Staff was very cocky and very pushy. I felt I was getting served by a used car salesman. I would never go back..."}
{"text":"Wins rave reviews for steamers, poutines, and everything else you can expect from a popular \"greasy-spoon\" type establishment.   Always buzzing with people around lunch, and super-fast (as for service, weeelllll, it's a hot-dog spot, not the Queen Elizabeth. Please don't come here expecting a long chat about which wine would best pair with your poutine).  What you get is fast, courteous service, generous servings, fresh dogs (you know the drill - the fresher they are, the more people come, and the more people come, the fresher they are) and, as a special treat, they carry fountain-type bottled root beer. Yes, I said bottled, not canned!  Note that they can probably sit 10-12 people inside, and the picnic tables are more convenient in the summer than in the winter."}
{"text":"Apart from the staff member talking some smack about my friend and I in Greek assuming we wouldn't understand (my Greek friend told him what time it was tho - homey was red like the ketchup).... Very solid dogs and fries here"}
{"text":"Un incontournable!  J'ai toujours vu ce resto au même endroit depuis plus de 40 ans et ils ont réussi à faire une rénovation il y a quelques années sans vraiment changer l'intérieur de façon notable....  Anyway, on y va pour les frites et les hot-dogs et il n'y a pas meilleur endroit en ville (c'est pas moi qui le dit, le journal The Gazette l'a nommé dans le top 5 à Montréal plus d'une fois!  Servis dans un sac de papier pour les frites et les hotdogs sont enroulés dans une feuille de papier. C'est simple, bon, pas cher, quoi de plus?"}
{"text":"I've been going here for more than 10 years, since when I first started at Vanier. Best poutine in Montreal as far as I'm concerned. Their staff hasn't changed that much over the years either - great that they can keep older hardworking people going with a routine and income.  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu really from steamies to club sandwiches to burgers to fish and chips even. If you like your fries crispy, just ask and they shall deliver. Extra gravy or cheese for your poutine will cost you though. They have a good assortment of soft drinks including cream soda - they'll be happy to pop open the non-twist top for you.  When you enter to order, and they give you a look, don't be afraid, just shout out your order. Forks are in a big tub near the door - can't be missed. Cash only on their old register (they do the arithmetic in their heads) and not much seating room if you come when it's busy.  They open bright and early everyday at 5 or 6am and close every night at 1am. Perfect for that late night fix if you are coming on the metro.   Only downside: poutine prices have shot up from $3 to $4.75 over these past 10 years. Tough for a student to swallow."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch during the work week with some coworkers. There's not much room to sit inside the restaurant, it's more of a grab and go kind of place (there are some tables & benches outside).    As for the food, I ordered the cheese burger and a side of poutine (they have several combo deals to choose from as well). Pretty decent cheese burger, but nothing to rave home about. The poutine on the other hand, was definitely worth the hype. The fries are nice and crisp with a generous amount of cheese and gravy. It is the type of poutine that you would want to take an immediate nap after, but so worth it during the moment. I didn't try the steamies but my coworkers said they were pretty good as well.   Overall, this is your perfect nonchalant greasy food joint. Not sure if I would come back just for the poutine, but definitely would return if I was in the area and craving some comfort food."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in the city and amazing fries. Staff is always so friendly and welcoming. Prices are great. Not much seating room but that adds to the charm. A true staple of Montreal"}
{"text":"Decarie Hot Dogs is one of Montreal's classic steame and patate frite joints.  I always stop in and visit when I'm in town.  Have been going here since 1970 and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I had one of our best dinners in all of our Canadian road trip.  It only cost us a grand total of $20 (with tip) and it was at a little 8 seat lunch counter with two men cooking.  We each got two steamies (aka hot dogs) fully dressed (with mustered, onions, and coleslaw), an order of poutine, and a can of coke.  Our food was quickly prepared by two men who you can tell have been serving up hot dogs and poutine for a good part of their lives.   The food was unbelievable.  Once the order of poutine and hot dogs were set before me I dove right in.   The poutine was a beautiful medley of crispy French fries, creamy cheese curds and rich slightly sweet and salty brown gravy.  It got better with every sinful bite.  The steamies aka hot dogs were fantastic.  Your perfectly cooked hot dog topped with traditional yellow mustered, finely diced onions, and a splendid creamy coleslaw that added a lovely hint of vinegar.   The prices were amazing.  Each of our meals (2 steames, poutine, and a can of coke) were $9.42 with tax.  Let me tell you that is a lot of food for that price.  We were both so full.   If you are in the mood for great poutine at a fantastic little hole in the wall this is the place for you.  If you are into pretentious poutine, sitting at a table, drinking from a glass, and having a waitress wait on you maybe you should check out somewhere in Montreal proper."}
{"text":"My father ate here when he was a student here way back when.  He brought me here when my family visited Montreal in 2004.  I've come back here every time I visited.  It's a long ways away from anything, but it always well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best greasy spoon you can ever find in Montreal. I went to a CEGEP nearby for two years and been to the place at least 5 times a month. Their hot-dogs, hamburgers, glass bottle Coca-Cola and vintage decor can pull you back to the memories of the 30's. Their poutine is by far the best I've had in the whole Montreal, and they've been on the Gazette more than once for their hot-dogs and poutine.  It is a small Italian family owned business, so the cooks are very friendly and outgoing, however the place may have a slight sanitary problem. Well, it's a greasy spoon, waddaya expect?"}
{"text":"BEST POUTINE IN MONTREAL.  Ok, now that we've established that let me tell you a little about the home of the best poutine...  This tiny resto has been around longer than i have, it sits about 8 people and the feeling of nostalgia I get is overwhelming. This is one of the rare gems you'll find in montreal, it's family run, friendly service, fair prices and most importantly great food...not to mention they're open till 2 a.m.  Im not sure what they put in they're poutine sauce but I'd pay big money to find out.  Will i go back? Every week!"}
{"text":"I found this place because of a facebook poll about the best fries in Montreal. a After seeing all the post I decided to go and give it a try for myself. It is a very small place right by Cote Vertu metro and if you don't know its there you can easily miss it. By the look of this place its been there forever. Signs are older looking and so is the set up. They have a small counter with about 8-10 seats and they also have seating outside. I can tell you all that I am very happy I gave it a try because they are by far the best fries I ever had. I had a poutine and the size is big and he gravy was out of this world. The prices are also very good so if your hungry for some old fashion hot dogs and fries this place is worth the detour. Just be prepared they only take cash so no credit card or debit card."}
{"text":"Great Montreal comfort food,Nick the owner sweet as pie,super burgers,poutine,a place where your check is written in pencil on the countertop. easily pound down three hot dogs,just fantastic"}
{"text":"Simply the best poutine in town, you feel like you are in a movie scene when you eat there. Service is good.  Not good with kids as the place is extremely small. Hot dogs and poutine !!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I come here often, just steps from the metro, amazing steamed hot dogs and pure cut fries. Not a big fan of their poutine but its quite a delicious treat though gives me a little gassy. One of very few places on the island that still  sells cherry cola. This diner is a classic not many left of these treasures."}
{"text":"I've been going here since i was a teenager. and yes the place is a total dive. I guess in their own right once they got it right why fix it .. this is not a date night place to go and eat this ,is a classic 1950s Montreal diner with no gimmicks  great hotdogs and double fried french fries, a great place to bring the kids just before a long road trip."}
{"text":"Spot on! You won't regret stepping feet into this fine establishment and be greeted by the magical aroma of Montreal steamies, delicious fish & chips, tasty fries and their legendary poutine... all for the fraction of the price of any other restaurants!   A solid reference since my teenage days, this is a \"must bookmark\" casse-croûte."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff but I honestly liked the poutine at Burger King better. It is VERY cheap to eat here I suppose but you get what you pay for. If you usually eat high quality all beef hotdogs you will not enjoy the bland mystery meat pink mess they sell. I am not jewish but I have a whole new respect for kosher hot dogs now. If you are only in montreal for a couple days maybe there is higher quality food you would prefer to eat. This stuff was not easy to digest."}
{"text":"Yes they serve fast food, however this has to be that nastiest dirtiest little hole. It's just so unkept, imagine how they treat your food if they can't even keep the place clean. I grabbed a salt shaker on the counter and it felt like someone had coated it with vaseline that's how much grease had built up over time I guess. The other containers were just as bad.   Food wise, fries were decent and the steamed hot dogs were nothing to write home about. I asked for all dressed and the coleslaw while vinegary had an enormous amount of salt in it.   The only good thing I can say, is if you must eat from here, take your food to go or take your chances with the bacteria in this place.  I definitely will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Very affordable and tastes sooo good! Very friendly staff! Overall great place!"}
{"text":"Went to Decarie Hotdog with coworkers... This place is old school, feel good food diner style!  I had 2 steamed eaten at the counter... wow, they were good. Service is amazing, and the owner (I think that's who he was as there's a picture of him on the wall) is a very nice guy that took time to talk with us. Some of my coworkers used to go there when they were going to Vanier... place is a classic, I'll be back for more \"roteux\""}
{"text":"Good burgers, fries, and hot dogs. Fed my family for $20 CAD and no complaints. Not a tourist place but good fun. Local joint. Walked down the street for gelato later."}
{"text":"Food is ok,  nothing exceptional. Price is very reasonable though, less than 6 bucks for a poutine - gravy, fries and cheese -.   Service is awful, I was checking the menu - was my first time there - and a short lady asked me what I wanted, when I replied I was still checking she replied with a sarcastic comment 'take your time my friend, we are open until 1am'. The tall guy was not nice either, with a very unfriendly face and molested tone asked me if I wanted my hot dog all dressed, when I asked what all dressed meant he said ketchup and mayo, I said only mayo and it was the most tasteless hot dog ever, it happened that he didn't tell me about the other toppings, which I believe is coleslaw."}
{"text":"Decarie Hot dog seems like a landmark that has been here for years. The food is inexpensive and tasty, but a bit too greasy. Eating more than 1 bag of fries will make you feel a bit nautious"}
{"text":"If you're hungry, in a hurry and not too picky this is the place to go. It does the job but nothing else.   On the plus side:  Service: Fast Price: Cheap (but Cash Only, they do have an ATM though) Food: Filling Location: Really cute small old-fashioned dinner.   On the low side:  Food: I got two steamies. They were good but nothing out of this world. I thought about getting some fries but the oil looked like it had been reused a thousand times.  Cleanliness: Not the place to go if you're a germaphobe."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's fast, they slide the food to you on the counter. Don't get too excited for a wiener, but this is one of the institutions that started Montreal-style steamies (check out the Wikipedia article). Last time I checked, \"all dressed\" here bears the traditional meaning (onion, coleslaw and mustard only, no relish). Poutine is decent and adequate enough for the price. Cash only.  NB: greasy spoons top off at 3 stars on my rating scale."}
{"text":"All I went for was the poutine and at $4.95 for a huge dish they did not disappoint. The gravy is not too salty, you get plenty of cheese curds and the fries are the perfect size for soaking up all that gravy goodness. There was also plenty of ketchup available on the counter for those that want to augment their poutine experience.   Getting Coke in a glass bottle was a nice option as well.   There are only a few stools to sit at inside plus a couple picnic tables outside if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"great service and great fries (poutine as well). cozy like schwartz but expect really greasy food and to fall into a food coma after."}
{"text":"Go to spot whenever in Montreal. It is open pretty late (I believe til 1) everyday) making it great for late night snack. Seating is bar style and pretty limited, but most people are usually in and out in 15minutes so there's always a spot. I usually order the poutine, which is authentic as far as I'm concerned, and hot dogs which are both delicious.  Best of all prices are quite reasonable for the portions."}
{"text":"Hot dog. Essentially made out of 'mechanically seperated meat trimmings'. Yes, three adjectives are used to substantiate the immediate ingredient, meat. Ambiguous. Be that as it may, a hot dog is always deserving to be had once in a while. The better ones are steamed. To be fair, I don't think their dogs are any worthier than those of their competitors. Such intangibles like their brand and the 'Mr Nice Guy' owner whom always busy with the day-to-day cooking and greeting build the establishment into a local institution."}
{"text":"It's a hot dog, not much more to be said. Fries were decent. It was a Friday lunch and the place was dead. I was disappointed that they had prepared steamies just sitting there ready to be served. The bun was terrible, not fresh at all. Who pre-wraps dogs? It takes 30 seconds to dress one up. I guess there was a reason why I hadn't stepped foot in there since my CEGEP days."}
{"text":"Love the hamburgers & French fries.  Love the old-school feel when u enter the place.  It feels vintage and warm.  Only reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because it's absurdly small in there.... Barely can seat 8 people.  But it's awesome overall and would recommend to anyone looking for tasty fries and awesome hamburgers."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fries are top notch. Crispy and delicious. I wish I could eat two all dressed steamies and an order of fries every day of my life and not get fat.  The poutine sauce is a bit sweet for my taste but it's nice and chickeny. The club sandwich is great as well.  But everybody knows it's all about the people. The staff is amazing.  If you're in the area, go there. Please."}
{"text":"Best poutine in town. The hot dogs are good too. The portions are a good size for those with a big appetite. Good value for money. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Best poutine in town! Fast service and best food around! I recommend this place for people that are out of town because it's our little gem.   Burgers are boom Fries boom Hot dogs are even more boom.  Add a cherry Coke to top everything off and boom.. satisfaction at its best!"}
{"text":"I promised myself that I wouldn't come back to Yelp just to give someone a 1-star review, for reason being of not wanting to negatively rate a restaurant based on one experience. HOWEVER, Decarie Hot Dog is an exception -- BY FAR.  My boyfriend and I wandered into Decarie Hot Dogs after 5+ hours of driving from Boston to Montreal. By the time we arrived to the city, which was around 9pm, most of the shops in Decarie were closing. We Yelped nearby to see a good spot to eat that had decent ratings and was still open. We picked Decarie Hot Dog because he and I LOVE LOVE hot dogs, and plus, the bright fluorescent lighting blared at us to come on in!  The little joint was typical of a hole-in-the-wall: tiny, grimey, and had very few seating.   We had high hopes of this place because of the average 4-star reviews -- who could mess up on hot dogs?  Canada is known for their poutines, so of course, we had to order a plate. He got the poutine combo with 2 hot dogs and soda, while I ordered the fries combo with 2 hot dogs and soda. But before I get into the actual taste of the dogs, I must divulge you of the service we received at Decarie Hot Dog.  We were greeted by a short, wirey-haired woman, and a large stocky resting-bitch-faced of a man. The woman I didn't mind because she didn't say much to us, other than the \"you're welcome\" after I thanked her for the hot dogs. The RBF guy, however, was absolutely RUDE. My boyf ordered the hot dogs through him, and decided to add one additional topping a few seconds later. The RBF guy, to which responded in an annoyed, condescending tone, \"ONCE AGAIN, what do you want on your hot dogs?\" His booming voice over the ceiling fan scared the shit out of me.  We were obviously not from the area and had never dined at this shop before. A little explanation of how to order their hot dogs would have been nice.   ANYWAY.  Back to the hot dogs:  the actual hot dogs were bland, buns were not toasted and cold, and the toppings tasted like they came from Costco-sized cans. There was no pop when you bite into the hot dog, no crunch from the bun, no oozing of juices and flavors. A 7-11 hot dog would have satisfied me more than a Decarie Hot Dog!!  But on the real, the service really ruined it for us. \"4-star\" or not, we are never ever coming back!"}
{"text":"Small space but honestly the price was good and the atmosphere was a cool local quick food stop with friendly people working there, quick to joke with you in a nice way.   Had a \"Steamie\" for the first time but its basically like any other basic small sized hotdog however with the sourkraut, onions and mustard (I didnt bother putting ketchup on) it was pretty yummy, had I not gotten the poutine I probably would have dominated at least 4+ dogs alone.   The poutine, as expected in Montreal, had awesome cheese curd and the way I figure is all poutine places usually have equal curd, what distinguishes poutines is the \"sauce\" (aka gravy) that each place uses. This one was very yummy... my wife refered to it as \"spicy\" but really it was this subtle kick of garlicness in it that  set it apart from just a basic gravy. Good stuff, if you are near there and need a quick bite i'd for sure pop in. Nothing MIND BLOWING, but good affordable food, and I can accept that."}
{"text":"One word... OVERRATED. The hot dogs are quite regular. The fries are nothing special. The poutine is subpar by city standards. If you're from out of town and someone told you that this was the place to go to for poutine... Then your source doesn't know what he's talking about.   PS: hygiene should not be something you read about in a medical textbook. I demand it from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Decarie Hot Dog is a Montreal institution. If you have a craving for comfort food... this is the place to go.... AAAAAND it's always open.  The esthetic of the place and neighborhood look somewhat shady as well as dirty but it can be worth your time to quickly come here to eat anyways. The place is literally this tiny hole in the wall, easy to miss with very limited seating and it can get pretty busy.  I've been here many times in my life without issues to have their \"Lafleur\" steamies. Hot Dog Decarie prepares them quickly and so dirt cheap you can easily buy more. And why not??? These dogs go down nicely and are delish!  My favorite though is their popular poutine. It's a 'notch below excellent' and is unlike many places that do serve poutine, it's consistently as good each visit. Huge portion, the fries are just right, generous with the extra squeaky cheese curds and the gravy goodness is damn solid folks. All for a mere $5. Best deal in the city as far as I know.  For a mere 10 bucks you'll leave this place with a full HAPPY stomach.   What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I really love these fries!!!!!!!!  Either way, decarie hot dog has always been and always will be my favorite spot for fries. They even have picnic tables outside now!  PS- I took away a star because I saw a fly floating in their vinegar which either meant it's a complete fluke.. or they don't check for stuff like this very often. Anyway, the fly was dead so it's no biggie.."}
{"text":"On my way back home from a trip to Montreal I happened to stumble upon this joint. I got the poutine, and I won't say it was bad, it was actually very good. My only dislike is that there was a lot of gravy, so that the fries were quite drenched and soggy. Its just a personal taste, and didn't really detract too much from an otherwise excellent poutine."}
{"text":"1st visit, it was good and cheap! Not big fan of hot dogs but overall I liked what I had"}
{"text":"J'adore les \"dives\". Toutes les sortes de \"dives\". Et laissez-moi vous dire que Decarie Hot Dog s'est taillé une place de choix dans mon coeur à cet égard! Sérieux. C'est vieux, c'est simple. Leurs hot dogs, frites et poutines sont dans les meilleurs en ville et j'adore m'asseoir au comptoir avec un Coke à la cerise et jaser avec le proprio et sa femme.   Ça vaut le coup et le déplacement jusqu'à la station Côte-Vertu. Promis."}
{"text":"The last stop with my Van visitors. 4 steamies, a huge serving of pouting and a sharing size bottle of spruce beer for under $15! Amazing. Best poutine I've ever had. Delish."}
{"text":"This must be one of those nostalgia places that people from the neighbourhood remember fondly. Food was mediocre at best. Prices weren't super cheap. Poutine was worse than an average fry truck. Hot dog was a plain old dog on a wonderbread bun. I wouldn't go back even if I was in the neighbourhood.   Service was friendly enough."}
{"text":"Not a good experience, the main guy, short and impatient needs to learn some manners and maybe let people think for as moment before barking at them to hurry up.  Portions aren't very good.  A bottle of pop is an outright ripoff.  This place is still coasting on their reputation from decades ago.  Don't waste your time here, it's a bad food, period.    ***I'm writing this review while I sit here and listen to the impatient guy rant on the phone.  Very rude and unprofessional***"}
{"text":"I just had my first meal in this wonderful restaurant. I ordered the pouting and from the first bite it was SO GOOD. I gave it 3 out of 5 because the meal had a bit of a pork, or meat taste to it, i felt like the potato tasted a bit like pork and i am not a fan of pork sadly. But other than that the meal was great."}
{"text":"I had a craving for some fast food when I was in the neighbourhood of Decarie Hot Dog and decided to grab a bite to eat there.  When I went to CEGEP in the area, I had eaten here a few times so I was familiar with their hot dogs and fries. When I went there recently I wasn't sure what I wanted. Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately asked what I wanted while I was still looking at the menu posted on the wall near the grill. I found this to be a bit too fast since it was evident that I was still looking at the menu posted on the wall when I was asked what I wanted (and I wasn't near the cash register either at the time). I quickly ordered a poutine and a hot dog. They asked me if I wanted a drink but I decided not to get a drink as I was short on cash.  It was prepared very fast and I paid and opted to eat outside the restaurant. There were 2 circular bright red tables with an umbrella for the sun outside the restaurant so I sat there and had my poutine and hotdog.  I thought that the poutine was okay. The sauce had a slightly sweeter (or less salty) taste than the other regular poutines that I've had in other restaurants. The fries are very good and they are similar in style/cut to the fries that you would get at La Belle Province (thick cut) which is the style that I like. The hot dogs were good for \"steamies\".  I will probably return although I will probably just go for 2 hotdogs and fries since I prefer \"Italian\" poutines over \"regular\" poutines.  This place is a cash only place. They do have a generic debit machine by the entrance which will probably charge high ATM fees.  They keep their forks and paper napkins for take out orders near the door (they don't insert it into your bag with your order). After sitting down in front of the restaurant, I had to return to the restaurant to get a fork for my poutine and some napkins."}
{"text":"It's rare to go to a place that you went to 30 years ago and find it's still the same......in a good way. I came here for the 1st time in years and there's a new generation of the family running the place but the food is still as I remembered. The hot dogs are still amazing and for some reason have a magical property that allows you to eat more of them then any human should washed down by the best fries in the city. There's something to be said for upgrading and change but also for tradition and not changing what works. This place works, it looks the same and the food tastes the same 30 years later (and it's been open even longer)."}
{"text":"I used to go here when I was in College which is walking distance away.  Decarie Hot Dog has been around for years, and is still going strong. It fits about 15 people at one, but is usually a grab and go sort of place.  The French Fries and hamburgers are great. They cook everything amazingly well. You will want to keep coming here just for hot dogs or burgers."}
{"text":"I love these hot dogs, the hamburguer not so much. The poutine is very good too"}
{"text":"3.5/5  Decarie Hot Dog was a stop that I had to do in Montreal, even though my parents are not exactly fond of greasy, down-to-earth Montreal food. Oh well, screw them, they don't know Montreal at all so I'm the tour guide.  I went to Decarie Hot Dog on Boxing Day, and to my surprise it wasn't too full. My family of 4 managed to all be seated quite comfortably, despite the limited size of this place.  There's not much to this place, but honestly you'll be out of this restaurant in less than 30 minutes if you're seated alone.  The menu is quite simple and, again, represents Montreal food very well. Hot dogs, poutine, etc...I stuck with the fundamentals and ordered a poutine with an all dressed steamie hot dog. There was a hot dog that was just made as I was ordering, so I got my hot dog immediately, followed by the poutine about 2 minutes after.  The hot dog, which was Lesters, was very good for $2. The poutine, thru all the hype I've heard, wasn't the best I had. There was a bit of an imbalance with the gravy and cheese curds, and some of the fries were a bit on the tough side so it was hard to eat; essentially the photos here threw me off, as the fries didn't scream \"sweet red potato\" in my part.  Service was okay, but I felt the owner had a bit of a sarcastic tone towards me cause my parents didn't order what most customers order (I didn't go thru what they ordered for obvious reasons). Either way, for a party of 4 I paid roughly $22, which was an excellent deal that stuffed our stomachs.  I wouldn't mind giving this place a second try, but I'll definitely be trying it again with people who understand Montreal food like me."}
{"text":"Five Star!  Five Star all day long!  This place is WAY out of the way, and you're going to be on the metro for a long time to get to it.  That's the downside.    It's incredibly affordable, and the poutine is more delicious than the pictures will give it credit for.  Also, while you're here having your tasty fries, gravy, and cheese, you might as well have two or three hot dogs - all dressed.  Everything is served up quick, and it's charming to sit in an old school diner.   This place isn't pretending to be anything it isn't.  But what it is is marvelous."}
{"text":"Late night CHEAT FOOD!!! Waaaw AMAZING !! Best dirty food in town!  Came here around 12am got myself their famous hot dogs and poutine. Super deeelicious. Hot dogs were not bad  But the Poutine was amazing! The sauce fries and cheese were AMAZING! Service was nice   Ambiance: deli style super cozy and very comfy old school montreal casse croûte ! So glad I stopped by to get a cheat meal! Love it! Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"People are often confused about decarie hotdogs' poutine. It's not the original poutine with salty sauce. It's more like a sweet, nonsalted and slimy sauce that will make you wonder if it's poutine at all. However, different doesn't mean it's bad. To each their own. I didn't like it, but some of my friends did. I also got one of their hotdog. Very cheap, fast, but below average. You get what you paid for."}
{"text":"Great poutine and hotdogs at great price. Hotdogs are 1.75 and poutine is about 6.00. Careful though, the old guy is very persuasive and will try and get you to buy out the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're trying to get a quick fill. The poutine and the sandwiches comes in great portion size. The hot dog and burger in my opinion are just average. This place does great and provides excellent taste consistency when its super busy, like summer time, or I suppose when students come in. The past few evenings that I have been visiting here seems to be very mundane. The fries tasted like they were thawed longer then usual giving a soggy taste, and you really couldnt miss the burnt oil smell either. The sauce on the other hand is still holding its rep high. I used to come here when I was at Vanier, still do when I really want to eat something on the go, other then usual M.cDo  Recap: Visit here when you really really do need a quick fill for an empty stomach :)"}
{"text":"I had to try my first Poutine, and this place was closest to my hotel. So I headed over on a chilly January evening and got two dogs, poutine and a soda for $8.75.   First, the atmosphere...how can't you like it? The guys behind the counter are friendly and funny, on the rare occasion they speak. It's small and cramped...er, cozy. However, you won't be here long, so it's OK.   So, the poutine? Well, I have never had one before, so take this with a grain of salt - it was OK. I don't necessarily need to have it again (though I understand that may get me permanently banned from the Province of Quebec), but I'm glad I did. The hot dogs were decent. All in all, it was a fine, quick, cheap meal, but nothing ridiculously memorable (aside from my first poutine)."}
{"text":"So Listen, I'm from Toronto and I went to Montreal for a wedding.  We had some time before so I said lets get some Poutine.    Is it the cleanest?  No.   Did my shoes stick on the floor?  Yup.  Did my tummy thank me?  YOU BETCHA!  So I took 3 poutines for take out, it was under $20 ($17 I believe) and it fed 5 people, so do I care that my shoes stuck, or it wasn't a fancy restaurant with cushioned chairs?  No, it gave me what I wanted and that was a BOMB poutine :)"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said.  A hole in the wall kinda spot that has about 8-10 benches to eat at the counter.  They do some of the best fries, hot dog steamies and burgers in town.  The staff has been there forever and it shows when you see the friendly manner in how they treat their customers.  I'd definitely rank this place in with other Montreal institutions like Schwartz and Orange Julep."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN.  Okay I will expand on that a little more and explain why I'm saying that.  Read on for the full review.  Decarie Hot Dog is a greasy spoon and it is considered by many to be an institution here in Montreal.   Here you can find the steamie and poutine, some of Montreal's quintessential foods.  The place is tiny with limited seating but in summer they have picnic tables to increase the number of places.  The food is cheap and comes really quickly.  I had a steamie and poutine and was served within seconds of placing my order.  The steamie was exactly what I was expecting and I enjoyed it.  The poutine was massive and pretty good.  While the curds could have been squeakier the gravy was velvety and well seasoned.  The fries were thick cut and fried to the point of being nice and golden.  All of this plus a can of spruce beer cost me $8.75 which was incredibly reasonable.  Now let's get to the negatives of my experience.  There weren't that many but the one I noticed was that the hygiene was non-existent and it is the reason why my rating is so low. The whole place could do with a good scrubbing and the person handling the cash was also handling food.  Those however turned out to be minor transgressions in the grand scheme of things. At one point the man working the cash and deep fryer coughed a bit and proceeded to spit out the mucus in the garbage behind the counter in plain site of the customers before returning to his duties.  WHO THE HELL HOCKS A LOOGIE NEXT TO WHERE FOOD IS BEING SERVED?????  I have never witnessed something like this in my life in any kind of food establishment and it was repulsive.  He also didn't wash his hands after that cough.  Decarie Hot Dog could easily be four stars but I was pretty disgusted by their hygiene practices here.  That little spitting incident cast a shadow over what otherwise would have been a pleasant greasy spoon experience.  As much as I enjoyed the food I won't be back to indulge in it anytime soon."}
{"text":"The BEST steamies and poutine under the sun. Decarie hot dog is the greasiest of spoons, but the food more than makes up for the cramped dining space and dirty floors.  The people behind the counter know what they are doing and have delivered the same quality products for decades.    A must-eat when passing through Montreal.    Cash only!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a steamie and great poutine and are not claustrophobic, this place is awesome. The atmosphere is exactly what it is. No pretentiousness at being the best, just a family run fun place for a quick treat. And treat it is.   The friendly banter between regulars and staff/owners/family makes you feel right at home if you can find a spot to sit. Dont go with all your friends unless you're doing take away.  Sad to hear the cash register has been replaced and no more pop bottles. :("}
{"text":"Dirty Dogs, Done Dirt Cheap.     A Ville St. Laurent landmark. Not reinventing the wheel and they have been in business for so long that you can choose to complain about how things look old and blah blah but to those I say, go blow 70 bucks at M:BRGR.      One million all dressed hot dogs served, over the course of the last fifty years cannot be wrong and what do you expect? It is a hole in the wall, grease spoon. If you want a poutine made with King Edward Potatoes, with Manchego chesse, chorizo and a black pepper gravy, go to a new trendy poutine place. However, if you want a simple, honest, decent poutine, two all dressed steamies, a black cherry coke and to pay with a ten and get change, you are in the right place.    And the guys behind the counter are always a hoot.   5 Stars, as far as grease spoons go.  Waka Waka"}
{"text":"I'm not the type that gets too worked up with service, especially one established & long in history that goes way back when I was in high school.  While paying a visit to Montreal, one of the three things on my must-do list in addition to 1) Schwartz' Smoked Meats, 2) Fairmount Bagels, it's 3) Le Poutine!  Going along with times, before tasting everything, I whipped out my smartphone & began blogging my dining experience. One lady started yelling at me, \"hey, you can't take pictures & videos! What are you going to do with it?\" Oh, c'mon lady, I came all the way from California to relive a bit of my youth nostalgia, and your actions simply ruined it for me.   Can't take pictures, a quick look on their FB pages already filled with photos from people like me, what I am doing is no different than any of the other folks. Besides, c'mon, go on with times, you should be thankful that we want to blog about our experience, if done well, it's free publicity & marketing for your little joint here, now you really pissed me OFF!"}
{"text":"The best fix for a fast food crave!!! The poutine's sauce is slightly sweet, the fries incredibly crunchy and just greasy enough and the cheese curds have the perfect amount of squeak :) side by side, the seats are cozy and the workers and owners of the place just make you feel right at home! The decor is cool, badges and stickers from business, school, products randomly everywhere. I am just incredibly sad that they dont have their old traditional cash register and tiny bottles of pop anymore :( it really added to the charm of the place."}
{"text":"I loved this place since I was a little kid when I would go up to visit relatives from the US and I would stop here for the poutine.  This place is small but big on taste with the food.  I always get the poutine, never ever disappointed and staff is super nice and friendly.  I would recommend this place with no doubt about it if any of you yelpers reading this ever come nearby and to go try it!"}
