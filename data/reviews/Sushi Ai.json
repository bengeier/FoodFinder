{"text":"I've had takeout from here several times and it's always so good! They lunch box deals are amazing and they have fresh sushi all the time. The server is super nice and the chef always goes out of his way to thank me for coming in even though I'm just getting food to go. Just what this area needs, a great sushi place!"}
{"text":"This used to be the Ajisai restaurant that have been in business for a number of years in Panorama Hills.  It looks like new owners took over and has a new menu.  We came here for a Saturday lunch so we really did not explore the menu much.  My wife had the shrimp teriyaki lunch combo and I had the sushi bento.  Both were well made and the portions were good.  The miso soup included with our order was okay except they put a bit too much green onions in the soup.  The rice on the nigiri and California roll were packed a little be too tight for my liking.  I prefer the rice to be a bit looser but without danger of falling apart... it is a delicate balance.  The meal was nothing spectacular but the raw fish on the sushi seemed fresh which they should be in any sushi place.  The service was friendly.   I give this restaurant a solid 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 start). I look forward to trying other things on the menu in another visit and update my review at that time."}
{"text":"Was looking for a nice restaurant with great food and ambiance that wasn't too expensive within walking distance. Great selection of dishes that aren't your typical Calgary Japanese fare, e.g. donburi, tonkatsu, chicken nanban. Wanted something that I could go to for a simple, nice, relaxing meal that was delicious but not overly fussy, like in Samurai Gourmet on Netflix. I think I've found it! 

I had the lunch tempura special and the portions were extremely generous at a great price. The tempura was light and crispy and I left really happy. Would heartily recommend this awesome neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"We got take out on a Sunday. We got the sushi special, negi toro roll, special scallop roll and a California roll. The one star rating is due to the freshness of the fish/ scallop topped with the at least one day old rice. We won't be going back even though this place is two mins away."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a couple more times since they have 10% off Combos A, B, and C for a limited time until May.   Food was still good with good portion sizes.  Server is very attentive."}
{"text":"I think this place is so underrated! The serving sizes are so big and is worth the money. My favourite roll is their Las Vegas roll, it's so good!! They make everything so pretty too . This is definitely one of my favourite sushi restaurants in Calgary, I highly recommend coming here!"}
