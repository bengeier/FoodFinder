{"text":"Nice decor but would rather pay less for the same dish at another location.

1. Vermicelli with spring roll and grilled pork 
- Crispy spring roll, pork was not dry. Noodles were not clumpy. 

Overall:
As nice as the decor is, the prices were higher than other similar pho restaurants and the menu was smaller. Service was good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and they have a lunch combo which came with a smaller size of the pho, a spring roll and a drink for $8.

The food is very average and is do-able if the location is convenient."}
{"text":"Awful! Food was so salty that I could not finish it and I was so hungry! Spring rolls were tasteless. Place is reasonably clean if you don't mind bits of leftover food from the last diners under your feet...won't be back. I love pho! So sad!"}
{"text":"definetly better than it's neighbour Xe Lua.
ordered the pho special and it came out piping hot! 
the broth tasted sooo good that my friend who ordered the rice plate couldn't stop drinking my soup. haha
the meat was tender and soft which made it easy to chew with good flavour.
decor also made the atmosphere more enjoyable along with friendly waiters and waitresses.
i had a delightful time here and will come back for more."}
{"text":"Good place to eat with some friends! Food is pretty good from my opinion! Sometimes they are crowded sometimes no! They workers are friendly and the prices are not bad! But acceptable!"}
{"text":"I'm a very loyal customer to the Pho88 in North York, and wanted to try the one downtown - it was a completely different experience.

Our food arrived but we had no cutlery or sauces, and the rare beef pho broth was...sort of...non-existant? It tasted like the ghost of a good soup, there was just nothing to it.

Boo :( I'll stick to the restaurant uptown, I just hope this was a one off, poor experience."}
{"text":"Some of my friends love this place, some of them hate it. My dad likes it because he's from the burbs and hates street parking.

Their pho is standard fare, but they don't always use the freshest ingredients.

On the plus side, the servers all speak english."}
{"text":"This is a very casual and quick restaurant that serves very good pho. 
I had the vegetable peanut butter \"raviolis\" AKA dumplings to start, which were great. Gooey and saucy - just how I like it. 
As for the pho, I ordered the chicken one which came quickly and was the perfect temperature. It was extremely filling. Add some hot sauce to make it even better. 
The waitress was a bit awkward and didn't speak much english, but all our food came out right. 
I recommend Pho 88 for a good quick and simple pho dinner!"}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food.  We found Annie! Surprised to see her and as always, food is great."}
{"text":"It was not very good. Not terrible though. The pho and the tom yum both lacked hugely in flavour. Very very bland. The beef in the pho was awful, tasted like processed meat. The spring roll and imperial roll were average. The peanut sauce was so strange, it tasted watered down. The service was fantastic, however and the staff all really friendly. They do take debit now to whomever wrote that they didn't. The place was clean and they offer a large menu. I would maybe go back but perhaps try ordering something different."}
{"text":"Been eating takeout here for the past year and it's gotten progressively worse. Pho is all noodle, packed in its own container and need a knife to cut the noodles out. They skimp on sprouts and basil. 

Then, we decided to try eating at the restaurant and it was worse. We ordered appetizers and they brought 2 tiny plates for the 6 of us. Asked for more plates and they brought one more plate. Then ordered sake, which tasted like it had been watered down.  Ordered red curry and guess what?  They refused to provide bowls and insisted we share it using the minuscule plates they provided. My brother ordered Pho and asked for only half the noodle and it came back as a full bowl of noodles so he couldn't even get at the broth or anything else. Plus, it was the wrong broth!  As usual, they skimped on sprouts and basil. 

They weren't even apologetic. I refuse to order takeout or eat at the restaurant. So don't waste your time. M"}
{"text":"Before today, I was a pho virgin.  When I got home from work, though, something came over me and I *knew* today was going to be the day that I would eat pho.  Naturally, I came to Yelp for help and settled on Pho 88 to pop my pho cherry.

I had an idea of what I was going to get (thank you, Yelp reviewers!), so when I sat down, I had everything ready to go. The server brought me a pot of tea (love it!), then looked through the menu and waited. And waited. And waited some more, until I finally had to change to a table closer to the back in order for someone to wait on me. 

I ordered the spring rolls to start and the well-done brisket pho. The large one. Ahem. More on that later.  The spring rolls were good -- a little denser than I'm used to, but very flavourful. Next, out came my bowl of pho...or should I say small in-ground pool-sized bowl of pho.  It was HUGE!!  Unless you're feeding a family of four, stay far away from the large bowl of pho!  I had no idea and now know why the very tiny waitress gave me a look of disgust when I ordered it.  Some assembly of pho is required, but of course, being the pho virgin I was, had no clue what to do.  The new server that brought it was sweet and very happily explained what to do.  So, I assembled away and did my very best to eat it as properly as I could. Because of the size of the bowl, I barely made a dent in it, which I'm fairly certain annoyed my server. Live and learn. 

The pho itself was flavourful and, while I probably would try a vegetarian version next time, it was good nonetheless.  I'd probably go back to Pho 88 again, especially now that I know the drill."}
{"text":"I was craving pho while driving on Don Mills in search for a place to eat, and came across this place. I've heard of the franchise before. Since I haven't really had a bad pho from the few other places I've tried (not part of the franchise), I decided to give it a try. Once I entered, I noticed the high ceiling and cool surfboard-like decor on one of the walls. There was another seating area farther away from the entrance but I didn't get to see it. As for the area I was in, it looked quite nice.

It was around 7 PM on a Friday evening and I was by myself. It wasn't empty but it wasn't jam-packed either - so I was assigned a seat fairly quickly. I was given a menu, a funky bottle of water, a cup, a pair of chopsticks, one of those plastic soup spoons, and a paper napkin. There was also a bottle of that sweet brown (hoisin?) sauce and a bottle of the hot (sriracha?) sauce. I didn't really know what to get, since I was only used to this kind of menu: 'beef pho', 'rare beef pho', etc. There was a dish called Pho 88 (or something like that) so I ordered that one in the smaller size (I think the two sizes are called regular and large - with large being the bigger size, of course). It was about $8, I think.

 It came at a reasonable time and it tasted pretty good. It also came with some kind of herb, some plants that resemble bean sprouts, and line on a separate plate. Never once did they come to check up on me - if they had, I could've requested more paper napkins that I direly needed, or a small dish for me to put the sauce so that I don't have to put the sauce in my tiny plastic spoon every time I took a bite. Speaking of the spoon, I hope that they would provide something more substantial than the tiny, disposable one. It was difficult to use because the noodles kept slipping out of the spoon (more than usual). They had some free mint candy I could take near the cashier, though."}
{"text":"This review gets a one star and not a 0 star because the interior and decor looks good. But, you don`t go to a pho restaurant for a pleasant atmosphere, you go for one reason and one reason only.. to eat a delicious bowl of pho.  Unfortunately, you will not find that here.

One test of delicious pho is the beef satay variation. The beef satay here tasted sandy, grainy, and had tomato slices in it which did not go well. I would say I did not enjoy eating this.

The regular pho is just that- regular. There is nothing that stands out. The flavour is alright, but bland. If you`re paying money for a meal in a restaurant, you deserve to eat something that tastes good.. not just average, okay, non-inspiring, no nothing.

The coconut milkshake which I ordered was below average. The flavour sucked out before the ice, leaving clusters of flavourless ice in my cup. I expect a nicely blended shake that has a uniform consistency and drinks evenly.

That`s about all I can say for Pho 88. Note, I did give it multiple chances, eatting here 2 or 3 times after it renovated. I hear it was good before renovations, but have not experienced it firsthand."}
{"text":"Nice clean place.  Haven't been to their bathrooms but apparently I should according to fellow yelpers.  I found the broth for the pho here was not too bad actually.  I'm surprised that everyone didn't like the pho.  The spring rolls on the other hand.  Stay away!  They do not taste authentic.  For a lack of better words."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times. The good thing about this place is that it has been renovated.  It also has free underground parking in the back. We parked there once but the whole underground parking is S-k-e-tchy...and little scary.

The pho there is pretty good. If you want the raw beef to come on a separate plate they will accomodate you. I've asked for extra broth a few times and they have brought it over to me.

They serve the thin noodles which i like.  The broth and ingredients are pretty good too. I haven't tried any other menu items.

The price is pretty standard like every other place $6-7. 

I wouldn't push anyone out of the way to run there but if you are looking for options late at night or for a quick bite to eat, this place is ok for the pho."}
{"text":"As a very big Pho fan and enthusiast, i do not agree with people saying the soup is \"tasteless\". Its good but its not the best. 
For a quick Pho fix near my home its perfect.
 I reside in Hampstead and its near. I don't always want to drive all the way to chinatown. 
The chicken and rice is great but i find the rice portion is quite small. 

Definitely a quick weekday night dinner.

They even have a couple spots to park in the back."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! The egg rolls and pho make me want to eat here every day. I love how close it is to home and how great the quality of food is. Great service and very relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I often come here at night during school year, so I've eaten at Pho 88 a lot. The noodles are delicious as they are not salty or bland. It has good flavours throughout. Portion is huge and quality has been consistant. But service isn't. Sometimes noodles come out fast and other times it's slow. And servers are not attentive. But those are minor issues. It is good pho with good price."}
{"text":"Oh..this place has very rude waitress..we politely asked for an extra empty plate for my toddler , she responded very rudely saying I have only  have two hands OK..wow so much attitude for asking an extra empty plate..my kids are taken by surprise with this kind of rudeness...of course we are never going to return this place again ever.."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town ! and best Pat Thai, and BBQ pork x Wonton Pho. I used to eat their pho almost every other day when they used to own Pho Annie, and since they left Pho Annie we've been waiting for them to open their new restaurant. Waited too long ! Now that they are back as Pho88 I'm sure to show up \"almost\" daily for my pho fix"}
{"text":"This is such a good Vietnamese restaurant. Service is kinda awkward because some of the servers are more fluent in Vietnamese than others, but overall it's good. 
They have a good, cheap selection of appetizers, rice dishes and of course, soups. As well as the traditional pho, they have stuff like tom yum, beef ball soup.. Good stuff! The portions are of a good size and the dishes always delicious. 
If you order a soup you get a little plate with bean sprouts, thai basil - which they grow themselves on the deck (in the summer at least) - and lime, and there are a plethora of condiments already on the table, including sriracha, chili paste, fish sauce.. and a bunch of other stuff I haven't even tried!
A main dish is usually under $10, so if you get an appetizer with it and include the tips, a meal for one usually comes up to $15 - pretty good if you ask me. 
The owner of the place is also very friendly and cheery, so it's a nice little atmosphere they have going.
I highly recommend this restaurant if you like soups. I however have not tried the rice or noodle-based dishes, but I assume they are just as good :)"}
{"text":"Decent pho but lots of competition on the street, gets edged out slightly by Pho Hung I'd say. Nice homemade noodle option. Great service. Tasty spring roll (not fried, like salad roll) with beef."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday and it wasn't busy. Food was warm (not hot) as you would expect for a bowl of pho. Utensils on the table weren't stacked and had to ask for them. Tables weren't clean either as we sat down. Taste-wise, food was meh. Servers seemed like they don't wan't to be there either and didn't check on you either. Although decor was nice, there are other way better pho places. The Bloor location is actually better in terms of service and food."}
{"text":"Location: its great because it free parking. Great modern place.

Amount: a little pricey compare to other pho restaurants. 

Food: ordered pad thai... I was dissapointed. I know pho restaurant and I ordered pad thai my fault! The pad thai tasted like onion. And it was full of onions! Every bite I took had onion. It was realy too much and the onion are not all cooked. I thought quarter to my meal, Im definitely eating onions w/ pad thai!!

Soup only came in 2sizes small or regular. Big eaters will probably complain.

You have to pay for a pot of tea. 

Good points: rice menu comes in large amount. Spring rolls are okay.

Service: okay"}
{"text":"We're out of towners from Seattle, WA. We have relatives here and usually visit Vegas once or twice a year. My sister recommended Annie's and we have ALWAYS make it a point to visit. We were so sad when the owner sold her restaurant last year. So imagine how happy we were to found out she opened a new one!!! This new restaurant is definitely an upgrade from the last. The restaurant is very open and welcoming. The food is great as I expected, but dare I say the service is even better than before? That is saying something for a Vietnamese restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Out of all the pho restaurants in Chinatown, I do have to say, Pho 88 is the cleanest out of all of them. But, the service and food was a disappointment. 

The portion of the pho is small, compared to other places. I usually can't finish a medium, but at Pho 88...I can. It's mainly noodles and not enough meat...2-3 \"sheets\" of meat in a medium bowl of pho. 

I went before the dinner rush and there was only a few tables filled up...yet, the waiter/waitress usually ignore us when we called them over. Some of the waitress can be snobby, which is horrible service. 

Since the renovation of this restaurant (couple years ago), this restaurant is not the best place to get pho.

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pre-Renovation I would say this place was one of the best. After the Renovation this place have become one of the most disappointing places I have eaten Pho at.

Sold out completely and changed recipes for the absolute worst. People go there because it looks trendy. Unfortunately the Pho is horrible."}
{"text":"I consider my pho knowledge at PHD level at least for a gaijin. Pho 88 is a pretty good package of location, design, service and pho. Their Vietnamese ice coffee is a very good addition to anything especially a warm rare beef pho. The Lychee ice drink is also great as is their mango smoothie. The waiter did not seem to mind when I ordered 4 drinks for myself (coffee/lychee/mango/water) but she may have thought I was out of line behind my back.  As others have mentioned the bathrooms are superb although unfortunately I've only gone number 1 in there so far. The pho while not exceptional will get the job done."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, large portions, decent prices. But pretty uninspired food. Too much focus on the mediocre meat and not enough on fresh interesting vegetables and seasoning. Would like to see cabbage and maybe radish in the spring rolls, not just stodgy ground chicken. Fresh rolls depend on the shrimp for any interest. Again, some snappy fresh veg and herbs would make all the difference."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed many lunches from Pho 88 and travel from the north end to enjoy their Rare Beef Pho and spring rolls. The atmosphere is nice and they're always very kind to my child."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday around noon. Was greeted right away & seated. There was a lady going around kinda loud( I am guessing she is the owner). 
Anyway, We order. Service was good. 
The food? Was ok. The broth had no flavor. Noodle was... ok.  I was there with 7 other people and they all said the broth had no flavor. 
The loud lady gave us free soda. We dont drink soda so that was wasteful. She gave us free egg rolls. Egg rolls were good. 
I was hoping they had great pho since the restaurant was bright, spacious(although too many tables.. making the seats tight), and plenty of parking. But since food was soso I dont know if I would go back as there are other pho's around the area."}
{"text":"Yes Annie is back! Got my pork with egg roll vermicelli and I am now a happy camper. It looks like there's some new things on the menu as well that weren't on the Pho Annie menu (i think). This new place will be a southwest favorite imo, especially now that there's more room!"}
{"text":"It's Annie! Yes, it's true, Annie is here, providing a definitive answer to the question, \"What's the best pho place in Vegas?\"

The food here is better even than her previous establishment, Pho Annie, and the place is bigger and nicer. The pho is magnificent, and then you can branch out to some of the other wonderful dishes on offer.

The regular beef pho is great. If you get tendon, they are properly cooked, not overly tough like at some places. The rare steak is said on the menu to be filet mignon, and I assume it is because you can tell the difference from other places.

Getting past the beef pho, other dishes of note include the roast duck noodle soup (mi vit quay), which is so good I make little noises while eating it. It's made with egg noodles by default, but I prefer it with rice noodles (which makes it pho vit quay, I guess). You have to be careful of the bones, though, and above-average chopstick skills are helpful.

The beef stew noodle soup (hu tieu bo kho) is similarly wonderful. I've had this at various places around town and this one is ahead by a mile.

They offer a BBQ pork noodle soup (hu tieu-mixa xiu) that you don't find elsewhere and it is great.

The chicken curry noodle soup (hu tieu ca-ri ga) is pretty great and is good for variety from the usual chicken pho (which is also very good here).

And of course the bun bo hue is superior as well. That's the famous spicy beef stew that comes with pig's feet and a cube of congealed pig's blood.

If that one annoying friend is with you, they offer a vegetarian pho. Lots of places make a vegetable pho but use beef or chicken broth. The vegetable pho is so good that I get it myself sometimes, and I'm a certified carnivore.

For shrimp pho... honestly, go to WTPho for that.  I hate to say it, but Annie isn't the best at absolutely everything.

Service is better than you usually find at Vietnamese places... if you go to pho places you know what I mean. Often Annie herself will come by to ask if everything is okay. But you sometimes have to flag down a waiter to get your check when you're finished.

Sodas are refillable, not brought in a can.

It's safe to say this is my favorite restaurant right now."}
{"text":"My family and I always enjoy coming here. Have to admit its not the best pho  but its in a good convenient area. Every time we go, the staff are really nice and courteous. I really personally enjoy the rice meals and the starters such as the springrolls and fries dumplings. The pho is good and tasty for what it is and its filling.However like i said, not the best youll find. Overall their location is great,  good variety in the menu, maybe a little pricey compared to other places."}
{"text":"We came here for a late dinner. The first booth we sat in had a wet gross and slimy spit that I sat in. There was no apology. We moved to a new seat. The chicken pho was okay. I haves tasted much better. I paid extra for glass noodles. They came in a huge clump in my soup. I had to stir them to loosen them in order to eat. 
My daughter had chicken pad Thai. It was just mediocre. If you want great pho, make a trip to Pho Metro at Warden and Lawrence."}
{"text":"Pho 88 may seem like a classy and clean restaurant with nice decor, but that's about it. I've been here twice, the first time was 3 years ago and it was only okay. I usually go to Train (a few doors over) but my friend wanted me to come to Pho 88 so I decided to give it another try last weekend.

That will for sure be my last time at Pho 88 because the experience was no good at all.

First of all, the service was slow and the waiters weren't attentive. I had to ask twice for a teapot refill. The second time they took the teapot - it never came back. The waiter totally forgot to bring it back - that got me pissed the most.

More importantly the food was a big miss. The red curry with chicken and green curry with chicken that were ordered at my table were really poor quality and didn't taste good. The curry was so watery - curry should be thick - even this type of Thai curry should be thick. The chicken sliced chicken breast and vegetables seemed like it they were just boiled in water and put in watery curry. It really seemed like they didn't know how to make it - and if they make this regularly then they shouldn't be making Thai food. So after waiting close to an hour that was what they made for me?

I know the servers/waiters did not mean to give bad service, but they really need to be more attentive - I spent too much effort trying to get a waiter to get us tea and in the end I never got it. I know its a Vietnamese restaurant but they need to start learning how to make Thai food if they want to serve Thai food too. Again, I am not returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We come here a lot. But the last 2 visits quality and service has gone way down.  They weren't even busy and we had to wait a few minutes to even get acknowledged . We were a party of 6 and we asked for water. They brought us 2 cups then forgot to bring the rest. They never took our order for more than 10 minutes. Mind you the restaurant is not busy at all.   We finally order our pho and they bring us soggy nasty looking bean sprouts and basil. Looked as if they washed customers old ones and reused them. We ask for new ones and it took over 20 minutes. We were already done and wanted our check. Everyone in my party was disappointed. They even messed up on our drinks we ordered. IT NEVER CAME.  Horrible horrible service and quality !!!! Never gonna come back again!!!! Beware!!!! The owner does not care."}
{"text":"Terrible attendance. I went in for guidance on meal recommendations and the service sucked as if they were doing me a favor. Ugliness and ugly face. I got up and left!"}
{"text":"I had the rare beef pho and my bf got the vermicelli. He enjoyed his dish. The pho broth was a little weak but the chilli pepper sauce, sriracha sauce, and garnishes all made it very enjoyable. The temperature of the pho was perfect. A lot of places often serve the broth room temperature. The beef cooked well throughout. Overall I would come back again. I loved the layout. The music was cool."}
{"text":"Great new place in the neighbourhood. They have amazing Banh Mi Sandwiches and their Beef rice plate. You can tell they use fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"annie is back!!! amazing food and excellent service. her new location is super clean and super spacious. annie is super nice and caring always make sure her customers are happy. great hospitality!!! we will be back for more and more!!!"}
{"text":"The pho was amazingly fantastic, went after a cold school's day and it absolutely warmed me up! Don't miss out on the spring rolls and I can say without a doubt it, was the best I ever had so far. The food was hot and steamy and the decor was comforting too- like a local indie coffee shop. Couldn't resist a second bowl, unquestionably good!"}
{"text":"This Pho place is alright. I only go here because there is a lot of parking in the area, there's a ton of seating and it's open pretty late. Pho tastes like any other Toronto place, nothing that compares to actual the actual Pho I've tried in Vietnam. This place makes good fruit milkshakes though. I always grab Avocado shake when I'm there. The staff are always friendly to us, and service is quick. I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to try this place."}
{"text":"I work in the area and go here for lunch. It's $8 for pho, large spring roll and can of pop. Quality is good and price is great. Nice decor on the inside and friendly staff. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"The Pho is really not good :( 

Probably the worst I ever had. It was tasteless and had ingredients such as broccoli, lettuce and carrots... it's the fist time I've seen that and it's not good.

The fried ice cream for dessert was okay but I'm not going back. There are great Vietnamese restaurants on Cotes-Des-Neiges."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, which would have been ok, but the one thing that made the experience very unpleasant was someone coming up to us several times during our meal rushing us to leave when there were only 2 tables being occupied.  We had only sat down for about 20 min when they started asking if we were finished.  Will NEVER return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Annie from Annie Pho opened this great place. The pho brought here is the best in town! It is full of flavor but not too much fat floating on top. Everything that I have had here is amazing! Grilled pork chops, spring rolls, fried egg rolls, beef chow fun... everything is absolutely delicious! Very convenient for dining in and also for pick up!
This new space is much bigger and very open!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my dining experience at Pho 88. The decor was nice, clean, and modern, however the food and service were not.

Our waiter forgot my iced coffee order 2 times, and when it finally showed up at the end (45mins later), I had no appetite for it, however he insisted that because I order it, I must pay for it. 

The broth and pho itself were mediocre at best. I have had a lot better. The food did not taste authentic and seemed more catered to Western tastes. I likely will not return to Pho 88 in the future."}
{"text":"The Bun Tom Cha Gio (vermicelli)was very good. Fish sauce taste perfectly. Also try out the butter chicken wings not bad either. Services staffs are friendly. Restaurant very roomies for big party.willing to recommend to try it out."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I have only tried various types of pho here, and nothing else. I figure if it's in the name, it should be your best damn dish.

All I have to say is BLECH. 

I find the beef is too fatty and chewy most of the time and I usually eat only one or two pieces before becoming totally grossed out and picking the rest out. The broth is only okay. 

It's disappointing, because the decor is nice and service is quick and polite so I tried (5+ times!) to really give this place a chance but Pho 88, it's over. I've moved on. It's not me, it's you."}
{"text":"Bummed by my experience at Pho 88. Expected great things from reviews but when I tried my pho it was incredibly bland. Lack of umami, nuance in the broth, etc. Did I catch them on an off day? I knew I wasn't making up things when a companion asked to try my soup and was surprised at how unremarkable it was. He had ordered the bun noodles with egg rolls and while it tasted good, the crust of the egg rolls were dry and not crispy enough. Service was ok, but nothing spectacular even though we were one of three tables there. Lots of seating but that lime green wall color has gotta go. The entire experience has my scratching my heads and doing a double-take to make sure I went to the same restaurant everyone seems to be raving about. I would like to come back for another try but the pho was so disappointing and there are so many other competition out there I haven't even visited yet so a return trip is unfortunately unlikely."}
{"text":"Fancy decoration... Nice try but no, I'm not coming again! First, I didn't get the \"no well-done meat extra stripes\" that I asked for (instead they only took out the meat). And second, there is a HAIR ON THE SPOON!! I tried so hard to get their attention for the issues mentioned above but got ignored (I'm pretty sure they saw me..) Well then, here I'm at Yelp. You might not wanna zoom in the pic that I uploaded cuz its a real disgusting hair.. I just wanted to proof that I wasn't lying Lol"}
{"text":"Unlike most Vietnamese restaurants, waiters here are actually nice to you!

Unfortunately, the food falls below the standard. One of the ways I judge pho noodles is the texture of the rare beef. But the beef is a little rough and too overcooked for my liking."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious. The sauces are expertly flavoured and the meals are beautifully presented. I wouldn't say it's the best pho in town, but it's up there. The cold shrimp roll is amazing and so is the mango salad with chicken satay. So good, so well priced."}
{"text":"Somehow soup base is very sweet,different from other pho around this area.but will try other dish next time.."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Cold food.  I went here with my two daughters for lunch.  We were sat very quickly and our orders taken promptly.  We ordered a drink each with appetizers and a main meal.  The appetizer came and was good.  My meal and one daughter's meal came.  But my other daughter's meal took a lot longer to arrive and was not what she ordered.  So we sent it back and had to wait longer.  Our drinks never arrived.  When I asked about our drinks we were told that the kitchen was busy and just to wait.  The drinks came after we finished our cold meals.
So we will NOT be returning.  I only gave this place a one star because you can't give it 1/2 a star."}
{"text":"From the first time eating here two months , never had a bad experience,  the lemongrass grilled chicken is awesome and the fresh spring roll is yummy ! Today trying the Pho ...looks great!"}
{"text":"Common prev. Yelpers, you guys are really disappointed me.  If this place is AUTHENTIC then Panda Express is authentic Chinese food?
1 star for services plus another star for clean and fresh veggies."}
{"text":"i'm all about the curry and Pho 88 dishes one of the best!! great service, great price...."}
{"text":"Went here for an after work meeting and ordered deep fried shrimp and I think a thai beef curry for mains.

Before choosing this place I had heard it was a great place for Pho but I thought I would try one of their other menu items.

The place itself is chilled out, not too busy (around 6pm midweek) and the décor seems quite new and modern. Not really any authentic feel to the place but then again nearly everywhere else I eat is sometimes too busy and the authentic vibe comes from the Asian crowd eating there.

So the starters were not great, I was expecting something tastier but they made me wishing I ordered something else. 
The mains were okay my friend had a Pho dish and devoured it like it was the last one going but again my dish went down but did not leave me with a desire to rush here and yelp about it! Left it 3 weeks after going :D 

The service itself was good, except for when someone orders a cocktail or whatever it was that required a blender and therefore the loud 5 minutes of blending which was annoying. Not sure why this place has such a big bar now I think about it.

Since Pho is pretty good wherever I go I doubt I will be rushing back here especially since I have about 100 places on my list of places to try in China Town."}
{"text":"Annie is back! If you've been around the Southweat area, then you know about Annie who used to own Annie pho. She is now back with this location!! She really takes pride in her business and the food is always great!!

This new location is A LOT more spacious and very comfy. It has only been opened for about a week or two, so it wasn't too busy when I went. But I'm sure it will be soon when people start to find out about it! Only thing is, the food took awhile to come out. But I think it's because it was during dinner rush and maybe the kitchen staff are new. 

Definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome curry, cheap prices, and clean modern design. My fave place for curry and pho."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner after work. There's definitely other Pho places with better price/portion.

I got the beef and tripe pho. Surprisingly there were decent amount of beef, but there was that smell you get from using cheap beef (which is expected for most pho places, but the smell was pretty strong here for me). 

Overall the taste was ok, nothing terrible or amazing. Just the smell brought this down a lot for me. 

They do take credit card though so that's a plus"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a few years now and we love it. From the pho to duck to beef broccoli noodles its all very good. 
They use good ingredients and the broths are amazing. 
They have. A multitude of dishes that have all been on point like the pork with vermicelli, to die for.
So many flavors bursting in your mouth it is all very exciting!"}
{"text":"3/29/18 used to be my favorite place... Today a young worker  a male with a pony tail use his finger to put half of the onion hanging from the bowl back to the soup bowl. Won't be going back, I feel bad for the owner cuz I've known her for a long time... next time used a chopstick or some thing. GROSS"}
{"text":"The dishes were absolutely fantastic. Food was fresh and well seasoned. The portions were so huge that we thought we would bring some leftovers home. Nah....it was so good every crumb was devoured by us. Service was super friendly and attentive. This will be a must stop when I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"A pho restaurant with a nice ambiance.  Large windows and high ceilings make for a relaxed dining experience. 

This restaurant is new so service is extra nice and fast.  It is very clean too and I like the industrial flooring, it's a very clean look. 

Pho is good. Vermicelli was delicious and they offered up extra fish sauce too. 

Veggies in the Verm were fresh and the spring rolls nice and crispy without being greasy. 

I also ordered the red bean drink, it came in a mason jar - classy and unique. 
Also there is plenty of parking. A big plus. 

Now the negative:

I find the portions smaller than the Chinatown offerings, but for the ambiance, cleanliness and parking I will over look this. I will just order more appetizers."}
{"text":"Nice decor, clean and large place. Flavors of pho broth was too sweet. Price is a bit high for portion. Bean sprouts were very clean but the basil was old."}
{"text":"Not impressed.

Pho should not taste like cloves. It should taste like beef and deliciousness. Unfortunately, the pho here tastes of cloves and not deliciousness. Meat was also scant and unimpressive. I also stole a sip of my friend's lychee drink and it was too sweet/generally untasty. 
Food versus price: 1.5/5 (Only reason it's not outright 1 star is that pho is pho is a filling $6 meal)

Servers and interior were nice enough but the owner/manager lady gave us a really hard time about our wanting to split the bills and made us feel awful about it... whereas pho train down the street is happy to split a 20-way bill.
Service/ambiance: 3/5 

Regardless, my main beef with the place (pun!) is that they are primarily a pho place, but their pho is possibly the least enjoyable I've ever had. Apparently they used to be really good, but seems they've gone downhill since management changed.

I might be dragged back by friends with inside connections to the place, but know that it will be against my will."}
{"text":"A pretty decent Pho place in the area.  The soup base is good and very nice server.  Worth coming back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"So I was told this is the new spot from the Annie Pho owner. The place is a wide open restaurant that's spacious and simple. The food came out very quickly and the service was very good. I came with family and we started off with egg rolls and chicken wings. Everything tasted great. I ended up getting the lemon grass chicken, but got to try the pork chops from my brother's plate. Both were excellent. I also tried some of my Mom's pho and the broth was delicious. The portions were good and the prices are reasonable. This place is a must try"}
{"text":"This is our favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA. The food is so delicious, staff is very friendly and patient. Restaurants decor is simple, clean, yet very nice."}
{"text":"Wow. So excited about trying this place (without reading any reviews ahead of time) only to be so disappointed. 

1. Could not get the attention of anyone to put in the order for the longest time
2. Order took a while to come in. 
3. Then things came all staggered. One appetizer came then the other took some time to come. 
4. They forgot the third person in our party's order completely. We asked a few times. Finally our server came back and he no longer remembered the order even though I saw him write it down with my own eyes. 
5. The Pho - why we came - one was bland as water. The tendon was totally uneven. Some were hard. Others were like pure mush. The spicier one at least had some flavour but not much. 
6. Then finally the third persons order came. It was crispy noodles. Sorry only partly crispy. And huge pile of noodles with 5 shrimp. I remember the number because there were so few it was easy to count. And then it tasted like syrup there was so much sugar in it. 

Then it took forever to get the bill. Not a great night for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since this place opened. Great atmosphere. Fast service and food is delicious. My favorite is the calamari and shrimp fried rice and pho"}
{"text":"The restaurant here is spacious and very clean environment! Great dishes ESP egg wonton noodle soup, mango salad, and lemon grass chicken plate where no other restaurants have! The manager Annie is super friendly and the store provides great service. Thanks Pho88 for my favorite dishes!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food is so good and the service is awesome. You don't have to call the server to ask for something they are all around asking customers what they need. Plus food quality is great.....
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I like that this place is close to home and I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown.  Ordered the filet pho which was good and also the calamari was pretty good.  Owner was nice and servers were ok. Only thing bothering us were the gnats flying around us.."}
{"text":"We ate at the newly opened Pho 88 Restaurant at S. Rainbow. I have to say we are very dissapointed with their food. I ordered beef stew, but it didnt comes  with bread which it was supposed to be included. The guy said theres no bread.  Also the beef stew contained mostly fat and hardly any beef. My son ordered soda chan drink and he said its too sour which is normally suppose to be sweet.  We highly recommend eating at Pho Saigon 8 instead, which is located near Rainbow and 215. Their food is much better and higher quality."}
{"text":"Vegan? No problem. They can adjust just about and dish in their menu to meet you vegan needs. We usually get the vegetable pho and tofu spring rolls. Our server Mahn is very helpful in suggestion additional dishes the can make in the kitchen to meet vegan need. The portion size for a bowl of pho are big."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in town! The newly opened PHO 88 is owned by the old owner of Pho Annie and she brought a lot of her staff with her. The new place is space is huge. I love the Grilled Pork Vermicelli with Spring roll."}
{"text":"While I wanted the food to taste good because of the location, this is just not worth your money if you want Vietnamese food with authentic flavor. 

Everything was bland, especially the bun no hue, which is the most flavourful noodle dish on a typical Vietnamese menu. I would recommend any of the other 2-3 Vietnamese restaurants up and down Rainbow for Vietnamese food.

It feels like a very watered down, westernized version to appeal to those who don't know better."}
{"text":"While not exactly the best Pho place in Toronto, this place still offers a decent bowl of pho at relatively inexpensive prices in Toronto.  The place has the usual Vietnamese restaurant decor and the place is usually loud and full of hungry patrons.

I usually order the special Pho noodle soup along with the fresh rolls with shrimp and they are always made to order and the food comes out quite quickly!  The portions could be a bit larger, but I do eat a fair bit when it comes to pho!

Overall I would come back if I was in the area, otherwise I typically would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"OK pho, but not great. Service is mediocre. Do NOT order the \"fresh passion fruit\" juice. It is neither fresh nor does it taste much like passion fruit. VERY watered down. 

Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Meh, much like the other pho 88 locations if they put as much effort into their food as decor it would be great! Is it too much to ask for? A broth, a real broth hand crafted and for gods sake keep the MSG out! I don't want to feel all tired and trusty and lazy after my meal! 
The place looks great! But the food isn't just there! It's not the worst pho but its certainly isn't the best! 

They used o be much better at the Dundas location. I will only go here if I'm too lazy to travel far"}
{"text":"I am genuinely surprised with all the good review for this place. Came here after church my with my family for lunch. Most of us got the special pho and my dad got the stir fried beef with fried rice (bo luc lac). Service was efficient enough, waitress was friendly and took our orders quickly. 

First of the place did not smell like a pho restaurant at all, when you walk into other restaurants (like Saigon 8) you are slapped in the face with the smell of broth and when you leave you smell like a delicious bowl of pho. This place smelled like nothing...which is a bad sign. The broth had no pho smell at all and it was so so very sweet. Not sure if they used MSG or sugar but it was gross, I squeezed 3 big pieces of limes, tons of hoisin and siracha and it was still too sweet to enjoy. For pho dac biet they should have a better variety of meats, they had beef balls and slices of beef, that's it! 

My dad said his bo luc lac was good so I will take his word for it but it was way overpriced. I think it was either $12 or $13 for the dish but he wanted fried rice and they charged an extra $4 or $5 or fried rice, the dish ended up being $17. Are you serious?!

Overall, will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located near highway with good access to parking around (weekdays it is busier and you may find it difficult to find empty parking spot). The restaurant doesn't have many staff and they might be difficult to call when you want to order or ask for something while you are there. Our appetizer arrived 30 seconds before the main dish and both of them were very late! There are few vegetarian options for the appetizer and the main dish. A dish ordered by a friend was fridge cold. there are a number of combos coming with soup. Taken together I didn't really enjoy my experience there. The food was okay and tasty but no effort was made to make the dish looking better. You also cannot use credit card and they only accept debit or cash."}
{"text":"Had the bun bo hue. Overly sweet with no other flavor present. Had to ask for shrimp paste.

Very little meat in the soup. The pigs feet had no flavor and apparently not boiled with the broth.

The blood cubes tasted off.

Don't think ill be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! If you like spicy you must try their beef satay soup - totally original and not like most other places where it's just regular pho with a satay sauce added to it. 

Also really love their grilled lemongrass chicken - so so so very tender!

I'm actually shocked this place is only reviewed at 3 stars now."}
{"text":"So excited for the grand opening. The food here is delectable and makes me feel like I'm having a home cooked meal by my grandma. I can tell that this will be such a successful restaurant. There's so much flavor in the Pho."}
{"text":"Pho (properly pronounced 'fa' by real Vietnamese people) is great here. I am a return customer when I'm in the area. The atmosphere is so nice and clean and the staff are so pleasant but surprisingly not all Vietnamese or Oriental for that matter. Not that it matters. :P

The spring rolls, though good, are not the best I've had among my Vietnamese restaurant frequenting.

Washrooms are beautiful! Whole place is beautiful who am I kidding. It's a shinning gem in the heart of dirty stinky Chinatown."}
{"text":"Decent food but bad service. Waiters didn't come for a long time and got several orders wrong causing us to have to explain why we didn't order x or y. Overall a very frustrating experience."}
{"text":"The standout - it's a clean pho joint with modern decor.  Go figure!  The first time I passed by this joint, I had to do a double take to make sure that it actually was what the sign said it was.  Love the dark, modern decor, love the cleanliness and this last time, was stunned by the incredibly polite and helpful service we received.

The food was pretty standard, with the pho noodles being pre-cooked rather than made to order.  All in all, it's still pretty tasty and if you're looking for after clubbing food before 2am on the weekend, it's the much better alternative to Xe Lua!"}
{"text":"This is a chic little place and a breath of fresh air after I've been going to those run-down Chinatown style Vietnamese places for so long. I really love the decor and I think it makes a big difference and sets the ambience for my eating pleasure. 

True, I don't think they have the best pho in town, but they have a variety of items to pick from on the menu for those of us who don't want pho all the time even though their significant other does. The pho is not bad here I must say. I really liked their spring roll especially since it came out fresh and crispy. I usually order their stir fried glass noodle. I had ordered their chicken option before and thought it was not bad. But today I decided to get their vegetable and tofu option, since I saw on The Social today to eat less meat at night time. Unfortunately for the vegetable version they decided to add more pepper to add more taste due to the lack of meat?!? It wasn't as good as the one I had before. 

Other than that the service was excellent every time I've been here. They brought us our food quickly, attended to us when needed, asked how our food was and packed our leftovers for us. I'll definitely come back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday night around 8pm. The service was great! We found the staff to be friendly and helpful offering suggestions and explanations of different menu items. We got the spring rolls which were great! I love that they gave both of us our own side of peanut sauce. I got the rare steak pho which was great! My boyfriend tried one of their combination phos and loved it! We will definitely be back. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hey hey I just moved to Montreal and I wanted to eat pho.. so I went to Pho 88, as the name suggests, there was a pho, but not just any pho, a tasty pho, a reasonable affordable price with a larger than normal side of bean sprouts, my favorite!!! The servers were very courteous and nice and because it was Sunday after 5 but before the rush hour I parked right outside very easily. A lot of people there, it was a nice not creepy atmosphere with tasty food!! Five stars for this one!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a new pho place in this neighbourhood! I was happy with the decor as well. 

I ordered a regular pho and noticed that there were barely any noodles inside. And the ones inside seemed to break really easily. Was pretty disappointed :( The broth was good though. 

Maybe I got a bad batch. However I be willing to give it another try due to the lack of pho places nearby!"}
{"text":"Very bland Thai, pho is tasteless. If it was dirt cheap I'd eat it. But price wise there are better places."}
{"text":"I feel a bit bad giving such a low review but the fact is this place is seriously below par. Why I feel bad? Simple, this was the first place I had pho in my life! That was over 15 years ago and this place has certainly kept it's looks as back then Pho88 looked more like a dive instead of the moden, wooden decour that now grace it's interior.  

So, back then, being a Pho Virgin and all, you tend to be more forgiving and seriously, whose first time is the best they ever had? There will always be better in the future --one hopes--  you know, once you know what you like and what is good. ;-)

I recently went there with four people and for one reason or another, we were all unsatisfied with our food. Personally, as I like to try new things as much as I like my staple Pho, I went with the Sate to see how it was. 

I thought it to be spicy (as in a lot of paste) but definately not hot. The soup itself was actually kinda of bland once your tongue got used to the spicy/peanut flavours. The noodles where not the best I ever had in  my opinion and my friend who had ordered the Pho (as is quite the pho skank)  felt as if some specific ingredients might have been left out(!) as such, he didn't finish his Pho.

All in all this place is a bit of a looker,  definately very modern in decor and for sure one of the better looking locales on the Spadina strip. Not to mention one of the few Pho places to be found. 

However, even though the portions are big and the prices generally low, it is a restaurant's great food  what carries the most weight and keeps people coming back for more, not the decor or serving sizes. I still think this AFTER give it the handicap of being a Fusion place where I do not expect the best nor the most authentic food. 

Still, I will not return."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had! The reason I only gave them 3 stars is their menu does not have a great selection and the service is not good. We come all the way here strictly for the pho and I only get the beef brisket...it's perfect. Their spring rolls are a good size and very tasty."}
{"text":"Nice place. Tidy. Cold shrimp rolls were delicious. Rare beef and tendon Pho seemed enhanced w MSG."}
{"text":"Pho 88 is fine. Their ambience is above average, but when they're busy, it can be pretty noisy. The food is good, if a little inconsistent (dishes change depending on which day we order them). But mostly we go because it's close and decent, rather than because it's the best vietnamese place in town.

We go about once a month, so it's certainly good enough to go, and go regularly, just don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"First time here. Was craving for pho after a \"crazy fun\" night in Vegas and came across Pho 88. I ordered the oxtail pho and it was delicious! The broth was flavorful, infused with the oxtail and the oxtail itself was tender right off the bone. Would totally come back here ."}
{"text":"It's alright - the portions are huge and the price is alright, but I was expected to be blown away by their pho-ness and I really wasn't.

We had 2 orders of the fresh rolls, and one came with a yummy peanut sauce, and the other came with a yummy peanut sauce with a white liquid ring around it.  I didn't taste it because it looked weird...

If you're craving Pho, you can go here to get your fix.  If you're craving fantastic Pho that you've been dreaming of for weeks, go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I'll go where ever Annie Goes  I'm so happy she reopened a place near southwest cause I was about to lose hope. the Restaurant  is big enough for big parties. Their broth for their pho is very tasty. I had the pho thai Sach with egg noodles which was amazing. The egg noodle was soft which I liked."}
{"text":"Ok, it's never going to be famous for it's stellar customer service, but.....it's a cute little local place where you can bring your own beer or wine, have a good bowl of pho or noodle soup or satay, it's perfectly noisy and busy (as most places like this are), good for groups and your wallet won't hurt when you leave.     
Appetizers were great for sharing, main dishes substantial, the food is pretty good.
Not bad for a little noodle place on Decarie!"}
{"text":"Loved the pho. Hint of sweetness in the broth, perfect taste. Went to their previous restaurant after they sold it, tasted different, like something was missing. Then a friend recommended this and so glad we found Annie again, missed the pho, and the cha gio. Friendly people, newer bigger place, and very clean. Huge pho portion like always. Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! Iove their Crispy Noodles. Tony and Annie are the best!"}
{"text":"We were the only ones dining in at this late hour on a Sunday evening at first.  Our orders arrived very quickly!  I really liked the interior of their dining room.  It was very modern and spacious.  They had TV screens too and a long bar and a beer on tap it looked like.

I ordered the small bowl of Chicken Pho, something that I don't usually order at Vietnamese restaurants because I usually prefer the beef pho. The Chicken Pho was pretty good. I really liked the skinny and soft pho noodles.  I liked the hot brothy soup too."}
{"text":"We had a great Lunch at Pho 88!  The Pho was excellent and the broth was the best we had in LV.  The Bun Bo Hue was good.  The broth was flavorful and tasty.  My one recommendation is that I would like the broth to be \"thicker\".  This allows the broth to enhance the favor of the noodles.  Also, the pig feet that is included tasted like they were just boiled and added to the soup.  Overall, I was happy with the food and the service."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from this place a few times. Generally, it was an average fare much like the other surrounding restaurants. 900 Don Mills mall does not have any outstanding restaurants, unfortunately.

Pho88 tends to overdo things when it comes to sodium. The \"Special Pho\" I tried was absolutely awful and almost made me sick. There was hardly any flavor in the broth besides salt. Other ingredients were average at best.

I've also tried a couple of chicken/rice/noodles dishes and they were ok, again, too much salt to my liking but not to the point where I felt like throwing up.
The place itself is small, but clean and the service is fine."}
{"text":"Worst service!! Foods were bad. Everytime i went there, the taste always changed. Some days were decent, but most time were awful. Mediocre at its best. I gave this place couple of chances but the last time i was there which was 2 days ago, this place let me down. I would never come back! The waitress were like robots and not even talked to you when they served food or cleared your table. One time i ordered soup and the soup came luke warm so i asked the lady owner to get the hot soup! She told me next time to tell the waitress that i wanna get my soup hot! Cmon! Common sense ! If i order soup, i hope that my soup is piping hot when it arrives to the table, not warm! Definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"The vermicelli with pork and egg rolls was average. The pork was marinated with too much sweetness and the egg rolls were nothing special. The Bun Bo Hue didn't have lemongrass and tasted blah. Bun Bo Hue without lemongrass is not the real deal!"}
{"text":"First time trying pho.  Found this place on yelp and it had god review.  I ordered the seafood pho but the gentleman got confused lol.  I asked what was in the seafood pho and he told me.  I asked what kind of vegetables because he didn't say.  I said ok I'll have that.  He came out with vegetable pho lol.  I kept it and asked for some shrimp to put into my soup.  We also got the shrimp pad Thai and egg rolls which both was really good.  My pho had a sweet flavor to it which I didn't mind but wished it wasn't.  The server was very nice and the place is spacious the bathroom is clean.  I would defiantly come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Yes, Annie (THE original owner of Pho Annie down the street) is back and at a brand new location. Pho 88 is located in the same plaza as Serenade, Gelatology and a KBBQ restaurant. 

She just opened her new restaurant Memorial Day weekend and I'm so glad she did, it's about time! It didn't feel right to be going to Pho Annie when it's no longer Annie's business!!!! Despite not seeing each other for so long, I didn't think she would remember me but she did! We chatted and caught up with each other briefly. 

My boyfriend and I love the following and we tend to switch it up between visits:
-spring rolls
-egg rolls
-chicken wings
-pho tai
-charboiled pork + eggroll vermicelli

FYI, she doesn't add MSG to her food. Thumbs up to that."}
{"text":"Ordered the house special at lunch on a Friday. There were NO meatballs, I can't remember if the menu said there would be but usually at Pho places you get all the meats for the house special. The broth wasn't very good, it was fatty and not very drinkable (yes I like to do that with my noodle soups). Someone in my group ordered the crispy noodles and it was almost too much noodle for the sauce to soften it all up. Someone else got the shrimp stir fry with noodles and really enjoyed it.

The service was fine, a little slow to check up on us while we were finishing our meals. The interior is clean and lots of good light from the big windows. The bathrooms were pretty clean as well. 

Overall, a little less than OK as a Pho restaurant, that's the star of your show and it wasn't enough to bring me back as everyone who ordered the Pho was less than impressed in my group."}
{"text":"They are great! The pho was amazing but they fell short on the egg roll unfortunately. I have to stick with pho annie but to me, the broth tasted identical to pho annie. I asked for extra siracha and hosain but guess I'll have to elaborate next time."}
{"text":"Best pho! Seriously delicious! We go at least once a week and the servers are so nice!"}
{"text":"Lame debit or cash only. No credit card.

Pho was not very good here. Soup was decent but not hot enough and noodles were overcooked. Did not feel very well after eating here. I question the quality/freshness of their meats. One alarming thing is the waitress/owner has no idea what's good and what's not. She was like I don't know I never tried it....what kind of owner doesn't know what their chef cooks and what's good and what's not?

Would never come here again."}
{"text":"New Pho restaurant in SW
on rainbow and windmill. Same plaza where Smith's is located.
The restaurant is very very spacious, clean :)
The staff is awesome. As son we entered we were seated.
Had my favorite soup Meat balls Pho!
We also ordered some spring rolls with peanut sauce (very good) and some egg rolls (i didn't care much for the dressing, little plain to my taste)
Price is decent $8.99 for a bowl of Pho
I love their Chili spicy sauce to add in your Pho
Welcome in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Had to try this spot out since I heard Annie moved locations. Since the original Pho Annie was taken over by new management the food had noticeably gone south.  This place is just down the street from there in the Smith's parking lot. The interior decor is quite authentic Vietnamese, just how I like it. Ordered a bowl of filet mignon  pho and it was great. Can't wait to try out some rice plates and vermicelli bowls next time. One thing I noticed and should mention is the price increase. A large bowl of pho starts at $8.99. I still think its reasonable though and they have refillable sodas (instead of the can) which my bf can appreciate."}
{"text":"We came here after edc day 1 since we were super dead and needed some pho to help heal us. 

The menu ranges from pho, com tam, noodles and a few other dishes. I got the pho small size. It came out pretty quickly, considering they werent very busy since it was a warm day.  Pho was light and tasty.  I would come again since the restaurant was very clean, and service was kind."}
{"text":"Agree with previous reviews that service is really bad.  First, server said there was free wifi but then actually seemed upset when he asked me if I wanted the password. When he brought the shared appetizer plate for spring rolls, he didn't bother to bring plates.  I went to counter to ask for two small plates  I offered to wait but he insisted on bringing. He then brought us just one plate!  Asked for stir fried beef with rice. He then brought me chicken. When I pointed this out, he did not offer to replace it. Instead he just looked at me. Food wise, pretty mediocre. Fried spring rolls tasted like they were frozen and were cold. . Pad Thai was about the same as you get in a food court.  Please avoid this restaurant and use your hard earned dollars at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to this place. I used to love their pho and pho sate.. but now pho broth is so sweet. I mean not the sweetness from bones. It's actually tasted sugar sweet. 
And my favorite from here is no longer my favorite:( 
They used to served really good sate noodle. But now it's bland. I tried add fish sauce. It's just make it worst. The girls are nice tho."}
{"text":"Give me a dirty Vietnamese joint over this classy version any day!  

Pluses:
1) The white girl knows more Vietnamese than the Asian guy
2) They have the option of fresh noodles
3) If you need to drop a deuce, the bathrooms are clean
4) This is one of maybe two spots in Chinatown to go to for Vietnamese food in a clean environment

Minuses:
1) The broth is meh
2) The tendon chunks are huge and chewy (gross)
3) The che ba mau could use more coconut milk, it was quite watered down

Other Pho 88 spots are much better than this location, though none of them are as clean."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch one day during the workweek, and found this place gets really busy during lunch time. There were not enough seating for the huge flow of customers, and the people waiting in line to get seats were standing close to our table watching us eat - awkward!

Service is almost non-existent, as there is such a long wait to even just receive our drink orders, and even a longer wait for our food to come. There were 9 of us at the table, and only about half of the orders were given on the first batch. By the time the second batch of the orders came, the people who got their food first were almost done with their food.

We had to wave down servers many times to remind them that we are lacking napkins, forks, spoons, straws, etc.

Serving size is okay, food quality is pretty standard. After eating you have to stand in line to pay at the cash."}
{"text":"The pho was good, good broth. Not the best pho in Montréal but it's a decent spot. Had the 3 colour desert, it was still frozen..."}
{"text":"The rumors are true, Annie from Pho Annie is here! I invited my cousin and my brother to eat Pho 88 because I saw some reviews on Yelp that Annie was here. We went in Pho 88 on Saturday, June 10, 2017 around 8 p.m. As we went in, we were greeted and seated by one of the servers. After we sat, we saw Annie walking around. Annie was stunned she saw us. 

We ordered:
- Spring Rolls
- Pork Chop Rice Plate with egg
- Beef pho

After a couple of months of not eating Annie's recipe, we felt like we were in heaven! Her Pork Chop recipe was so good and has lots of flavors. The Spring Rolls was very delicious.

If you are in Vegas or around the area, eat here! This restaurant is brand new and everything is clean here. If you have a party of 10 or more, they have enough seats for parties."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Chinatown Pho 88 a longggg time ago. Then they started renovating and I suppose from there they have decided to market towards being a higher end of Pho? Their decor is really nice, however I don't care so much if the food was the same. Their prices are much higher and less in portion in my opinion. I ordered their Pho small special. Broth was not very hot. I also ordered fresh rolls with viet sausage ( my fave ) however they sliced them instead of putting a whole sausage which was quite stingy of them. Especially since I paid an extra $1.50 to sub for the pork. So I paid $6.25 for two fresh rolls which is really pricy. Will not be returning. Just not worth it to me."}
{"text":"While it's not the cleanest place, it's probably still the best Vietnamese restaurant in the area. I would love for someone to tell me this isn't so, and point me to a better one. I say it isn't the cleanest because we sat down at an empty table and that table had a bit of dried food stuck to it. I was then given a cutlery set in a napkin and the spoon had crusty rice stuck to it. Yeah. Not the coolest. 

We came last Saturday for dinner. Between the four of us, we got the spring roll platter ($12), pork chop rice ($10), P03 regular ($9.50) with an extra bowl of noodles ($2.95?). 

The spring roll platter came with 6 rolls: 2 fried shrimp, 2 cold shrimp, and 2 fried chicken. It also came with 3 sauces: nuoc cham (standard sweetened fish sauce), Thai chili, and sweet peanut hoisin. For $12, it was not bad for price. The 2 fried shrimp were smaller than the rest, but there was very discernible shrimp in it, along with some sort of taro mixture. The fried chicken is your typical Vietnamese fried spring roll. The two fried chicken rolls were cut into 3 pieces each, and the other ones were cut in half. It's a good platter for sharing, unless you're super into rolls. Then, it might make a nice dinner.

I can't remember the exact things in the P03, but I know it did include cooked flank. There wasn't that meat to noodle ratio was lower than I'd have expected, and the pieces of meat had some chewy pieces of tendon connected to it. I like tendon, but it has to be soft. 

I believe I asked them this the last time I was there as well, but pork chop with rice is $10, and pork chop with spring roll and rice is $9. The difference is that for the pork chop with rice, you get 2 pork chops. However, these pork chops are not very big and are fairly thin, so next time, I think I'd rather go with the pork chop with spring roll for the lower price. That being said, the pork chops were cooked quite nicely. The marinade is lemongrass and something sweet, and they grill them so they've got crispy edges. They also serve this dish with nuoc cham (that magical fish sauce again) and it goes wonderfully with the rice, green onions, and the assorted cold veggies on the plate. If only they didn't charge $1.75 for a fried egg on top...

Funny story. We asked for hot water. They got us a small pot for 3 people. We poured it into the glass cups they gave us for cold water because they didn't bring us anything else. When we asked a different server for more hot water, he asked us where our teacups went. Um...we didn't get any. Where else would they have gone?

I'll probably be back due to desperation, but like I said, I'd really like to find a better Vietnamese restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant with okay pho and chicken satay dishes. There are better pho and Thai places than this in the city."}
{"text":"We are one of Annie's original fans when she worked at Jenni Pho 6-7 years back. Her excellent service, above and beyond enthusiasm, and the ability to make her customers feel good is why we will be forever loyal. Her food at the original Pho Annie really combined the essence of Vietnamese/Chinese home cooking-elevated! We used to think it was only a nice substitution to China Town for its location, but now that Pho Saigon 8 is open, you can really tell the difference. Remember, PHO 88 is the NEW NAME. So excited for what's happening in the Southwest! I predicted (well hoped) that this area would be the new Asian food enclave. It's looking GOOD! Must try at the NEW Pho 88 aka Annie!! 
**Garlic chicken wings
**Egg wrapped fried rice
**Bun Thit Nuong Chai Gio-rice vermicelli salad with lots of fresh greens, marinated BBQ pork( flavored excellently) spring rolls, and Vietnamese dressing !
Everything is delicious! 

Wishing you lots of good business Annie!

{"text":"One of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown. The food is inexpensive but they don't cheap on quality. You get a lot for the money and it tastes delicious as well as authentic.

Their Pho bowls are very large and you'll probably have a large time finishing their XL size. Service is hit or miss but you shouldn't have much trouble on off-peak hours. They renovated the place and it looks much nicer than how it originally was.

Overall, a can't miss spot if you want to try out authentic Vietnamese food in the heart of Chinatown."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic pho! Nice modern ambiance instead of usually dreary mom and pop shops. Broth was superb(no msg effect)and they offer fresh noodles bonus! Staff are attentive and nice selection of dishes."}
{"text":"This place was a last minute choice after an evening of tequlia drinking, so my memory may be a little cloudy (but I doubt it).

Ordered the Vietnemese Vermicelli Chicken.  I can't remember what my table mates order (perhaps a side effect from the tequila).  Anyway, food was served quickly and I enjoyed my dish, I do seem to recall my friends enjoying their dishes too.  

The food was tasty enough, but not quite the authentic experience I was hoping for. The restaurant is clean and fairly modern when compared to other spots on the Spadina strip.  The service was fast, friendly and above all cheap! The bill for all three of us was $26 and change.

I should mention that they have an ok sized menu with several Vietnamese and Thai options, as well as some fusion dishes as well.  

I wouldn't not recommend this place, but it certainly wouldn't make my list of favourite Spadina haunts."}
{"text":"The decor in this restaurant is  quite trendy, blending in with the feeling of Shops at Don Mills. Pricing is slightly more than that of its sister restaurants and the traditional pot of tea is an extra that needs to be purchased on the side. The pho soup stock has a pleasant beef flavour and the noodles are cooked just right, but at the same time has a overly strong amount of MSG, even when compared to the other 88's. Pho is served in two formats small (8\" bowl) and regular ( 11\" bowl) . Service is quite prompt and polite."}
{"text":"Protip: They serve Vegan Pho!!

As you can tell from all of the other reviews, Annie is back!!

Tucked inside the plaza anchored by Smith's, the corner of the plaza has many good eats.  Gelatology, Doh, and Serenade are all in the same corner.  But I digress, we are here to talk PHO!  

Oh how I have missed this pho.  The broth is so flavorful.  I always get the Pho Dac Biet.  There is also ample amounts of meat in the pho.  I hate it when some places give you a tiny bit of meat.  My mouth is watering as I write this review.  I may just have to go out and get myself a bowl after work!!  

If you've never been to the old Pho Annie, definitely stop in and give this place a try.  You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"This is a really busy place during weekday lunch hours and they only have 2-3 people working. If I needed someone I walked up to the guy instead of waiting for them to come to us. My friend actually accidentally bit into the green chili pepper and I ran up to a server to rush order a mango smoothie and it came in less than a minute! So thank you for their quick accommodation. I'm giving a three star because I didn't like my vermicelli meal it was really al denté which is not how I want to eat it! They do have fresh pho noodles so if I try that next time I'll probably have a better rating as most places don't offer fresh noodles. The decor is very nice and furniture has a modern pho feel."}
{"text":"I have been to many, many, many different pho places. This was by far the BEST PHO I have had. The meats were of a higher quality, and the broth was not over-salted like most other pho restaurants. The portion size was also very generous and the presentation was on point. You can tell there is love put into the food you're being served.

Service was also great."}
{"text":"I got the Special pho in a regular size. Lots of noodles but barely any meat. I feel like i got ripped off because after the first few bites, I ate plain noodles. At least the noodles were good. But for $10 You ate better off eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnemese places I've found so far in Montreal.  Location is not great right on the Decarie, but it's worth finding a parking spot for the food inside!  Good service and fast as well."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Friendly owner! Great food! I enjoy the chicken pho with chicken broth!  Annie will always have my business!!!"}
{"text":"A really good pho restaurant in the SW area. This is a new restaurant by the same owner that used to own Annie's Pho just down the road. This place is bigger and has a better open set up. Love the pho here because their broth is tasty, but not too salty. I usually get the combination special. Their portion is big and they're generous with their meats. Their hu tieu (pork based broth noodle soup) is also delicious. Service is also fast and friendly! Delivery is available through Door Dash."}
{"text":"NEW WAY TO PHO; WORTH A TRY

From the logo stamped, raw wooden entrance to the naturally aged wooden furniture and the use of natural concrete, metal and stone composing the dining area, Pho 88 on Don Mills is a calming way to experience Pho.

You are warmly greeted by their friendly staff and have several options for seating from 7-8 seater booths, 2-4 seater tables along the side, and communal 8-10 seater picnic style benches. 

The menu is easy to navigate as everything is categorized and simple with choice.

I ordered the P01 Pho Special. There are two sizes to choose from so choose according to your appetite. The soup was properly proportioned, easy to eat and enjoyable. The broth was good, but will rate secondary against others where a more savoury experience was present.

Notice mention share dishes: 
Basil Chicken Fried Rice, Crispy Noodles served with veggies and chicken, and an assorted spring roll platter

Dishes are cleanly presented in design that compliment the clean industrial decor. The restaurant executes a visual plan that leaves you feeling relaxed with its use of long leading lines that draw you to stalwart areas; the bar, ceiling lights and high wall decoration.

Whether you are there for a sunlit afternoon with family, or a dinner get together with group of friends, Pho 88 on Don Mills is a safe choice for a comforting dining experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the most worse soup ... (pho) which they so call it . 

Full of salt , and noodles more than meat. 

Ordered bubble tea : worst worst... loaded with sugar."}
{"text":"Their Pad Thai chicken is $9.99. Its large enough for three to four people which I think is a great deal. It's so good. You can smell a bit of fish sauce in it but the taste is great. The chicken taste great. There's bits of peanuts and it adds crunch to it.

Their chicken fried rice is good enough for like five people. So much food for $9.99. I think it's needs more soy sauce because the meat is overwhelming. Other than that, it's good. Basic fried rice.

The spring roll is good for four people. It's $5.99. There's a hint of mint in it that you notice right away is there and stays in your mouth but not that powerful where you're like eating toothpaste. It's good. More vegetables than there is shrimp. 

The Special 88 Beef noodle soup for $9.99 is good. The beef is nice and thin but has some weird texture after you chew on it. The broth is good - it's a bit sweet. The noodle is a bit hard as if it hasn't been cooked long enough which is good because I don't like my noodles to be soggy and soft. 

The service was pretty good. They were quick and nice. They came often to fill up our water. They were also attentive.

I would definitely come back here again for the pad Thai and the pho."}
{"text":"Surprised at the reviews here, nothing but positive experiences here, great food, value, and service. I come here biweekly"}
{"text":"It's 41 degrees out and I could feed a cold like symptom brewing through out my body the entire day. So what do we do? We wait half hour before closing to finally come in for our pho fix lol! Stoked that they still allowed us to dine in since we called a few other places prior to coming here and they said it'd have to be take out instead. 

With it being like a freezer outside right now I'm happy to be in a nice, clean, and simple room. (We're from Hawaii people we don't enjoy being this cold haha!) Our server was very attentive and came by periodically to make sure our waters were filled and to ask if we needed anything. Broth and noodles were both yummy! It would be great if they offered different bowl sizes as I and I'm sure many others small eaters wouldn't be able to finish the size bowl they offer. But it's a great price for it not gonna lie."}
{"text":"Good pho,  good egg rolls.  Just wish they served mint and carrots with the egg rolls like other pho places."}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open.
I ordered #17 rare steak and brisket pho.
The noodles were inconsistent, some thick and flat others thin. I was confused.
Also was asked twice if I needed a fork, while I was using chopsticks... 
did they think I was using chopsticks wrong or something? 
The broth was okay, not the best or the worst. 
Service was good, never had empty water. 
Biggest issue was halfway through eating a strong smell of sewage leaked into the restaurant and I had to push away my bowl and rush paying to get out of the bad smell. 
Saw staff members spraying the place to try to get rid of the smell so idk what's going on with the building.
May not be their fault.
I honestly would have gave 4 stars if it wasn't for the inconsistent and confusing noodles I got in my pho. 
I always have received rice noodles that were thin. I have never had 2-3 different noodle types in my pho.




Idk if I'll be back..."}
{"text":"There are so many Vietnamese places in Toronto that I would say it's quite tough. I quite like the location of this one, lots of parking, really spacious, does not look like Vietnamese restaurant at all. That's a good thing. Décor is modern, lots of aisle space. Not there busiest though, so when a wave of activity (new people, people checking out, orders needing to be filled), they struggle a bit too keep up cause they aren't staffed enough.

The food, like I said a lot of comparables in Toronto and this one, falls short just a bit. The meat to noodle ratio is a bit off with too much noodle and not enough meat in the large pho.

The spring roll platter was alright, there are three sauces and I think a restaurant a bit more refined would make sure to say what they are and which goes best. I didn't feel the filing combinations were fabulous.

Otherwise, good location with good space."}
{"text":"Annie! She delivers excellent service and delicious food. New restaurant is big and spacious. And clean! Glad she is only down the street!"}
{"text":"Nothing special in this restaurant.  Food is average and some dishes can made at home."}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese food in Vegas (a welcome surprise!), and SUPER FAST. 

We came here to get some hot soup on a cold day, and this hit the spot. The restaurant, which has loads of seating, is located in a nice shopping plaza with other restaurants and cafes, and has plenty of parking. 

We were immediately seated, and they took our order pretty much immediately. We ordered the Pho ga (chicken pho), chicken curry noodle soup, and the vermicelli with egg roll and pork. Everything was tasty, with huge portions and plenty of herbs and bean sprouts on the side. We also ordered Thai Tea and Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk (good and strong, just what we needed).  Everything came out in about 5 minutes, which is insane and perfect, given that we were dining with our infant daughter asleep in the stroller (AKA ticking time bomb of screaming). Service was friendly and super prompt. Overall, enjoyable meal and very much recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was open late (and was one of the only places open on Spadina so late) when I needed some soup because I was feeling sick and just didn't want any other kind of food. The staff were super nice and the pho was  delicious. I will totally be back! The staff really made my day... Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The place has very nice service and the waiters are attentive and nice. But the pho tastes like they added hoisin sauce already in it which isn't bad but I hate hoisin sauce and kinda ruined the food for me."}
{"text":"Good food, very tasty servers could smile and chat a bit more but great restaurant, very good pad Thai and soup broth"}
{"text":"Can't help but wonder how long until somebody sues them for most likely the world's slipperiest floor, ever. They should rent out ice skates at the entrance, might be a better alternative to the tile that they laid. The first time I went to Pho 88, I enjoyed it. Tonight I got an almost $12 meal, with very likely the worst cuts of chicken I've ever seen, they charge quite a bit for maybe a quarter of a chicken breast, including gristle skin and bone. Lazy kitchen, awful experience. Enough to not make me want to return."}
{"text":"It's an okay place, but probably my least favourite Pho 88 location. In comparison to its other locations, this one is pricier, has smaller portions, (I can probably stop naming things now), though it is remarkably nicer (dining area and washrooms). Their washrooms are pretty to look at and clean, which I couldn't say about any other Pho 88. If that's a compromise you're willing to make, go try it."}
{"text":"If I'm ever I  the area again, I'll be coming back for sure. I enjoyed the vermicelli noodles with grilled shrimp and it exceeded my expectations. Very flavorful and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Really great food. I go back often for lunches and supper. Fresh and tasty food, presented by friendly and attentive staff. There's really nothing not to like and I've never been disappointed. I'm posting some pics of the dishes."}
{"text":"The restaurant recently renovated. It's easily the nicest looking restaurant in Chinatown. It certainly looks out of place. The prices remain the same, so it's a cheap place to get Pho. They now sell a lot of appetizers that are quite good also."}
{"text":"I thought this was brand new because it was so clean.  I was very comfortable eating here.  The food is very good, too.  Had spriing rolls, egg rolls and curry chicken pho.  Now my favorite place for pho in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I love vietnamese food!  It's always flavourful and filling! I've only gone to two places so far in Toronto. This ranks second and I fear it will slip if i try another restaurant.  Ok, I don't fear - I just know.

I will say this, wowzers! When you order, be prepared to eat really soon!  Just like everyone else said, they are fast.  I would almost venture to say just as quick as fast food.   

Now, you must be asking yourself, 'what did she not like?\"   I have this terrible addiction to food especially a dish in particular...vermicelli noodles with spring rolls and either charbroiled chicken or pork. Oh, heaven!

This was a first for me.  I didn't inhale my dish.  Even so-so versions of this I inhale. (I know, too much info, eh?)  But the texture of the spring roll and the mixture itself was nothing I have ever had. It was potate-y, non meat based (which is fine but this one was so off) and well, bland and mushy.  This is not typical fare. Spring rolls vegetarian or not are crisp and zesty.  The accompaniment was so-so as well but that totally put me off.

On the plus side, the place is clean and modern. The bathroom was so clean and you don't have to go into the basement!!!  Probably the most exciting part.

There's so many places to choose from and this by far is one of the shinest to choose from but don't forget to try those hole in a walls because I promise you they will surprise your flavour palette"}
{"text":"Surprisingly an OK choice for the Spadina strip. 

It certainly wouldn't be my first pick for a quick meal in the area, but it did the trick when we were desperate for a late night meal to absorb some of the tequila poisoning my blood.

Service was ok, food came out fast and it was pretty tasty. I had the bun bo (stir fried beef with vermicelli bowl). The menu is the typical \"Viet-Thai\" fusion so you can get pho, bun, com (rice) dishes as well as Thai curries and mango salads.

Pho 88 has a clean interior with modern renovations, so it's a good option for people who are afraid of the divey gems that can be found in Chinatown. I generally prefer the more divey places with authentic food."}
{"text":"This is pretty much the most incredible Pho restaurant I've ever had in Vegas or anywhere else for that matter. Very clean and professional, courteous workers. Well worth the 18 minute drive from our house. Nice date night with hunny"}
{"text":"Annie's back with her new Pho 88 place that just recently opened. I really liked her food and the serving size is just reasonable for the price. If you're craving for some Vietnamese cuisine better put this on your list of restaurants to visit."}
{"text":"This place has been excellent. I ate three times already. It is my new favorite place. Service is very good. My water was filled constantly. The place is clean and the owner is pleasant. I have tried the short ribs, the rare steak pho. The diced steak. Everything is tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Simple decor, clean and decent food for the price 
Good for quick lunch
I had hot and sour soup, flavour is good, not too hot but it's easily fixable"}
{"text":"When I walked in the first thing I thought of was, \"wow it's super clean here.\" We were seated and the prices are a little more than other pho places but it's worth it with the quality of food and service. 

SERVICE IS THE BEES NEEzzzzz. 
Theyre super attentive and pay attention to their customers. (They refilled our drinks more than once, say whaaaaat ?!). I asked for over easy eggs and they said one of my yolks cracked and even when I said it's okay, the cook remade me two eggs  good looking out, yo girl loves yolky eggs. 

The amount of food and taste of the food is great. Everything I want in a pho restaurant. 
I'll continue to come here for clean bathrooms, the best hangover food, and great service!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Vietnamese restaurant! I am so glad we don't have to drive to China town for some authentic Pho and fresh vietnamese spring roll. You have to try their beef stew pho. It was ahhhhmazing!!! The beef was so tender and the soup was super flavorful. I really enjoyed their pork chop rice dish and fresh spring roll. The portions were enough for 2 people to share. The restaurant was clean and staff was friendly. I'll always come back here whenver I am craving for some Vietnamese food goodness"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly. The food was decent. There were too many flies at the table to want to return."}
{"text":"The owner of this place was also the owner of Pho Annie down the street and I did not like their Pho at all but a friend wanted to eat here so here we came. I usually go to Jenni Pho across the street if I don't want to drive all the way to Spring Mountain lol but I must say that I actually like this Pho better than Jenni. So Kudos. My new go to spot for pho."}
{"text":"Located at the Smith's lot on Rainbow & Windmill. The food is good, not my fave, but a decent Vietnamese spot. HUGE & GENEROUS portions, well worth the money. I ordered the Rare Filet Mignon pho w/ vegetables it was okay, good flavor, with generous amounts of good quality meats (4/5 stars), Pho 88 fried rice was pretty tasty, I ordered it with chicken & they give lots of chicken as well (4/5). The pad Thai presentation was very impressive, but it was dry & lacked flavor. I'm a huge pad Thai fan but I'd give it a 3/5. The best thing we ordered was the fried chicken appetizer, roughly 10-12 wings per portion & it was fabulous. Lots of flavor & hands down a 5/5. Thai tea was so-so, nothing too special 3/5 & the Vietnamese iced coffee, not a fan at all. It was definitely watered down, overly sweet, and lacked the coffee flavor, 2/5 stars. Lastly, staff was present & the restaurant is huge with lots of room, great for big groups."}
{"text":"Very crowdy during the lunch time. Choose other eating hours, otherwise you will have to share your table with strangers. 
Good food. Amazing asian fragrances. Look for the best recipes on the wall board.  
The fried ice cream is mandatory. The service could be better, the waitreses are always in a hurry and don't have time to explain the menu. The prices are really good for the portions the offer."}
{"text":"My staple restaurant for Pho. I've been loyal to this place for almost 4 years (Chinatown location).

Food - 

I love Pho. Pho Tai and Vegetarian Pho are two of my biggest loves. If you love Pho as much as I do you'll enjoy this place, too :)

Tip -
Make sure to ask for \"fresh noodles\" in your Pho for ultimate Pho experience.

Drink - 
Love tea with taro and tapioca."}
{"text":"Came across Pho 88 because the initial restaurant we wanted to eat at had a 30 minute to 1 hour wait....serendipity af...now I'm a fan..Yay!

Service:  Very friendly staff that got us seated immediately with smiles.  The servers kept my diet Cokes fresh and I worked my way through the food.  The kitchen got our food to us quickly and was prepped well.

Pho & then some: Dining with my God-daughter, parents and bros ensures we get to try a lot dishes.  I had the #12 otherwise known as the Special 88 Beef Noodle Soup Pho Dac Biet.  Great broth that compliments the tasty noodles and beef.  Lots of noodles and beef ensured it would be hard to finish this tasty bowl of Pho. Great stuff
The pork chops with egg was very good.  Cooked and seasoned well and the eggs complimented the flavor  
The egg rolls were as good as you'd find in any Pho joint but the chicken wings were my favorite non-pho dish. Lots of flavor and you got a lot of wings for the order.  Great value in price and flavor and something I'll have again.

Ambiance:  Green walls and contemporary lighting make for a bright and pleasant dining area in a very large open area.  Red Asian decorations, and art line the wall and floor plants throughout the room.  There are lots of tables and chairs in the center with big booths along the wall.  I don't think there'd be an issue with a wait even on the busiest of nights with this much seating and quick service.

Pho 88 just became my favorite casual Pho restaurant on the Southwest side of town.  I love the fact that even the non-Pho dishes were great along with the Pho to give me more options when visit.  You're getting some very flavorful Vietnamese food for a very fair price.  I wasn't planning a dinner here that night, but this was meant to be. hehe  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful. Reasonable, great food, very attentive staff.  Best Vietnamese food that I have found outside of Chinatown.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We gave it a shot, after reading the mixed reviews. Yes, I saw one fly and fruit fly, but didn't bother us or stick around. I got the #41 Pork, rice and egg - it was really good. Lot of food and a good value. He had the beef pho which was also really good. Space was open and clean. Would def go back."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much and wasn't surprised by this less than mediocre 'pho' chain. We came around 7pm and we were the only other patrons in the restaurant. They gave us a jug of cold water. I asked for hot tea and she said it was extra. First time I've been to a pho place and they didn't offer complimentary hot tea during a cold day. 

The menu had only about 7 options of pho noodles which is pretty ridiculous if you call yourself a pho restaurant. I ordered the dac biet in small. It was pretty pricy for such a small portion. The beef was very chewy and the bowl consisted mostly of noodles. My boyfriend ordered the pad thai since he remembered the Pho 88 downtown was okay years ago. It tasted like ketchup with lime to me. 

Wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommend! The only plus is that this place is nicely decorated. But that is likely the reason why it was so overpriced for crappy food."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 1-star ratings but unfortunately this restaurant was calling for one. I'm not sure if this is even a Vietnamese restaurant even though the title is \"Pho\" 88. None of the staff in this restaurant was able to speak Vietnamese - only Chinese. Really? The pho bowls looked horrible. 

For someone who lives in a small city (Windsor, ON) even the local pho restaurant here is better than what Pho 88 has to offer. Disgusting - really. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Annie (used to be the owner of Pho Annie) is back under the new restaurant name Pho 88. She is thankful for all her loyal customers and it's by word of mouth that her business flourishes. Huge portions and reasonable prices. The new place is much bigger and better. She said that she wants the customers to be happy and full."}
{"text":"Pho was good, decent. Nothing amazing. Beef was very fatty. I like mine more lean. Ordered fried chicken wonton as well. Wasn't great. Service was meh. Waitresses are grannies who do not look like they wanna be there. A/C was on blasting too and it was freezing rain outside. When I got to the cash to pay, the lady was taking forever to open a bottle of wine and I asked if I could pay after 3 minutes of having to watch her battle with the wine cork and she told me \"I'm busy\". Would not return."}
{"text":"Pho 88 is probably the most popular vietnamese food chain in Toronto.  I've been to this location twice, and ordered pho both times.  I usually frequent the Markham locations and I couldn't find much difference between them.

The pho here is excellent.  Almost just as good as the Markham locations.  The soup is tasty, the beef is thinly sliced and easy to eat, the noodles were cooked perfect.  

Parking is free which is advertised on the outside as you drive along Spadina (you'll get a card to stamp which gives you about 1.5 hours of free parking).  The parking garage is kind of ghetto ... so I recommend bringing a friend so you won't be scared."}
{"text":"This place is just phenomenal! Price, quality of food and service are great all the time! I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has consistently good food and service, and a great lunch special for under 10 dollars that gives you a small pho, drink and spring rolls!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very affordable, and some of the best broth ever. I recommend the rare steak, came out so quickly!"}
{"text":"The Pho was good. Tried both beef and chicken options, vegetables were fresh and a good addition. Service was quick and attentive. Pot stickers were delicious. Would recommend to others and eat here again."}
{"text":"1.5 star
I've only had pho here. Pho here is ok, not exceptional. I've previously been here 2-3 times because it has nice ambience. But I know I won't be going back because my boyfriend found hair in his pho....... tangled within a piece of beef. We called the waiter over, he didn't apologize, instead just offered another bowl. We didn't want to make a scene or anything so we just got a second bowl. No discount or anything, either. I will be reminded of seeing my boyfriend pulling that hair out of his food every time someone mentions Pho 88, meaning I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. No one greets you. Not even sure if I was to seat myself, so I waited for 10mins just to told where to sit finally. Had to be seated at the bar coz the tables were littered with dirty dishes, personal items (staff purses, keys, & used cups) scattered across the back of the bar. Instead of clearing away the dirty dishes, they stacked it up on one of the tables. They had 2 wait staff and didn't know who was covering which tables or maybe they just shared all their tables, which made for confusing service as they didn't know if orders were taken or not (as was the case with me!) and none was clearing tables even as more customers were coming through! 
Really didn't want to tip as truthfully, there was no service whatsoever, plus I waited for 15mins only to discover that my order didn't go through, and the waitstaff that took my order just went back to the one guy who seemed to be the only one allowed to punch in the orders and screamed my order at him. So from here on, another 10min wait with no apologies for not even putting in my order in the first place! Would've walked out if I wasn't so hungry already. Walked in at 1:15pm, didn't get food till 1:50pm. 
Pretty disappointed with the Pho88 chains now. Used to love the ones in Sauga. No more...done with Pho88s."}
{"text":"The fam wanted Pho this week and we decided to try this place.  

My daughter and I both ordered the Pho dac biet and it did not disappoint. Soup came out piping hot and the flavor was perfectly balanced without the extra oily taste.  Added the veggies and it was off to the races with plenty of meats and noodles to fill us up.

Wife ordered Pho Ga and she was a little disappointed with the skimpy chicken portion - I agree (my opinion matters)

Kids ordered the Pho tai and again it was jam packed. Fully loaded with noodles and meat. 

Spring roll was on point
Egg rolls were delish and super hot - of course!

Definitely coming back and this time I am gonna try the vermicelli dry noodles - bun thit nuong. oooooooooww"}
{"text":"Beef combo Phô was good. Restaurant was spacious, bright, and clean. I found the broth to be flavorful and traditional. Service was so so but still just fine. Would recommend for a quick bowl of good Phô."}
{"text":"Always great quality & friendly staff! We love the Pho (#13) & #54 Virmicelli noodle bowl!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few days ago with my family and the Pho here was amazing. I love the Pad Thai here.  Annie came to talk to us and said she was the original owner at Pho Annie. There's a lot more space & parking over here. She was very kind and offered all of us free drinks on the house. I highly recommend this place & I would definitely come again!!:-)"}
{"text":"Right behind our house and we love it!! drove a long 8 hrs from northern cali and this satisfied our big family for our arrival dinner. Great quality, prices, and fills you up without feeling like it's heavy. We like the #12 & #13 with spring rolls and egg rolls. Ordered to-go so that our family can eat comfortably at home. The food was well packaged and easy for us to put together for dinner."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday, the decor is nice. The food however...my friend ordered the bun bo hue, myself and another friend got the 88 special. I asked for meat on the side (which is normal and means the raw beef on the side), but instead got ALL the meat including tripe on the side. That was fine, but my friend's bun bo hue had a hair in it and they promptly had to apologize and replace it. The meals themselves were bland and seemed to be teeming with M.S.G. We finished our meals and now realize that we all had bowel problems the next day. WHAT THE F%$#!"}
{"text":"Literally just two thin slices of beef with my special. No meatballs either. And soup was leaking from the bowl all onto the table."}
{"text":"Got the regular pho. It was ok. Kinda salty. Saltiness overpowers the flavour. Portion is also kind of small compared to other pho places and also slightly more expensive. They don't give a lot of beef or noodles. I would only come again if we didn't feel like travelling far."}
{"text":"Pho broth was 'watered\" down with really no flavor and the rice noodles were way over cooked I ordered the brisket and tendon. It was like the old Wendy's  Commercials where the old  grandma  asks \" Where's the Beef!?\"

Customer service was poor. Menu, utensils and check thrown down on the table. This has to be one of the worst viet noodle experiences in many years!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and the food has been decent.  I prefer their satay soup base over many of the other pho restaurants.  However over the last few visits, I've notice the quality on the decline and I've never been a fan of the seating.  Hardwood benches don't give you an inviting feel to the place."}
{"text":"My very first experience on vietnamese food. They offer free tea, decent prices and good service.  Food was spicy as I expected and absolutely great. I can't way to come bac and try different things from the menu. A portion serves two. 

Broth/Soup and noodles came pretty fast, and not-so-standard dishes took around 10-15 minutes to prepare. 

Pretty easy to find (the 510 Spadina streetcar leaves you right in front of it) even for someone like me, who had arrived in the city just one week before."}
{"text":"I had read and subsequently forgotten that this is the new restaurant from the owners of Pho Annie. That was quickly remedied when I saw the server and realized, \"Oh remember that guy from Pho Annie? Wait, they're all from Pho Annie.\"

I ordered my typical BBH (Bun Bo Hue). Certainly not the best I've had, but by the time I reached the bottom of the bowl, I concluded that I really enjoyed it. The broth had a definite fish sauce aroma at first. Fortunately, that didn't translate into being too salty. The one thing I usually don't enjoy about BBH is that the noodles are larger and more slippery. Pho 88's BBH noodles were easy to pick up and slurp.

So my quick review is that if you enjoyed Pho Annie, you'll enjoy Pho 88. The advantage is that this location is much bigger and more open. (Annie used to get pretty full)."}
{"text":"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 stars - reason being the price - lunch for 2 people was $32 plus tip.

We had 1 small pho, 1 vermicelli, and 2 Vietnam expresso coffee.

Pho and Coffee for a quick lunch should not cost that much.

Food was regular 3 stars.. maybe 2.8 stars 

Coffee was pretty strong.. 

Can't think of any reason to return apart from it being convenient for me."}
{"text":"I guess maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I didn't really enjoy my pho as much as I did at the old Annie's.  I feel like they are no longer the best pho in town.  Broth was cloudy and too bland today.  Not impressed by my super wilted basil and moldy lime.  The steak was good quality though, and did seem like the filet mignon advertised.  Egg rolls tasted a little old.  I'll probably give them another try sometime, but Red Lantern seems to be outdoing them these days both on taste and value, and is about the same distance from my house."}
{"text":"The pho was good but I feel like there was too less beef in the pho. Overall good experience and good price"}
{"text":"Pho broth was delicious! I didn't feel like I needed to add any other condiments to make it tasty. Great, quick service. Very clean. Large booths and very spacious restaurant overall."}
{"text":"I order Shrimp Fried Rice and grilled Pork to go two order each when we arrived home the Shrimp Fried rice did not even look like they were for two orders just wondering what happen to this place used to be very good when it comes to order to go this time me and the wife felt like we were cheated on our order the pork grilled instead of getting two boxes the lady cashier told me they put them together reason we order two that means we need it separated. Are they saving box or service is deteriorating normally I give this place good review this time two Star. What happen? Calling Annie what is going on?"}
{"text":"So sad. The food is good but the service and the crew are terrible. They should hire people who has patient to people. Not coming back anymore. This restaurant sooner or later is going to close. Bye."}
{"text":"My first time eating at the Pho 88.  The place is very clean and service is excellent.  The Pho soup base is little off but not bad.  The soft tendon is little too tough.  Over all pretty good experience, but need little improvement on the Pho soup base and soft tendon needs to be softer."}
{"text":"My favourite place for pho in the city so far but that could change anytime as I'm addicted to the stuff like crack. 
This is the best 88 location in my opinion and the prices are cheaper here than in North York. 
There's not much to it, its cheap and satisfying and the decor is surprisingly nice!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan.  Every since Pho Annie changed owners, it seems the owner opened up this place and took her cook with her.

In Vegas, it's really hard to find a decent Pho place (District One Oxtail Pho is probably my favorite but it's hard to justify $14 a bowl for more than a special occasion).  

You're not really coming here for the ambiance, or service.  You're coming here for a pho fix.  It's definitely not the best I've ever had, but for the proximity to my place, the price, and the quantity, it's hard to find better. 

I haven't tried their other offerings (rice dishes) except their pad thai.  Don't get pad thai at a Viet restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to try some Pho while in Vegas, Pho 88 was the spot.  I am glad we did, it was very good.  Service was very quick, staff is very friendly as well.  Got the spicy Beef Soup (one draw back here was they did not give the mint and basil leaves). I would have given five stars if those were included, not sure if maybe they don't serve it, but traditionally that is what I am used to and what makes the soup, but all in all very good.  Also got Vermicelli noodles with egg roll, always a favorite.

Tried something I had never had before Che Ba Mau (Three color dessert with agar agar, beans, condensed milk and ice) different, but it was very tasty and a nice cool treat in the Vegas heat.

The price here is typical of a Pho place, most dishes under $10.00, I would recommend this spot and would come back again.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went to Pho 88 after a day at the Toronto Ex. Pho 88 is a nicely decorated Vietnamese restaurant. The service was friendly, but rushed. The restaurant was half full on Saturday night.

I ordered the grilled beef and pork with rice. My friend ordered pork and chicken with rice. We started with the fried spring rolls.

The spring rolls was okay. It was full of peanuts. Not much flavor. My beef pork rice dish was good. But I only wish the pork chop was larger. It was tasty and full of flavor.

My friend was happy with his chicken pork rice dish. He said that it was tasty.

Would we go back? Maybe, since we like Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This place is very clean, the food was fresh and tasted great! Great value and affordable place to have a nice dinner... we had Two entrées, an appetizer and two specialty drinks and all for under $40. The service was friendly and fast.  This is a great place! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The owner Annie is super sweet. There's usually never a wait and they get your food out pretty fast. Everyone here is nice in terms of service. Very clean facility. I always take my family here and they all love it. Perfect place to go in cold or rainy weather pho season"}
{"text":"This pho joint is the newest addition to a Don Mills strip plaza that also houses two Chinese restaurants as well as an odd-one-out Italian eatery. Decor is the most hip of the Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to, but the tradeoff is smaller portions and higher prices. We ordered the house special pho and a porkchop chicken rice dish - tea is extra. Tastewise, the fare will satisfy your Vietnamese cravings but you won't find pho served in a bowl large enough to bathe an infant in and we all know that that's a marker of a true Viet resto!"}
{"text":"3.5 ! Needed to eat after bootcamp and Pho88 was just behind Fitness Connection. The restaurant is fairly new looking & looked beautiful inside w/ its high ceilings and stunning bar area. 

I ordered the Grilled chicken & spring rolls vermicelli. First I was quite impressed with the chicken. There was actually a decent amount. I've been to some pho places that only give half the amount. The spring roll was nice and crunchy. The noodles were nice and thin. My fav kind! The portion for myself was great! But I know if my hubby ordered it, the meal would not be enough for him. The only con is, the price is slightly higher than what I'm used to. $9. But that's ok. There was a decent amount of chicken & the restaurant was very nice and clean. 

Service was great. The waiter was always there & also changed our water jug without us having to ask. There were many patrons that evening & I was surprised the waiter had time for all of us. The food also came out quickly. 

Lots of parking"}
{"text":"And if I could I would give them 1 million stars. Amazing place. Great atmosphere and super clean. You can see the kitchen from where we were sitting and everyone was washing their hands regularly, might be weird to you but I do watch that. The hospitality here is exceptional. Everyone is nice happy and positive. Food is clean and the quality of the meat is not what you get in most Asian restaurants, very high end quality indeed. I definitely will be a returning client especially that I live pretty close by.
Highly recommend it if you like good food and great customer service without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"My son loves pho so I try most places I can. The noodles here are great!  It has everything you would expect from a pho restaurant, and the speed of service is right on time so add Pho 88 to my stop of restaurant I frequent the place is super clean witch is nice I ordered the rare steak and my son the chicken both were 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a sate rare beef and chicken pho soup with extra meat and spring rolls ( deep fried chicken and shrimp). Everything was amazing! so flavourful  I was sceptical with the reviews. But really happy I didn't listen. I will definitely order again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We came here last night for dinner.  Customer service is superb here.  One of the best for Asian restaurants.  

We ordered:  

Spring rolls
2 Pho Specials
Vietnamese Ice Coffee

Everything was decent.  Spring rolls was great, nice portions.  We tend to eat with nuoc mau dip instead of the actual dip for this dish because I'm allergic to peanuts.  The nuoc mau is very sweet.  This must be a thing in Las Vegas.  I think cutting down on sugar and adding fresh lime juice would be great.  Pho broth was good, it's flavorful...but on the sweet side which is a little weird.  It could only be two things, sugar or a lot of MSG.  I don't remember my parents ever adding sugar to pho.  So I'm lending towards MSG, I could be wrong.  Both isn't so great.  I personally don't like sweet in my entrees.  Vietnamese Ice Coffee was very tasty, but again it's on the too sweet side.  I would give them a 5 stars if these little tips are fixed.  =P 

We really enjoy the big, quiet environment here.  It's not too far from our place.  Service is great.  We'll come back to try other things, hopefully it won't be on the sweet side."}
{"text":"So excited they finally opened!! These are the same owners as Pho Annie before. There new place has so much more space. Worth the drive of the extra block for some good Pho. 

We order the #13 Rare Steak Pho. So good!! Also get the chicken wing. For sure a must!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch with two other coworkers. We ordered one dish each and somehow that was one too many to remember. Never got my food.

It's embarrassing sitting there talking while your coworkers are eating.

Never returning again. My server was the same Asian lady the other one star reviews are pointing out."}
{"text":"Try the grill pork rice plate, come with sauce and soup, and 2 eggs on top , pork taste every good.. place is very spacious too, will sure come back and try other stuff.."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after reading that the original owner of Pho Annie opened this place. Came here for take out. Ordered the rare steak pho and pork chops. Both were great.Both dishes were very satisfying.I  like the fact that the pork chop meal comes with a side of soup which is a plus because sometimes all I want is the broth rather than the whole package. Anyways everything was so flavorful and the pho broth was just right. Not too salty nor did it have an overpowering taste or star anis like some broths do. Our go to pho spot is usually Pho Kim Long in China town which we have going to for years but I think we found a new spot and being that it is way closer to our house it is definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"I seriously don't know what I did to this woman but I had the worst service I've ever received since I started frequenting this place after my friend introduced me to this restaurant. I know the owners are not Yelpers much based on no responses from other negative reviews but here goes.

I walked in to have lunch before I did my errands and the restaurant had 4 other tables. One a group of 4 Vietnamese, 2 Filipinos, a Vietnamese couple with their less than 1 year old child and a solo Asian man whose background I could not discern.

She seemed perturbed that I interrupted her meal while there were other tables in the middle of getting their meals. 

As she sat me, she literally threw the fork on the table on top of the napkin that she placed before the fork. I know the difference between placing silverware down gently on the table, rushing to finish setting and throwing it down. She threw it down. I DID NOT EVEN ASK FOR A FORK!! Previous servers who have waited on my table never even did this to me before. 

As she shuffled away from my booth in her house slippers to check her other tables her attitude did a whole 180 turn around. She went to the group of 4 Vietnamese customers and she started talking to them and laughing with them. Even joking and smiling. She then went to the table with Vietnamese couple wth a baby and she started cooing at the baby. Then she returns to my table and asks what I want. I placed my order and said I'll keep the menu since I was still debating about dessert..

When she dropped the duck noodle soup I ordered I had to force myself to eat it because I did not want to walk out. Definitely not the best way to start my day. As the Filipino couple left, she said her goodbyes and even said \"salamat!\" ..... really?

She basically ignored me throughout my meal and even sat 2 more tables and got their food or before"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were regulars at Annie pho, but once we heard it was run by new owners, everything wasn't the same. We were so sad because Annie Pho was our favorite Vietnamese place. Until recently, we were told that Annie opened this new restaurant, Pho 88. This brand new location is nice and clean. The taste of all the food tastes just like I remembered. I'm so happy to have my favorite Vietnamese place back. Amazing quality and fairly large portions."}
{"text":"Love their grilled pork and soup has really great broth. I had it to go but the place is kept clean and service was really good. This is now my favorite place"}
{"text":"Yo wasup with the old lady that's always working here. Worst server/host/manager or whatever she is. Sat us down while on her phone. Once we sat she threw her napkins in front of each of us and placed the utensils down like they were on fire or something. Took our orders, went straight back on her phone. When she served us our food, she literally had the phone tucked between her ear and arm like she was not going to get off that phone. Also, I went to the bathroom( which was surprisingly pretty clean) when I came back out, she was sitting on one of the booths with one slipper off and her musty ass foot was on the booth  and we made eye contact and she put her foot back down hahaha."}
{"text":"I hate to leave these kinds and of reviews but I am really disappointed in this place as I was a follower of this owner from Pho Annie on rainbow.  We live in this area and it was our go to place for pho but never again will we go there and I will never recommend this place ever again.  Go there if u have to but you will be in for disappointment. There are better places in las vegas that have better service.  This is the reason why we have been there since its opening and this was the worst service and pho ever.  When the basil and bean sprouts came out they were all wilted and brown on both plates there were four of us.  I glanced around and everyone else had nice green ones.  Nice fresh basil is a must for pho.  So I asked if we could have better basil.  I saw the guy take it to the back and brought back picked off wilted leaves just rinsed again and there was bug eaten leaves.  I was like really wtf.  Oh and the owner lady knew that this was all happening. The pho tai came out warm not hot and the meat was already fully cooked.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO A REAL VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT!   Never again!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my family and the food was excellent. The noodles and the broth was different but very unique and delicious. Everyone was friendly espicaly Karen. Service was fast. My new to go to pho place. Plus it's close to where I live."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, some of the most disappointing Vietnamese food I've ever had. 

The deep fried spring rolls filling was pretty standard but the skin was overly sweet. If they usually put sugar in the spring roll skins, I've never noticed before, but this was over the top. 

The beef ball pho broth was good, but the beef balls were pretty awful. It tasted like compact, frozen, hamburger meat."}
{"text":"Pho 88 isn't usually my first choice for pho on the Spadina strip, but it was one of my dinner companion's. I've been there many times in the past for the same reason: Other people seem to prefer it. Despite the nice renovation they did a few years ago that differentiated the joint from its nearby competitors on the outside, my favourite thing about Pho 88 is the cleanliness of the washrooms. Finally, a bathroom in Chinatown that's not going to make me gag when I make the fated trip after drinking way too much bottomless steeped tea!

On this most recent visit, I decided to try something different from their multi-Asian cultural menu. It's all there after all. Why haven't I ever deviated from ordering anything other than shrimp salad rolls and the crazy pho with a dozen cow parts in it? There are even pictures to guide the uninitiated. 

At last, I ordered Thai glass noodles, one of my dinner companions the Chinese crispy noodles, and the other Vietnamese noodles. Each of the dishes were plentiful and did the job, but nothing out of this world. I don't doubt that I will eat here again and am not saying that the food is anything to complain about. It's just that much better food exists and it's just steps away."}
{"text":"Liked the food fine, but the service was questionable. A woman who I can only assume is the manager was hovering around us, watching us eat, standing by us on the floor and observing the customers. It was bizarre, like we were in elementary school again with a teacher watching us during lunch hour. We won't be going back because of how uncomfortable we were."}
{"text":"This is Annie's new place. I'm hooked on her Chicken Curry Pho and I'm so glad I found her new place! I've been searching high and low for at least a similar recipe. Now I can fulfill my Curry Pho cravings!"}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews and seeing that Annie was back, I was excited to try this place. Sadly, I will not be back to dine here. I came in for lunch and was seated right away. First problem, a lady brought her Pomeranian in a stroller and the dog was yipping away and it was pretty annoying. Very odd. 
Second problem, this place has a bad fruit fly problem. I saw one fruit fly and thought maybe it was just the one...until I saw another then another then another. It was so bad I had to cover my soda with a napkin. The server asked me if my soda was ok and I told him there were fruit flies so I covered it, and as I was telling him this, one flew onto my egg roll lettuce and I told him I was not eating the egg rolls. After that, I completely lost my appetite and was sick of swatting away fruit flies, so I asked for the check and quickly left. 
I googled \"fruit fly problems\" and was pretty grossed out of the reasons listed......."}
{"text":"The original Pho Annie owner has opened her new spot! As long as Annie and Tony and staff are back in the kitchen they will always have my business. Oh how I've missed the food. This location Pho 88 is way better. The space in here is very comfortable and big to accommodate big parties unlike the last spot. Their menu I almost exactly the same just named differently. The pho broth is way better  than it used to be and I can only imagine once the pot gets flavored how much better it will be over time. 

Come stop by here if you want to eat some great comfort food. We got to eat egg rolls, buttered fried chicken wings, five spiced squid. Crispy egg noodles with seafood, vermicelli bun noodles with Grilled pork and egg rolls, And broken rice with short ribs. All were great. We'll definitely be back to show some love."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon in Chinatown, hungry for food and there's line ups at both Pho Hung and King's Noodles.  We walked a bit further south on Spadina and decided to duck into Pho 88.

I've eaten at a few other Pho 88 locations before but not this downtown one.  The decor is dark, sleek and White people friendly.

We ordered the medium pho ($6.50), the vermicelli noodles with grilled pork, jumbo prawn and spring roll ($8.95) and a potent Vietnamese coffee ($2.50).

My bowl of pho was jammed to the top with noodles so the medium size felt more like a large.  Coffee was deliciously strong and vermicelli noodle dish was hearty as well.

A decent lunch spot with no line ups."}
{"text":"review assumes you get the pho (cause it's their staple dish)
the broth is a bit oily and not the best tasting i've had as well as having slightly smaller than average portions
the beef isn't great but it's fine really 
however, the service is fine, courteous and quick , and they refill your water attentively, yet consider that i went at 630 on a monday so it wasn't too busy which helps 
my friend got the spring rolls and they're overpriced and small

Overall food was subpar pho but still tasty, with decent service
would recommend if you're in the area but not if you're looking for a good pho place to eat"}
{"text":"I'm so please that this place opened. The pho was delicious and the meat was tender. The service is impeccable. Now I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown to get my pho fix"}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to like this place I just can't. I came in and we were seated right away with our menus. The first thing I noticed was flies! I counted four flies that were around our section and it wouldn't stop bothering us. As annoying as it was I killed all four of it by slapping it hoping that's the end of them... nope there were more. It was frustrating from beginning to end to sit down and have flies fly all over the section. I seen other customers swatting away flies as well. I ordered a shrimp pho and my fiancè ordered a grilled pork plate. It took less than 10 minutes to come out but once I seen my pho I was a bit disappointed... $9 for that? Portion was on the small end for the soup and I was given 6 shrimps in my soup (other pho places range from 10-12 at least.) They have one size for pho so if you'd like to order extra expect to pay extra. However, the pork plate was beautiful I could say that. The presentation was amazing and to have soup and an egg with it tops off the dish! I'd order that if I decide to come back. The lady who worked there was super nice but I had to ask our servers to keep filling up our drinks, why have servers when I have to walk up to them to get water myself? Our total came out to $30 and I will say mixed with the environment, food portioning/ taste, it was not worth it to me. I was too distracted with the flies and getting too annoyed to even enjoy the food. The grilled pork plate was the only thing that looked good."}
{"text":"The food is eh.. i've had waaaaay better, but tend to go here when i have no where else to dine with my bf. The decor is nice.
customer service = 4+
spring rolls are good here to try as an appetizer, the pho isn't great.. 
the smoothies are good its something to try!!

 i usually get the grilled chicken with rice, and i love it."}
{"text":"Really good place ,clean and spacious 
Very fresh food so tasty 
Homemade springs rolls 
Very nice owners"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with my wife. The interior decor in this restaurant is very nice and spacious. 

We went ahead and ordered Regular Rare Beef Satay Pho, Small Flank and Brisket Pho, and Regular Spring Rolls. 

First came the spring rolls. Nothing special. I find the spring rolls is a bit on the cold side, would taste much better if it came out piping hot. It does feel like the spring roll was microwaved, I could be wrong. 

Then came the two pho. The satay pho is spicy as hell. It is flavourful and delicious. The rare beef is tender, juicy and melts in your mouth. Very good!  My wife also liked her pho. She find the broth very delicious. 

To conclude, we did enjoy our meals but not the spring roll. If I come back we will order something else. 

Food:  3.5/5
Ambience:  4.5/5
Service:  4.5/5
Cleanliness:  4/5"}
{"text":"Worst pho ever. Service was so slow had to keep calling the waiter over for everything. Everyone I came to have dinner with got there food at the same time and my meal ... never came . Annie still can't get it right."}
{"text":"Finally this pho restaurant has opened!! The former owner of Annie Pho is back! 

The restaurant in interior looks fantastic and has the same comfortable ambience. 

The menu is similar to Annie Pho with great pricing. I ordered the Chicken Curry Soup and it was AMAZING.  Delicious and not as many bones in the chicken pieces (which were hardy). 

I am happy this place is open for business!"}
{"text":"We finally graced our presence at this place and ONLY regret the opportunity of not coming in earlier! Annie is back and better! The place is bigger and the portions are bigger. We normally could finish what we usually order but we had to take our leftovers home. My son and I usually share a bowl of rare steak and beef balls pho and it filled us up for two meals. Annie definitely goes above and beyond in making her customers happy and have them coming back, it's no wonder her loyal customers followed her from her old location! She gave my son a free drink and she gave me a free iced coffee! What makes us want to come back even more is she remembers having us at her old location! I love her and thank God for someone so friendly and generous! 

Like I said, the place is bigger than her old location with way more seats/tables available! It's super clean, per usual, and it feels so homey especially with her family being there. I'm a fan of mom and pop shops/restaurants and she is the true definition of owning one! 

Guys, come here for all your Vietnamese cuisine cravings, you will not be let down! She is the best, hands down! Welcome back, Annie!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Good quality ingredients. Very fast service. Plenty to eat. Meals packed with flavor."}
{"text":"No improvement , on the contrary.
Pho broth only tastes cloves. That is not a good Pho! And it takes too long to get it once ordered."}
{"text":"Checked out this place based on \"Hot&New\". To my delight, this place was amazing. Great service! Lots of choices on the menu. Decided to go with traditional Grilled Pork Chop Rice Dish \"Com Mi Da\".  I recommend if you have not tried. The Rice dishes came with Pho broth, totallY amazing. Large portions. The staff was very friendly and attentive . Love to come back when in town."}
{"text":"What I don't understand is why they would make this place look so nice, and then not maintain it. I remember the first time I came here, I was thoroughly impressed. It's nice to know that you could have the same quality of pho without having to share tables with a bunch of strangers. Nevertheless, since the 2 years i've been away, this place has really gone down the hill. The floors are soo nasty that if you're not wearing shoes with tracks, you will slip and fall on the grease. Their bathrooms are dirty, and their soap is watered down. Really?

The food is not impressive. My pork chop was so dry and thin. The price is slightly more expensive than all the uptown Pho88s but still cheap. They don't accept credit card so make sure you have cash or debit handy."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place got a 4 1/2 star review...misleading to those who want to enjoy a good pho. The broth is bland and is not even close to normal pho broth, which is typically beef bone based. This tasted like they used a powder substitute instead. I didn't have anything else so I can't comment but wouldn't  recommend the pho to anyone. I don't do reviews often but I hope this helps others who are craving pho (Skip this place). 

Service is good and our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"I cannot say that this is the best pho.  The soup base is borderline bad. The service was good.  I would not recommend it with all the fantastic pho restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"After saw review I went there pho. Pho was just ok. I left mildly disappointed. I went there again for rice. Wow their rice was delicious! Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was ok.  The food is great!  I had the pork chops with Broken Rice, and it was delicious...my kids tried to eat it all before I could have any.  The pho broth was very flavorful, but they don't give much noodles.  We also ordered the Pad Thai, which was good, but they didn't give us the option for how spicy we wanted it.  The downside was the service.  It took them a while before they came to take our orders, and the place was not busy.  Also, we had to ask for our waters to be refilled several times, and some other little things and details that other restaurants would just automatically do or offer.   The food was good, so we will probably be back again."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING the #41-grilled Pork and rice included with sauce,soup, and even a runny egg on top of the rice. The pork was marinated PERFECTLY.

The sauce you put on the meat and rice it made it even BETTER it was mildly sweet making a perfect combination"}
{"text":"The food was terrible and the service was worse! My egg rolls tasted so fishy and the rare steak pho tasted funky. I asked the manager to change it because I didn't like it and she started yelling at me!! She told me she was going to charge me for the one egg roll I ate!!  Are you kidding me?? 
We left and went to pho saigon 8 instead and the food was delicious and the service was much better."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent customer service. They treat you like family. We enjoy coming here and food is food every time. Veggies are always fresh."}
{"text":"The food was okay - lots of broth, not enough noodles and meat but the taste was exceptional. the price is typical for any other vietnamese pho restaurant, $9.99 for a large bowl of pho.

The atmosphere was nice, decent size for dining. only 2 flat screens one on east and west wall - of course the north wall served as the kitchen and the south was entirely glass facing the parking lot. this place is fairly new and that's how it looked. Tables were generously set with sauces and utensils except for the typical forks and regular dining spoons, which is okay. Their soup spoons have the hooks on the end to prevent them from sinking into your large bowl, i love these spoons!

We ordered a thai tea which arrived in a to-go cup, although we were dining in and it had a sticker marked with yesterday's date. i'm going to assume this thai tea was made yesterday. as a customer, i'd like to have things fresh, made that day. or the sticker could've been a \"sell by\" date which would've been worse. if you're gonna give me something dated yesterday, be courteous and take the sticker off..

Lastly, the main reason why this is only getting 1 star - from the moment we were seated to the moment we left our table, we had about 10 different gnats flying around us and all over our food. We killed about half of them which you'll see in the photos. Not only is it disgustingly unsanitary, it ruins the appetite. Do something about your pests, please!"}
{"text":"Good food. Service was super slow on thanksgiving Monday. They seemed to have lots of staff wandering around but kinda forgot about us! I have to admit that the food came out pretty quick, but they took off after that.

I had the lemongrass beef. I know, it's not Pho but it was super good. Especially for Chinatown standards. Yum.

Wouldn't recommend again unless there was nothing else available."}
{"text":"Love Annie's food.  Her last place went downhill fast after she sold it.  We eat here at least once a week.  The Stir Fired Lemongrass Chicken and the Beef Chow Fun are the best in town.  The Pho Tai is made with filet mignon with wider than regular noodles, the broth is not what I am used to but still really good.

Yes, Annie is back and better than ever!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night at 7PM.

This location has a non-traditional bar/rustic look compared to most viet restaurants. Ordered two pho, chicken curry and a pad Thai. The pho was acceptable, good portion for the price. The pad Thai was awful, so sour it was unpalatable and we had to argue with them to take it back. The chicken curry was incredibly watery and had very little chicken (just chicken legs where the meat fell off).

Will never return. Doesn't even have complementary tea ($1.50/pot) 

Oh they also had no bean sprouts for the pho..."}
{"text":"like most people that came here.. we didnt want to wait an hour or two for the restaurant next door... so this was the next best (closest) thing.. 

walking in.. i could tell that most of the people eating there didn't like waiting to get seated either.. so i was relieved.. 

me and the wife and the baby came in.. got greeted.. told us to go where everybody was not.. maybe because we got a baby.. and he was crying at the time.. so i guess being considerate of others.. we were cast away for everyone else.. jk.. maybe coincidence...

anyways.. the place was bigger than what it looked like from the outside.. very spacious and very clean... i see the waitors walking around really fast and moving fast and working hard... all that good stuff.. 

got seated.. felt uncomfortable because as soon as we sat.. a lady came and started asking if were ready to order... pause! can i get a menu first and some waters.. and maybe a high chair.. ? 

placed our order.. i got the pho dac biet.. *special / combination... and wifey got a vermicelli.. 

food came out fairy quick.. and we then commenced in partaking our food... 

average.. typical pho place... price was about the same as any other pho place ( like across the street ).. 

noodle : broth comparison was good.. 

ill be back if the restaurant next door is an hour or two wait again.. lol"}
{"text":"Normally I don't write less than positive reviews, but this place I can't find much positive things to say. My boyfriend and I ordered the food togo. I'm not sure if it's because we went in 20 min before close since we weren't paying attention to what time it was, but the brisket that came with our pho was completely dry. In fact, I would have preferred them to have turned us away saying they're closing. The food also came out really fast, like under 8 min. We also got an order of spring rolls on top of 2 orders of rare meat and brisket pho. I asked if it only comes with shrimp as the only option and the guy answered saying it comes with meat too. I'm allergic to shrimp, so I told him just to have meat and NO shrimp in it (stating my allergy). He nodded and told me he understood (twice). When we got home, much to my disappointment, they completely disregarded the mention of my allergy and only had shrimp in the spring rolls. Maybe there was a miscommunication, even when I stated no shrimp twice? The restaurant was closed before we got home so there was nothing I can really do about it. It felt like a complete waste of 5.99 when no one else at home eats spring rolls. On top of that during payment, the paper that had our order written on it stated something like 24.95. The 4 was written sloppy, but the man who took our order confirmed it being 24. He proceeded to call over another lady who told us is not 24, but 25. I didn't want to fight them on just a dollar, but imagine if they added an extra dollar to every bill? Perhaps if we would have gone during a different time, service wouldn't have been so rushed and terrible."}
{"text":"I've ordered several times from here before and it never disappoints. Food is always good and fresh. I had vegetables with steamed rice today and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome, very good and plenty full. Nice open and clean restaurant with great food service.  Bit hard to find in the Smith shopping center . I'll be back real soon"}
{"text":"My friends and I are here for dinner and we just found our new fav pho spot! The food is made fresh and VERY flavorful! Remind me of home cooked Vietnamese meals! They also have a great vegetarian selection too, which I really appreciated because some places don't have that many vegetarian options on their menu. The colors and atmosphere in the restaurant is really clean and welcoming. I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"A must try if you are a Pho lover! This place is fairly new and located in the Southwest. The owner use to own Annie Pho but sold the business and took her cook with her. The portions are large and the food is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Overall impression: a modern rustic atmosphere with below than mediocre food and not so great service. 

My boyfriend has been here before and he said that the first time he went was an absolute nightmare with terrible service and terrible quality of food, but he decided to give this place another chance and said that the pho with satay was one of the best broth he has ever tasted. 

Coming from a Vietnamese family, I had low expectations of this place of them nailing authenticity but I did hope for flavorful food. As an appetizer, we got the shrimp spring roll and the flavor was okay except they kept the tail and skin on the shrimp which left an unnecessary choking texture. I got the vermicelli with BBQ pork and spring rolls and it was alright. It wasnt terrible, but the pork was very fatty and the fish sauce was lacking a lot of flavor. And we got the coconut milkshake and avocado milkshake which was very watery and no flavor. It was more like an ice shake and I would recommend not getting it. The staff were unattentive and didn't even give us enough napkins. 

I would say if you like flavorful and spicy soups get the pho with satay, but if you like to try something else, it's a better choice to stick with another Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Know if this is the old 88 that was at Broadview and Gerard. It is the best pho in the city of Toronto"}
{"text":"Good pho, decent price, and a nicer setting than most pho restaurants - what's not to like? Combine this with a recent trip to Paris where I ate 11 pho that had like 6 slices of beef and half the portion of noodles and no air conditioning - it really reminded me how good I have it at home!

The soup is rock solid - as good as any I've had anywhere else in Toronto. I tend to measure all Vietnamese joints against the Pho 88 at Steeles and Warden (apparently not owned/managed by the same people as this location) because it's where I grew up, and the pho and broth at this place is just as good.

Where this place surpasses Steeles/Warden Pho 88 is the rice platters! I love to get the pork and chicken chop platter and this place has the juiciest, freshest chops I've ever had. At Steeles/Warden, the meat is paper-thin and dry. Here it's juicy, succulent, and has the wonderful charred aroma of the grill! Amazing.

The one thing is that for a long time, service was quite frosty - I'd come here after taking an evening class and would always get shooed out because they were always closing early. But in the past month, they've hired an absolute sweetheart of a server, who makes us feel so welcome, and who has encouraged us to call in beforehand with our orders to ensure we get our food and that they can close on time - a win-win situation. So we've been happily coming back after a few months-long hiatus."}
{"text":"Former owner of Pho Annie.  Food is delicious as always.  They upgraded their steak for pho soup to filet mignon and the price is still the same.  This time my husband had their grill prawn with Vermicelli noodle and my son and I had Hong Kong style noodle.  Like always, the food is always on point.  

This time we didn't order their garlicky, buttery chicken wing but it is something to think about for those who loves chicken wing.  

Their sate (homemade hot sauce) is one of the many reason why we keep coming back here.  No other place in town have the same hot sauce like theirs."}
{"text":"First off, I had high expectations for this place thanks to all the reviews both on here and google as \"the most authentic pho\" in Vegas. Coming in, we realized the hostess was a Chinese Vietnamese lady. We ordered Pho Dac Biet #12 and Pho Cari ga #22. 

I got a little disappointed right away looking at our side veggies plate. We were the first guests in the morning and were served super cold and old basils with a lot of black dots. Not fresh or good at all. I bet they gave us the defrosted frozen basil from the day before. 

But the pho and curry came so we decided to enjoy them to the fullest. Sadly, after three spoons of soup, I felt really sick. I am an MSG detector by nature. In another word, I am allergic to MSG. And yep, this place seems to have MSG in their broth. My head is spinning around writing this review and I feel super drained. The meat in the pho was good tho. 

Definitely not coming back to this \"best pho in town\" restaurant. Ever."}
{"text":"One of the best broth based soups I have had, the tendon and tripe are very good. The meat that is used is high quality. The restaurant itself is very sparse, but nice, and the location is great."}
{"text":"Came here to get some pho since I heard that this was a good place to go to and it's super close to my house. When walkig in the restaurant was a bit warm but we were greeted right away and sat in a booth. 

The server came and gave us waters and gave us a few minutes to decide what to order. I decided on phone with beef balls and egg rolls. My husband got a Number 57 spicy beef noodle soup or Bun Bo hue. 

The soups came out first then the appetizer egg rolls came out a few minutes after. I didn't particularly enjoy the flavor of the soup when comparing it to other pho restaurants. I added a lot of hoisin sauce and Sriracha and had to add more throughout my entire meal because of the lack of flavor. My husband seemed to enjoy his soup and ate it all which was good. The egg rolls were good but I wish they would've cake out first so I could enjoy them hot and fresh before my meal instead of in between bites of my pho. I ended up just eating my portion of the egg rolls after I was finished with my soup and by the time I was done they were not really warm anymore."}
