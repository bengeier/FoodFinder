{"text":"This is a newly opened location in the vicinity of the young and eligible hood. I've been watching the opening of this location with anticipation for the past couple of months and the delayed gratification was well worth it!  Highlights:  - The food: I ordered the 6oz Hero Burger, and it was cooked to a succulent medium-well, as per my request, with perfect grill marks! And served on a soft bun topped with my fresh toppings of choice (lettus, tomatoes, red oninons, pickles, mayo, ketchup, and my favourite the maple chipotle BBQ sauce)   - Quick service. This may of course change as they should, rightfully, pick up more traffic over the coming weeks! - Welcoming staff: nothing beats a service with a genuine smile and everyone from the cashier to the grill boys seemed friendly.  - Location: perfect uptown downtown location within a few minutes of the Yonge and Eglinton Subway Station. - Prices: 6oz burger goes for $5.99 and considering 100% Angus beef patty, in addition to the portion size, this pricing is definitely justified! I need to mention that there is a smaller 4oz burger that sells for $4.99, which would still satisfy and a monster of an 8oz for $6.99, large enough to be shared!  Food: A Service: A Food presentation: A Atmosphere: B+ Prices: A Recommended?: Yes"}
{"text":"Overpriced and substandard. When you're going to pay this much for fast food, you might as well go to a real restaurant. For a combo, expect to pay upwards of $12.  Also, the burgers, especially the chicken burger here are awful. Tough, rubbery and served on an unsatisfactory bun.  The toppings aren't always fresh either.  The bag in which the hamburger comes is cool though."}
{"text":"I would rate this less than 1 star if it was possible. Overpriced, nasty food with a side of rudeness.  Each of us (2 people) ate the poutine with mushrooms. There were hardly any mushrooms, definitely not an extra 2 dollars worth. The gravy was bland and the fries tasted freezer burnt. The curds were small and melted so much that it mind as well have been grated mozza in this poutine. Definitely not worth 7.95 each.   I have never eaten at a Hero Certified Burgers before so I cannot compare whether it is simply this location or all locations that have such bad food.    We witnessed the owner being pushy with one of his employees and he (the owner) spent the better part of our meal staring at us.   Don't bother going to this location."}
{"text":"I had a most unpleasant experience on my recent visit to this location.  I have been here several times, and for the most part, everything has been fine.  However, I ordered a 6 oz. burger with peameal bacon (no fries) to go yesterday.  I requested my toppings to be put on the side, as I was going to eat it later.  Immediately, the manager Jaroosh told the cashier that they could not do that.  I told the cashier that I have requested this before, and had never had a problem, however, I was once denied before years ago by the same man.  He told me that the containers were too large to hold each individual topping (they were small plastic containers, not even big enough to hold a small salad or coleslaw).  I asked him if he could put all the ketchup, mustard and relish in the tiny container, which he agreed (he should have suggested that before telling me that they could not accommodate my request).  After I walked out, I came back in and told him how disgusted I was with his customer service, and that I was going to report him to the head office.  After our shouting match, I left.  Later, I had my burger, with guess what, no peameal bacon.  Then I was really livid.  He once before had forgotten the peameal bacon, and had to be reminded by the cashier.  I will never visit this location again, the service is deplorable.  This man definitely needs a course in customer relations, he never smiles or greets the customers.  The lady there, I'm assuming is his wife, is a sweetheart, and had never had any problems with other staff.  I have filled out a customer service survey with Hero Burger, and have yet to hear back from them.  Plus he owes me $1,29 + tax for the peameal bacon that I never received."}
{"text":"The poutine was incredible. Pricey for a combo, but it was still completely worth it."}
{"text":"Very greasy slimy-esque burger. Doesn't live up to the hype at all don't understand why anyone would want to go back when there are SO many other awesome burger joints and even franchises across Toronto. Felt pretty gross and sad after eating a burger the other week. Won't repeat the same mistake twice."}
{"text":"First of all I gave this place it due two strikes before I made my mind. For 12-13 bucks combo, I have had a lot better. They have some pretty funky topping, which good. But, the patty doesn't have any taste to it. All you taste are the topping.  Otherwise, place is well kept and staff is friendly.  That's it for Hero Burger."}
{"text":"Mediocre burger- the bread was soaked with the toppings by the time it arrived. Wasn't happy with the service- 3 people received their order before me even though they ordered after me. The cook was rude and seemingly disgruntled in his tone and demeanour. I chose this place out of convenience and will never go back. Tons of other places to go to waaaaay better than this joint."}
{"text":"Burk!  I am a big burger baby, and usually easy to please, but hard to impress. This place did neither and I won't be going back.   Stopped by for a pick-up; Ordered the 6 oz. blue moon burger combo. Fries and sprite. How bad can it get.   Half a joke later, in staring at my plate in disbelief.   Bread is soaked and stale  Meat was tasteless and overly salty  Blue cheese was good but I could have chucked the rest of the damn thing  Fries were ok, run of the mill. Needed salt but the meat more than compensated.   Not to mention that the service was pitifully slow and quiet. I mean I can count on my one hand the number of words exchanged. But for a good burger, I would have put up with that.   I should have known better  than to check out this place. It's always empty, even with a school nearby. Burger joints should never be empty at peak hours. Wishful thinking had me hoping it couldn't be that bad.  Two stars solely for decor/seating in this location. But do you go out to eat or sit?  I RECOMMEND- trying onion rings or a poutine. The fries were so bland, almost as bland as the sandwich.   Better yet, there's an A&W a block west.  EXTRA TIP- Gluten-free burger available. For the daring."}
{"text":"Fine burgers, awesome grilled salmon, sweet potato fries are a really nice touch. Gluten free buns are available (and being gluten-intolerant, this is a must). Fine tasting fare, good service, nice and clean."}
