{"text":"Ate here last night and was pleasantly surprised! 
Excellent wood-fire pizza!! What impressed me was that all the ingredients were from Napoli... 
I really loved it here will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our food. The restaurant was half empty on a Sunday at 9pm, but the servers and the kitchen staff seemed to take their time for no reason, standing chatting with our food in their hands instead of bringing it to our table! Our waitress was holding our sauce for several minutes chatting with a fellow waitress. We asked for salt and pepper and it never arrived. The food was very mediocre, lacked flavor and very small portions. Poor service and poor quality food. Would never come back."}
{"text":"Great pizza! 5 cheese was great  affordable price service was not bad just slightly strange"}
{"text":"The best spot to indulge yourself with some Italian ( and not only! ) food: 
The best espresso and pizza, guaranteed. Great ambiance with a fountain in the middle and grand piano. Large space and luminous atmosphere. Perfect location and extremely professional service. 
À voir!"}
{"text":"antipasto misto was quite disappointing.   For $18 you would expect a little bit more.   We were extremely disappointed with the takeaway from this restaurant. The choices of meals was very limited. The portions were very poor. Definitely would not recommend. Meals weren't anything above ordinary and were quite pricey as well."}
{"text":"As a pizza lover I can honestly say that this will be my regular spot! Food was excellent and very affordable. The ingredients were fresh and offered a unique taste I've never had before. Plus the decor makes you feel like you're in a small village in Italy.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza I have eaten in Montreal for a while now.
Light dough, good crust and very tasty ingredients...and for a very, VERY good price.
Meal hit the spot perfectly.

Liked the little details in the décor - fountain in the middle + piazza-like stones, giving the whole place a very authentic Italian vibe (instead of the stereotypical stuff you find usually).

Definitely coming back. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Pretty bad, unfortunately. It is a nice place. Pizza's are slightly expensive. Our pizza's were burnt, they offered us new ones, but those still tasted burnt. Not as big as some here suggested, normal size for Italian pizza. Service was a bit slow, the waitress was new though. The red beer was good."}
{"text":"We were waiting for this place to open near our building for a while now. When it finally did, we thought we'll give it a try. We asked about the contents of one of the starters and the waitress mentioned all of the vegetables and left out a very important ingredient, the meat. We ordered it thinking it was vegetarian. 

The starters arrived, my husband ate one in one bite and I used my fork and knife to cut into one. That's when we realized there was meat in it. We called the waitress to ask what kind of meat, since we don't eat pork. It was ham. When we told her that she didn't mention that, she started arguing that we didn't mention we don't eat ham. Huh? Imagine this, the waitress standing there for 5 minutes telling us that it's our mistake. To make matters worse, she called the manager who stood there for another 10 minutes telling us that it's our fault, and that we should of stated that we don't eat pork as soon as we entered the restaurant. What?! Just change the plate and let us eat in peace! 

The manager did offer to have the starter \"on the house\" after giving a lesson on how to order in a restaurant. My husband refused and paid full. We took the pizza \"to go\" and ate in the comfort of our own home. It wasn't that good anyway. Left a bitter taste in our mouth after what happened. The place was empty, we should of figured that much."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!! The Pizzas are great and the price is not bad considering the size of the dishes. You can actually split a pizza with someone else since the pizza sizes are huge! 

The restaurant is super well decorated, with an inside water fountain! It's a great place to talk since it's not very crowded and does not have very loud music! I totally recommend going!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Amazing food, decor, service, and pricing. You really feel like you're in a piazza in Italy with the fountain in the middle of the restaurant, the basil plants, the piano...it's very meticulously designed. The servers are very attentive and lovely. The pizza is delicious; very light but flavourful. I love the vegetable pizza and the 4 cheeses (ask them to add mushroom!). They also have yummy desserts like the lemon and almond cake. Sometimes I just come for a cup of coffee and listen to Sinatra playing in the background. My new favorite restaurant downtown. Soon in the summer they'll have a terrace as well. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"After a long day of touring Montreal, and wanting an early dinner and a glass of wine, we stumbled upon Piazza Del Sogno.  My husband had pasta and I ordered a pizza.  I thought I would just eat a slice of pizza and ending up eating the entire thing!! So delicious.  Thin crust and full of flavor.  So glad we found this spot.  Stop by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I have already gone twice in the last 3 weeks and I love the pizza. They have this appetizer of fried vegetables, Risotto balls and  salt dough balls (by far my favorite, just ask for marinara sauce with it). The coffee is good and the desserts are great, I could almost go there just for a piece of the almond chocolate cake.
The ambiance makes you feel right in Italy.I have been serve both times by the same waiter and I've gotten excellent service. He was very attentive to our needs. A great place to grab a bite downtown."}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza, coffee and desert - feels very authentic, beautiful inside. They are close to another wood over pizza place on Stanley but I find their prices and food a little better. Nicer atmosphere inside too - very friendly staff."}
{"text":"To be exact I would have given a 3.5 stars. Some have said that the pizza was the best in montreal but I would disagree. And the tables are the most incomfotable I have ever seen. On the good side, service was extremely friendly"}
{"text":"If you want to have a real experience of Italy, this is the place to be! Love the fact that this restaurant is well decorated and gives you the feeling of being in Italy.. got there for lunch and it wasn't not packed. The lady told me to choose my table and was super nice. I was fascinated by the idea of the inside water fountain which gives you that relaxation feeling while eating. It's quaint and love their wood fire oven. The decor is unique in itself and you can just admire as it's well done.

I got to my table and she brought me the menu. I know I was going for the Margherita Pizza which is one my favourite. In a span of 15-20 minutes, My pizza arrived to my table and I was so surprised of the size of this pizza! It's huge and so filling. At my first bite of it, I totally had memories from Italy coming back to me as it reminded me of the flavour and consistency. It was delicious. I finished it all and decided to check out their homemade desserts as well. I had the Italian cookies. I totally enjoyed it and would recommend it to all :) 

It's just a nice, quiet as well as quaint place to be if you want the authentic taste of Italy"}
{"text":"This place has a great Italian ambiance and they have great pizza. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Family-style place with  authentic food. Friendly service, not very noisy. All the pizzas I tasted were great.

I recommend for a lunch or for dinner with friends.

There is also a nice selection of appetizers, and reasonably affordable wine bottles."}
{"text":"I imagine this is what eating in Italy feels like. The inside is so cute with a water fountain and plants everywhere. The margherita pizza also did not disappoint. The bread and crust was some of the best I've had. The staff is also super nice."}
{"text":"It looks like a little piazza. They do coffee, lunch and dinner. 

Good and cheap which is rare in that section of Montreal."}
{"text":"This place has very good and authentic Italian style pizza. The thin but not too thin crust, the real cheese that you won't find on any pizza chain out here, and the fresh toppings all contribute. And yes, it's freshly baked in an oven."}
{"text":"The translation of \"Sogno\" is \"Dream\" and if you have ever been to Piazza Del Sogno, you will know why their name is so appropriate for what they have to offer.  Located at 1180 de Maisonneuve Ouest, (if you take public transit, it's a convenient two second walk from Peel Metro),  they offer amazing Pizza, a beautiful ambiance and on top of that, you get great service and food for an amazing price.

We were greeted by their very polite and welcoming staff and got to choose which table we wanted to sit at.  It was hard to decide because the entire area is so beautiful.  I have never been to Italy (yet) but I felt like I was transported to Naples while dining and that hasn't happened in a very long time.  I chose a table that gave me a good view of the entire restaurant while being able to watch the pizzas being prepared.  They use a wood burning oven and that alone made me fall in love right away.

We started looking at their menu while enjoying water and a good Newcastle Brown  Ale.  Piazza Del Sogno now has their liquor license so if you have ever passed by it before, wishing you could enjoy food with a nice beer or wine, you now can!

For our Appetizer, we had the Fried Calamari and it will now be the only place I order it.  Other restaurants tend to either make their Calamari too rubbery or their marinara dipping sauce is too bland or too acidic.  Not here.  Their marinara is the perfect compliment for the perfectly done Calamari.

We then had the Seafood Salad Entrée which is a wide variety of fish- squid, mussels, clams, shrimp, with arugula and cherry tomatoes.  The plating was gorgeous and it is incredibly refreshing.  It it the perfect thing to pair with one of their pizzas, which is a \"must try\" for anyone who dines here.  It was absolutely delicious.

I ordered the 'Zucchetta' Pizza- Butternut Squash, caramelized onions, veal sausage topped with smoked cheese and basil leaves.  They had unfortunately run out of the veal sausage, but they were very apologetic and were quick to offer me any other topping to replace it; I chose Chorizo.  I will take this time to point out how nice our server was.  He made the whole experience a fun and memorable one.  

Now, back to the pizza.  I am a huge fan of thin crust pizzas, and this was great because while the crust was still thick around the pizza, it was thin for the area under the toppings- it was the best of both worlds.  They also have a hot sauce that you can put on top if you want a bit of added heat.  The mixture of that, the butternut squash, the amount of delicious cheese- it was all just amazing.  We were pretty full by that point, so we were unable to eat the entire pizza but they wrapped it up for us to take home in two moments.

John finished his dining experience with their Espresso which is gaining in popularity.  He enjoyed it and said he wished he could have had a full sized coffee mug full of it.

Overall, I will definitely be going back and if anyone ever asks for a recommendation for pizza, I know I will be telling them that they have to go to Piazza Del Sogno.  For a restaurant that opened only a few months ago, (and dealt with minor setbacks like any restaurant would when it first opens), the future is looking bright and I give them 5/5 Stars.  I can't wait to go back, especially since I was too full to try any of the desserts we saw when we entered.  Plus, I still have to try their pasta which also sounded amazing."}
{"text":"Premier essaie dans ce nouveau restaurant italien qui a ouvert ses portes il y a quelques mois au coin de Stanley et Maisonneuve. Le restaurant est très charmant à l'intérieur, il y a au centre une fontaine, des pots de fleurs un peu partout et est très lumineux. L'espace café et le four a bois rappellent les authentiques restaurants italiens. Nous avons commandé les arancini. Toutefois, on nous apprend que la friteuse n'a pas encore été démarré donc cela prendrait 15 minutes avant de recevoir l'entrée. Décevant sachant que nous sommes un jeudi à l'heure du lunch. L'équipement devrait être fonctionnel non... Nous avons changé par la salade de boconccini et tomates cerises. Belle présentation, mais pas de pain, pas de sel sur la table, pas d'huile d'olive. Nous avons du tout demander, le serveur ne nous proposant rien. Puis la pizza est arrive végétarienne, encore une belle présentation, bien cuite. Il manquait un peu de legumes tout de fois. Encore une fois, le serveur ne nous a pas demandé si nous voulions quelque chose, donc nous lui avons signifié que nous voulions de l'huile piquante. Nous avons remarqué que tous les autres clients devaient également lever la main afin de demander des extras au serveur. Donc décevant sur ce point!"}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal from the US, I found the best Napoleonic pizza! The restaurant has a full Italian vibe, completely feel like you're in Italy. Definitely worth a try. Service was excellent. Finished off with a great latte."}
{"text":"This place feels like a piazza in Italy while being indoors in Montreal. Staff was extremely friendly, much more friendly and helpful than the average waiter in Montreal.

The food was delicious, but if you order pasta, the serving is a bit on the small side. If you are feeling hungrier, I would suggest getting a pizza which is a much more generous serving.

Aside from the serving size, the menu has many choices to please everyone in your party."}
