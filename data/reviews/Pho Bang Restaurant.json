{"text":"The \"new\" Pho Bang opened today.I was on my way to Da Vang for my weekly pho fix and I thought I'd see what was going on over there.I had a love/hate relationship with the old Pho Bang;the pho was no good,but the 
canh chua tom and tom bo nuong vi (grill -your-own shrimp and beef) were the best in town.The shabby decor and slow service didn't put me off,and the ladies there knew me because I was a semi-regular for many
years.
  The new Pho Bang is totally re-done,floor to ceiling, and now is a very modern and pleasant dining environment.I ordered my usual pho tai bo
vien with the raw beef on the side,and an order of goi cuon (spring rolls).
 The pho exceeded my expectation and ranks with my favorites in Metro
Phoenix(Khai Hoan,Da Vang,Dragonfly).The broth was oily and beefy like
Da Vang,and a bit \"oniony\" like Maxim.Very flavorful and well balanced.
The tai was above-average in both quality and quantity.Leaner and more
thinly sliced than Da Vang,it remimded me of Khai Hoan,sliced a bit thicker.Good meatballs too,like Little Saigon.The goi cuon was solid.
Good size, no skimping on the shrimp and great peanut sauce.They
do use the poached pork,which isn't as tasty as the bbq'd pork in my
favorite spring rolls(Little Saigon,Khai Hoan,Dragonfly).They still hit the spot,though.
  I'm only giving 4 stars because the jury is still out on the rest of my menu favorites,yet to be tried.Oh,one more thing...this place is Da Vang cheap!I And they open at 8:30am (hello,breakfast pho!).I was very impressed with the new Pho Bang and can't wait to go back.I hope my fellow Phoenix pho addicts will check it out!"}
{"text":"I like this place for a cheap, tasty bowl of Pho and some spring rolls that always are fresh and not skimpy on the ingredients. The decor is like some old whore who gave up trying long ago, and I am totally okay with that. Am I wowed when I come here? No. Do I always get the tight lipped mamasan who almost growls my order back at me? Yes. Do I always get good food at great prices, in a place I feel comfortable wearing track pants and a bandana at? Hells to the Yesss..."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a hassle getting into the restaurant's parking lot these days from light rail construction.  But that's probably just as well.  I'm not in a hurry to get back to Pho Bang -- so no biggie.

Some respectable ethnic eateries aren't much of a looker when it comes to decor.  No surprise there.  But Pho Bang takes shabby and RUNS with it.  The floors are worn, and so are the classroom-like ceiling tiles.  

When I walked in there was no greeter, or anyone around to direct you to a table.  I later see that two little old ladies were running the ship in what became clear was a family operation.  Since I wasn't sure about seating protocol I walked to the back counter where it looked like one woman was counting the cash register (it was only 7 pm).   She looked at me all confused and flustered.  

It wasn't that busy either.  Two tables in particular were messy upon my arrival - and were for another 20 minutes after that. 

I was finally sat at a table near their Best of Phoenix awards - all four of them.... from the late 90s!   Figuring that many Vietnamese places have popped up in recent years to make it more competitive - I didn't think much of it.  I noticed on the menu that Pho Bang is a chain with locations in Manhattan, Dallas and Houston - who knew?  

I place my order of shrimp summer rolls and pork and veggie vermicelli noodle bowl and assess the scene - 3 tables at about 6 -10 mostly Asian and Hispanic people (some family, and some friends) each dining and laughing. 

To make the atmosphere even more sketchy than when I arrived,  I notice this grey moving cart that was wheeled from table to table.  Servers here don't clear the table and take the mess to the kitchen - they just dump it in a cart and wheel it all over the restaurant until closing.  Nice, unsavory, and klassy.

My food arrives and the summer roll and dipping sauce tasted alright.  The roll was heavy on the mint leaves, but otherwise it was OK.  The noodle bowl was OK too.  Nothing to write home about.  The one I've had at a Vietnamese place in Chandler was much more flavorful.  I'm not a soup person so I'm not sure how the pho is.

So, there you have it.  An average food experience coupled with unsavory ambiance and so-so service."}
{"text":"Yeah. The place could use a once over with oxyclean, but the yummy food makes  up for the charming patina on the floor and walls. One of my favorites is the rice noodles with grilled pork, sprouts and crispy spring rolls on top. Comes with this sweet and sour sauce stuff you pour on top. Perfect light summer lunch. Also, the pho is a nice bowl of goodness. Squirt some hot sauce and hoisin on that and that is a perfect meal. Remove any eyewear to prevent steamage.

Bonus is the Vietnamese market next door. After lunch you can stock up on Botan Rice Candy, steamed buns and reasonably priced dishware."}
{"text":"So, this place has one vegetarian entree... and I am not completely certain that it was 100% vegetarian. My dining companions seemed to enjoy their food, but I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Love their marinated shrimp that you grill on your table.  Then take it, along with fresh Vietnamese veggies and wrap up to make your own rice paper roll (or summer roll).  Delicious!!!

Good pho too.  When I still ate meat, their grilled pork chops over rice was sooo good.

Go there with a group so you can order lots of dishes to try.

Service can sometimes be slow---not the place to go for lunch if you're in a hurry.  The wait staff mean well & are good people."}
{"text":"ALERT !! ALERT!

Pho Bang is now Pho THanh. The only thing that I had here was Banh Mi. So far it  is very good but it takes forever!!! There  are too  many waiters and not enough cook. 

I don't know if this is true anymore but waiter from this restaurant does not get tips, the owner takes it all. That's the price waiters here pay for getting paid under the table."}
{"text":"Let me first clarify that I am Vietnamese.  All Asians know when they hear a restaurant is good you gotta ask, \" Did a white person tell you that or were they Asian?\"  Come on you know you do it too. And i'm not trying to say that people of the light skin can't appreciate Asian food ( I have a non asian friend who eats lots of asian food I wouldn't eat) , but come on when you've been eating it almost everyday for your entire life you know a little bit more than someone who's had it a dozen times.

My review is a little skewed in the fact that I haven't had too many things here.  I've really only had  cha gio bun tit nuong (Spring rolls, and grilled pork with noodles) , ca kho (fish cooked in a clay pot) and canh cua (sour seafood soup).  Let's start with the good.  The cha gio bun tit noung is good.  The cha gio particularly is good, I wish they would give you more they cut up one sorta small one but it's tasty.  I'm sorta jealous that mine cha gio isn't as good, i can't figure out what it is too.  The nuoc mam is pretty good, they julianne carrots in it ( pet peeve when they don't at a restaurant) and they serve it with green onions that are in oil ( hate when restaurants don't do this either).  It's tasty this is what I typically get when I go here.  The other two not so hot, the ca kho was crazy salty, and the canh chua was just blah.  I'm not sure what they are known for at this place, but that's how a lot of Vietnamese restaurants are they make a few things that are great and they specialize in those and just have the other stuff just cause.   

I haven't eaten the Pho cause I am a snob to pho.  I really don't eat Pho anywhere, I really only eat Pho made by my dad (My dad used to have a pho shop)    I will maybe eat Pho in Orange County, NYC, or Toronto.  I'm North Vietnamese we came up with it I know my Pho.   and I'm a purist in that I think Pho should be eaten plain, no hoison no siracha, only a bit of lime.  So sorry no pho review, but it didn't smell bad. 

And all these reviews about the decor and untidyness.  Well that's just Vietnamese restaurants, and to be perfectly honest I don't think it's too bad even considering it's a Vietnamese joint.   Ha, and I know more than one person who says when choosing between two Asian restaurants in Cali, they go for the one with the lower letter rating.  I am included in that group : )"}
{"text":"It's crazy, but I could live on the greasy fried rice and spring rolls from here for about a month or so. If I kept cash ready, and smiled into the face of scowldom on the other side of the counter, that is. I once tried to debit my $4.36 bill and thought I met the Soup Nazi. I don't care, it's addictive. A little lightrail construction should not stop you. Bring cash if ordering under $5 and don't look around if you don't like 'greasy spoon' kitsch. Fried rice.... mmmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I'd been here about three years ago... maybe under different management. But when I went again this past week there was nothing left of the good memories from the previous visit: Indifferent service; mediocre food; and it wasn't even cheap. I'll not be going back."}
{"text":"Pho Bang is a chain of franchise restuaurants started out of New York City. There are 3 in NYC, 3 in Houston, and one each in Taipei, New Orleans and this one in Phoenix. 

It is old and grungy, and hard to get to with the light rail construction. The prices are dirt cheap, the decor is dirt cheap and the food is un-remarkable. They offer most of the usual Vietnamese dishes, from Goi Cuon appetizers (summer rolls) to Bun (vermicelli), Mi (egg noodles), Com (rice plates) to stir fry chicken, pork, beef; also seafood, some specials and Pho soups (16 different ones).

The Pho comes in 2 sizes, with most regulars costing only $3.95, and the large costing $4.50. Their large is equivalent to many places' medium, however. The broth is average at best, and all the accroutements are too. 

I am not sure how the franchise works (royalties, menus, common logo, etc) but if you want a very cheap meal and you are not a snob or afficianado of Vietnamese food, this places works for a quick filler. They will show Korean Drama DVDs dubbed in Vietnamese on the TV if you ask. They will watch Korean Dramas themselves when it is slow anyway, even if you don't ask! Winter Sonata anyone?

PS - Pho Bang in San Jose is not affiliated with this chain."}
{"text":"My father died of cancer in 2002 after a 7 year struggle... when he could still get around (and even when he couldn't), we would regularly go to Pho Bang to eat together. The owners were sweet and would always ask how he was doing when I would go in by myself. I've been eating here for over a decade and the place hasn't changed one bit... they haven't replaced one thing. It's old and as the other review said - shabby. The owners are very sweet, but most of the customers they get are local and speak Vietnamese. 

I have to say - this place has the best spring rolls of any vietnamese place I've ever eaten at. This is the main reason I still eat here... the food is still very delicious. It's really rough finding decent asian cuisine in the Phoenix area. Specifically Korean and Vietnamese. 

If you can overlook the unwelcoming ugly old appearance and you aren't intimidated by the scary neighborhood and locals-only attitude - the food is delicious. I'd give the food 4 stars and the family that owns it have always been so sweet to me and my dad. I just wish they would relocate or fix the place up a little bit. It once won the Best of Phoenix - but that was a long time ago... at least the food is still the same as it was back then.  Give it a try if you're brave enough."}
{"text":"This place embodies all of the problems that can befall a hole in the wall restaurant and none of the charm.  The dining area was filthy!  The blinds on the windows where literally covered in dust and some sort of ancient splattered liquid.  Their was a television in the corner of the dining area blaring some inane program that the staff was watching.  We sat at our table for ten minutes without anyone so much as acknowledging our presence.  Finally one of my companions got up and dragged a woman back to our table to take our order.  The food came and our waitress sat watching her program for a half hour before we had to once again leave our table and pull her over to get refills on our drinks and get our check so we could leave.  I had the pho which was bland and lifeless and my companions shared a pho and a crispy noodle dish which wasn't half bad.  I would say avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"This place is solid for lunch.  Yes, it is a total hole in the wall, but that is part of the charm!  Right? I went with regulars, who ordered for me, so perhaps the menu may be hit or miss.  What I can tell you is that my meal, what ever it was, was great.  It was a noodle/BBQ pork dish.  And the deep fried spring rolls were fantastic.  And guess what was even better?  My whole meal, which was more than I could eat, was $4.50!  I will be back."}
