{"text":"Esquire is one of our favorite places to go! Friendly staff, great pizzas and appetizers, well-kept pool tables and $1.50 PBR drafts! The in-house pineapple tequila is fantastic as well. They always have a decent sized crowd with a variety of ages, even during odd hours."}
{"text":"This restaurant has high quality bar food that won't break your bank in downtown Champaign.  All of their entrees including pizza are $10 or under but most sandwiches with chips are around $7.50.  The appetizers that they have are so huge and can feed a good group and it won't break your wallet.  The drinks are relatively cheap and they have free peanuts.  The bathrooms are small and there are peanuts all over the ground but that adds to the character of this amazing bar.  If you aren't a jerk expect good service; if not you get what you should receive."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I go here all of the time and love it. It is a great bar for relaxing and enjoying some cheap drinks. The food is typical bar food, but is also priced right.   Overall, this is, by far, my favorite bar in Champaign (if not anywhere)!"}
{"text":"Give me some salty peanuts, PBR and Mediterranean pizza from the Esquire anytime!  Best bar in town!"}
{"text":"New to town, I got in with a group of Masters students that meet up here every Friday, and so far, this place is awesome.  Lots of room outside and in, cheap drinks and good food at a good price.  Its great to have veggie food at a bar that isn't cheese and/or deep fried!  The portobello mushroom sandwich is delicious.  The staff is always available to take more orders, don't mind splitting checks for groups, and there is a wide selection of drinks available."}
{"text":"have been here several times...never really understood why people liked the place, as one reviewer mentioned it is just OK. But it went to terrible after yesterday. I went with two friends to have some drinks and pizza. We sat outside and had some drinks, pizza and then decided to order some chicken wings. Well, at the beginning we asked for a drink menu and the waitress sorta scoffed at our request. She basically wanted to know why we would want such a thing. We let that go...Anyway, we got our wings and they were very spicy, I called her back and mentioned it. She snatched the food of fthe table and said, \"Well I will jsut give you your money back!\" I tried to explain to her that I did not want any money..I just wanted her to know that they hsould tell folks that the wings could be very hot (even though they are not listed as BUFFALO or SPICY). She ignored us and stalked off, returning with our money shortly thereafter. I asked her for the manager and she was more than happy to bring him to us. The dude listened to us and in short said, \"TOO BAD! SHE IS THE OWNER'S DAUGHTER!\" WOW, what an experience. I will NEVER go there again! TERRIBLE SERVICE! SO SO FOOD! NOT WORTH IT ONE BIT!"}
{"text":"Location is good, drinks are usually on the strong side...HOWEVER, the rude service you can expect to receive here, far outweigh the positives.  Every single visit to the esquire, I received unfriendly, uninviting service.  The crowd in this place is 40+ and unless you fall into this category, the staff will make you feel very unwelcome.  Every trip downtown, I want to give esquire another chance, and every time I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Esquire and went here quite a bit to play pool and have a very average (but cheap!) pub food experience.  The main problem is that it doesn't have great beer.  It is pretty townie and older for the most part, which is actually kind of nice coming from the Pig or M+Ms, and it does have a decent unpretentious neighborhood vibe (despite not being in a neighborhood).  They do have pineapple infused tequila they make themselves, which is delicious, so make sure to order a contusion.  It's a fairly versatile place, good for happy hours."}
{"text":"Best Neighborhood Bar in CU by a long shot.  For a bar food bar, their pizza is ridiculously good.  Try the Blue Pear (warning, no red sauce).  The bar tender with the beard will take care of you.  We meet there regularly with a large group, and they handle the crew very nicely.  Crooked Tree is always on tap! Why not five stars?  Cause the food isn't free? not sure."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than fried food, specifically broccoli, after some (or many) drinks at the Pig. Service is usually good, great considering the fact that they're putting up with a lot of drunken shenanigans. Also, you can get fried food to go and take it back to the Pig or Mike and Molly's."}
{"text":"I think of it as a neighborhood bar. Lots of regulars drinking PBR.  The food is really good bar food. The pot stickers are my favorite.  I like sitting on the sidewalk in the summer season. Good choice of beers."}
{"text":"Esquire pretty much kicks ass. I first discovered it while I was working for the city across the street and would come over for lunch quite a bit to get a steak sandwich while I was in the process of packing on the pounds.  I've since lost weight and now I eat the black bean veggie burger (absolutely delicious).  Esquire has grown and changed (a bit) over the years to accomodate the changes in downtown Champaign, but it still retains much of its original character.  I think it and the Brass Rail are the only two places left where you can really hang with the hardcore downtown alcoholics.  I mean HARDCORE!  Esquire is awesome!"}
{"text":"Blue Cheese Burgers.  That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Just got back from a great party at Esquire. The food was fantastic!  Their fried chicken is out of this world and they also had really good Greek salad and potato salad. They have a good bar selection too...I had good German beer. It's just a friendly, fun place to hang out and they have a back room for private gatherings."}
{"text":"The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The food is cheap and is great, drunk or sober. I recommend the Asian Dumplings, or a burger. Their Contusions are amazing (Pineapple infused tequila)!! Plus, who can go wrong with free peanuts, pool tables, and a Jukebox?"}
{"text":"I love this place so much...  It's my favorite bar in town.  The grilled cheese and fried broccoli is where it's AT, and the drinks are inexpensive.  It can be quiet enough to have lots of talking with friends, loud enough to chill by yourself and have some food.  One drawback is it's hard to find seating on weekends, but with two rooms and two bars, it just takes a bit of time but not too long, and that happens with any bar in downtown on the weekend."}
{"text":"Five stars not because this is the best of the best, but because I live in this town and this is the Mothership for me. I am from the midwest and we don't use the term pub in the way it is known in places like across the pond where a joint like this is more than just a watering hole or place to aspire to a trend.   This is a place in the downtown with the history to give it cred, services & accouterments well above the dive status, and an interesting mix of clientele.  The atmosphere is welcoming, I see everything from suits to shorts, PhDs to dropouts, divas to Bettys  crunching peanut shells beneath their feet as they walk in.  This is about as friendly as it gets in Champaign -  it has  a diverse mix of patrons and many of the staff are actual humans (unlike some of the neighboring places where androids/sullen youth are still learning the basics of interacting with humans).   The beer selection is good, wine selection lame (head across the street to Bacaro if you are jonesing for vino), and the mixed drinks are great as far as they go. They make their pineapple-steeped tequila if you are looking for something unique to make your date's undies fall off.   There's decent pub food. For the last 15 years I have said they had the best burger in town, but the last one I had was lame - i hope it was an outlier but I got to be honest with you. I like the pizzas, but they are no hand tossed, wood oven style that I love in Rome. Instead, they remind me of an upscale version of what we used to get from small town places in the midwest called \"Pizza King\", crispy, moderately thin crust and unlike the PK, the 'squire's have better, but not pretentious, topping options. If you want better eats, take a short walk to one of the restaurants nearby.  When the weather is good, there's outdoor patio seating.    There are large screens that are not too obtrusive, but this is not a sports bar unless it is a game of local import, the TV sound may be off and the jukebox may be playing an eclectic mix that span the genres reflective of the patron demographics. Other entertainment options, beyond your friends or friendly banter with the other patrons, include pool tables, darts, and some machine games."}
{"text":"love love love this place. after moving here in september, me and my boy went looking for a bar where we could totally relax, actually hear each other (even at 12 am), have some cheap beer, and possibly even play some pool. welp, we found all of that, and some, at esquire. they have the cheapest (and strongest) drinks in the area, tons of seating (though can get crowded later on on the weekends), a juke box with some great tunes, and awesome service (try to get art as a server and you will be extremely content all night long). oh, and did i mention they have free peanuts? or that you simply spit the peanut shells out on the floor? yeah, it's that type of place....i love it. all of it. and i also love their special pineapple-induced tequila. to die for. basically they put tequila and pineapple in some sort of jar for a week and then serve it out and it is simply delicious...can't get enough of them. this is the perfect place to go at night, or during the day to watch a game and have a few beers/pitchers ($5 red stripe pitchers cannot be beat).  the mix of people is also nice to see...everyone from people sitting at the bar flying solo to couples at a table and to groups of 12 sitting around a larger table in the back room. awesome awesome awesome. the only reason i am not giving this place 5 stars is because i haven't tried the food. once i do, i'll be back to recap on that...."}
{"text":"I go to Esquire a fair amount, but mostly for the pineapple tequila margaritas. They're to die for, and often the only thing I order here. Otherwise, the spirits and beer selections are okay. It's about on par with the rest of the downtown bars (similar to Jupiters, for instance). The pool space is nice and open as well. I'm not a huge fan of the aesthetic (my inner OCD hates the peanut shell on the floor schtick) but it's a pretty good bar.  The food, on the other hand, has been consistently underwhelming. I haven't tried the pizza yet, but that's because I've been unimpressed by the other stuff I have tried. The appetizers tend to be greasy, and the chicken fingers were weak. Plus food normally takes forever to come out of the oven.  In short, come for the booze, but eat beforehand."}
{"text":"This is the first bar I visited when I moved here five years ago. It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart.  It's a good place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice array of seating options: small tables, mid-size tables, large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't too a ton of good in the dead of winter, it's lovely on brisk autumn nights.  The people who frequent this place are an interesting mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging around, which I think we can all agree is pretty delightful. (I do not advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth.)  One of the best, most endearing things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this, and for that I am truly grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun and a great place to come out and shoot pool with friends but I can't stand coming here for lunch. I don't know why I bothered trying a second time. So my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation. I ordered the burger the first time and a hot dog the second. I guess some people don't mind having a communal condiments station but I have a problem with this. The fresh produce like pickles, onions, and lettuce are not refrigerated at all at the communal condiments station. I mean at least puts some cold ice under the box of pickles, lettuce, and onions at least! The ketchup bottle and mustard container all looked like it was ready for the dump. The tips were hardened and crustified and it just looked out of date because no one bothered to keep em clean. Stickyness galore. Wash your hands if you still decide to go. Anyway, minus food but fun joint. Proceed with caution cuz after a few beers you might just make a drunk order of food and realize you got yourself into a bigger mess then you had planned."}
{"text":"I came back here with a friend on a random Thursday night as we both felt it was too early to call it a night, but weren't looking for a venue with dance music blaring in our ears nor were we interested in having to shove through the crowds to get a drink.  At Esquire, we managed to secure a pool table (only $6 an hour!!), got cheap drinks, and just had a relaxing low-key night.  Plus, I got to work on honing my pool-skills (or lack thereof =P)."}
{"text":"This place is the most laid-back, chill, bar that I have ever been to. The people here are mostly an older crowd, but they make you feel right at home.   I like this place because their burgers are cheap and you can get the side stuff (lettuce, tomato, etc.) yourself at a different table and can therefore get allllll the pickles that your heart desires. Not to mention, unlimited peanuts!"}
{"text":"Although I enjoy coming to the Esquire, I have sat on the side where the bartender Rich works. On more than one occasion this man acts as if we are in his way rather than welcoming us as guests. Last time we were there he was in a particularly bad mood, being nasty to his fellow workers and acting as if the patrons were in his way. I come to a bar to have a relaxed fun evening, Rich has more than once made the evening very uncomfortable.  I have been in the bar when Rich wasn't working, and when he is not there the people behind the bar are relaxed, they smile, and seem to have fun, but when Rich is there everyone is on edge and grumpy. God forbid anyone does anything in his \"territory\", they get a nasty look.   This man is more worried about making sure that everything behind the bar is in its place and perfect, than he is about giving good service to his customers, he will walk by an empty glass many times without asking if you need another drink, you have to flag him down.  I think he has been there much too long, and has lost the knowledge that the customer comes first."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very reasonable prices, friendly staff, nice atmosphere with a wide range of customers. Will come again."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong for the price. Cheap beer, great food.  My two favorite items are the portobello sandwich (the size of my head) and the pizzas.  Also, the fried broccoli is really good."}
{"text":"Are you a functioning alcoholic looking for cheap, strong drinks? Are you an elephant looking for a source of all you can eat peanuts? If you answered yes to one of these questions, then Esquire is the place for you. Strong drinks,. free peanuts, powerful outdoor heat lamps. The only downside is the 2am cut off."}
{"text":"My favorite bar. Great mix of people combined with the best thin crust pizza around (love the garden pizza) and topped off with a Crooked Tree on tap. I've never left disappointed!"}
{"text":"Big, bright space so you won't feel closed in by others. The pool tables can be a major draw if you're into that thing. The free peanuts feel like a premium, which is nice, and I even enjoy crunching shells underfoot. The food is good though not for anyone watching their diet, of course. Years ago, I had the best black bean burger I've ever eaten there, and even though I've reupped with the carnivore crew ever since, I still miss that burger. Oh, and you've got to try the pineapple tequila. These are the positives.   Negatives: their mixed drinks can be odd. I once ordered a whiskey and ginger ale, and I swear their ginger ale was Coke and Sprite. The place is often under the sway of the regulars, which is fine in general, but it sometimes created an in-crowd feel that affected service. There were times where friends and I felt straight up unwelcome, like a burden to certain staff. Not sure if he's there anymore, but the old bearded guy was the prime example of that.  Since I usually don't eat when I'm out drinking, the Esquire never felt like a must go sort of place, and a snooty staff only made it more passable.   Easter egg: seek out the secret bathrooms."}
{"text":"I stopped into Esquire Lounge for a couple hours in the evening while waiting for the 7:59 PM Amtrak train back to Chicago. This place is right across the street from the station. I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo as well. It was THAT kind of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. There are larger tables as well, so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college football games. There are decent sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out to the classics. And perhaps best of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, and even the students are cool with the townies.  The beer selection was surprisingly good. There were a lot of good import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty good as well. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not my favorite burger/fries combo, it was definitely worth the $4.50 I paid. The \"fixin's table\" they have is nothing more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special there. But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.  The charm of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating. The cheap food and beer is an added bonus. And I almost forgot, free peanuts! If I return to Champaign any time soon, I will definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"After a stressful day of test taking, my friend and I just wanted to relax, eat, and it was a beautiful day so we preferred somewhere outside.  She had been to Esquire before and said the burgers were good.    I really like the place.  I had the chicken tender sandwich with fries, and it was FABULOUS.  Everything a fried chicken finger sandwich could be.  At first it was delivered to the table empty, just a bun and chicken fingers.  But then I was told of the \"Fixin's Table\" where I got to add my own lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and a sauce(s) of my choosing.   I enjoyed sitting outside and watching the people walk by.  And when my other friend showed up with her dogs, they didn't mind at all.  And she loved that they had Fat Tire on tap.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.  The only problem with sitting outside is that you do not get to throw your peanut shells on the floor- you have to bring a bowl outside for the shells... ah well...  On those cold winter nights I can throw my shells on the floor inside."}
{"text":"Nice place to watch sports, enjoy cheap (but tasty and local) beer, and hang out with friends.  Several offerings from Triptych, Revolution and Riggs. You can get pints or order pitchers.   Didn't order food last night but have enjoyed the pizza in the past food. Typical bar food but prepared well!"}
{"text":"Ruthie AW Harper (unregistered) says:  LadyLuv The Place Where Everyone Feels @ Home...  You get the complete package; Good Food, Good Drinks, Friendly Servers and a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me this place has some fantastic Pizza (she being of the skinny eat nothing calorie-full type), and well, I made a mistake of listening to her! It was a Saturday night, when the bar is super crowded.  We were a group of 4, and as always finding parking spots on downtown Champaign can be a such a chore in weekends.   Anyway, you order your food to the bartenders. Waiting for the bartender to notice you in a crowded bar could be ok if you want to order a beer or shot, but for food? I don't like the idea.   I ordered a Greek Pizza, while the aforementioned friend ordered a garden pizza (I can't remember the name now, but it was their vegetarian pizza) . To be honest, I dodn't like either of them. The Greek one was a disaster. It had clusters of feta cheese spread over a thin crust, and almost nothing else. It was supposed to have sausage, but I couldn't taste any. The vegetarian one, although being the better one, was kind of juicy. A juicy pizza is NOT my favorite.   I'm not against non-American-style thin crust pizzas. As a matter of fact, I love Jupiter's pizzas. But these ones, well, you heard me. There should be a reason these were so cheap (I guess around $7), and I now know it."}
{"text":"This is where I learned to drink. No seriously, my first regular bar, back in the 20's. Massive, sometimes a bit loud, but it's home. Grad students, old school folks, younger crowds... this spot is a mix socially, and really that's what a bar should be. Except for one old fuck that bartends, the staff is always consistently great. Great selection of booze. Food is good for being \"bar food\", a big shout out to the BOH there, small space cranking out the food."}
{"text":"Great alcohol. However I was with a group of 3 and we ordered multiple drinks because we are all semi alcoholics and they told us we could only have one drink each. You all have lint butt."}
{"text":"Synopsis: This place is a dive which alot of people find happen to find sentimentally appealing.   ..........MMM OK- it's actually more of a watering hole. You know, an acceptable environment within which to get your drank on. It's just impersonal enough that townies, transplants, and recent grads can tolerate one another- and low enough on the ego scale that they may let their guard down enough to interact with one another for a moment.  The food and the men's bathroom share some compelling similarities- they are both occasionally necessary, routinely \"less-than-fresh\", and exist in the same realm between offensive and forgettable."}
{"text":"I only put one star because it will not allow me to write a review without it- otherwise 0 stars. Will not return or recommend anyone else visits this establishment. Service was horrible on a night that was no more busy than the average, the place was filthy (not just peanuts on the ground) and the employees were RUDE! We asked for 2 waters and one server said \"sorry I'm too busy for that right now\". The food was average, nothing like what the other reviews here say.  We visited due to the outstanding Yelp reviews, but were extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"There's something quite nice about this place. I've heard they're quite cheap with the drinks here, but I'm more a fan of the food. Every pizza I've had here has been really delicious. The ambiance is worth the visit as well, a traditional joint with pool tables on the side.   But the bathrooms...avoid the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Love this place. I eat here at least 4 times a week. It has it's own charm and staff are all friendly once you get to know them."}
{"text":"Staff are great, though service can be slow if the place is very busy, which is understandable because the food is amazing. I tried the steak garden salad and the meat was cooked to perfection. Most restaurants serve bland salads or poor cuts of red meat, but not Esquire!"}
{"text":"Great prices on drinks and food. The thin crust pizza is delicious. Good selection of draft beers."}
{"text":"Cheap beer, dive bar, great company, and holy crap--did everyone just eat a hojillion peanuts and dump their shells on the floor?  Really? What the hell, it's a great dive bar.  I cant' even hate on it.  The booths are big and comfy, the setting is as nonpretentious as it gets, and the peeps are chill as hell--and most likely you're not gonna run into many undergrads ;)"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to champaign last Thursday and after unpacking we needed a bite to eat.  It was pretty late, so we were very sceptical about the quality of places that would be open around midnight.  We chose Esquire lounge secondary to their variety of food options and full bar.  We arrive and it wasn't very busy inside about 4 other tables besides us.  Our waiter came over promptly and took our drink orders while we looked over the menu.    Drinks: I ordered a absolute cosmo and the hubby ordered a Blue Moon.  I have to say my Cosmo was amazing.  The flavors went together well and there was a strong kick to the drink.  The bartender was a older gentlemen with a beard and he a was handling almost the entire restaurant; kudos to the bartender.  When the waiter brought over our drink orders he also took our food order.  We ordered the mozzarella sticks and a sausage and pepperoni pizza.  We started drinking our drinks and waited for our food, and waited, and waited, and waited..........  We finally asked our waiter what was the hold up????  He went back into the kitchen to inquire but when he came out still no food, saying \"its coming\".  So we waited some more...by this time we were almost finished with our drinks and getting annoyed.  At a couple of minutes, we notice the waiter talking to someone from the kitchen, they come over and tell us that it will a little while longer due the the chef burning the pizza :/  I reply, \"well what about the moz sticks\" and they inform us they were trying to time the food together.  Still annoyed but knowing there was nothing we could do if we wanted food, we were like \"well could we at least get the sticks\"?.  They said yes and was very apologetic about the food.  The manager told us secondary to the inconvenience they would comp everything.  We were super surprised at their great customer service.  Most places, even though it was their mistake about the food, would not be as accommodating as the Esquire staff!  We were very impressed with their level of professionalism!  Food: The moz stick came out first and they were so delicious.  They were the hard batter kind and had loads of cheese inside:)  The dish came with about 6-7 sticks and marinara sauce.  After eating about 3 I was totally kinda full (they were so big)! Then they came the pizza, it was loaded with sausage and pepperoni, it looked very tasty. However, it tasted even better!  We moved from Buffalo, NY and we literally hated the pizza there. So this was so refreshing, we ate  the crap out of the pizza. We were so very surprised of the quality food secondary to us thinking it was only a college bar but the food and their service surprised us. Due to both of those things, although the food and drinks were comped, we could not help but leave a $20 tip! They totally earned it!  We definitely will be visiting Esquire again, the food was wonderful, the drinks were great, and service AMAZING.  See you soon Esquire!"}
{"text":"Esquire rocks. The place is dirt cheap and the food is simple and good. 1.50 pints of old style and 3 dollar grilled cheese sandwiches make this place my cheap go to in Champaign. They also have free peanuts which are good when you are too cheap to buy the cheap food, like I am sometimes. It's a bit of an old man bar but the cheapness makes up for it in my mind. Also, they have a number of large pool tables. The place can be pretty packed on a Fri or Sat night as well so it makes for a good time."}
{"text":"Esquire is the perfect place to stop for an after work beer, an evening out, or any occasion really. It's one of those places that makes you feel welcome right when you walk in the door.  They always have a solid rotation of different beers on draft featuring the typical staples along with local brews. I really like that you can get a pint for yourself or a pitcher to share (or not, if that's your thing).   The food never disappoints. It's just really good bar food, nothing fancy. I'm partial to their burgers, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Come in with an appetite and want something to snack on before you get your food? They have peanuts, and you can just crack them and throw the shells on the floor.   If you're downtown looking for a great bar with a welcoming atmosphere and friendly service, look no further. Esquire has got you covered. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is great for what it is. Cheap food, cheap beer and alcohol (hefty wine pours!), and a nice atmosphere. Service was super fast. Salad was surprisingly fresh (and only $3.50!). Pizza was great. Throwing peanuts on the ground was fun. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"I don't remember my first visit to the Esquire. I suspect I'm not alone, but my reasons probably differ. See, I was less than a year old at the time, and I likely wasn't into doing much more than staring out the window at the buses or blinking up at the moving Hamm's sign.  Luckily for me, I have been to Esquire many more times since. You could say I grew up throwing peanut shells on the floor and stomping on them. (For the record, I still throw the shells on the floor, but I no longer do the accompanying dance--that stopped being cute around age eight.) Before my family moved away from Champaign, this was the number one place we would take out of town relatives visiting. Even as objectively yummier, cooler places opened up around town, Aunt So-and-so and Uncle Whatshisface would always demand to be taken back to Esquire, and we were always happy to oblige. It's a comfortable, unpretentious bar, and that's what you needs sometimes.  It's all about the ambiance, really. There are better burgers in town, but at Esquire it's the whole package that keeps me coming back. That and those peanuts. For real."}
{"text":"Best bar in Champaign (IMHO) and the closest thing to \"Cheers\" in Champaign. Decent beer selection. Peanuts in the shell, eat them and throw the shells on the floor. 4 pool tables. Relaxed and laid back. Used to be a townie bar, then they expanded it and all types hang out there. Just your basic, no frills, hang out with your buddies, BAR."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere, free peanuts, and $4.75 pitchers of PBR? ... Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This place is vastly different from any of the other restaurants downtown because its atmosphere is neither pretentious nor dumpy.  It somehow manages to straddle the line in such a way that nobody really seems to feel out of place there.  The burgers are some of the best in Champaign.  They have a good char-grilled taste to them that so many other, more pretentious, places lack.  There are a large number of sides to select from, including fried mushrooms, onion rings, french fries, potato chips (which, sadly, just come from a bag), fried broccoli, and Asian dumplings (which my friends tell me are fantastic).  I've had the polish sausage once, and it was passable, but nothing special.  The pizza is good and comes in a number of varieties.  The one complaint I have is that the service can be especially hit-and-miss.  There have been times I've been served wonderfully, and there have been times I've been ignored for a half-hour just to refill my drink.  Overall, Esquire is a down-to-earth place with good prices and good food."}
{"text":"Gluten-free beer! Two Brothers Prarie Path. Vegan/vegetarian options for food: black bean burger and Portobello mushroom sandwich. Double check the bread situation if you're gluten-free.  I celebrated New Year 2018 here. It was a happening scene with a great local band playing... I wish I could remember their name!  Any place where you can get free peanuts and toss the shells on the floor is alright by me.  Great spot for a quick drink, billards, or just watching a game. I'm sure I'll be here a few times while I'm in Champaign."}
{"text":"The quintessential neighborhood bar.  I was able to stop by for lunch one day on a brief visit back to town.  Same faces, same food, same friendly atmosphere.  Not a gastropub, not an elite bar, just a solid dive bar.  Love this place.

{"text":"Where else can you get 2 polish sausages, fries and 2 beers for $13?  Good food, great prices- nice relaxed atmosphere.  Esquire is definitely a place to be visited when in Champaign!"}
{"text":"Came here again with a friend, recently. Can't drink because of doc's orders on some acupuncture I'm doing. So I ended up ordering a cherry coke. Tasted delicious, although the waiter got it wrong when I said I wanted no ice. What can you do? Still, I got around 3 refills for free. You can't beat that. Peanuts are free, delicious, and a fun thing to do on the side of conversation. And they're free too, if you didn't know. So another bonus. Had the BLT which tasted nice. Also fries, which were solid. Finally, polished everything else off with the famous Asian dumplings (they still haven't changed the name, which is to be expected but no less irritating). I'll stop complaining when they start calling the burgers \"Euro-American.\" Anyway, I'll still probably come to this place years after I'm only \"visiting\" CU. Nostalgia, if nothing else. Friendly service all around, value for money (cheap prices for decent helpings of food), decent ambiance, and a fixture of downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"The food is decent....if you can get someone to bring it to you! My last experience at the Esquire was very disappointing; we sat down at a table and waited for someone to come up to us....we lost our patience when a waitress looked straight at us and walked away! In the past I've had other \"iffy\" encounters as well--where servers have forgotten drinks, etc. It's too bad because this bar has a lot of potential but it's like whoever is running it just doesn't care about the experience of their customers. There are plenty of other bars around; I don't see myself ever going back!"}
{"text":"Nice lounge with real people.  The patrons are friendly, easy going and mature, and the music is eclectic - James Brown, Tom Waits, the Black Crowes...keep going.  Good hamburgers and cheddar broccoli.  Also a great black bean burger.  Excellent place to grab lunch.  Reminds me of Southport Avenue in Chicago."}
{"text":"you know you're in a sweet bar when you spend more money on the jukebox than you do on drinks. esquire has one of the best jukeboxes i've ever come across, and over the years i have probably played every song at least twice!  great divey bar. students, regulars, pool sharks. peanut shells on the floor. pinball machine, old school table bowling, pool tables, and plenty of booths and tables to relax in.  they make their own pineapple infused tequila- get some in a margarita and you won't be disappointed! also excellent bar food- dumplings and fried broccoli are some of my drunk favorites.  the only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the pool is a bit pricey. $9 for 2 hours? lame."}
{"text":"I spend too much time here, drinking, eating peanuts, playing pool, dancing. Very fun place to hang with your friends"}
{"text":"I really don't understand how this place can be held in such high regard.  There isn't a particularly good drink selection, the food is terribly mediocre (the burgers are just terrible), and the bar itself has not a remarkable characteristic in sight.  While all that is bad enough, I've always felt that the employees here are tremendously standoffish with anyone under 40, and this is the only place I've been to downtown where they'll chase your party down after you walk in the door.    With so many fantastic places in downtown Champaign, the only reason this one hasn't gone out of business has to be the location."}
{"text":"The pizza is a little subpar but the vibe is good; really comfortable, fun local bar."}
{"text":"Mostly great venue.  Beer selection is good.  Easy to get to.  Food is ok.  Salmon is awesome.   Just a few times there was an issue with either too much noise from the TV or jukebox so I couldn't hear the person next to me."}
{"text":"The Esquire is an excellent place for delicious bar food, peanuts, and Strongbow.  If, for some reason, you do not like Strongbow, they have a decent beer and alcohol selection otherwise.  It's not the most sanitary place in the world -- which if you're sober can be kind of off-putting -- but otherwise it's a great place to go any day of the week."}
{"text":"Giving all the props because we were at Guidos bar & had terrible service & warm beer. Came here after ,.,Jessica was excellent bartender. Quick, concerned ,,really knows how to make money! Greet guests, talk to them even when you r so busy & suggest items. Let's you drink a little before. killing u with ordering ..at the bar!!!!. She is awesome!! And will be on our 40% tip group. We may be in our 50's but we're in bar biz & know what one should expect. We spend money,..sorry 019 at Guidos,,,you lost out & need to learn the biz"}
{"text":"The service was terrible and not to mention there were bugs on the windows, sad to say that there was even one that left on my clothing...disgusting!!! Do not recommend, or plan on returning"}
{"text":"I had the greatest experience at Esquire.  We went for lunch, and had a waiter who was friendly, talkative and helpful, but not overbearing.  Our food was delicious, came hot, and was inexpensive.   The BEST thing was that we were talking about how we love Strongbow on draft, and our waiter chimed in that he thought Bentley's had it-- and actually CALLED over there to make sure! It was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Traveling from out of town and wanted to watch a hockey game. Everything we ate was great. The prices on everything were so low! Beer & shot specials made it easy to buy rounds for people around us and have a great time.   The real shining star of this place were the servers. I don't think I've ever found a more accommodating staff.  Lisa \"999\" :) was extraordinary.  She went out of her way to set us up so we could enjoy the game and was extremely attentive as were the two other male servers.  If I lived here this bar would be my regular place.  Wings were good, thin crust pizza was good, Asian dumplings were good.  Good draft beer selections available by pitcher."}
{"text":"Came to this place to end the night after celebrating a friend's birthday. Shared fries, fried potstickers, pizza and chicken tenders. The food was decent. Either that or I was starving - probably the latter. The server was a bit pushy and had an attitude. After we ate, we played a few rounds of pool. At this point I probably would've gave this place 3 stars but it's what happened at the end of the night that completely turned my night sour. As we were leaving, a staff member came and started screaming bloody murder at us. I was stunned and asked my friends what was going on. From how she was acting you would've thought someone had gotten killed. Turns out my friend forgot to pay for pool. She was out her damn mind yelling at us like she was crazy! The way this woman acted was completely rude and unprofessional. There are numerous ways she could've dealt with this situation and the way she chose was completely and utterly unacceptable. Honestly don't know how this place is still in business. Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Yeah, it's THAT bad. I will NOT be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I wanted Pizza - I wanted Good Pizza - Lady Di posted a picture of her lunch on facebbok - and the picture was PIZZA from Esquire Lounge! It looked DMN Good! So on Saturday I ordered one --- Sausage Cheese and Mushrooms..  I have traveled from Coast to Coast - my dad loved tasking me to a place in chicago and spending upwards of 80.00 on what is known as Chicago's Famous Pizza ... Can't touch Esquire Lounge Pizza --- Too Bad I don't drink... So (5) Star!   When I walked in the female bar attendant ingnored me TOTALY - Then a kind gentleman from the back came over drying his hands - all smiles and was California Kind! Sorry I did't tip him... But the female waitress had me SHOCKED! This is 2015 -  THIS PLACE WILL SEE ME AS OFTEN AS I WANT A SNACK! LOL! HAPPY !"}
{"text":"I'm not exactly what keeps me coming back to Esquire, I just really like the place. They don't seem to do anything special, but they serve good bar food in a quiet little restaurant. The super relaxed environment is definitely part of the appeal for me. My wife and I were able to go out for a cheapish, chill date night."}
{"text":"My last visit to Champaign treated me to some wonderful places to spend some quality time with friends. Murphy's Pub, The Blind Pig, and others. I would not put Esquire on that list. The decor is uninteresting at best. There is no personality. It's designed to appeal to a crowd that just wants a nice bright place to hang out and drink. Not being a drinker, I can't rate the Esquire on that, but I can rate them on the food, and the food is so forgettable, I forgot to review it. Our group had a couple of burgers, some wings, and a chicken sandwich. I was told the burgers were good. The chicken must be avoided at all costs. The sandwich is one of those strange creations that takes chicken strips and puts them on a bun. I'm not entirely sure why, as this makes an awkward eating experience. The strips were nearly tasteless. Thank goodness for mayonaise. My wife had the wings. After one or two, she was trying to figure out why they didn't seem right. I was going to eat them, but I couldn't, and I LOVE wings. These things had enough salt to turn Lake Michigan into a salt lake. They were awful.  I would not go back at all. I'll eat diner food, fast food, and other kinds of food, but not Esquire Food. Meh."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place and had to try it, but I sincerely do not know what all the hype is about. The food was ok, but just ok. With all the other options in downtown Champaign I probably will not be visiting this place again. It was not a horrible experience, but I also have no reason to come back again."}
{"text":"I'm liking this spot!  Not quite a dive; you can eat free peanuts and toss shells on the floor, so almost.  Most reasonable damn drink prices in town.  Cheap good noms: black bean burger, daily soups, fried brocco, and best of all asian dumplings.  Larger inside than seems it'd be- there are many pool tables, 2 bars, lots of booths.  Music low enough to hold conversation if so inclined.  Not a shit-ton of kids (undergrads) around to annoy.  Good spot to get your grown-folks drink on.  Did I mention the most reasonable drink prices around?  Three pints of PBR under 5 bucks for the win!"}
{"text":"Surely a place you can feel at home and neighborhood bar with good food good people good owners. The staff is amazing and the food is truly delicious and the price tag on the meal and drinks is not bad either. Fairprice diverse menu full bar that's not expensive it's a nice place to go any time for lunch or for dinner and it's a perfect place that you can bring in the whole family for lunch or an early dinner"}
{"text":"My number 1 \"go-to\" place.  Great food, great drinks, and a great place to just hang out.  The \"Cheers\" of Champaign! Not too long after moving here I stopped in for lunch one day, and that had me hooked.  Lots of friendly regulars hanging out at the bar!  And unlike many bars, the kitchen is open until closing, great for a late night snack or late meal."}
{"text":"This is a townie joint with awesome staff, great beer selections, and fantastic pizza. The interior is cordial, with two main rooms including a bar area and a more loungy second room. Two pool tables available and usually a fun, relaxing environment."}
{"text":"I will sometimes just sit outside and eat alone here, especially when it's not busy. The food is typical casual American fare, but the quality meets the prices. Service can be a bit snarky at times, though."}
{"text":"You know you're going to have an interesting night when some random dude swipes some of your fries while you're playing pool. ha! Needless to say the first time I went to Esquire there was a bachelor party and it was hilarious to watch the crazy activities.   The selection of booze is fine, there is even a batch of peanuts to grab and munch on while you're hanging out. I tried their fried broccoli recently, it's soooo addicting.   The place can be a tad messy, obviously because of the peanuts, and it definitely has a mix of townies and college kids, but it's a pretty fun place to go to for a hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Best. Ribeye. Steak. Sandwich. Ever.  Plus good bartenders and hush puppies! You might also want to check out the billiards. Several good quality tables.   Large booths accommodate 6 comfortably and can put together tables for larger groups. Hopping on the weekends."}
{"text":"You can't go to Champaign and miss stopping by Esquire's. Nice atmosphere, good food."}
{"text":"We love to stop here when in town.   Great food, beer selection, pool tables & juke box !!!     Customer service is a 10!!"}
{"text":"A good bar to hang out, watch some sports, and to eat late-night food. I really like their chicken wings and Asian dumplings, and I'm looking forward to trying some of their other food. The customer service is pretty good even when the bar is crowded."}
{"text":"So me and my husband go here all the time and we gambell if we got it..seldom drink more less eat and run..most the time my husband orders same pizza everytime depending on who takes his order if it comes out right and i flip flop between pizza a hamburgers with fried broccoli..i most the time i have a great experience when everything pans out..."}
{"text":"Why, yes, I would like to drink a lot, play pool, AND watch the game, all at the same time! Because, really, they have everything here at the Esquire.   Cheap drinks, good service, pool, and TVs everywhere; what more could you ask for?!  I love the peanuts thing they do, and I love the whole feel of throwing the shells on the floor! I feel like a rebel for making a mess, hehe. Their fries are wonderful to chow down on when you're feeling pretty happy, and their honey mustard is ridiculously good (not sure what kind they use, but I need that in my life!).   I was a little disappointed they didn't have Bulleit bourbon, but it could just be a southern thing. I got over it quickly, Makers is a good substitution in my Old Fashioneds.   Two thumbs up for Esquire! Will definitely be back next time I'm visiting Champaign"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have never been disappointed in their Bleu Pear Pizza. It is an amazing amalgam of cheese, pear and pine nuts that surprises you from the first bite. Don't come out to the Esquire and not try this pizza! Oh, and if you enjoy smoking cigars, (as I do) they allow smoking out on the patio which is always fun on a warm summer night. The people that sit out on the patio are always so friendly and the staff is quite attentive to your needs as well. This place is situated right in downtown Champaign which is such a nice place to be, and there are dozens of other things to do if you are starting your night here."}
{"text":"First off let me say that I am definitely a city girl so restaurants like Esquire are not really my type. I have dietary restrictions and I need to be picky. I came here with my mom and sister to grab some food on Sunday. It seemed to be the only place open. I ordered the portabella mushroom sandwich (super bland), my sister got the chicken salad (she said it was pretty good), and my mom ordered the salmon.  Overall the food was nothing special to me however coming from the city to this little suburb area the price for the food was pretty amazing. The salmon only cost $7 and it was a fairly big portion.   The servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load. I wont be back here but that mostly has to do with the lack of food options."}
{"text":"A crew of us were looking for a couple of drinks after an event at nearby Destihl. We started wandering in the direction of activity, and wound up at Esquire Lounge. They were showing the NFL game for the sports fans in tow, and had pool tables for the sports haters in the group, so it was a win. The tap selection is extensive enough to not offend anyone, and pitchers are a solid deal.   We grabbed a picture of Blind Pig's U of IPA and started the clock on a pool table. Our group wound up staying for a couple of hours. The chill atmosphere, well-maintained pool tables (seriously, some bars just do not take care of them!), and reasonable pitcher prices definitely made us stay here instead of continuing the night elsewhere. I have no clue how the food is, but I'd certainly recommend this as a place to grab a few drinks. It seemed popular with both locals and visitors, which is always a good sign!"}
{"text":"Kind of underwhelming place overall. Average beer selection and limited food selection (their pizza is probably the best thing I've had). Feels like a 90's bar that hasn't done a great job of staying with the times.  That being said, there is a nice energy throughout. Staff is great and service is prompt and friendly. The News Gazette has an Illini-based sports talk radio show there on mondays that is always a good time."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat and grab a beer with little kids after a long drive. We were also looking for something with a \"college\" feel considering its a college town and we are about 10 years out of college. Nostalgia gets me every time. This place had a much older crowd (on a Monday)...think 45 year old regulars, but what do you expect on a Monday night? The draft beer selection was ok. They have one Bell's, Guiness and Harp on tap, but that's as \"crafty\" as it gets at the front bar (the back bar was closed and may have had more available). The food was only OK. We got a small personal pizza and a steak sandwich. Neither one was that great. The staff was super friendly and GREAT with the kids. The price was also right."}
{"text":"Coming from California, these are the cheapest drinks I've ever encountered! We called ahead of time to ask them to play the niners game, even though the bears / packers were the favored game of the day (and time). They had a TV set up all ready with the niners game when I got there.  There are peanut shells all over the ground, which I find a little tacky and dangerous. The Pizza was pretty decent - thin crust. We ordered the Hawaiian although we substituted BBQ sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce.  There are fun pool tables and other arcade games. A jukebox for your favorite tunes can be found near the bar, i think.  This place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign."}
{"text":"It used to be a towny bar but I think more recently there are younger people who frequent.  It's not trendy.. it's more laid back.  They do make good drinks and you get free peanuts.  When I say drinks.. I mean things like rum and coke.  If you ask for a mojito or margherita..those can be disasters.  The service is also excellent.  The reason why I keep going back.. their fried broccoli (even if you don't like broccoli) or fried dumplings (even if you're Asian).  I go back all the time because of that.  The other stuff is just average in my opinion."}
{"text":"Solid, affordable, delicious food. Favorite item is the grilled salmon salad but it's a great casual restaurant offering stick-to-your-ribs selections. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely a casual place with decent service. However during the food experience, the appetizer quantity for Asian dumplings was 16, but I only got 8..."}
{"text":"Holy hell. What have I been doing with my life? My grad program loves to party here, but for whatever reason I had never come. I am regretting all the times I went to campus bars. I'm not a grown up by any stretch of the imagination, but this place had no undergrads in sight. Plus, the deals! 18 Asian dumplings for around 5-6 dollars? Delicious black bean burger for about 5 bucks? Gin and tonic (my standard drink) for less than 4 bucks? What is not to love?  Add in the great service, the nice sized televisions for sporting events, pool tables that I am dying to try, and quiet music so we can actually talk to each other and hear ourselves think, and I'm still kicking myself for only checking this place out now. Plus free peanuts! I LOVE FREE PEANUTS. Now, granted, this was a rather quiet Thursday, so we'll have to see what happens if/when it gets busy. But so far, all systems go."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night and it was really packed. Our waitress was really busy and it took her about 20 minutes to ask us what we wanted. The seating area is kind of cramped; chairs were often back-to-back. Their pizza is good, though, and they had decent drink prices."}
{"text":"I only went there once but I really liked it.  I have never been to a place where it felt so comfortable.  I got a burger which was pretty good and reasonably priced.  They have free peanuts and the atmosphere is great.  I sat outside and it was just a really comfortable place to be.  Everyone there was friendly and just relaxing.  Service and atmosphere is the best part of the place."}
{"text":"This will be a review down memory lane.  I grew up in this bar, much like Jackie H's review.  One of the bartenders was my little league baseball coach, then I played on the bars soft ball team.  Even though I have not lived in Chamaign for about 10 years, I can still find people I know, and bartenders that remember me.  When I was little I would order kiddy cocktails from the bar, then get change to play on the only pinball machine.  Then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor.  I have seen expansion many times.  Originally from one bar and a few booths, to a wrap around bar, then finally to the pool hall and extra bar area that you see now.  I have met U of I basketball coaches here, there are pictures of former Cubs players kissing my Mom (wait, what).  My parents originally met here.  It is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here.  Anyway, beyond the nostalgia, it is one of the best pubs to visit in the downtown area.  Just a great place to relax and have a few drinks.  Along with the evolution of the bar, so has the menu.  Now there is a mix of pub grub like burgers, fish sandwiches, etc.  Which I don't think are that great.  Though the various pizzas are very good.  As are the wings, which I am not typically a fan of.  Though these are baked, not fried and battered like most.  The Asian Dumplings are great as well.  The service can be hit or miss.  Depending on the time you come, and where you order.  Bar service is pretty good, but the waitresses can be a bit confused when trying to find you after you place the order.  Though they work hard, and always take care of anything that might be wrong.  Drinks are pretty standard.  There are a handful of good micros on tap.  Usually something from Two Brothers or Dark Horse as the main micros available on tap.  A bit more extensive selection in bottles.  The rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar.  Overall, not perfect.  Though the goods far out way the bad.  An institution in the downtown Champaign area, and a place I will always love."}
{"text":"I'd like to give Esquire a 1 star to keep people out during move in week.  Excellent place for beer and bar food."}
{"text":"Esquire is a gym-class all star: it performs reasonably well in most areas, and can be counted on not to kick the ball into its own goal, but isn't going to catch the eye of any out-of-town talent scouts or date cheerleaders. Its journeyman efforts will win friends and a few high fives, but it is not the flashy varsity letterman.   Food here is just fine, and very reasonably priced. I have been disappointed with the size of their appetizers once or twice, but their entrees are a solid value, cooked dependably to be exactly what you expect in pub grub. Prices are very good for downtown Champaign, but they lack the booze selection of a Radio Maria or Blind Pig. The gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka.  Service is always friendly, and fastest at the bar. If you sit at their pretty awesome outside tables, the trade off is that you're gonna get ignored. You can order lunch ahead and pick up 15 minutes later. The free peanuts are priceless, as are the friendly patrons who are more likely than other crowds in town to strike up a convo with you.   All this sounds pretty complimentary, but the fact is that this place is not stand-out awesome in any particular way. If you want to take your friends from Chicago to visit 4 places in downtown Champaign that are all different from each other, to give them an idea of what the \"new\" Champaign has to offer, you aren't going to stop at Esquire. Of course, that's just fine with me. I'll at the end of the bar eating peanuts and saying to some dude I just met holy shit the White Sox sure are Cubbing it hard this September."}
{"text":"Gotta admit that the name of the place belies what's actually inside. When I hear the word \"Esquire,\" I think formal and gentlemen. What I got was scattered peanut shells all over the floor and a normal bar scene.   Despite this, this place features some cool billiards. It's a great place to watch sports games and the prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food they serve. They have a condiment bar so you can put as much tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, and/or onions on your food. My burger and fried mushroom meal came out to be $8.49.   And if you're feeling like a hipster, they have PBR pints for a dollar on Sunday."}
{"text":"The food was awful. Reheated frozen food that made me ill afterwards. I'll be avoiding the cuisine in the future..."}
{"text":"Cheap, good pub food.  Don't expect fancy.  This is a great little local watering hole with pretty good food options for an extremely reasonable price.   They have a surprisingly good beer selection and infuse their own liquors.  Seriously a must-try in Chambana."}
{"text":"Hey I saw the Cubs win the World Series here,what else am I supposed to say? I have great memories here . If you gotta watch Chicago sports, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Champaign. So many drinks to choose from, and I e never had a bad meal. If you like tomato soup, you have to come here. They have a tomato bisque soup that is incredible! Definitely a most go to place"}
{"text":"Esquire is one of those bars that definitely grew on me. Ten years into Champaign and I never really visited until last year. I always thought it was where old white men went to watch the Illini lose every game. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This place is a hodgepodge bar: pool for the cool kids, actually alcohol for us AA dropouts, free peanuts and late night eats for the potheads, and respectable cocktails for middle aged women out on the town without their husbands. As a mixture of all of these, I don't show up until 1 or 2am and am always happy to try their awesome fried menu which is cheap (most less than $5) and served until 2am: fried broccoli, crapton of fried dumplings, or steak fries. If you need to watch your health, they also make really good flatbread pizzas. There is always seating because this place is huge including an outdoor patio area. Service is always great and I have honestly never gotten a drink that I disliked. Just for that, I upped my star to four. I believe in you Esquire. Thank you for not letting me down."}
{"text":"Literally what it's advertised as.  Cheap, solid food, no frills.  Great beer selection, nice crowd mixed between the locals and the (typically grad) students.  Super convenient location near the terminal."}
{"text":"This is a great place for quick cheap bar food and drinks.The ambiance can be a little trashy at times but whenever we find ourselves downtown and craving some quick food, this is our go to. The menu is surprisingly diverse and high quality for the prices and you can't beat the free peanuts. Their drink specials are pretty great and they have a pretty impressive selection of beer. I wouldn't make a special trip for it but if you want a cheap place to meet up with friends or find yourself hungry in downtown champaign, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Not so bad, and definitely not traditional bar food. That said, we opt for better food in the downtown area."}
{"text":"My sister and I dropped into the Esquire for a burger and a brew today at lunch. The second vice was great and summer shandy was on tap. The service is great and the decor offers lots of great old photos of historic Champaign. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I go here whenever I'm downtown and need smokes. Last night, was standing in front of Seven Saints doing \"outside things\" and a guy comes up and asks where he can buy a pack of smokes, and I say, \"you can go right there, next door and buy them there. They are $8, but it's right there. Or you can go about 4 blocks that way (points south west) but you might get robbed there. Or you can go about 4 blocks that way (points north west) but you might get robbed there too... or you can go right there and for $8 get a pack of smokes\".  Last night was in there for dinner. The lady again asked \"what do you want?\" we were undecided, I usually leave it to her to decide because she never really wants anything I want. As we were leaving kohls (more on that later) we saw a car with license place MICA, so I offered MIGA, but she said no, because she's not that adventurous. So, we settled on Esquire. But is it really settling on Esquire? When this is your fall back of \"i don't know what to eat\", you are actually living a pretty decent life.  The cheese sticks here are some of the best in town. Not sure why, everyone probably has the same opportunity to get these version from whoever their supplier is, but they don't, so these are the best. The Asian dumplings are what makes me eat here. Don't know why, but they are awesome. The sauce is great too, and there's never any left when I get done, because I suck it out of the paper cup. She gets a grilled cheese. I get the ribeye steak sammich. It's definitely a serviceable ribeye steak sammich. It's not a steak place, so don't ever get a steak rare from not a steak place. I went with medium rare. There's enough juice (fat/blood/whatever) to make the bun deliciously soggy, and the steak is tender and flavorful. The grilled cheese is a grilled cheese. Nothing fancy, nothing bad.  They have Triptych Pretty Nice Little Saturday on tap. They ALWAYS have PNLS on tap. Did you want a pitcher of PNLS, because you can get it here! Within the past 2 years, their craft beer selection has vastly improved. That's probably to the dismay of several of their regulars. Esquire is the TOWNIE bar downtown. It probably has the most eclectic mix of people. After sporting events, the place is almost all orange on the inside. Not too many other bars downtown are that sports friendly. It's kind of the place that people who went to school at U of I 20-30 years ago go to, after they come to a game.  It's a comfort bar. Even though the chairs aren't that comfortable.  There's pool. There's peanuts. There's the asshole in your group who thinks it's funny to fill your pockets with peanut shells."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are pretty good -- thin crust. Get the BBQ chicken. The food isn't amazing but it's pretty good for a lounge/bar. I've tried their sandwich as well with pulled pork. This was very tasty! Had it during lunch time when it's not too busy. Apparently they have a buffet lunch or something. Cool, chill place to check out in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"I go to this bar every single time I'm in Champaign. They have an actual jukebox that's loaded with good stuff, you can eat peanuts and throw the shells on the floor, they have pool tables, and lets not forget, the CONTUSIONS. They're just shots of pineapple infused tequila and even my friends who hate tequila seem to love them.  I also really like this bar because they have some good bar food (lots of fried stuff) and they serve fried food pretty late. This place is also big, so it can feel busy without being shoulder-to-shoulder like some bars. It's just an all around nice place for a chill night or a party with a big group. Probably one of my favorite bars in Champaign. Just make sure you have your ID because they WILL card you!  UPDATE: The jukebox is now gone. I am not happy."}
{"text":"Always a fan.  Been here several times in the PM, have always wanted to try and get in for the salad bar at lunch.  Have done so a couple of times in the last couple of months, and it is great. Wonderful fresh ingredients.  $8ish for salad bar and a bowl of the WONDERFUL clam chowder - that's a good lunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night Jan 14, 2017. We had never been there and we are glad we made our first visit. We ventured in about 11pm and did not eat there so I can not comment on the food.   It was crowded with people consistently coming and going. A fun bar where many new one another but also welcomed first timers. If your looking to sit quietly and sip a martini this is probably not the place to go. But if you are looking to go out, maybe meet some new people, and have some quality drinks than you are at the right place. We are definitely older than many there but that did not matter. People of all ages drinking there.   Bartenders were great and worked their tails off. Friendly and made awesome cocktails. Drinks well made and generous as were the pours on the shots.    My wife commented as we walked out, \"that it was one of the best places to people watch outside of Vegas\". I liked it because all were friendly, fun, and it was a great place to get some quality drinks. Stop in for a drink. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This place is chill and that's chill - but last time I was there I went into the men's room and saw the managers \"special review\".  I then used a roll of teepee to relax and release da demons.   All my friends said to meet them there but something must've come up with everyone of them cuz they never showed up. While I was waiting, I enjoyed the peanuts, workers and Chardonnay.  Anyway, atmosphere was chill - neat ambiance - I stepped in dog poop under our booth.   At this point of the night I had a few too many drinks and wanted to just shimmi and dance, unfortunately there were not any hot guys or girls to house.  It's chill tho."}
