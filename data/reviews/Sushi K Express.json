{"text":"Sushi K is an amazing little sushi takeout place in Cloverdale mall. I was reluctant buying anything because take-out sushi never takes as good as restaurant sushi. However this place makes quality sushi. So, so yummy. The best part is that they usually have deals, buy two and get a California roll for $2..etc they're reasonably priced, not the cheapest but that's a-okay with me because it's so yummy  The best part though, besides the food is that their customer service is excellent. The chefs are always recommending things and the cashier's are really friendly. There are a few tables if you wish to sit down and eat and everything always looks clean. Make sure to grab a stamp card because you WILL be returning for more!"}
{"text":"The four star is for the taste. Their sushi was pretty good - we got Dynamite and Spicy Salmon.  But it is pretty pricey for the portions they gave - around $10 per box, and it was already near the end of the day. For price, i would give this a three star."}
{"text":"It's not bad but the pieces are small and they only give you little packages of soy sauce, ginger and limited wasabi.  I didn't find it reasonable at all for \"mall\" sushi."}
{"text":"This is like Sushi Express but just fresher. The items are prepared on the day they're being sold so it tasted fresher than those you can buy at Metro. The servers are very friendly.   The prices are also very reasonable. Try the green tea sugar free drink and you'll be awake despite of the carb rush.   This inside grandma's mall - Cloverdale and normally not packed."}
