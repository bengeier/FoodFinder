{"text":"Went in for the clam chowder and they didn't have it on a Saturday night!  Give me a break! And they are still pushing that nasty all you can eat shrimp!  No thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, as always.  The wood fire  cooking is an added plus. With only salt and pepper blend the serloin steak is so much beeter. Matched with coconut shrimp with orange sauce and brocolli. I had my starch fix with t h e potato soup and started it all with a blooming onion."}
{"text":"I'll admit it: I like Outback.  However, they are not all created equal.  This one has good food, great service.  They seem to always get the orders right and, like the others, it's still a good deal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pleasant in that it feels rather cozy and the servers are extremely good here.   However, the letdown for me is the food itself.   The filet mignon I ordered looked like it was pan fried and it was the thinnest filet I have ever seen. It was a good cut, though being nice and lean and cooked as requested.   But... I couldn't taste the steak. All I could taste was their salt / seasoning salt. It was completely overbearing. I also ordered a baked potato with nothing on it and steamed broccoli. Well, you guessed it, all it tasted of was salt. I drank so much water afterwards trying to get rid of the salty taste but it just didn't work. Honestly, it was a terrible feeling for what could have been a good meal with pleasant service."}
{"text":"Always a great steak but tonight I'm having the burger and onion bloom. With a cold beer of course.  I got the app 365 on my phone so Tuesdays free onion bloom....or whatever they call it.  Very attentive staff so far.  Really tasty onion.  Really impressed with the burger its best I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"NOT the best experience.  Food was not bad and came out quick but felt very tooken advantage on their new steak and unlimited shrimp deal.  The server Mike F gave me options on everything else we ordered that had an option, down to the lemonade but when I told him and I pointed to the steak and shrimp unlimited deal, he did not ask did I want a filet or sirloin, which I guess the sirloin was the deal, which is what I wanted for $15.99 but he in fact took it upon himself to order me the filet and then bring a bill where it showed they were $28.99 a piece.  Bad thing is that even on this add online, it is very misleading and that is probably why their servers try to get over on their guests as well as the establishment.  Awful advertisement, use better ways to get people in the door and be direct on your promos. I wish I would have asked to speak to a manager but I was trying not to make a seen and in all I  was upset at the server and took it out off his tip.  He definitely should have opted me which steak, I work with servers that do this sort of thing, so I'm very aware. I'm in the industry and this should not have happened."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday for the first time in a while...and I remember why I don't eat at this location. My waitress was Kayla, I think. She never introduced herself. She brought us our appetizer and let us wait for about 25 minutes before taking our order because she thought we had more people coming? Absolutely ridiculous. She didn't even ask, she just assumed we were waiting because there was an extra menu on the table. 25 minutes later we finally order...she drops my ketchup and didn't get my order correct. The people behind us had to speak to the manager because their food wasn't cooked all the way. And the people in front of us were complaining because she got their order wrong as well. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"I never got our servers name. We sat right by the bar in a both I'm in the industry and she was freaking awesome. I don't normally do yelp yet the food and everything was so great. I couldnt wait to write a review.! Steak was cooked perfect along with the crab cake. Strawberry lemonade was so yummy. You guys did awesome keep up the great work!!! :) Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here today for a good steak dinner and of course the Blooming Onion. Well the onion was great but the steaks were over cooked. Everything else was fine. We have been here numerous times and never had an issue. That said, everyone makes mistakes. We did not complain but the waitress realized we were less then satisfied. She told the owner and he came to see what the issue was. He asked how we ordered them and he agreed that they were not right. He said he would take them off our bill and offered us another steak, we declined and told him he didn't need to do that. He responded \"I'm the owner and i can do what i want.\" Now that is costumer service. Very rare these days. Thank you sir and we will continue to frequent your fine establishment. I  highly recommend this Outback Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Another new low in dining service. We were told it would be a 25-minute wait, so we headed to the bar. Were seated at the bar. It took 20 minutes just to get any bartender to notice us. We had money out; we tried to summon them! Nothing. They were too worried about acting like bar backs than bar tenders. Finally received our drinks but with no coasters. They didn't care to clean up the drinks that were there from before we arrived, or remove napkins or anything. We were invisible. And my wine glass was delivered to me HOT! Wine in a HOT wine glass? Geez. We weren't asked if we wanted another drink. Finally our table was called. Whew! We were seated. Again, it took 20 minutes to get more drinks. If you can't staff a bar at 6:30 p.m. on a Saturday, you might want to rethink your franchise. The server brought bread and butter. Butter was hard as a rock. I ordered a steak with a wedge salad. My husband ordered a steak salad. His steak salad and my entrée were delivered after about 30 minutes. No wedge salad. Server went back and got it. No problem. We were still more angry about having to wait and wait and wait for drinks. Wedge had a vinaigrette on it - not to my liking, because it made the lettuce appear brown and weird. Just not the best wedge. And my baked potato was supposed to be \"loaded\" but had hardly anything on there. Where was the butter? Sour cream? At least put it on the side so I can put as much as I want, on there. And bring more butter. The only redeeming thing was the steak. 12-ounce ribeye was awesome. I ordered the garlic butter on top, and for $1.49, it was a dollop of nothing. But still the steak was the redeemer for the meal. It wasn't the dining server's fault for anything; the bartenders are to blame. And they were wearing Badger T-shirts. I love the hometown loyalty, but they looked sloppy. A Badger polo shirt looks good on both men and women. Makes you appear more professional. We won't return."}
{"text":"We had a party for 30 people... they were the most unorganized, unprofessional staff we have ever experienced. 1st, we called and made a reservation for 6:30, didn't get our tables until almost 7. 2nd, when they started taking our orders, we asked them to separate the orders by who is on each bill... the waitress refused. We waited over an hour for our bills. And they still aren't correct. This is ridiculous..."}
{"text":"Another satisfying dining experience at Outback. On a recent Thursday evening my husband's filet was just the way he likes it ( pink), and my firehouse salmon was delicious...just the right amount of heat, complemented  by the sweetness of a mango salsa. A pleasant surprise...the Bloomin onion...way too much for just 2 people, is now available in a smaller serving. Our friendly waitress, Jill, was prompt, efficient and accommodating. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Ordered Car Side one prime rib that was cooked just right and one rib eye which was very tender.   Also received our free bloomin onion (thanks Ryan Newman).   Overall good quality of food and food was ready when i arrived at the time they told me on the phone."}
{"text":"Let me save you a trip. Premium prices for food that is less than mediocre. Steakhouse Mac and cheese was apparently sitting in the window so long the cheese hardened and it was lukewarm. Greasy soggy fries that make White Castle sliders look dry. Not to mention that all of the food was over seasoned with pepper. That is the only thing we could taste. And it takes 30 minutes to get a glass of water on a night when there is 5 other tables in the restaurant. You're better off at Longhorn or Texas Roadhouse...they might even be cheaper."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 take out meals with appetizers, and side dishes. It was a large order. Arriving back home after picking up the order, we realized two items were missing and one item was incorrectly ordered. I called the restaurant and let them know. Usually restaurants will just give you credit for the items during your next visit. However,  Susan.who took my call.did an AMAZING rhing!!!  Without hesitation,  Susan asked for our address and DELIVERED the missing items!!!!  Unheard off and the BEST customer service I have EVER experienced. Susan, thank you thank you!!!!  I hope your regional GM see this review. You are extraordinary!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service was the worst I have ever experienced. We were ignored from the moment we were sat. No refills, no one checked on us, and we had to ask for bread four times.We sat down for our meal 2.5hrs before closing time and our server was busy cleaning up and outside smoking. We had to stop all the other servers to get items we needed like a box and the check. Waiting over 20mins for bread and being ignored is disappointing."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the quality of the food here. My husband and I ate literally everything on our plates. We ordered Filet Mignon and Parmesan crusted chicken. Both are fantastic dishes. The staff was very welcoming and the service was quick. Anyone looking for some great steaks in town needs to check this place out. Can't beat the prices and quality."}
{"text":"Have always had a good experience here at Outback, finally decided it's tine to put my feelings on the internet. Normally pretty content going with the Outback special, never had to have it returned for any reason."}
{"text":"We went to a late lunch around 3pm. The restaurant was empty. We were seated right away, but it took 5 minutes for our waiter to greet us. After receiving our drinks and bread our waiter passed us over to another waiter, as he needed a break. Of course that was no problem. I wanted to order the tuna on coleslaw and asked our new waiter if there was a good amount of coleslaw since I felt like having salad. He indicated that we had an appetizer and bread so I wouldn't need additional food...period. Seriously?! We received our entrees. As I had thought, I barely had any coleslaw under a good portion of tuna. It looked like an appetizer as well. My fiancé ordered a pasta dish in which the pasta was undercooked. The manager brought out another bread ten minutes later stating that it was being warmed, which again was not a big deal. But our waiter didn't come back to check on us until the time we received our bread. We finished our meal and had our dirty dishes sitting in front of us for TWELVE minutes!! Mind you, there were at least 10 employees walking around with nothing to do and yet not one person bussed our table. We also did not see our waiter for these twelve minutes. I had to ask two employees for our check before finally being able to cash out. What a waste of money and time! We will never come back and I suggest if you'd like to enjoy your dining experience, choose another restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my wife were in Phoenix for a couple of days, and wanted to have steak. Having heard about outback and their consistent steaks, we decided to give it a try. We started with their specials - crab stuffed mushrooms which were dripping with butter but were delicious. They came out within a few mins of ordering.   For main course my wife had the fillet steak and I ordered the ribeye classic style. Our salads came out pretty fast and even before we had finished the steaks were on our table. A bit too hurried for my liking. The steaks were cooked pretty well, especially the fillet. The ribeye was medium rare instead of the medium well, and you could see that it wasn't a very high quality cut. Overall it was a decent steak dinner for the price."}
{"text":"We were here Sunday night. I have to say the service was good.  The hype for food way over rated and over priced.   Won't be going back at all"}
{"text":"My husband and I were starving and keen for a decent steak. We assumed we'd get one here. We ordered the outback special (sirloin) and the prime rib steaks. I asked for mine to be medium, and the waiter immediately asked whether I was sure, because it would be \"a bit red\" in the middle. (Would he have done the same thing if my husband had ordered first?)  I wanted my steak pink (i.e. \"medium\"!), not red, so I changed it to medium-well instead. It came out really dry and overcooked (100% brown)... it was even overcooked for well done. I've had this exact thing happen before at another Outback in a different city, and that time I sent it back (the waiter agreed that it was way overcooked) but this time we were so hungry and we wanted to get out of there and do other things rather than wait for another steak so we didn't complain. But seriously, shouldn't a steak house at least be able to cook steak properly?  Another strange thing was that the two soups on offer weren't Australian at all - not a big deal but I'm not sure why an Australian-themed restaurant couldn't have at least one soup on offer that is actually consumed in Australia.  Overall, it wasn't completely terrible... husband's prime rib was a perfect medium, as he requested, the service was acceptable, and they allowed us to move to another table overlooking the strip when it became available... but I'm sure you could get a much better steakhouse experience elsewhere in Vegas."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp is always yummy!!!! I love the sweet potato. They have great specials and great food. Outback always does it right!!!"}
{"text":"Sooo where should I start with this place. Came in with 3 of us and waited at least 10mins to be seated even though they only had 4 tables in the whole restaurant. Another 10mins for our server to come by and say hello. I don't understand why he didn't take our drink orders then, he decided to walk away and said he'll be back. Well that's another 10mins just to put our drinks in, by then we were all ready to order but our server said\" let me go get the drinks first.\" We didn't see him again until 20mins or so passed by........the food out 30 mins later.....and it wasn't even that great."}
{"text":"We just went to Outback over the weekend, and it was awesome.  We \"clicked thru\" and was seated at our table almost instantly.  Our server, Chris, was great.  She was very courteous, and knowledgeable.  We had a gluten free attendee, and Chris took her allergy very seriously.  They also have a separate gluten free menu.  We enjoyed everything, especially the tuna appetizer and the porterhouse steak.  I really enjoyed my Outback Steakhouse experience!  I highly recommend it if your in the McKnight area."}
{"text":"10-25-2013 Monday 6 PM party of four. We were seated and immediately were approached by a very rude server female. I was clear she didn't want to be there let alone serve us. This was really a shame as the other couple (visitors from Australia) had never been in an Outback but come to the states every year. We ordered drinks, which came one at a time. I asked the server what was the problem, she said bartender had to restock entire bar. Wife ordered salad, no croutons server was snippy. Order steak and lobster steak cook wrong lobster was size of shrimp over cooked. Server was no help what so ever.  Bad experience .01 TIP rendered.  This outback has been steadily going down hill for Two years."}
{"text":"I have no complaints. Our waiter, Andrew, was amazing. The food was so full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Andrew even suggested ordering our food in a different way so we got so much more for a couple more dollars. He made the experience so much better."}
{"text":"I ordered the filet medium. When it finally came, it looked like a well done hamburger. I've had filets here before and they were ok. I asked the waitress if all the filets looked like this now. She put her hands on her hips and said what's wrong with it. The manager came over and asked if there was a problem. I showed it to him and he acted like it was fine and offered me a new one. I told him no thanks. Won't be going back there anymore."}
{"text":"Updated 3/12/2014. Both the assistant manager on duty the night of our dining and the managing director, Kevin Hommert, called to discuss the disappointing service. Kevin was very open and non-defensive. He's made a few changes already to the table cleaning process and seemed very committed to improving the service level through better staff training.  I wasn't asked to change my review, but I moved it up from 2 to 3 stars to reflect the outreach and positive attitude.   OK Food -  Combined with the Staff Training of an Average Fast Food Restaurant .  Often, I think the host position in restaurants sets the stage for the entire meal. How many times have you walked into a restaurant, only to find the hostess staring at the seating map? Hello? Hum, maybe I'll check my phone for messages..... 'Oh Hi!' That's how our dining experience started at Outback. It's not a big deal, but if I ran a restaurant, I'd have a greeter and someone working the table map. It's an easy way to differentiate your restaurant in a crowded market.   Anyway, we were asked to wait a couple minutes while they bussed a table.   Well a couple minutes turned into 10 or more minutes, so I got to watch the table busing process at work. At this Outback, table busing is done by the assistant hostesses. Behind the hostess stand, there's a napkin on the floor with a bucket of disinfectant solution. Once the assistant host is done busing the table they drop the cleaning rag near the bucket, grab menus and seat the party.  Sometimes the rag  lands on the edge of the napkin, sometimes partly on the floor. Doesn't seem to bother anyone doing it, but I doubt it would meet with the approval of a health inspector. It certainly can't impress any customers who notice.  Anyway, back to our wait. Several new parties walk in and are seated, so I approach the hostess and ask if she's forgotten about us. She looks confused and surprised. It's obvious she has - and we were quickly seated on the other side of the restaurant. Our table hadn't been cleaned properly, so my wife had to wait another 7-8 minutes or so until our waitress arrived, as she had been getting drinks for a large party. We asked to have the table cleaned. She immediately asked the hostess stand to send someone over. They grab the rag off the floor and head over --somewhere else in a big hurry. Meanwhile she takes our drink order and food order - still no table cleaning. We ask again. She asks again. An assistant host heads over with the rag from the floor. I ask for a clean rag, not one off the floor - or  'off the napkin on the floor' -  as they put it, and eventually we have a clean table - well at least it's not sticky any more.  Food was OK. Waitress did a great job trying to make things right. The hostess came over at the end of the meal to apologize for the rocky start, and offer desert. I told her that was very nice. I don't think I've ever had a hostess come over and apologize, so I thanked her. She offered desert again. We declined again. (We can't have it for health reasons.)  Nice service recovery until she got up to leave. As she walks away, she has the oddest expression. I think it was something between wanting to roll her eyes, (but she didn't) to being frustrated by us not accepting the 'peace offering', to confusion as how someone could possibly turn down desert.    I wish restaurants moved beyond 'free desert' as the solution to all problems. Not everyone is looking for a freebie. Most people just want great food, and good service from a well trained staff. Where was the manager in all this? I don't know. I didn't ask to speak with one, but a good one would have come over early in the dinner. I don't know, maybe the hostess was the manager, but she seemed a bit young and running the host stand certainly doesn't leave time to make sure things are running smoothly.  I sent Outback a similar review, but they haven't acknowledged it or responded to me, which tells me the lack of customer engagement is probably systemic. Outback is part of the Blooming Brands chain of restaurants. Other brands include Carrabba's, Bonefish Grill, Flemings and Roy's. Flemings has good food and excellent service. But, I guess I just don't get the Outback, Carrabba, Bonefish Grill model of moderately expensive food paired with mediocre, inexperienced service.   If you're going to drop $100 on a steak dinner do yourselves a favor and avoid chain restaurants, especially those with inconsistent management.  Food was OK, but with the exception of the nice waitress, the staff was about as well trained as your average fast food restaurant. Not a good situation when your bill comes in near $100. Find a good independent steak house and pay the extra bucks. It'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Both my mom and I ordered the New slow roasted sliced sirloin and it ended up being tough, chewy, and too rare for us! Our baked potatoes were very over done and we couldn't eat those either. It was difficult to get our servers attention after he brought our food to the table and disappeared so my mom (who is handicapped) flagged down another server who was rude. We then asked to speak to the manager (who was on the phone.) When she finally came out to the hostess station, she said they could cook us something else, but she seemed annoyed and really didn't care, defending her cooks and time potatoes were in the oven. We walked out, without eating or wanting to chance another bad meal. Quality has really gone downhill and my husband and I used to rave about their steaks. And, my mom (who doesn't eat out much) was so disappointed after our experience at this location."}
{"text":"We came to this Outback to have a bit of normal among the myriad of new foods we had in Vegas. We love Outback at home and so we thought we would go get food we know we love. This location doesn't have the same menu as others. We love the chicken artichoke flat bread and couldn't get it here. Not enough room to store all of the ingredients? Ok. I can understand that. Vegas is compact and I don't know what else they use artichokes for.   However, what I don't understand is being told that they aren't offering the current Outback promo of Steak and Lobster for $14.99 but we can get a steak and add a lobster tail for a total of $35 instead. AND being told that other locations in Vegas and on the strip do offer the promotion doesn't help. So I'm not sure if this location is just cheap or what.  Our waiter also had a bit of an attitude when we expressed our disappointment by the lack of our favorite offerings. He took about 20 mins to bring out our bread and we only saw him a few times during the meal. He was much happier serving other guests.  On the plus side, the steak was excellent quality (which the waiter made sure we acknowledged) and I was \"forced\" to try a new side (Aussie Fries) that I did end up liking and may order again. I also very much enjoyed the baked potato soup."}
{"text":"6 people, 7pm on a Saturday night.  We were seated in one of our large booths so things were a little cramped to begin with.  Our server was attentive but was missing basic service skills; bringing tea without a sugar caddy, coffee without cream ect.  When our food came, they brought out food for 5  and said that they were out of the 6th dish and asked if he would like something else (I'm sorry you waited until NOW to tell us this), when passing plates around the booth we noticed that they were cold. After touching our food and realizing that it was cold to the touch we got a manager sent to the table.  She asked what the problem was and we explained what was wrong.  She had our food redone and everything was just ok.  In the end our beverages and appetizers were taken off the bill.  Ok rectification but we wont be going back after not leaving the restaurant until 9:30."}
{"text":"Lunch chopped steak was good. I asked for medium, but it came out medium well. Fried onions and mushrooms on top. Good.  Cup of clam chowder was full of clams. Very good.  Mashed potatoes had skins and bad spots from the potatoes. Lazy way of fixing mashed potatoes. How about peeling the potatoes and cutting the bad spots out. Not good.  Ice tea is good.  Service was excellent.  Price: $16.87 + tip. Hmmm not a good deal."}
{"text":"The food is great. Best burgers ever! If you want a healthier choice, why not try the salmon or steak? To expensive? Not when you consider that it's a sit down high class restaurant. Plus this Outback is in a great location. I personally give Outback 5 Stars and even this particular Outback 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here, it is always busy there on weekends.  make sure u call ahead.  we still ended up waiting 25 minutes once we got there.  time went by fast.    I ordered the sirloin and grill shrimp with house salad which was delicious with vegetables hubby ordered the tuna grill rare .   My sirloin was over cooked well done I had told the server.  He took care of it right away and order me another one medium.  The second one came out perfect and also gave me another serving of vegetables.  They even gave me a free desert  ice cream with chocolate syrup with Oreo on top with whip cream for the inconvenience.  Great customer service and the manager came over to make sure everything is fine.  Highly recommend this place. !"}
{"text":"The establishment has a clean presence about it and the hostesses were quick to great us and politely sat us. I wouldn't know about the food because we never received any service. After nearly 15 minutes of wait staff passing by without saying a word, offering drinks or checking to see if anyone had waited on us yet, we left. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but portions are small for such high prices. Fast service and good customer service. A restaurant I will come to once in awhile. Again, prices too high for such small portions."}
{"text":"OMG What a Wonderful experience!! We were greeted and seated as soon as we entered the restaurant. Its beautifully decorated and clean.  All the servers were men dressed in black. Our server was prompt, attentive, informative and curtious. Our meal was served in a timely manner - salad first and then the main course and of course desert. It was EXCELLENT !  Every bite was wonderful. I had the Fire Grilled Salmon with a sweet potato, yum. For desert I had cheese cake with raspberry sauce dribbled over it. I at every bite. I  definitely want to go back!!!"}
{"text":"We went last night, 7/7/12. We don't usually frequent chain restaurants, but we had a gift certificate. We went early to beat the rush and were immediately sat. The hostess was friendly and out waitress greeted us warmly. The service wasn't bad, honestly.   For an appetizer we ordered the Awesome Blossom, the big onion. It was awful. Very disappointing. I had been years ago and I remember them being awesome. I was bummed. It seemed like the onion still had skin on it and many of the onion petals were only thin skin, not bites of onion. It was really bad. I barely ate any. Luckily, the salads followed quickly and they were good.   I got the small sirloin with sweet potato fries. My husband got a bigger sirloin and a baked potato. The steaks were cooked perfectly, mine was a perfect medium and my husband's was a perfect med. rare. However...the steaks had no flavor. I had to ask for A-1 and I don't even really like the stuff. Another disappointment. The potatoes were fine though.   I had some blackberry cocktail and that was super awesome. Sweet cocktails aren't usually my thing, but it looked awesome on the menu and tasted just as great. My husband asked for a draft beer (forget which one exactly) and he got a bottle. He wasn't thrilled about that, but he was happy about the cold mug that came with it.   Overall, the food isn't enough to bring me back, but at least the service was good."}
{"text":"Luv the happy hour drinks. The French onion soup was great ."}
{"text":"Jason was FANTASTIC! He engaged with us and recommended a new cocktail for my husband to try, and my husband absolutely loved it! Also, let us know the specials that they had going on. We usually come to this outback at least once a week and this was by far one of the BEST service experiences we've ever had here. Food came out fast and was delicious as always! See ya next week Outback :)"}
{"text":"Great staff! (We have had Deb, Chris & Randy the few times we have been there) Decent food (however a little over-priced compared to some mom&pop shops out there). Friendly.  They just started opening for lunch by us.  Not the first place I think of when I think steak (see TexAZ), but closer to home and pretty good!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money at this location.  We went four times to this location because our family loves Outback Steakhouse.  We wasted our money.  The servers were terrible.  Our last server was rude and never apologized for all of her errors.  She actually chuckled when we complained.  The manager tried to make it right and was very kind.  However the server was not addressed.  We got a new server who said he was always sent in when these situations happened.  We will NEVER be back to this location!"}
{"text":"This is one of pur favorite places to go to every weekend; we love this place!Great service!! We came in on valentines day, Kelly was our server she was attentive and friendly. They had a good deal on valentines day too"}
{"text":"We went into this location for a fast lunch. We were seating immediately and the hostess was friendly and has a good sense of humor. I had the potato soup which was creamy and HOT most restaurants serve warm soup. My husband had the steak and it was tender with lots of flavor. Our serve was pleasant and attentive. I would recommend this location for a tasty, fast lunch."}
{"text":"It is very infrequent that I bother to take time to write a negative review for any establishment. This particular Outback is D league. Outback has mismanaged my time, money and order 3/3 times over the last 6 years. The \"manager\" of this Outback reports that I should drive back to the store to correct an overcharge on my visa.(on the hottest day of this summer to date) Do yourself a favor and patronize the Keg steakhouse across the street. These guys can mess up a wet dream."}
{"text":"We had a great experience with outback tonight. The service was prompt and friendly. We were seated quickly and our waiter was very accommodating.  We brought in our two messy children and the waiter was very sweet he mentioned that he had children and he understood. The food was delicious as always and we will return. Hopefully next time with JUST dad and mom.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"I know how popular Outback Steakhouse is, and I know why.  Moderately priced steaks and \"all the fixin's\" is a popular combination, and somehow the Australian theme sells it.  Some of the food is tasty.  The \"Bloomin' Onion\" is a fun treat. I probably would continue to patronize them if only they took more care with their food."}
{"text":"11-23-2016, I had the the Chopped Steak and it  was  very bad, I will never be back, No seasoning at all. Just very bland. I could have got a better Burger at Chases. Even Rocco and Chepe are sad."}
{"text":"Went on Father's day. I will preface this review with that yes I know that Father's Day is probably one of their busiest days of the year. I will also say that I don't blame our server for the slow service we received, I think it was management's lack of having the store being properly staffed for the day. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides and salad were good. So on those merits I will give three stars. But the speed of things left a lot to be desired.   We were seated immediately, but didn't get greeted or have our drink orders taken for 15 minutes. The waiter kept trying to make it to our table to get our order but kept getting short-stopped by impatient people at other tables. He obviously was getting overwhelmed. After our drinks finally arrived 15 minutes later he took our order. Then finally after an hour after being seated we got our entrees.   I should have taken the hint when the waiter did that thing where they just throw the check on your table without asking if you want desert, but we ordered desert anyway, which turned into a half hour ordeal after first placing the order. Then my daughter received the  wrong item and we had wait another 15 minutes for them to fix it. So almost two hours after being seated we finally left.  Luckily I had really good company, and overall had a great tasting meal. It is just that it was at the speed of some french restaurant where you get the table for the entire night."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating at Outback at least once a week. We always ask for the most friendly and efficient server. Joe Broderick make our evening fun and enjoyable!! The food is excellent and always prepared the way we like it. Can't say enough good things about going to the Outback!!! :-) :-) :-) :-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate their last night and have been up all night with food poisoning! I just wanted to let everyone know. DONT EAT THEIR!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a taste for a blooming onion, its not what it use to be so I said something. It was taken off my bill and received a gift card for a return visit. Very loyal staff and management. They can use smaller plates since the meals are tiny. Really tiny."}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary and sat in the bar area , bartender came over and welcomed us back . I told him what we were celebrating.  We had our usual great service and we were treated to a big piece of cheese cake with three different toppings and two glasses of champagne.  We love this place and go back as often as we can afford to go.   Thanks for making it even more of a special day."}
{"text":"Our favorite Outback in town (and the closest to our house)! Every time we come here the experience is quite good, good service, even when it's busy. The food has never been anything but great, and we love to bring the kids here as well. There are a lot of tourists at this location as it sits right in front of the outlet shops, so I would suggest a call ahead seating (they don't do normal reservations). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"On my last visit to Outback in Westlake, Ohio. My meal and the guest that are with me had nothing to complain about.  Apparently not everyone could agree with me as the dine and dash was on.People running for the car and within minutes the police are present, the waitress was beside herself with anger. I thought we where back in the Wild West."}
{"text":"Hands down it is most likely the best Outback I have ever been to.  Being a worldwide traveling \"foodie\", it is rare for an owner of a \"chain\" restaurant to treat his customers like they were his personal guests. This owner appears to, as does his staff. My steak and lobster were created just to my specifications and my waiter was attentive without being a nuisance.  Also, it is a known local place on the strip but not \"on the strip\" that has a genuine reputation for local Vegas celebrity sightings. I saw a few, who also appeared to be enjoying themselves.   Cheers! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It is a wonder this Outback is still in business. My son and mother came here in January 2014 for a birthday dinner and it was so bad the manger comped the whole meal $80. Waitress was fair kitchen staff was the issue. Fast forward our 35th anniversary a week ago. I wanted a salad got mashed potatoes; waitress said she forgot to bring the salad. Wife wanted Lamb well-done came medium rare. Finally got lamb right, never got salad. Grilled asparagus dry and tasteless. My steak was good. They did comp us a meal for medium rare lamb. Also observed three other parties having meal issues and manager comping dinners. I estimated about $60-$70 of food comped including ours. Oh the waiter did bring me my salad to-go along with a free desert. This was a Monday night there were a total of 4 parties in the dining room and maybe another 5 around the bar; not a busy night. Recommendation for this property, some serious kitchen and wait staff training. Moral if you can put up with bad service,  poorly cooked meals, and want a free or at least half price meal, go to Outback on Pineville-Matthews Rd. Otherwise try another location."}
{"text":"Curbside takeout is terrible. Don't bother. The food will be cold and soggy. Even though it takes forever to get done. Never get the $8 Oreo sized crab cake."}
{"text":"We frequent Outback in California and this is the best experience at an Outback that I've ever had. Park in the structure on the 5th floor and cross the bridge. There's a back door just before the M&M store. If you miss it, turn around and you'll be facing it. Parking structure costs $3, the machine takes debit or credit card only. No cash. Ed is a great server! Tell him the family from Huntington Beach sent you. He has a tip on how to win free tickets to Las Vegas shows at NO cost to you."}
{"text":"Was looking for a steakhouse which wouldn't break the bank like the majority of high end steakhouses in the casinos. Ventured down the strip and stumbled upon outback.  We went quite early (approx 5pm) and as such the restaurant was very quiet. Our waitress was fantastic, consistently checking to see if everything was ok and refilling our drinks.   Went for the signature sirloin (12oz) which included 2 sides (creamy mash potato and a chicken tortilla soup) all for just $21! The steak was ordered medium rare and was very tasty...if there were to be any criticism at all it would be that the steak perhaps may have been on the rare side a bit too much, but with it being such a thick cut I have little complaints. The soup was brilliant, as was the mash.  Very great steakhouse if you are looking for steak on a budget in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Having driven four hours, set up a show, was tired, thirsty and hungry, I (foolishly) chose not to believe the crummy reviews of this place as I was staying at the Hampton and wanted to believe I could just go downstairs and have the usual great meal and service I've had at dozens of Outbacks across the country before.  Silly me...  Believe the reviews, this place sucks.  I sat a t the bar and was ignored for nearly 10 minutes before finally getting to order a bud light on draft.   (a very complicated order for the bartender...).    She was sweet enough, but dumb as a rock, proceeded to walk off and not bring me a beer, instead, I watched her take another order, then BS with a customer.     I should have walked there, but the other bartender asked me what I had ordered and hustled me a beer quickly.     I ordered from her a NY strip medium and asked for bread.    I'll keep it brief.  Bread never came, steak was raw and riddled with gristle.   I tried to get the gals attention and said \"this is raw\".  She smiled and said. \"Ok, ill take care of it\", then walked to the other end of the bar to take the food order of 4 guys...     At this point, I made the executive decision to soldier through the meal and get the check and goto my room for bed.    She never came back to fix my order, so I clearly made the right move.  Tomorrow I'm getting in my car and finding a place with good reviews.  Ok, now to floss all this disgusting gristle still in my teeth.   Gross...."}
{"text":"Food is terrible. Service was extremely slow and no one really seemed to care if you were enjoying your meal. I will never go back. The quality of food and service has gone way down. I'd rather go to chilies or Applebee's."}
{"text":"Second OB in Las Vegas that is not related to OB family.  1- Server acts as if the customers are there only for her not the other way. 2- 25 minutes sitting with drinks on the table, then comes the blooming onion and salad, blooming onion barely warm and under cooked. 3- She acts like she is doing me a favor bringing the bread about 2 minutes before the burger arrived. I declined the bread stating clearly that there is no sense of having the bread 30 minutes after sitting down, her answer was \"OK\". 4- Burger barely warm as well,  I have to mention, this was at lunch time on a slow Friday. I have to check another location before I say goodbye OB. So far, 2 locations in Las Vegas suck. I can't post before I mention their $4.49 pink lemonade, and the suggested tip on the receipt."}
{"text":"Been to several Outback locations and got awful experience almost always. My wife and my son went there a few weeks ago and came home raving about the quality of both food and service. To get to the point, we went there tonight and what a great experience. I ordered steak and unlimited shrimp, my wife ordered grilled chicken with unlimited shrimp, and of course we started with blooming onion. Every food item we got was perfectly cooked and timely served which is key to having a great dinner, from bread to steak we got a top quality dinner. I must start with Jason our server, this guy is amazing, he knows what he is doing and it shows. This fine guy pleases his customers with his personality and he knows when to check on you and replenish your drinks and food (bread and shrimp). I asked my wife to use her card to pay, when he returned the receipts to be signed, he wrote on our copy \"girls rule\", way to go Jason, keep up the great work. Outback, please make sure you are taking a notice of this review and try to fix your other locations, i.e. the one on the strip above casino royal."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, the Outback is consistent and always delivers delicious food. I like that they have seasonal limited-time specials, so I usually try those. For the summer, it was all things MOONSHINE. Isn't moonshine illegal? Well, I am Northern, so maybe they look the other way in the South. Kidding. It was only flavored vodka marketed as moonshine. Either way, we pretended to be mountain folk for the day and try a few items!  We had the moonshine BBQ wings and bloomin' onion for appetizers. I heard the onion has about 10,000 calories, but hey, this is not the place to come when you are on a diet. The wings were decent but a bit hot and made my mouth burn :(. I had the sirloin & shrimp for a main and he had the double burger. Both were excellent and plenty of food.   We split the 'thunder from down under' brownie dessert. It was tasty, but I was a little disappointed- for $7.29 it should have been bigger. Usually, there is never enough ice cream with these types of desserts, but there was twice as much ice cream than brownie. The brownie should have been twice the size it was. :( It really was a one person dessert and should have been priced at $5.49 instead. What does a brownie square cost to make? 20 cents? Hey Outback, don't skimp on the brownie!   The server Jeff was very attentive and friendly. The food came out hot. Overall a nice meal and worth stopping by. We will return and would recommend."}
{"text":"Ryan sat us immediately,  ordered grass fed  burger with a baked potato, my son had the sirloin and mashed, everything  was perfect, and Ryan was the perfect server. Courteous, knowledgeable , and just the right timing checking in on our needs, can you clone him !!"}
{"text":"Went last night and to wait about 15 minutes because no tables were bused. The host seemed to be in a bad mood but our waitress was nice. The food was good. It was an okay experience."}
{"text":"Came in at 3:15 on a Sunday afternoon. Took a few minutes to get greeted. Took almost 30 to be seated. Manager was standing around. There were 2 servers and a bartender working that I noticed. There were 6 tables in the restaurant that had guests at them (I had time to walk around and count) and a few in the bar area. There were also 4 servers sitting at the bar who sounded like they had just been cut.  They were out of Uniform but I overheard and saw that they were employees. I've been in the industry long enough to know.   I found this a bit out of place. As a bartender myself. Sure people could've been cut. Shift change maybe. I tried to give benefit of the doubt. But there is no reason 5 groups of 2 tops should not be seated for that long on a regular Sunday afternoon. Whether one of the servers on was a food runner or whatever else was going on. I've done my fair share of awkward times to get busy and no one was hustling. No one seemed bothered that their lobby was filling as most of the restaurant was empty. All points deducted were due to this. I was in a good mood. I remained in such just because it's not the end of the world. But as someone who's done this a billion times before. It's just poor customer service.   The food was fantastic. Rachel recommended me a parmesan chicken dish and it was fantastic. Every aspect of the restaurant once seated was great. Rachel was friendly and fun. In fact she solo saved you one extra star. The food hit the spot and was delicious and timely."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the place is very clean. Upbeat atmosphere. Great food an service. Definitely a place you'd want to take the family."}
{"text":"I have never have such bad service at an outback. Our server let our margaritas sit on the bar until they were melted (over 30 minutes) once I personally left my table to retriever them, the manager offered to bring them out though they were clearly old at this point and separated. The overall food quality was much lowers than any other outlet (mostly cold and 40%incorrect orders). Also the wait time for the bill (no offer of coffee or dessert was over 30 minutes as well). We came for lunch at 2, with 4 other tables and at least 3 servers on. Regardless of past good experiences, I will never return to an outback and suggest all to do the same."}
{"text":"Arrived Sunday afternoon at about 12:15PM. Was seated quickly and placed our order by 12:20. Ordered a Caesar Salad and shrimp appetizer. It wasn't crowded at all, maybe 10 cars in the parking lot. Waitress brought us bread 2 times, still no food at 1:00pm, so we just left. 40 minutes of waiting, waitress never came over and said they she was sorry it was taking so long, nothing. Next time we'll try Longhorn!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Outback steakhouses.  This one is extra special because it is open for lunch!  My standard lunch order is the blossom burger with a French onion soup.  The burger is a monster burger with a single portion of the blooming onion sitting on top of it.  As for my dinner order I get the blooming onion app, the chopped salad is one of the best things on the menu and one of the best salads I have ever eaten and for my entree I go with the filet with a blue cheese crumb crust.  Side for me is either the mashed potatoes or the sweet potato with honey butter and cinnamon."}
{"text":"The food was really good and was worth the price. We had to wait a really long time but it was extremely busy so that's understandable. I recommend Blooming Onion appetizer."}
{"text":"Hostess didn't know how to use their table queuing system. They said the wait was 40-50 minutes and had multiple parties waiting in the waiting area while they had 3 to 4 open and cleaned tables in the dining area. They put my name in their electronic waiting list and gave me a buzzer. After waiting 20 minutes, I went up and asked and they couldn't find my name in the list so they said they'd get me a table. 10 minutes later I went up again and she apologized for forgetting and finally seated us when I pointed to an open table. They forgot to bring us silverware. The manager came by and apologized. Apologies are nice but I would rather eat at a well-managed restaurant. I won't be coming back. There are too many options in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant ever. Great food and great service. Love it!! Ever since I could remember this was my favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Hopefully the food is worth the wait....lots of empty tables and a very crowded lobby of people waiting for tables.  There are about 35 people waiting in the lobby. They say they are short on servers so leaving every one in the lobby and tables empty.  Some patrons are leaving after waiting a while.   **update**   ....after commenting to the manager he came out and started seating patrons much more quickly.  The food was good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Outback has gone downhill.  In town for a lacrosse tourney arrived at 9pm and met a 30 minute wait.  The usual 16 servers was operating with 10.  Bartender was frustrated and showing it.  That Bloomin' Onion app is just plain gross.  Deep fried full of fat and after one bite = buyers remorse.  We had the pork and prime rib sandwhich.  Food was super salty.  Mashed potatoes lukewarm.  Salad= iceberg lettuce.   My feet were sticking to the bar floor just like the frat houses in my college days.  It smelled the same too."}
{"text":"Read this before coming to this location because this is worst dining experience I've ever had and I'm in the hospitality business! The wait time was 80 minutes and when we were seated we didn't have straws or silverware for at least twenty five minutes. We repeatedly asked for them and the waiter kept replying that they would but nothing happened until the manager was involved. Our food literally sat in front of us while we stared at it with no silverware and no one was proactive about solving the problem. Our food orders were wrong, refills were very delayed, and to top this whole experience off it was my dad's birthday dinner :( The response at the end of the night was \"sorry, I'll try better next time\" and barely anything was discounted. We were so excited for this location to open, we literally counted down the days and chose it as the birthday location but we seriously recommend you going to the location on sunset and not this one. They DO NOT have it figured out yet. The location is beautiful but the people they hired are service amateurs."}
{"text":"Called to attempt to make a reservation for a large party and spoke to a manager who lacked ANY problem solving skills! Was told they don't accommodate parties.  The person who answered the phone sounded bothered to be working that day! Would never support this establishment!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had if I could give 0 stars I would.  It began when our waiter took his time getting to our table to ask for drinks, then took 30+ minutes to get us the bloomin onion, sugar for iced tea, and bread.  20 minutes later we received our salads and soups and not a minute after we got our main meals when we hadn't even taken a bite. We asked for the manager, who we were later informed was named Patricia as she hadn't even introduced herself when she came over, she blamed the server, didn't take responsibility as the manager, didn't apologize and clearly had attitude with us as if we were putting her out of her way.  The waiter kindly apologized for his actions and her attitude, more of a manager than she was, however, Patricia came over and continued to throw her waiter under the bus. Patricia was very rude, even trash talking about our table to the other waiters.  Horrible experience, rude manager and awful service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Matthews area!  I come here because of the great food and extraordinary service!  Melissa  at the bar is awesome!  She is one of the main reasons I've been coming for years!!  If you are looking for good times and great food this is the place to be...and the bar gives you super service!!"}
{"text":"Won't be going to this location again.  Hadn't been to Outback for a while so decided to go to this location to celebrate a birthday.  Did the online thing where you \"get on the list\" for a time slot.  Got there and still waited about 15 minutes -- which surprised me for a Sunday night.  Server was nice but seemed to be in way over his head.  He seemed to have too many tables -- the people beside us left before their food arrived.  Everything was slow -- from the time it took to put our drink order in to the time to receive them -- and then to receive them correctly.  We knew things were looking slow so we put our appetizer order in at the same time our dinner was ordered.  I asked for my prime rib to be well done, it arrived more toward the rare side of medium.  My son ordered steak with a sauce on it that we paid a couple of dollars extra for -- it arrived without the sauce.  I complained to the manager yet she never made it to our table to make things right.  The server was left to deal with me and I was upset.  We were in there two hours that we hadn't planned on being there for.  I don't know if it was the server, the kitchen, or what -- but food/drink delivery to the table was slow beyond slow and things didn't come out of the kitchen properly.  Worse though, is that the manager never came to our table to talk to us.  It was a birthday dinner and it wasn't a good experience.  Food was okay -- nothing great enough to tolerate another visit to this place.  The server had to go find someone to adjust our bill--which they did.  But, a manager should've come to our table to make things right."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place is not what it used to be.  Last two visits, we had unusually long waits for service.  When our orders were finally taken, and the food brought to us, the portion size was noticably smaller and the price higher...plus salad was even extra.  At check out,  we tried to use the $8 coupon and were told we couldn't if our friends at the same table did since there was a limit of one coupon per table.  Then we were told that the large group to our right (5 separate tables pushed close) couldn't either because they were also considered one party even tho they were at 5 separate tables.  Seems the restaurant was determined not to let people use their coupons."}
{"text":"The food was good, filet/lobster and outback special. Unfortunately, it was WAY too loud; the waiter for the next table was bending over talking to the table beside us and kept putting his butt in my face.  He had a napkin hanging out from his belt or pocket and it came very close to going into my glass of water.  He was completely oblivious and when my fiancé said, \"excuse me, you have your butt in my fiancee's face\", rather than apologizing, he glared.   Two of the four forks wrapped in napkins were dirty with food particles on them and it took longer than average for waitress to initially come to our table, to deliver bread and to refill drinks.   Despite the tasty food, we will probably not be going back for a while."}
{"text":"Very disappointing dinner. Had to ask for silverware when we got our salads.  Our waitress didn't know the menu, had to ask someone about several items on the menu.  They were out if ribs and prime rib.  I ordered the sirloin with coconut shrimp, sweet potato fries & garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked medium as ordered but very tough and no seasoning. The shrimp and fries were the only good things on my plate. My boyfriend ordered chicken fried steak but there was barely any steak.  The rice was very bland. Probably never coming here again."}
{"text":"I attended my first Yelp Social Event here, and I had a great time!!!  I have always been a big fan of Outback Steakhouse, so needless to say, I enjoyed everything!   The complimentary Crisp Red Apple Martini and Sauza Gold Coast Rita drinks I had were spectacular! And they were the perfect compliment to the great new $4.00 \"Bar Food\" appetizer dishes we sampled.  We had the opportunity to taste test: Coconut Shrimp with Creole Marmalade; Margarita Flatbread Pizza topped with Monterey Jack, parmesan, tomato, basil, and balsamic reduced glaze; Homemade BBQ Chips with jalapeño ranch sauce; Bloomin' Onion Petals with spicy Signature Bloom Sauce; Chicken Artichoke Flatbread with wood fire grilled chicken, spinach, artichokes and parmesan; Bushman 'Shrooms batter fried with spicy ranch sauce; and Short Rib Steakhouse Nachos (kettle chips topped with BBQ seasoning, cheddar sauce and short rib).  My favorite samples were the Coconut Shrimp, the Bloomin' Onion Petals (my all-time Outback favorite) and the Margarita Flatbread Pizza."}
{"text":"Tonight's review is for a delivery we ordered for Cuisines to go. We ordered a few salads, some wings and a burger. The food was delivered fast and was still hot. The problem was that we specified on our order \"no mayo or sauce\" on our burger. It came covered in mayo sauce. I called and talked to the manager Lucy, she was both inept and unprofessional in our conversation and said \"so what do you want? Do you want to drive back and pick up another burger?\" Um no I do not want to send a driver that did her job well back to your restaurant to fix a problem that she didn't have anything to do with. Honestly, I simply wanted to let someone know that the only entrée we ordered showed up horribly wrong and it would've been nice for a manager to be helpful."}
{"text":"I came here last night around 930 with my boyfriend. Walked in behind 2 other people. We weren't greeted by either the hostess of the server walking by. They just stared. Then the host came back and silently sat the first two guests. When she came back she said \"you gotta let me clean a table\". Came back then sat us down. After 10 minutes we finally got greeted by our server. He brought us our drinks and we put in our appetizer. Another 5 minutes goes by and our server comes down the aisle then turns around so my boyfriend grabbed his attention. Asked us what we needed, which was to take our order then walked away.  Dinner... I ordered a med-rare filet and boyfriend ordered the med-rare sirloin and lobster combo. His meal was delicious other than steak being med-well. My filet came out extra rare. I love rare steaks but even I couldn't eat that. Unfortunately I had to send it back for a couple more minutes on the grill. My boyfriend was done eating when I got it back. It was now medium which I was at this point just happy to have the steak. Little to no flavor at all and extremely chewy. Thankfully I always get filled up with bread and of course bloomin' onions. The server never came back to check on us again. Literally. For the rest of our dinner. He was closing the store while my boyfriend had to stop the managers conversation with another employee to ask for our check. When she stopped mopping the floor the manager brought the check to who I figured was our server. Out comes another server. She gives our check. We put in the check book 20$ in cash and a debit card. Before we could explain our payment she returned, grabbed the book and went back to the kitchen. She comes again, dropping off our payment. I was charged the amount ($61.38) and our server kept $20 as his tip. Without ever returning. We told the female server what had happened and fixed the mistake. Of course my bank was charged, then repaid then charged again. So basically it was the worst service I ever got in a restaurant. Luckily the bloomin onions are amazing and will always keep me coming back. The strawberry sangria was also delicious. I am a server and so is my boyfriend so we know the struggle of being a server but this was ridiculous. He had only 2 tables total and the manager and all other employees only cared about getting off the clock."}
{"text":"Poor service !!!   Cold appetizers ( frozen) lack luster attitude from staff .   Will not come back !  Get better service from sizzler."}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for lunch for just about an hour. Took 45 minutes to get our appetizer and then 15 minutes more for salad and soup. There are 5-6 tables where I am sitting. This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Got the ahi tuna. Excellent,  portion was enough for qa meal. Taste was great. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is hit or miss but mainly miss. We walked in about 530pm. Two ladies opened opened the door and greeted us. The customer service was pretty good. The glasses were dirty that were on the table. The silverware wasn't clean. The food was not prepared correctly and not hot like it should have been. I don't think I would go back to this location ever. I'll travel an extra 20 minutes to the independence blvd location."}
{"text":"Went here last night to celebrate my father and mother in laws anniversary.  For a Thursday evening there was no wait at all and we were seated right away.  We were created by our server who was just excellent from start to finish, he got our drinks quickly and made sure they were refilled before they were empty.  He even talked to the manager and was able to get a free dessert for the happy couple.  I had the prime rib and shrimp add on with mashed potatoes and the meal was great from start to finish.  We all had the carrot cake for dessert as well and it was great.  The only thing  I thought was the meal was a bit pricey and my shrimp add on for $5.99 only got me 4 medium shrimp on stick.  But all in all still a great evening and time well spent with family and the wait staff made the evening very enjoyable and did not rush us at all.  Granted there was no one waiting but still very nice evening."}
{"text":"When I want salmon this is the place I go. Blooming onion is way better than any awesome blossom. Thank you for opening for lunch. And the place needs to be bigger so the wait isn't so long."}
{"text":"Husband and I were not impressed at all with the quality of food.  I ordered a ribeye, medium rare and it came out well done, no pink at all.  Sent it back for them to cook another steak which took forever.  My husband's Hamberger was OK but he felt bad eating when I was not so it got cold waiting on my steak to come back.   The manager brought my steak and said \"cut this to see if it is the way you want it\"....Not sorry you had to wait or sorry we over cooked the first one.  Just a cut it and see if it's right.   It was but has so much seasoning on it it over powered the flavor of the steak.   Oh, the server was awesome!  She was the one apologizing for everything.  The ribeye was very thin, no wonder they over cooked it. So got the check and was charged for 2 ribeyes and the Hamberger so the waitress had to take that of of the bill.   Not your best night Outback!!"}
{"text":"I ahve eaten here 3 times. I just cant get my taste buds around it. The blooming onion was freaking great. I tried several different steaks and was sorely disappointed every time. The onion gets 5 stars. The steaks are rated above. Sorry Outback"}
{"text":"My wife's sesame seed salad was good is the   reason for 2 stars.  I ordered steak quasadea. Bad news!  Maybe 3 'little' pieces of steak throughout the whole order. And about the size of half of an anchovie. NOTHING like the picture in the menu. Glad I didn't order the porterhouse pork chop. Probably the size of Oreo?  They did comp my order."}
{"text":"Food is always perfect and Scotty always says hi to us and makes us feel like family."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this Outback for dinner tonight, the wait was shorter than expected, which was great. Our waitress, Aubrey, was very nice and attentive. However, at some point one of the waiters managed to dump eight drinks down my back, which were mostly dark colored sodas (very cold and very sticky). The guy was very apologetic, which I appreciate, and I wasn't angry at all because I know that accidents happen and I wasn't going to take it out on him (Another waiter bumped into him which made him lose balance and spill them on me). He and the other waiter grabbed me towels to dry off with and immediately wiped off my seat and made sure I was okay. A few minutes later, the manager walked up with a smirk on his face and asked if I was okay and said, \"I heard you got an unexpected shower, sorry about that. Let me know if you need anything.\" And walked away. Obviously a young and inexperienced manager, he didn't offer to comp anything, just laughed it off. He could have at least offered desert, but what got me is that they couldn't even do a 10% discount because my husband is military! Of course, I hate to sound like that person, but if other places can offer 10% so easily when the visit is absolutely perfect, but when you get drinks dumped on your head you can't even get that courtesy, something isn't right. Get your shit together, Outback."}
{"text":"I was invited to join my sister and her family for a birthday dinner. We got there first and got a table for 5 by the window. Our waitress was gracious and took our drink order while we waited for the rest of our party to show up. It took ten minutes just to get an ice tea and decaf coffee. The place was not busy at 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon. Rest of family Finally got there, rest of drinks and orders taken. It took 20 minutes just to get appetizers ( an onion and loaded fries). Everything came out LUKE WARM. DISAPPOINTED. Then came the meals, another 20 minutes to get our meals. My mashed potatoes were cool and the beef sandwich came out cool with cold melted Cheese on it. All in all, it took 1 HR and 20 min for our meal. Sorry. Poor food. Will never go again. Happened once before but thought I'd give it another try. You need better kitchen help!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, took 25 min to get our appetizer, got our bread AFTER the main course. Terrible overall"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service I have ever experienced. My boyfriend and I made reservations and the people that came after us finished and left first. Let me start out by saying our waiter was not very attentive with what we asked for multiple times. I asked for A1 sauce and Tabasco sauce after our meals arrived and he never brought them, the steaks were getting COLD. I had to ask a different server to bring them. We were there for at least two hours on New Year's Eve. Plans were delayed because of the wait. So yes, I would choose longhorn any day!"}
{"text":"The steak here is great! Yummy baked potatos! Great service. Our sever Shawn was great! Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"I had a great server Trent that was very attentive.  The food was cooked to perfection.  Even the manager Abby came by to check on everyone.   Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"great service, great steaks... payed 30$ for a stake and 2 side dishes...a fair price at South Boulevard in Vegas"}
{"text":"We went in for a quick lunch and it was fabulous. Our server was Scott and he was very attentive, polite and helpful.  My sweetie had a garden salad and grilled chicken on the barbie. I have a grilled chicken Caesar and garlic mashed potatoes.  The garden came with cheese - which my sweetie doesn't like and we didn't know. The waiter gracefully and quickly brought it back and got us a new one. Everything else was fabulous. He gave me a free coffee because he felt it was far too expensive and I had wanted a cappuccino which they don't serve. Great experience, great service and great food."}
{"text":"I always love outback, a good tip is if you order a lobster tail you can have them season it with the same seasonings that they use on the steaks, eg outback special seasoning. The food is pretty consistent at outback and if there is ever a problem they will take care of you. This outback was clean and the staff were very friendly.   Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Super Essen und kurze Wartezeit von ca. 15 Minuten. Die Bedienung Josh war genial und freundlich"}
{"text":"My steak was like rubber. It was full of tough gristle. I will never return.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately that does not make for terrible food."}
{"text":"Ottima la cipolla fritta tagliata solamente metà tale da sembrare un fiore. Ottimo l'agnello della nuova Zelanda e le polpette di granchio. Prezzo nella norma. Locale tranquillo nella caotica Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Wow....what happened to outback?!?! Service is friendly, but slooowww. Bread was stale. Steak cooked to order but really fatty. Yuck! Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here. The hostesses will hit on your husbands. The waiter was brand new, and tried his best but was nervous and uncomfortable. They will say they will \"take care of you\" but will not. Worst visit to Outback I've ever had."}
{"text":"We have been to this Outback at least a half dozen times in the past 8 months.  It is always very good and consistent.  The service has been the same as well.    We've been to Fleming's, DC steakhouse and a few other higher end steakhouses in the area and IMO Outback, dollar for dollar, is by far the best value in town.  Period."}
{"text":"Great place AWESOME service! ! Steak was great, blooming onion was delicious, and cheesscake was to die for. . GO OUTBACK! !"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining in with Outback for the first time. I had the tilapia with lump crab. It was soooo good. Omg!!! And my server Jennifer suggested the blackberry sangria. It wa ls awesome. Just what I needed after a long day. Jennifer made it a pleasant experience. Thank you so much Outback!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, waited over 45 minutes from order time to entree delivery, Manager indicated he thought performance was unacceptable and offered a step ped up beverage ( what can you do to iced tea?) or a free dessert, We declined dessert at lunchtime and really just wanted to receive our order in a reasonable amount of time. Manager's apology and offer felt scripted, except he said \" no worries\" about 10 times. When the entree's arrived my guest's side item was missing.  It couldn't have been much worse and no genuine attempt at service recovery occurred. No rules, just wrong..."}
{"text":"Outback going downhill! We used to get a good meal for a good price! Meat is low quality! We ordered a filet mignon was horrible didn't even look or taste like one! They said it was because it was grilled! Bull  Tasted old! Last time I will go there!"}
{"text":"its a coin toss if they burn your steak...management are very rude...they remodeled and all that is different is a bigger waiting area..."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Got ignored by the bar staff while they entertained friends, and then got poured the wrong beer.  Appetizer (trio sampler) looked like it sat under a hot light for a week, and tasted just as bad.  My entree was bland, boring, and over-cooked.  It's apparent that no one there cares -- I even complained to corporate and never got a response.  Absolutely terrible.  And the potholes in the parking lot could swallow a small yacht.  What a dump!"}
{"text":"OK, so maybe this place had a major turn around? I eat out 4 times a week because of my job and tonight I went with 3 co-workers and had wonderful meals and service. My grilled salmon and lobster tail was excellent and everyone else enjoyed their meal and service very much. Overall a great experience!. Oh, and the young lady that was offering samples was super sweet and even let us try a few things while we had our dinner.  I am a VERY picky restaurant patron but I would definitely go back to this Outback location."}
{"text":"Bad service.  After standing at the hostess stand for nearly 10 minutes while the hostess buzzed around seeming *confused*, the manager finally came over and acknowledged us- then took a phone call- then discussed seating for a large party that had not arrived yet- and then finally directed the hostess to seat us... 80% of the restaurant was empty but a party of 12 that arrived before us was throwing them for a loop... Once seated, we waited another 15 minutes and asked twice if a server had been assigned to our table... We were told our server was entering an order ( must have been some order).  The confused hostess never offered to get us drinks and the manager didn't speak even when she saw us leaving....the staff just seemed incompetent."}
{"text":"Steak tacos were o.k,  The steak was dry.  Almost got the feeling they were trying to use up what was left over.  atmosphere nice.  We had a blooming onion that was delicious."}
{"text":"There is nothing more disappointing then craving a good steak only to have your hopes dashed by an incompetent steakhouse. You would hope that a steakhouse, of all restaurants, could serve up a decent, edible steak. My husband and I stopped here for lunch with our youngest son due to its proximity to our destination and we left extremely dissatisfied. My husband ordered a prime dip sandwich which for $11, one would think it would help curb his hunger some but someone must have misconstrued it for a child's size portion. I ordered the 9 oz. signature sirloin and asked for it to be wood-grilled and cooked medium rare. When our server brought the food, he informed me that they were mixing up a new batch of mashed potatoes and they would be out shortly. They made their appearance after we were done eating. The steak was completely overcooked on one side, tough, and tasted as if it had been smothered in liquid smoke. It horrifies me that Applebee's can cook a better steak than a steakhouse. Needless to say, I couldn't eat more than a couple bites. My husband choked down the rest out of pure hunger. I think it goes without saying that we will not be back."}
{"text":"I just visited outback steakhouse tonight with my husband and two children.  This was one of the worst experiences we have ever had in a restaurant, and we eat out fairly often as a family.  The waiter completely forgot our appetizer.  It took a good 25 minutes for my daughter to get apple juice.  When the mains finally arrived, the waiter came by and asked how our appetizer was.  We said we never got it, and he said he had no idea what was going on in the back, and asked if we wanted it then.  We said no, but noted a few problems with our mains.  The BBQ chicken, was plain without the advertised BBQ sauce.  My daughter's parmesan pasta, had no parmesan, etc.  It took another 10 minutes to get the BBQ sauce and parmesan.  My son's steak was actually cooked the way he wanted, so that was in their favor.  My kids wanted milkshakes for dessert.  It took 20 minutes before they brought them, and they brought the wrong kinds.  Ultimately it took 45 minutes and a talk to the manager to get my son a milkshake.  Again, the waiter just said he didn't know what was going on in the kitchen.  We were not the only one with problems.  A man seated behind us had a cold steak and had to have it re-done.  A lady another table waited about 30 minutes for a glass of wine. The restaurant was not busy.  There were perhaps 6 tables with diners.  We will not go back.  We felt like telling people at the door to just leave.  2 hours, for a mediocre meal, and terrible service is not something I need to go through again.  Skip this one, and go to one of the many better restaurants around here."}
{"text":"This particular restaurant only gets 2 stars because of the quality of food they have. But it's about the entire experience, not just the food.  Food: just about always good as you would expect it. Steaks are well seasoned (sometimes you can eat without A-1 sauce. Sides are great and desserts are good too.  Service: hit or miss, just depends on who you get and how busy they are.   Management: Horrible. Everyone who has worked or still works for the owner knows he is a prick can't stand him. I had a bad experience there 1 time (mind you I worked there in 2005-2007, still a non biased review) but needless to say I know the rules. No ones food is supposed to run past 12 minutes from the time it's put in without a manager speaking to the guest. My food ran 25 minutes and he did not want to compensate me in any way, neither come out and talk to me to explain anything. And the restaurant was not busy at all.  If you're looking for good food, come here. If it's great service you are after, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I had the lobster and my husband had the shrimp which is a new menu item. He really liked his meal! Mine was good but not awesome. I expect a lot when I'm spending $26 a plate. The waitress was very good though."}
{"text":"Average meal, but the service needs to be way better.  Our waitress seemed as if she was just going through the motions, and it was like we were an inconvenience to her at work. And usually while leaving any restaurant the host/hostess will have a parting remark, but he was too busy attempting to be artistic."}
{"text":"I recently moved into the North Phoenix/Paradise Valley area. Lots of restaurant options and since I work 10 hour weekdays I figured I spend the latter part of this summer trying out the dinning options.   So I wandered into the Outback Steakhouse by PV mall on a Monday at 630. Dinning room was pretty much full but me and the wife wanted to watch the baseball game and in our experience you get better service in the bar. Our intuition was rewarded this night. Pleasant (and tall, Outback get a basketball team) hosts directed us to a half full bar and we took our seats. Wife was a bartender in college so always wants to see what kind of talent a restaurant has. We were both impressed.   Jillian welcomed us instantly. Brought us waters as we browsed the wine selection. I selected a Cab and Jillian suggested a red blend for my lady which she really enjoyed (2 glasses!!!). Started off with a Ahi tuna appetizer which was very good.  The other bartender, Nicole, introduced herself and asked if we survived our Monday. I gotta say it's really apparent when bartenders work well together and actually work off each other. There was a 7 or 8 person collection of what I would guess were regular customers on the other side of the bar. While it would be easy for the bartenders to focus their attention there Nicole and Jillian did not. They made us feel at home and valued. Ended up talking baseball with one of the regulars while our meal was cooking. I believe that says a lot about an establishment.   Ok ok enough, for the food. I love wedge salads but dislike iceburg lettuce. Outback made me a wonderful romaine (wedge salad) with all the blue cheese, bacon, onions and what not. It was awesome and was instantly offered once I said I disliked iceburg. Not a picky eater I swear. The wife passed on the salad but shared my hybrid wedge.   Entree wise she had Salmon blackened which was recommended by Nicole and was wonderful. Side of rice went perfectly with the fish which was seared and seasoned nicely. I had an 8oz Filet which had just the right amount of seasoning and was super tender, nice and perfectly cooked to the medium rare I asked for. Can't go wrong with a baked potato with that, the gym will be tomorrow.   As we were eating Jillian came back to see how our meal was. My wife informed me she was probably the lunch bartender and as it was now 730 was off the clock. I though it was a very nice touch, I've worked jobs where I ran out when my shift was over but this Outback doesn't seem to have that problem. Nicole kept both out wine and water glasses filled throughout our meal and made us both feel like we were family. I say it again, we were both very impressed.   Only gripe is no manager stopped by while we were seated. I've been to an outback a handful of times and as I remember a manager always stopped by the table to see how things were. Maybe it was different because we sat at the bar but I just wanted to compliment the cooks, hosts and fine bartenders. I look forward to reviewing other restaurants in the area but even more so I look forward to a great glass of Cab and Filet at our Outback."}
{"text":"The food and service at outback are very good but there really only one reason I drive as far as I do. There is a Braden named Ember that is employed there. She is reason enough to go and just have a few drinks. She is very enthusiastic and friendly. My drinks are always refilled before I have to ask. She is always a projection of proficiently  without being flirtatious and as a married man it always nice to be able to go to a bar and have a friendly conversation without any hidden agendas or ffr. Thank you Ember for your extraordinary service. It's also nice to here a lady brag about her family. So often do you go to a bar and have a lady bartender go on a rant, spousal bash, Irkutsk be in a less then desirable mood. I have been to a few other locations and I can't say the same. I live in southern highlands and I will continue to go to that location as long as she is there along with a few other staff members."}
{"text":"Our experience here was a bit conflicted. The hosting staff was absolutely incompetent. (Well, the young guy holding the door was kind at least. One lady we didn't interact with at all.). The two men \"hosting\" couldn't quite manage to figure out what they were doing. After multiple groups with the same number of guests who came AFTER us were seated BEFORE us, we were about to just leave and take our business elsewhere.   Thankfully we didn't though because our dining experience with Courtney was great. She was always very kind, polite, and attentive. Our drinks were always full and she made it a point to check in on us throughout our meal, which was great considering we could see how busy she was. When she was seated with a large group she made it a point to refill our drinks and check on us before taking their food orders. The other servers who ran our food out were also very kind and attentive.   Clearly the hosts tonight were incapable...hopefully if we come back it's not when they're working! However, at least it seems that the wait staff has it figured out!  0 stars for the guys hosting and 5+ for the wait staff."}
{"text":"The baby back ribs are phenomenal the waitresses and the noise level was very nice. There was no wait, no mess at the table everything was perfect"}
{"text":"I was going to write a lengthy detailed description but decided it is not worth my time. My wife and I have given this particular Outback 3 more chances in the last 7 months. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I found the service to be poor. The restaurant was half empty; but we had to wait 20 min for a table.  Having been to Outback before, we we're ready to order when the waitress arrived. She asked out drink orders, etc, and the order of the food arriving. 5 minutes goes by our salads no drinks. My wife opened her napkin and silverware to a dirty used napkin and silverware. Finally our drinks arrive. The food was just ok for the prices that they charge you. Too many good restaurants for less money and better service and food"}
{"text":"Best Outback Steakhouse I've been to. Been to different ones in Arizona and California. This is by far better service and best food!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and a nice atmosphere with ok steak options. Had the on bone rib eye,  perfectly cooked and massive but meat quality was lacking. Somewhat sinuey and fat not distributed through the cut, chewy overall and required a bit of hacking. Side of fries was good but salad was a little limp."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was great. Walked away 100% satisfied. Steak and unlimited shrimp was delicious and Jim was a great server. Felt like I got way more than what I paid for!"}
{"text":"Got the half ribs and its was dry. Our waiter wasn't very satisfied with. Fingers smell of cigarettes. Somebody else brought our food and didn't have any silverware or napkins. Didn't like the service here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always friendly from the hostess to the server! The food is always made how we ordered and and is delivered to our table in a timely manner! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The waitress seemed a little too comfortable when she took our order while sitting down at our booth. That was weird.   Bread and butter always appreciated. Our steaks were okay. I don't know why I was expecting the Wow Factor.     Our bill + tip was came out to $55. Checking my bank statement a week later, and Outback charged me $65. I called the manager, he researched it and said it looks like I left a $15 tip. Are you kidding me?!  I told him, there's no way I'd leave a $15 tip for a $40 tab for a waitress that took my order sitting at my table. He called me later that day, informed me that this happened a few too many times and that he \"fixed\" the problem. He will be sending me a $25 gift certificate to come back. He said, \"Don't worry, you won't see her, anymore.\" Yikes!  The second go around was better, the difference and tip after my $25 gift certificate was paid in cash. LOL."}
{"text":"They have really good, spicy clam chowder.  It's a little hard to find but we keep coming back for a nice Saturday lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered a NY strip, med rare. It came out pretty grill stripes but was solid purple, raw and almost cold inside. Sent back while others ate. What seemed like 10 minutes came back cooked more on the outside but still same on inside.  Sorry, for a steak house this is not good. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this location. It's a Friday afternoon and we were sat right away nobody came to the table so after a good 10 min we got up and walked out I told the red headed hostess who was missing a few teeth that no one came to the table so we are leaving and she gives me a dirty look ?? Really we won't be back to this location"}
{"text":"It was just okay. Service was poor even though there weren't many people here.  It should be better than this but it's just ok.  This particular location has always been average. I don't think the management or staff really care much about the customers. The wait staff acted like that Ryan Reynolds movie \"Waiting\"."}
{"text":"We love coming to outback for the great food. But this location has terrible costumer service. The host is walking around Iike someone killed his dog. He didn't even say hi to us. Just said how many today? The restaurant was pretty Empty being 230 In the afternoon on a Monday. We were sitting for 5 minutes and still no server. Another table got sat at this time and a server came right over to them. Still ignoring us. We continued to sit for another 5 minutes while the other table that came In 5 minutes after us had already gotten drinks and their order taken. I got up and asked the host if we could get a server. He said yeah then just stood there at the stand. We ended up grabbing our menus and sitting in the bar area instead. The manager walked by a few times ignoring us too. Then sat down in a table not too far from us and started eating lunch. Still no service at this time. We've been in there for 16 min now. Our server eventually came over and the service was okay. He was very monotone and not too thrilled to be there either. When I asked if we could have some bread he snapped back at me saying \"yeah give me a minute to heat it up!\" When we had already waited about 12 minutes after ordering. My boyfriend ended up sending his steak back. And getting his food to go. This will be our last time at this location. Our service the time before was even worse than this."}
{"text":"Fillet and lobster doesn't look anything like the pictures.  The 4 oz lobster includes the shell so don't expect much meat.  6 oz Fillet looks like it was squashed and was served cool even though I ordered medium rare.  Sprites are $2.99....really?  total bill after AARP discount was $71!!  so not  worth it...the baked potato is what filled us up..."}
{"text":"I was there last night. I have to say that it had been many years since I had experienced superior customer service like this. The restaurant manager is Top Notch! She is amazing and I'm sure will have a great future with her incredible service skills.  I am very pleased with this place. It will become one of my favorite places. I recommend everyone to visit. Customer service is what makes average become excellent."}
{"text":"Our server was great, but the manager was horrible and not hospitable at all. She checked on every customer around us and continued to give us dirty looks. The hospitality industry is definitely somewhere she doesn't need to be working if you are going to be prejudice. Corporate needs to know about this."}
{"text":"Inevitably I end up here when a family member wishes to have a steak.  Unfortunately, the cooks cannot for some reason cook a steak to proper temp.  It only takes a thermocouple that most cooks have in their kitchen (instant reads only take 2-3 seconds to measure proper internal temp).  So, I've given up expecting my steak to be cooked to perfection- it won't be.  Went back tonight upon request, and I was shocked at just how salty everything was.  And, let me tell you, I'm a salt fiend- especially sea-salt.  [Others look at me with disgust as I lick the deer salt-lick- ok, mostly joking here, but I love salt.]  But, salt and syrup on my sweet potato fries?  A bit much.  Salt all over my burger? and the bun?  it's a bit much.  For the price, I'd say there are better places in town for a better steak.  At least the manager won't argue with you that you are incorrect on the steak cooking.  [Seriously, someone buy these guys an instant read thermometer...]  [and it appears the upset stomach around 8 hours later is yet another feature of my visits - this happened last time as well]"}
{"text":"Tolles Ambiente und gutes Fleisch. Wir waren bei unserem Las Vegas Aufenthalt zwei mal hier und haben Steaks und Spare Ribs probiert. Es war super! :)"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch, around 2:30 and of course it was empty. Food was good. Service was good and dessert was fantastic. Bourbon Glazed Bacon Salmon was extremely good. It's been a couple years since we were here last but had a good experience then too."}
{"text":"If I could I would give it 10 star. I loved the food it was delicious and satisfying to my belly . Ambiance was good . Staff was nice from the entrance to the end . We will definitely be back . Best food ever ever ever and the bread too . Thank you Outback for the amazing food , continue with the gray chef"}
{"text":"I have been here twice...steaks are dry and don't taste good.  yuk..wont go there again"}
{"text":"Had a relationship-ending experience tonight.  No drama.  Just too much blah.  Ordered a martini: undrinkable.  Ordered the Victoria filet, $21, spit out 4 gristle balls.  We're done.  No hard feelings.  We just don't feel the value.  At all."}
{"text":"Lunchtime service is horrible! If you're on a lunchbreak and have limited time,  don't go to Outback. If you want to spend 90-120 minutes for a leisurely lunch, they have a reasonably priced lunch menu with adequate options."}
{"text":"Great roasted tendered steak.  Great service from our server Philip M funny and helpful guy! 5stars, will come again."}
{"text":"Good food, good price and good service. The restaurant is under construction is the only reason it did not get a full five stars. I know this is unavoidable but during this time it is a little inconvenient getting in and out. I'm sure once the remodeling is complete, it will be a top notch place."}
{"text":"We have had great experience with Outback online reservation system that allows you to check current wait time and put your name in online. I checked this locations webpage several times as we were getting ready (2 adults and 2 kids) and as we were driving to the location, and each time it said \"currently no wait\". When we arrived we were told they were on a 40 min wait. NOT COOL. I will be reluctant to go back."}
{"text":"I returned to this restaurant after receiving a gift card from a representative named Brittany from Tampa FL and I will say service and the food was great, so see people writing your experience helps others not only make a decision on where to eat but some establishments actually take your feedback and apply it. I didn't think it would be fair to visit a different Outback with my gift card so this one could redeem themselves and at least in my eyes they have and I would recommend them...  Thanks again  CSM (R) Ronny R Martinez"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. Food definitely disappointing and over priced. I ordered the 'crab' tilipia for $14.99 with side of rice. The tilipia was good and moist and the rice was tasty. But where was the crab? Menu described this dish as having crab clump on top of tilipia. There were some sliced mushrooms in butter sauce on the fish, but I could not see or taste any crab! Our waitress was very nice and they were very short of staff as many employees apparantly failed to show. Despite this our waitress had them bring some more 'crab' in a small dish. Again, I could not see any crab meat, just sauce. For $14.99 only one side comes with the entree which is poor! Our group came early and since it was happy hour drinks were half price. I ordered a frozen margarita which was good (probably had no alcohol as it had absolutely no effect) and still i was charged $5.50 for the drink. Their big onion appetizer was free for the 4th of July and it was good, but our table of seven only got one. Did not seem fair, but it was tasty. Despite the food our group had a good time, but I would not recommend the food!"}
{"text":"I won't be back! Our food was beyond underwhelming! My husband ordered a medium rare prime rib, which arrived medium-well, almost to well done. It was very dry and overcooked.  I ordered the sirloin steak medium rare - it arrived so rare that I think the cow was still running around outside moo-ing.  Our friends chicken was over cooked and dry, as was the baked potato. The potato looked like it had been baked, then microwaved and was dry on the outside and mushy on the inside.   When my husband and I complained about our meals, the manager did offer to replace them.  He agreed that the prime-rib was not medium rare, and my sirloin was so rare, it was cold in the middle.  My husbands replacement prime rib, was still medium, not medium rare but a better one that the first.  I decided to go with a prime rib also as the manager had told me that their sirloin was their toughest steak.  That was an understatement!!! I've had sirloin before, and it's never been that tough - not even cheap sirloin from Wal-Mart is that bad! My prime rib was rare to medium rare, but good enough.  We ordered both our meals with Aussie Fries and honestly, it was the smallest serving of fries I've had at a restaurant. Potatoes are one of the cheapest food items at a restaurant, surely they could give you more than a small, McDonald's size serving for the prices they charge.  We will not be back :("}
{"text":"Outback STEAK-house apparently couldn't live up to it's steakhouse fame. We ordered their steak&lobster special and $9.99 steak special. Of course I don't expect $10 steak to be an example of perfection but I at least expect it to be edible. I ordered it medium but it came out absolutely medium rare. I struggled with cutting a first piece and I couldn't even chew it... it was just plain inedible. Wife ordered medium well and it came out medium. French fries looked soggy like they were sitting in a bin for a while. I sent my plate back and even though establishments attempted to give me a replacement meal I denied. To their credit they comped the desert.  Bottom line... not going back there again. Steakhouse were you can't get steak right doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"Outstanding service!  I have been coming to this outback location for a few years, and I always have a good experience. During my most recent visit I experienced service that exceeded my expectations.  Long story short, my 2 year old son bumped his face and bit his tongue right after we ordered our drinks. The poor little guy was crying and I was about to leave when Heather came to my rescue. She brought him an order of fries which calmed him down. She wasn't even our server, but she took the time to help my son. I was amazed at the thoughtfulness and her ability to help our group stay and enjoy dinner! Our main server Sarah was also very friendly, attentive, and quick!  I didn't catch all of the names of the people who pitched in to help us, but I cannot say enough kind words about the entire staff. They even held the doors for us as we left and thanked us for coming in!  The food was delicious and everyone in our party was very pleased with their meals. I especially enjoyed the cheesy broccoli side dish. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened here. We have dined here for 15+ years. It was our favorite, regular, steak house. NO MORE! I The last two visits, the food has been horrible. Ill prepared, under or over cooked, wrong orders, etc. This is sad. We will not be back.  Update: I just spoke to the manager who is genuinely concerned with our displeasure. I will return for another visit and hopefully the high, consistent quality will have returned."}
{"text":"The food may sometimes not always be out of this world but this location makes up for any of their shortcomings for food with amazing service and excellent customer satisfaction. The managers here really value their customers. This location will make sure to always take care of you and if there are any problems with your order they will fix it to your satisfaction. I have gone here for many years now and have always had excellent service and great food."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!  We went specifically to Outback for their prime rib dinner. After placing our order, we were informed that they only had so many oz ' s of prime rib left and did we want to order something else. When our dinners came out,  we were surprised to see that they split the reminder of the prime rib between us in addition to our replacement dinner. Outback manager Melissa took a very bad experience and turned it into a positive one. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Your a steak house man! When are you going to learn how to cook steaks. Every time I've gone in there bad steak."}
{"text":"While there are plenty of very expensive \"real\" steak houses available on the Las Vegas Strip, I find that Outback generally provides a good value and a comfortable expectation.  This location is the one with the entrance at the top of the \"Coke bottle\" elevator shaft down near the MGM Grand where we stayed.  Be warned, the prices are a lot higher than you are used to if you eat at Outbacks at home.  However, it is still a lot cheaper than other steak option on the strip, so capitalism runs it's course. Overall, it was decent.  the food was good and well prepared, though the service was only so-so.  Now, that can certainly vary depending on your server, so you may have better luck. For my trip, it was a short walk north from the MGM Grand, so it was quite attractive compared to other steak options. If you are on the south end of the Strip and craving a decent steak dinner, this Outback is worth paying a visit.   Now, I can't close without mentioning that there is another one on the strip, further north inside the Casino Royale, across the street from the Mirage.  Overall, our experience there was better and we ate their earlier in our trip before a show closer to that location.  If you are located closer to the center of the strip, I would definitely recommend that one first.  If you are on the south end as we were, I don't know if it would be worth the extra walk unless you had other reasons to go that far."}
{"text":"I gave them two stars bc the place is mediocre at best. The outback used to be one of our favorite places to eat however it has gone down hill. I could take it or leave it. My husband orders a half rack of ribs every single time we go. About a good 75% of the time he gets a skimpy half rack of ribs with about 5 fries. There portion sizes and quality have significantly declined. It's inconsistent and nothing great anymore."}
{"text":"Came in here yesterday for dinner around 4:30 and it wasn't busy at all. Specifically asked for a booth away from other people because someone in our party of 3 had Autism. The girl at the front, very loudly might I add, says \"WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT AUTISM IS\" and literally placed us in the booth directly behind the front desk, immediately next to another group of people. naturally we were also around lots of foot traffic, the bar, and we were only mere feet away from the greeters and the people waiting to be seated.   The entire time we were trying to enjoy our meal, but we couldn't because my brother was so overstimulated by their loud cackling and talking at the front desk and he was uncomfortable having so many people walking by. We ended up leaving early and getting our food and dessert boxed up to-go.   I never caught that girl's name but I hope one day she's embarrassed by her ignorance and wises up. It's 2015. There's no excuse to be completely ignorant about disabilities, especially ones that effect 1 in less than 70 American children born. if someone specifically requests you accommodate their disability, you damn well better do it and not question them (or in our case, ignore them completely).  The food WAS spectacular, all three of us got prime rib and lobster with caesar salads and then cheesecakes to-go. Our waiter was a bit of a disaster. Nice guy, but it seemed too difficult for him to juggle one table and the empty bar. He never looked our way, as if he was hoping he'd never have to wander to our table if he never made eye contact to prompt it in the first place.   Our glasses piled up and cluttered the table and were never removed. Never brought more bread when he said he was going to get it. We had to ask another waitress to bring horseradish and refills, because for nearly ten minutes he was standing by an exit looking the other direction, or at the bar just facing the other way.   Time to clean house. Hire some smarter girls to work at the front. Ones who won't piss off patrons the second they walk in the door. &Hire more assertive staff. No excuse to not pay attention to your tables when the house isn't packed."}
{"text":"I usually order the Chicken on the Barbie (my regular) They make it just right. Juicy and not dry, or overburnt.  The sweet potato fries are usually excellent. Honeyglazed w/ a very slight taste of salt. better than the ones at FEZ imo.  Keep in mind it depends on the customer's taste of what is good : )  I usually get good service when I'm here. I am seated quickly and the servers are prompt."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to dinner here tonight. The food was so good- we both got steaks and they were seasoned and cooked perfectly for how we asked. I also got a drink, and asked the waiter for his suggestion on a margarita- loved his recommendation! Great overall experience with staff and food."}
{"text":"Once again a spendid dinner at the Outback Steakhouse.  If you want superior service Ask For Scott he is THE MAN"}
{"text":"Come here almost every weekend. Always good to fair service. Everytime has been a great experience. Food is always fast and cooked properly. They always strive to make your meal one to remember and to keep you coming back!  Any errors they will correct with no questions. I ordered the seared ahi this time and the order came out looking like a half order. The waitress had the manager bring out another free order that was double in size. Not expected and I even told her it was unnecessary but they insisted."}
{"text":"We went here for prime rib.  It was awful & not edible.  Should never have been served to us.  It was grisly & looked like leftovers , rather than freshly prepared.  How could management not oversee quality control.  Unacceptable:-( We will not go there again.  They comped us as it was not edible, but we left hungry, unsatisfied & frustrated."}
{"text":"Cody was the best server that we've ever had. He was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, always made sure our drinks were full, engaged us in friendly conversation, made sure our order was accurate and although he didn't personally make our food, his efficiency and timely manner with our food was wonderful. It was an exceptional dining experience and we will be requesting him from now on because we KNOW it will be great every time. He deserves major kudos and recognition for his hard work and dedication to serving his customers with exceptional service.   Our porterhouse was cooked and seasoned perfectly, our bloomin' onion was crispy and very tasty, our salads were crisp and refreshing, and the ice tea was good. We love eating at this Outback and usually it's \"ho-hum\" experience that you would expect from any eatery but as the above paragraph stated, it was just wonderful this time.  If you visit this location, ask for Cody. He's spectacular."}
{"text":"Have been there twice in the last two months both times sat in the bar area good waitress food good and veterans get 20 percent off great deal"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good there but the service we received from Erin was awesome.  She is one of better waitresses around as she is very nice and very attentive. I wish there were more waitresses like her."}
{"text":"Outback is always...well Outback but today was a unique experience. The bartendress was AWFUL! She was rude enough to scare off two groups of people and even combined flat beer from the end of one tapped keg with fresh Stella. Gross and offensive.   I got filet with wild mushroom sauce which was definitely delicious as always at Outback. However my experience with this woman soured it entirely.   The key lime pie was fantastic for dessert and the margarita was strong. It's too bad about the bad service."}
{"text":"What happened to outback ?!?! It has been a few years since my last visit ( which I always enjoyed).   I am taking time to sadly complain about the overall restaurant .  There is not much to write about it, but that is overall low quality food that is way over priced and never cooked right . The full slab of ribs is over 20$ !! I only ate about 3 ribs from the whole slab. The ribs were dry and tasted like old bad pork. The fries that came with the ribs were cold and there were about 11 fries on the plate.  It was one of the worst meals I have eaten in a western modern restaurant ."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at this Outback restaurant every week and have done so for the past few years.  We love their signature 6 oz steak and wedge salad. My wife always get's there \"House Merlot\".  It's the Merlot I would like to discuss today.  Last time we were there, my wife ordered the Merlot and it was bitter and vinagerish tasting; like it had gone bad. We are no wine connisseiurs, but we know how that particular wine should taste.  When we told our waitress, she relayed the information to the bar-tender. We had sat in a booth in the bar area so we could hear the conversation they had. The bartender said that he had opened up the bottle yesterday and he hadn't had any complaints. The bottle was almost empty. I could see that from where I was sitting.  The waitress offered us another type of wine, but the Merlot is what my wife had her heart set on and nothing else sounded good to her.   To me, this is where the bartender at Outback really failed.  Alcohol is your cash-cow. Don't screw with it.   In my opinion, the bartender should have opened up a new bottle of Merlot and poured a new glass and had my wife try that.   He should have come to our table and asked us how the wine tasted. Tried to make it right. All we got is, the bartender telling our waitress that the wine was good.  The wine was not good. The last 45 times we've gone it has been good, but that day it was not. Take our word for it.  So, because the bartender was so lazy and lame we are now taking our business to Longhorn steakhouse nearby.  We tried Longhorn this week and it's just as good, and some respects even better, than Outback. We'll miss the wedge salad, but I don't like the way we were treated.  Outback, say goodbye to $100+ per week or over $5200 a year from us. Honestly, we went to Outback that often. Even when we were out of town..."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance came here 3 days in a row, different waiter each time, different hour of the day each time and the service and food was fantastic. Filet migno 6 oz medium cooked perfectly 3 days in a row. The sweet potatoe with honey butter and brown sugar... absolutely to die for. And their homemade ranch with any salad DELIC!!! So fresh and crisp and i can not forget the fresh hot baked bread. I eat two by myself. Today i am trying a huckleberey cocktail with moonshine which is ahmazing and the first day i asked for a strawberry martini from a later menu and they knew what i wanted and it was so good i had 3. I highly recommend outback, moon. I will return for a 4th visit very soon."}
{"text":"Service is excellent.  Blooming onion is addictive, very good.  Steak was a little chewy but delicious."}
{"text":"If I could give this less than one star, I would. Where to begin? Well, my husband and I loved the Outback Steakhouse in Rockford, IL and now that we have moved to Madison, we decided to check out the one here. We got in and were seated at a booth. The light was super bright and was right at eye level. We asked to be seated elsewhere and were moved to a table. Our server, Erin, said that a lot of people don't like the lighting and they keep talking about remodeling. (She knew how shitty the place she works is) Anyway, we ordered the 4 for $14.99 deal where you get a soup, salad, entree, and a dessert. My husband and I both got the potato soup, Caesar salad, and the chocolate cheesecake. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin and fries and he ordered the chicken marsala. We were served our drinks and bread and then our soup. The soup was cold. Tasty, but cold. We said as much to our waitress when she came to ask how the food was. We were very polite throughout our entire experience. We ate all of it because we were starving post-workout. The salad came next. Both of us by that point felt nauseous. My husband found some type of apricot jelly bit in his salad(!), the dressing tasted too acidic, and the green lettuce was wilty. Our main courses came out and the manager came over. She was very young, nice, but asked if we wanted another soup. We both said no that we had eaten it, it was just cold. We didn't say anything about the salad. She left and we both essentially said \"Why would we want more soup when the first one was bad?!\" My husband said the mushrooms on top of his chicken didn't taste right and that the sauce topping was also cold. I didn't have any problem with my steak, but the fries were VERY greasy. By this point when the waitress came we just asked for our desserts to be boxed. We heard the table next to us complaining about the soup and as our waitress came out to bag our food we heard the manager over talking to them as well. The bag she gave us was an oversize one that she apologized for it being so big but said that they were out of the smaller ones. We paid for our food and my husband couldn't believe we paid $40 for that. We tipped our server as it wasn't her fault and she was nice throughout, but one or two things, okay we can deal with, but when your entire dining experience is sub par and other patrons are complaining too? I can safely say this is one establishment we will not be returning to."}
{"text":"We have been here three times in the last five months.  My husband loves the ahi tuna appetizer, and I love the shrimp on the barbie.  Our steak and lamb were delicious.  The hostess, manager, and wait staff were efficient and friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was quite pleased on a recent visit to Outback. The staff was very friendly and enthusiastic. A brief awkward moment when the hostess mistakenly told my fiance they do have root beer, but no big deal. Our server's name was Dawn and she was a delightful person. We had our drinks and ordered our food within probably 5-10 minutes of arriving. I had the bleu cheese wedge salad, which was divine. For our entrees, I ordered the filet with a lobster tail and a loaded baked potato while my fiance ordered the ribeye with a double side of the garlic mashed potatoes. The filet was perfectly cooked, flavorful and just the right portion. A baked potato is a baked potato but no complaints there. I had the lobster tail steamed at the recommendation of Dawn and it was delicious. My fiance said his ribeye was good, not great. He had it char-grilled. Perhaps seared was the way to go. We'll have to find out next time we visit. The garlic mashed potatoes are pretty darn garlic heavy, just as he likes it. Probably not the best option for anyone sensitive to strong flavors.  Overall, a satisfying dinner, a pleasant visit, and a nice end to an awesome date night. We will definitely be eating there again."}
{"text":"This outback was nice and clean, and the staff was friendly. Unfortunately my favorite, the walkabout onion soup, was sold out. What? I've never had that happen to me...   But other than that, food was great and there was nothing else to complain about."}
{"text":"I always get great food here. The staff is always great as well. Prices are fair.   I go 2 times a month.   If you have a problem with your food, dont be afraid to tell someone there, they will correct it. Im referring to the lady below."}
{"text":"While it doesn't seem that Outback even checks these, and their business certainly isn't hurting, I would hope that you Yelpers would pay attention to this.   Now, I'm very vocal about how I feel, but I will never put bad things on the internet--until today.   I've given Outback two chances in one week--only because I had a gift card. The first time, they were very quick. However, upon receiving my food (Outback special, salad, and fries), I was MORE than disappointed. The flimsy to-go box contained a miniscule piece of leather that they called a steak and what seemed like 8 individual fries with crusted cheese on top. Thankfully the salad was okay, or I would have had a fit.   The second time, today, was a free bloomin' onion special, so I anticipated a wait. After sitting in my car for over 30 minutes, I was finally greeted and given my bill. The bloomin' onion was said to be free, yet my bill was $24. Hm, didn't make sense. However, because i tend to go with the flow, I just paid, and used the $7 left on my gift card. When the to-go person came back, I asked if the gift card had been used, and she said yes. Well, unfortunately it wasn't, but they did proceed to take it and throw the card away. Bye-bye, $7! I guess I didn't need you.   Now, I thought, maybe the food will be delicious since it was busy. WRONG! Same stuff. Overcooked steak (I order medium rare and get well done), a few fries, and a salad that was wilted. Oh, and hard bread! C'mon, Outback! The bread is what makes you!  Thankfully, the bloomin' onion was good.   Needless to say, my Outback days are over. I don't know if they merely focus on the people who eat inside, or if they really just are terrible all around. You should think about improving your curbside line functionality and maybe hiring a few new cooks. Also, let's not charge people for free items, that usually gets you better reviews.   I'm not a picky person, and understand that food service is a hard industry, but to be a chain you are certainly slacking on a lot of aspects.   To management--CHECK THESE REVIEWS. You are consistently getting between one and two stars. Is that really how you want your business to be known? Sure, Hops and Tilted Kilt aren't hurting your business, but if this keeps up, I think that trend will begin.   I hope that you all will take my review in to consideration. What's sad is that my family has been craving a good steak for a dinner. Unfortunately, it won't be here."}
{"text":"was extremely disappointed with the service i received at this Outback!! my appetizer came out after my meal. I had to send my drink back because it wasn't made correctly. the waiter would walk by and leave empty plates and cups on the table. For the restaurant being very slow i was shocked that we had so many problems!! I typically go to this outback, but now will be finding another location!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a year or so but went last night. Management really should make more of an effort to train employees. Our bartender was also our foodserver and just really didn't have a handle on good customer service. The bar was dirty with crumbs everywhere. The service was painfully slow. When my wife ordered a second glass of wine, which took forever to actually order it, the bartender just dumped more wine from a small carafe into her dirty glass. When our food came mine was ok, not fantastic, but was as expected. We had appetizer plates and such in front of us that were empty but not removed which caused the food runner to have to ask another waiter for assistance to remove them when all this could have been accomplished had the bartender been trained correctly. My wife's steak was tough to the point she only ate a small portion of it. They did take it off the bill but that's still not a good dining experience for us.  Gave it one star, lots of room for improvement......."}
{"text":"I love this place for sele croon and consistency of food. For a chain I think it is quite good. Ceasar salad is wonderfully garlicky. Yum yum. Salmon is always great and steaks can't go wrong.   This is a go to for us when we want a reasonably priced steak out.  Service is always very good."}
{"text":"We love going here to eat for special occasions but today wasn't as good of an experience as we usually do. The food took over and hour to get to us, normal not a problem, were patient people, but when we got our food it was barely warm-almost cold. Again, Outback has superb food choices and this experience won't stop us from going again just something to think about."}
{"text":"This one sucks. Go to the Pineville-Matthews location!   Our steaks were over cooked and took a long time to get. My husbands salad was thrown together and my clam chowder was cold. No Bueno"}
{"text":"Confirmo, sigue siendo tan bueno como siempre!! Salud. Bebidas, vinos y los camarones al coco, uy, de chuparse los dedos. No recordaba las carnes, pero son deliciosas. Ya no le pude llegar a los postres, lo siento."}
{"text":"We were utterly ignored at Hooters so we left and went to Outback. Friday night around 9 pm. It's usually a decent time. This time, the host was actually Australian with the accent. The server was on top of everything. I ordered fish/chips. There were free refills on the fish. For a fish/chips fan, that's amazing. Everything was right. They nailed it this time."}
{"text":"Outback Steakhouse is a fairly good chain. tHis location did not disappoint. They always have good quality food. Good sized proportions with a fair price for wHats on the plates, you wont leave hungry!  We were particularly happy with the great customer service from our waiter.   The only thing that could be improved would be Beer selection. No Australian's drink Fosters - and that's the only Australian beer they serve."}
{"text":"Our visit was a romantic one and the meal was awesome, best steak and lobster.We always enjoy a bloomin onion ,it was even better...The bloody mary was right on the spot with celery and olive and his margurita pleased him.So just to sum it up- a great night.Best steakhouse in a long time."}
{"text":"Shawna was great attentive and make good suggestion. Food was amazing. I would recommend them any time."}
{"text":"I always go to Outback for the blooming onion but tonite I was a bit disappointed. Too greasy and salty. Side veggies need to be tender (grilled or steamed) not on the crunch side. Fish tacos don't come with lime wedges, C'mon !!! Service was excellent though."}
{"text":"The food was actually great, this review is for the service.  I was actually blown away by the terrible service we received from our waiter. From the moment he came to our table, I knew we what we were in for. It was one smart mouth comment after another from him. He was very negative about happy hour when we inquired what the specials were.\"There is a  happy hour, its nothing really special, but yeah, there is a happy hour\".  ok.  We never did hear what the happy hour entailed. We waited quite some time for our drinks.  He messed up a dinner order and said that cook must have read the order wrong , so while 3 of us received our dinners, 1 sat with an empty bread plate. We had to ask for bread and he appeared very bothered by that, commenting, \" I was about to bring it to you anyway.\"  We waited quite some time for the checks. When he finally appeared, he said that the person that rang up our order , did it incorrectly, so he made the corrections in pen on the receipt. We carefully looked at the check and saw errors right away. When we brought it to his attention, he made another smart comment about another server probably ringing it up wrong.  Never a smile,  thank you, have a good night, nothing. It was an incredibly negative experience. A member of our party spoke to a manger as we were leaving. When he told the manager some of the comments made by our server, she said \" I know exactly who you are talking about. Was it *****?\"  and it was.   Wow.   I don't care so much that the service was a little slow, it was the server's negative attitude that totally turned me off. Again , our food was great, but I just can't justify paying 50 bucks for dinner& drinks and being treated so poorly.Will not be returning ."}
{"text":"Got take away twice, both times they forgot my sauce for the hearts of gold mahi..last time I called them and told them my situation and the girl Brittany replied \"so what do you want me to do about it\""}
{"text":"On Saturday Jan 4 2014 my fiance and I went to Outback in Phoenix AZ for dinner.  We were greeted and all of the initial service was fine.  When we ordered, we got the new barbeque nachos and there were less than 10 chips on the plate, no meat and there were a few drips of cheese.  The server did not think it looked right but he indicated that he had not served it before.  My fiance ordered the chicken strip platter but received the chicken bites instead and only received a sample portion.  (About 5 bites) No side dish, which the menu states that there is.  We brought this to our servers attention and he brought the requested potato, however we were charged for it on the bill as a separate side dish.  Our server was OK.  He was clearly new and didn't know how to handle our orders.  Anyway, the drinks we had were great but the food was not to our liking or to the description on the menu.  When we asked about that the server assured us we got what we ordered but we didn't.  Nothing was done about our concerns and my fiance said to me that we would not be back.  This is disappointing to me because out back has my favorite martinis.   I e mailed the store about my experience.  So on Jan 13 I got a call from the store manager who told me that she was sorry for my experience and she was going to send me a gift card and invited me back.  Its been 2 weeks and I didn't get the gift card.  I probably could have lived with not going back without her call, but when I got the call and she said she was going to give me the card i was happy because I love their drinks and I didn't want to stop going.  Unfortunately I am even more disappointed now because the manager called me to tell me she was going to do something and then didn't follow through."}
{"text":"Oh Outback. Maybe people have moved on from dining at Outback. However, I was given a gift card, so I made the journey. I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. The soup, salad, steak and dessert is a great deal. It's more food than the body can handle. =) French onion soup was amazing. Caesar salad was very nice. Steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. Carrot cake to finish it off. Sadly couldn't finish the dessert portion."}
{"text":"We came here for a good dinner. The main courses arrive, my wife's chicken was dried out -- sat under the heat lamp too long -- and my mash potatoes were cold. When they brought out my replacement potatoes, they were nuked to death. Never again"}
{"text":"WORST LUNCH EVER! This location has signs about advertising that they are now open for lunch. My work lunch crew decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, we will not be back.  We arrived and we were seated quickly enough. We ordered shortly after being seated. We all ordered from the lunch menu so it should have all been quick service. And we waited ...  We waited over 1 hour before some of us received any food at all. Those at the table who ordered soup and/or side salads finally received those items. We inquired as to when our food would be out.   The table behind us likewise had been waiting sometime as well and has asked for the manager. She finally came out after we were there about 1 hr 15 minutes. We told her we had been waiting as while as well. She said she would bring our food ... no apologies, did not stop to talk with us, just said she would get the food and took off. A few minutes our waiter brought bread to our table ... isn't the bread supposed to come much earlier? Anyway, we then saw our waiter get angry and throw something ... hmm.  So another 15 minutes has gone. We decide to just leave ... its been an 1 1/2 hours now and 2 hour lunches are frowned upon (go figure). Just as we are about to walk out our food comes. The waiter tells us \"its taken care of.\" We take our food and leave a tip anyway.  I got back to work and attempted to eat the food we were finally provided. I had ordered quesadillas and french fries. I had the quesadillas but no fries. It was disgusting. I took one bite and threw it away. Luckily, I had a protein bar in my desk drawer.   To wrap it up, everyone has a bad day ... stuff happens ... it's just the way the cookie crumbles. With that said, there was NEVER an apology or any real effort to make it right. The staff seemed to be annoyed that we would expect our food in less than 1 1/2 hrs during our lunch hour and have the audacity to complain. When we finally received our food and attempted to eat it, it was disgusting. Tossing some disgusting food our way (and not all that we were supposed to get at that) and muttering \"it's taken care of\" does not an apology make. This restaurant needs to implement Customer Service 101 ASAP."}
{"text":"Got tied up and ended up eating a very late lunch with the wife. We both ordered the Steak and shrimp combo. She had the grilled shrimp and I had the coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp was spot on tasty which I shared with the wife and she agreed. The grilled shrimp and both steaks had way too much pepper (just a smidgen less than blackened) for our tastes. They were both cooked to our requested levels. We will probably come back here again but will absolutely tell them to lighten up on the pepper. They did have a salad dressing that I tried for the first time and found quite nice, Blue Cheese vinageret."}
{"text":"Overall very good. No wait to get a table, excellent service (Tom was fabulous). Daiquiri was smaller than I would've liked but very tasty. Had the new Ahi Tuna which was delicious. Also had the ribeye, excellent portion, ordered medium rare but was little more on the rare side. Atmosphere was perfect. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the worst dining experience I've ever had. The steaks are grade c meat at best, the managers are disgruntled and will not tolerate complaints. When I asked  if I could move seats I was treated with disrespect and greeted with a curt \"no.\" This restaurant is horrible, the staff is sub-par and the management is not worthy of being called human. I wish I could warn people on a daily basis not to eat here."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants. I love the Australian theme the restaurant presents and the atmosphere it brings with it. It is extremely welcoming. This place also gets you seated surprisingly quickly for the long line at the door. If you attend I highly recommend the Aussie Cheese Fries for an appetizer, they are one of my favorite items on the menu. The prices are a little expensive but if you're looking for good food with an amazing atmosphere and exceptional service, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was great, very friendly hostess and waitress.  Ordered the pork tenderloin and it was cooked to perfection.  Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Walked in for some drinks. Waited 10 mins in the bar area, not one person came up to us. Waited 10 mins and left. No one even greeted us at the table, no water or anything. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a burger with bacon cooked medium, it came out very well done (dry). My sirloin and shrimp were perfect, though. Food was just ok."}
{"text":"I love Outback.  I like to eat low-carb and just love, love, LOVE their blue cheese dressing.  Salads are excellent here.  They are always crisp and fresh.  I frequently get the wedge and just love it, it is always good.  Service at lunch is excellent, fast and efficient.  Steaks sometimes aren't exactly how you ordered them, but the kitchen will happily correct it to the appropriate temp/doneness.  Highly recommend for lunch at this location, they do such a good job."}
{"text":"Sat at bar and had decent dinner. Lobster was great the steak so so. Excellent service from a Chris-attentive and professional. Will go back to bar because of Chris and order something different."}
{"text":"Food is sooo salty and water is unfiltered from the tap. I knew Yelp was going to be useless in helping us decide, when McDonalds had nearly as many stars as this joint."}
{"text":"The husband and I had a previous experience and after that said we would never be back. Decided to give it a second try and left with a different outlook. Came at 5 o'clock on a Saturday night, were able to be sat immediately, and our server, Julia, greeted us promptly. Got our drinks and appetizer within 10 minutes of being seated. And food was on point. Julia was wonderful at keeping contact with us throughout the whole experience. We will be returning, and requesting Julia to be our server in the future. And the fired mushrooms are fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way out of Phoenix.  everything was great.  Food was excellent and came out in a timely fashion.  scott, our waiter, was amazing - very attentive.  restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"We've been coming here 9 years and have seen it change proprietors 2 or 3 times.  Aside from Corporate Outback screwing up it's solid core menu the past few years with kooky stuff, this particular location has gradually declined for other reasons.  The take out always screws up orders every single time.  They forget at least one thing on every order.  Food is always cold and not double checked.  And the portion control is way out of hand.  I get it, cost savings but even sauces filled at a third of a take out ramekin is ridiculous and noticed.  We used to love Outback and this location.  Now we love neither and have officially \"black balled\" this particular location, sad."}
{"text":"This is the best Outback location in the area.  The food is always tasty but more importantly the service is always great.  I come here about once a month and haven't had a bad experience yet.  The sirloin and crab legs are my favorite.  Pro-tip:  If you like your steak medium rare order it medium.  They consistently under cook."}
{"text":"Went to Outback last weekend with my fiancé and daughter. The service was great. We ordered the porterhouse, filet, and steak medallions. We also had crab and lobster. The food was so so. We had a chicken artichoke flatbread type thing and it was horrible. I say go with the Blooming onion because it is fantastic. Overall the experience was so so. We had a gift card so it was not so bad."}
{"text":"The only downside to this restaurant is trying to find it. For the uninitiated -- the only entry is by a glass capsule elevator on the bottom of the 'Coke' bottle symbol (which is a sign for the said bottling company's museum and merchandise outlet on the strip). This is right next to the M&M museum as well. Once you get in -- you are assured quick seating and a cheerful enthusiastic staff swiftly catering to your cravings. The decor is nice  enough and you can look down from the fourth floor perch (if you choose window seating) to observe humanity float by and get accosted by canvassers.  We ordered a Steak as well as a 'Mushroom and Swiss burger'. Beef in both were juicy. The complementary black bread was fresh and tasty. Our servers were super nice and friendly but non-intrusive. We did not feel hurried although this place was on the strip itself. We spent less than 60 bucks for three people on the strip and that was our meal highlight of this Thanksgiving trip to Vegas ."}
{"text":"I had the most horrible experience here. I understand it was christmas eve and the kitchen was busy, but still the server managed to get three out of three orders wrongly prepared and didn't even come to apologize. The manager found me looking around to find my server so he can take the dishes back and the manager was nice about it, but still no apology or nothing from the server. The server did not even ask how i want the meat cooked until I mentioned it much later. Also, we ordered two three-course meals but we just left without even eating the desserts because 1) the server gave us the bill before I was even half way thru my main entree and 2) we waited for the desserts for 15minutes even after paying the bill and the server didnt even care to explain what happened with the desserts until I asked. I dont care how the food was. The service was terrible. I will never go back here. Ruined my christmas. Even one star is a waste."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience and will never be back, personally this location should be shut down. First off waited at the host stand for several minutes before being acknowledged staff was too busy talking amongst themselves to notice us standing there. The only good thing about our experience was our server. Ordered a steak cooked medium took 3 times of recooking it for it too come close to being right. Restaurant looked dirty and the bathrooms were awful. Will never be back at this location."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to stop for dinner, recently. My filet mignon looked like a hockey puck, and was doused in spices. My wife's steak was also way too spicy. The mashed potatoes, while good, were portioned out to maybe 1 cup at best, and I thought they had forgotten to put any sort of dressing on my salad, until I got to a few leaves that had a very small amount spread across them. At least the lobster tail, albeit small, was tasty. We spent $80-90 on our meal. For that amount, I certainly expected better quality. I'll take my business elsewhere, from here on out."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for a late dinner. Sat in the bar. We really like this location. Service is good. Manager came by and said hello. We got the pretzel and cheese dip appetizer. Everything was great except the Steak. I was like shoe leather. I usually get the ribeye or prime rib. This time I got the flat iron. Big mistake. I was not even eatable. I have gotten the flat iron at Texas Roadhouse and its great. I gave 4 stars because I really like the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. The steaks can be a little hard to get right tgey always cook off. But the managers are quick to fix the problems. Salads are great and the bread is good as well. Pkus service is always on point. If it wasnt for the inconsistent temperature on my steaks they would get 5 stars"}
{"text":"So slow. Kept my family with 3 young kids waiting for more that 30 minutes (probably closer to 40) just to get a seat. That was after they told us it would be about a 10 to 15 minute wait. We were there over an hour and a half before we even got our meal. The food was excellent, but waiting that long with young kids made the night miserable."}
{"text":"I have been to many Outback restaurants and I have to say that the steak I had at this one was the worst one ever. Like chewing on a piece of shoe leather."}
{"text":"Took forever; which I knew was going to happen on a Saturday night. I ordered buffalo bites and received plain buffalo wings. Took 15 minutes to fix the food. My grandmother received a steak well done when she wanted it rare. The manager came over and took the steak and it took ANOTHER 15 minutes to get that fixed. On top of that the new steak my grandmother recieved was literally like MUSH. The texture was like baby food. Gross."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night around 7ish. Place was packed but the wait was very reasonable. Staff was extremely nice but you could tell they were under trained.  Silverware was not present when seated and took a while to get it delivered.  Blooming Onion was amazing as always and super quick to arrive. After that, the experience went down hill.  My wife's steak was over seasoned making it spicy. She loves spicy foods but it was simply too much. Baked potato came with what she requested to be off it.  Friend's chicken sandwich was under cooked. Like pink on one side.  Other friends chicken tenders were cold but cooked.  My burger was actually really good.  We talked to the manager about the issues. She offered to replace the undercooked chicken but at that point we were finished and ready to leave. She took it off the ticket.  She said the steak is just seasoned with Outback's normal seasoning. We both have had Outback steaks before and this was very different.  Unfortunately I would say to pass at this location and go to another. Very close to this there is a Bonefish Grill I would recommend for much better food/experience."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the terrible parking lot.  It has huge potholes, and more than just a few.  If you can make your way past that, the inside is nice looking, was not busy at all on a Monday evening.  Service was great, food tasted delicious (do they coat the peel of the baked potato with salt?  whatever they did, it was amazing!!).  It is a little more pricey than I would like, but not too bad."}
{"text":"Food good but wait time was ridiculous. Didn't get us even when there was a table available. Had to get a manager to get seated."}
{"text":"Our server, Matt, was friendly and attentive. Manager was checking in with customers. Everything we needed was brought without asking. The beers were fresh. Unlimited shrimp hot the spot and was deliciously brought out in intervals. Steaks were right on! Thanks for a fun date night!"}
{"text":"Outback is a great place to go for lunch. It is very comfortable and friendly. It is a good place for family's or get togethers. The meals are light, and not as filling as they could be. The food tastes great though, so it makes up for it. I will come back in the future."}
{"text":"Disappointed by the serving size! Surprising, I know, at a restaurant known for their huge portions.  My husband and I are vegans who took our son to Claim Jumper following his graduation from ASU. He's a meat-loving guy who picked the place. No worries for us, we can alway find a salad that will work for us. My husband and I ordered the California Citrus Salad (hold the bleu cheese). So far, so good. The our food arrived. We honestly thought they split one salad between us. Another member of our party was eating the side salad that came with his entree which was bigger that our full size salads. We asked the server and were told that was the size of the salad. We had to order a side of fries so that we didn't walk away hungry!"}
{"text":"a very nice steak house, we have eaten after our wedding there. with a very tasty steak. and the cocktails are very cheap to las vegas. And the dessert cake of all 3, I can only recommend."}
{"text":"It's Outback, what can you say, I love their food.  I was impressed with the service.  I didn't catch the waiter's name, but he was awesome.  He was very attentive and regularly checked in on us."}
{"text":"Is was a fri. Night, called half hour ahead. Got there with in that time frame. There was no one waiting for a table, no line. Gave her my name and asked if we could have a booth(we're older and booth more comfortable). She said there were none available when u can plainly see there were 3 at least in dining room cleaned and available. The girl wanted us to sit in the bar.  We left...."}
{"text":"I always go to outback when I want to have steak.  Usually...I only pay 30 bucks for dinner but  I  can always get  enough food....love outback"}
{"text":"We've gone to many Outback locations, but this one has most of them beat. Our waiter, Jonathon was polite, on top of everything, had all the details exactly right, and was not too chatty, nor was he neglectful. Everything from the bloomin' onion, salads, to the main entrees were very good. Highly recommend, much like our home location Mishawaka IN USED to be."}
{"text":"Went here with a family party of 5. Service was good, food for the others seemed ok. We ordered a blooming onion floating in grease. They should at least put it on a drain rack and paper towel before serving. I was extremely disappointed in the grass fed burger I ordered as I am partial to steak. Menu states aged cheddar lettuce, tomato, onion, garlic aioli. It came as Luke warm patty, dry top bun, some sort of dressing on the bottom and very little grated lettuce, nothing else. It is my fault I did not send it back as I was unsure of how the menu read in the beginning. When we mentioned it on the way out, the hostess apologized and gave us a coupon for a free blooming onion, which by the way expired in April 2016"}
{"text":"We had the steak and lobster! Good service and decently price! I love their lunch specials and great when you are craving red meat."}
{"text":"So not impressed.  The manager was the only good thing about this location.  Server was rude especially to my husband.  She spoke over him and cut him off I don't know how many times throughout our visit.  She also talked so much that she didn't pay attention to what each of us had ordered and had to come back and pretty much re-take our parties orders.  Not once did she come back to refill our waters and gave an attitude when we requested it. Also, the food was so so.  I've had better and definitely made better at home.   I will not be going to this location again."}
{"text":"While there has been some updates to the menu, it seems like the quality of food was not comparable to the prices.... but our very special waiter made all the difference..."}
{"text":"Started off on the wrong foot, but the owner Don stopped by our table and really turned the night around.  The steakhouse mac n' cheese was unbelievably good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and very willing to cater to special requirements.  Gluten free? Not a problem. Want just carrots instead of the mixed veggies? Ok!  Salad with extra cucumbers and no tomatos, np.  Their croutons are made there, and a bit spicy.  Mmm, delicious.  I love Outback.  Today I had a crispy chicken sandwich, a baked potato, and a house salad.  I'm a supertaster (basically 1/3 of the population can taste Prop, a bitter flavor in many vegetables) and their salad is rarely overly bitter, which really makes me feel \"normal\" when I can enjoy a salad.  The baked potato, as always, was properly cooked, which is rare in restaurants to be able to get a baked potato that is actually cooked all the way through (Not sure how people can enjoy jason's deli or memphis bbq potatoes where they're actually still hard).  Butter, bacon, and cheese.  No extra upcharge for the bacon and cheese.  The crispy chicken sandwich was a nice surprise.  Its on their new brioche bun which was amazing, it had folds, a good flavor, soft on the top, and was properly crisped on the grill.  You know the bun is right when after you pick it up to take a bit and put it down, your hand has \"impressed\" on the bun changing its shape.  The aroma told it all though, it was a real buffalo sauce!  Not Frank's red hot sauce, which is a fine hot sauce, but isn't buffalo sauce at all. This was a mixture of butter and hot sauce, and was delicious.  So delicious. :)  Here is a tip, instead of ordering the cheese fries you can't finish, just get french frys and add cheese and bacon for a buck more.  They'll even give you the same ranch sauce!"}
{"text":"Before attending a performance at Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts, we decided to go to Outback, where we had a gift card. There are several in Scottsdale/Phoenix to choose from, but this one had such really bad reviews, it actually made us want to check it out, since we had about 2 hours to kill! Our experience was really very fine. We were greeted and seated right away. Our server brought us a couple beers and bread. We ordered (fish tacos, btw, were excellent and lots of good, juicy fish) and got our dinners in a timely manner, the server checked back at the right time, brought us our check at the right time, and we did not have to wait for her to process credit card. The manager stopped by to ask how our dinner was. I could tell they likely were paying attention to Yelp reviews and were going out of their way to give their customers good (not smarmy) service. So I felt it necessary to report my experience here."}
{"text":"Solid, consistent chain food. Clean and not overly bright. We come for the service behind the bar. Kayc remembers our names, drink orders, and we never wait for our check. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Okay, maybe it wasn't the ideal situation for the waitress. 10 of us arrive at 9:20 pm and the restaurant closes at 10.  Still, we all ordered drinks and and entrees--all things considered we were \"big tip\" potential. The waitress just sucked.  Messed up a lot of our orders and L (who eats gluten free) kept asking if things were gluten free. Even though they have a gluten-free menu, the waitress was unwilling to go ask the cook what exactly they put in the food, and in particular the sauces.   J and I ordered the prime rib--mine was supposed to be medium rare--his medium.  She got the size of the prime rib cuts wrong, got the side dishes wrong.  Ugh. Just awful."}
{"text":"Upside-the server was friendly and attentive. Downside- both steaks we ordered were tough, they don't have thousand island dressing, and did I say they didn't have thousand island dressing. It wasn't even a possibility here and I love Outback housemade thousand island. Fortunately my local Outback has great servers, steaks that don't need a chain saw to cut, and thousand island dressing."}
{"text":"This Outback is their newest prototype and I have to admit, its awesome looking w the new decor...now let's get to the service! The call ahead is awesome! I had a party of 9 booked and they told me they can take us in at 7 but maybe 20-30 min after we check in bcoz its a busy day..honesty on the phone is awesome! Don't make any promises if you can't deliver! We checked in at 7pm and sat down at 7:30..they use a tablet and have all the info in it! Cool! The server was awesome!  She was attentive and helped in our choices...the food? Well they ran out of their steak and all you can eat shrimp special!!!!why did you say I give them 5 stars? It's because when I complained, the actual manager emailed me back and explained the situation....that to me is customer service! The food we had as an alternative was good and the bread was awesome as usual...will I come back? Yes!"}
{"text":"Out back, My favorite restaurant. :) Ever since I was a little kid. Portions of the food got smaller. But the customer service was great. I'll always go there for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Oh this was not good. A server brought bread to our table for three with a small dish of butter(?) We had no plates or silverware. When I asked a waiter if we could have plates she said (with a straight face), \"We don't have any plates. We have large plates for the meal, but no small plates. If we get some, I'll bring them to you.\" I said, do you have silverware? She said, \"Yes.\" Could we have some?  \"Oh, ok. Sure.\" The food?  Stay home, make a bologna sandwich (on a plate) and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Extremly lecker ;o) Unseren letzten Abend in Vegas hätte ich nirgends wo anders verbringen wollen, das Essen war toll. Wir hatten eine kleine  Vorspeise Seared Ahi Tuna Sashimi-style  Thunfisch roh sautiert in Gewürzen, mit Ingwer-Soja Sauce und Wasabi vinaigrette Hauptgang hatte ich ein  Outback Special® - Sirloin Steak (englisch) mit Folienkartoffel und einem Classic Blue Cheese Wedge Salad, mein Freund hatte Lobster Tails grilled (Hummerschwänze gegrillt) mit frischem Gemüse der Saison. Einfach ein Traum, ich kann mich kaum erinnern wann ich das letzte mal ein so gutes Steak gegessen habe. Service war unaufdringlich, schnell und sehr zuvorkommend. Schade das es diese Kette nicht auch bei uns in Deutschland gibt, Churasco ist ja schon lange nicht mehr das was es mal war, Outback wäre hier eine super Alternative."}
{"text":"So disappointing. This used to be the go to restaurant for a great meal for a special occasion. Not anymore. Daughters 16 bday dinner Monday evening. My husband myself and her 2 brothers. Sat in kirstins section. She sucked to say the least. Empty glasses more than once brought my son's side of mashed potatoes after he already finished a whole rack of ribs. More butter for my potato when she brought potato already cold and wouldn't melt. Restaurant wasn't even busy. Her tip reflected on how she shouldn't b a server. 102.00 bill, she's lucky and that she and the restaurant got anything. Disgusted I spent that money on food when it could have went to her another awesome gift. Won't be returning. Blooming onion looked like it belonged on the kids menu."}
{"text":"This review was for last nights meal. Our server was Anthony and he was very attentive and helpful. The reason for the three star review was the quality and portion size of the food. My husband ordered the ribs and chicken plate. This is where the food portions became comical, he ordered a wedge salad, it was large and seemed  proportional. Then the main course came out. The chicken breast was the size of a child's fist and the ribs consisted a 5 very small ribs. This cost of this meal was $16.49 plus a $1.00 upgrade charge for the salad. The server who brought our food even made a comment to how small the food looked on the plate. The cost of this meal for three people was over $100.00. One was a kid. We felt sad as we left and not happy.  The prices were not in line with the size and quality of the food.  Sadly we probably won't be going back to Outback, there are too many options to get quality food."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service, food wasn't even average.  Will never eat here again.  For the price you would think the food was above average and the service exceptional"}
{"text":"Never again!  This time went to a different outback on a different town.  Service - slooow.  Wait long.  Food so-so.  Price expensive.  Like I said never again."}
{"text":"We always have a wonderful experience at this Outback. We hardly ever go unless we have a Gift Card, and this was a lucky occasion. Not to mention the place became a ghost town for a Holiday weekend.   Food was great, as always! I have been obsessing over coconut covered anything so I could not wait to try the coconut lobster (A++ in my book).   The restaurant is always clean and a lovely dinning atmosphere. May want to take care of a few roof leaks because all though the black ceiling tiles are a nice touch, there's no hiding the water stains. (Sorry, can't go anywhere as a property manager) :(  Our waiter (Harrison) was wonderful as well. He was very attentive and such a sweetheart, especially when I realized I had the wrong order. I would have not said anything/made an issue had I not been wanting to try these freaking lobster strips. Immediately after I spoke up he took initiative. Reassuring us that he have them fix it without out any hesitation. With Customer Service going in the toilet in this day and age, one could appreciate his kind demeanor and sense of urgency to correct the situation. In addition to his awesome server skills, he had a very likeable personality and interacted with us throughout the night. If anyone's up for a promotion or at least acknowledgement, he should definitely receive it. As previously mentioned, GREAT Customer Service is hard to come by these days. Therefore if you have an employee that's willing to go the \"extra mile with a smile\", appreciation is in order."}
{"text":"Ok, I gave Outback 4 stars.  Now, I have to put this into perspective.  It's Outback Steak House...a chain restaurant.  I would normally give chains a lower star but we had a good experience.  You're going here because it's convenient and you know it.  You're not going to Outback to get the most amazing food experience.  So...we got seat at the bar because we wanted a couple drinks first.  The bartender was sociable and friendly.  We decided to eat at the bar because it wasn't very crowded (it was a Friday night which we noticed but whatever).  We both ordered a steak.  Our salad came quickly and it was what we expected...iceberg, few veggies, big croutons.  Whatever, we were hungry.   The steaks were done how we ordered.  It was good and like the other times we're been there.  They are consistent.    My bar is always low at chains but I always get what I'm expecting at Outback.  Thus the 4 stars."}
{"text":"The manager Brian went way above and beyond. The bloom pedals were very good. The food was excellent. It came out hot and we will be back."}
{"text":"Just had dinner.  We waited a bit before someone came to the front to seat us.  The Hostess  was sweet.  The restaurant was pretty much vacant.  We waited as if the restaurant was packed until our server arrived.  We ordered water with lemon.  We again waited.  We placed our order and asked for the complimentary bread.  She said she just put it in.  The bread arrived and it was luke warm and hard.  The silverware had food stuck on it, and brought it to the server's attention.  We decided to ask for napkins that we dampened to clean it off.  Clean silverware wasn't offered.  We always order Ribeye.  I never saw a Ribeye in the shape of a circle.  It wasn't a Ribeye.  Fortunately my guest had a Ribeye as ordered.  Both were over seasoned and salty.  My salad, well it was okay, ordered additional Ranch.  Was bought Ceasar.  Then when brought it to the server's attention, she questioned my comment and said it was Ranch.  My guest tried it and stated it wasn't Ranch as well.  The food was overall was below average.  The prime rib, I'm sure that was given to me, was labeled for our K9.  One good thing was the Manager coming over and asking how things were.  However, the extended wait periods, and partially eaten meals, there was nothing that could be done.  We didn't care to stay a second longer.  We paid using the kiosk on the table.  The server said to wait so she could make sure we paid.  Wow!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my B-day in June and I wanted some steak that was affordable for everyone. The waiter we had was remarkable he knew who order what and knew where the food belongs. We had a party of 13 and usually they will get confused but not our waiter he was outstanding. I had the Melbourne and i got the 32 oz version. I guess the 32 oz steak is only in Vegas cause it's 20 oz where i live. The steak was juicy and not dry at all. My cousin had the ribs he said they were pretty good and everyone said they steak was delicious. I will definitely be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"I have tried and tried to see the good in Outback but I can not do it. The meat is not prime, (which is understandable), but is not even choice either. Without the heavy seasoning it would be suitable for dog food. The very existence of Outback is it's heavy advertising which is somewhat fraudulent.  And the goofball in the Outback commercial   who talks like an Aussie is laughable."}
{"text":"The drinks are very weak and the service was terrible. Our bill was 200 dollars for a MEDIOCRE MEAL. I would never go back there again!"}
{"text":"My wife & I had dinner tonight, we heard some good things about the Outback on 54st off Ray rd. My wife's steak was done perfectly, my hamburger was cooked as I ordered it medium rare and our waitress was extremely personable and professional I very much recommend this Outback"}
{"text":"I went here as a last resort after being unable to secure a table at Beef-n-Bottle, so my expectations in regards to meat quality that day were a little high.  The first thing to expect at Outback is a fairly long wait on weekends; if memory serves me correctly, the wait on a Saturday night was about 50 mins.  There is a small waiting area to the left of the door that has complimentary lemonade and they also pass out samples of appetizers.  This small space is a real life saver when it's really cold outside.  Regarding the food, I recommend either the Victoria Filet or the New York strip (rare or medium rare).  Since the prices are so reasonable, you're basically looking at a $10-14 steak if you get the sirloin and based on the comments from the table next to us, a $10 piece of meat is what you're gonna get.  While we enjoyed our filet and New York strip, the couple next to us was unable to finish more than half of their sirloins.  They said that the meat was kind of tough and dry.  I personally found my strip to be tender and juicy, however it was lacking in the seasoning department, let just say I needed a lot of steak sauce.  The loaded baked potato was cooked well, but the cesar salad that I had was very bland.  The dressing had almost no taste and the parmesan cheese was bland with an odd peppery taste.  The service was great, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  If you asked me if I'd return, I'd probably say no.  The food quality just isn't what I'm used to in the realm of steaks.  To be honest, I've had better steaks at some of Charlotte's local bars.  If you're on a limited budget and want a steak dinner for $20 or less, you can't beat the pricing here."}
{"text":"Hair in my salad. No refills. Didn't ask how my food was or how my steak was cooked. Unpleasant waitress. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"If I could give a 0, I would.    On October 11 me and my family decided to go to eat at Outback in Chandler, AZ. I am 4 months pregnant and take medication that I cannot drink with (pregnant or not) so I decided to have a non-alcohol daiquiri. I asked my husband to drink some first just to be safe. He did not taste anything. I began drinking it and after about 5 sips I began feeling something is not right with the drink and felt a buzz. I asked for management to confirm there was no alcohol in my beverage. They immediately realize they made a mistake and comped our meal and said someone from corporate would be following up the next day.  The phone call I received the next day and today was a very uncaring about my pregnancy and about the medication that I take and basically said we comped your meal that's all we're doing because you weren't injured and gave you free coupons. I told them a free meal write off does not compensate for a negligent mistake.   Moral of the story is that I trusted a virgin daiquiri would be served to me and I made the situation very clear I was pregnant. The fact the corporation is uncaring that my 4 month old fetus consumed liquor and that my medications could've caused harm is unsettling.   Be careful if you order your children virgin drinks. Taste the drink first."}
{"text":"I had such a terrible experience with the lead hostess here that I joined yelp just to give a review.  The hostess on the night of 3/3/16 was terrible at her job. Incapable of dealing with the stress of the dinner rush, incapable of managing the people or the tables with any efficiency whatsoever, and responded with sarcasm when asked what position on the wait list we were on.  I can only imagine she is the girlfriend or wife of the owner or management to still be employed at this position in this restaurant as she is a terrible human being. If I could leave negative stars I would as one star is being generous.   The waitress and the food were typical of an outback steakhouse and were of no complaint."}
{"text":"Most reviewers focus on their meal, while back-grounding any comments on atmoshpere, staff, and management. I'll start instead by commenting on one of the managers who visitted the lobby to offer bite-sized samples of the Victoria's filet to patiently waiting guests. I enjoyed both the class of his guesture and the tasty bite. On this visit,  there were remodeling renovations underway, but the 35minute wait seemed less onerous after the filet sample!    When we were seated, we ordered  our 'usuals' for drinks and a bloomin' onion app. (We order more apps now that Outback offers the smaller \"petals\" portion.) I always enjoy the spicy sauce that onion's served with.--and tonight was no exception.   Our 8 year old orders an adult 1/2 rack of ribs now that she's in a growth spurt; and my wife always enjoys the Alice Springs chicken. (Note, I lived in Australia,  visitted the Alice, and there's no such thing on the menu there! )  This time around,  I got the new chicken tacos,  which had great portions of chicken and toppings to add on. My only issue was how tough tortillas get under a warmer while waiting for the rest of the meals.    Despite the construction and Saturday night bustle, everything was very satisfying, including the wait staff catching kitchen mixups Before they arrived at our table! I say great job everyone and thanks for a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I am kind of new to Outback but I am a fan. I was just looking for a place where I can eat some really good Prime Rib and I have to say that I found it. I try to come to Outback at least once a month. There service has always been really good and you can call for a reservation a head of time so that you can avoid a wait. Usually with my Prime Rib I get a side of broccoli and a side of remoulade sauce which is great for dipping. If you are not afraid of a little horse radish it is on of the best I have tried. I am lucky I do not live that far away. I always look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for our server Ryan, without him the rating would have been 1 star. He was attentive, gave refills without asking, made sure we were happy with our meal, and really cared about our dining experience. The food left a bad taste in our mouths. The onion tasted burnt and was stringy, burger was very. very close to raw inside, and the fries were so salty that they could have been used to clear the snow from my driveway in winter. I have to give credit for the GREAT potato soup. It was filling, not to hot to eat, and had a wonderful taste and aroma! A BIG thank you to Ryan for some of the best service we have had in a restaurant in many years!"}
{"text":"I am a regular of the Outback chain - as a person with too many food allergies to list - I always find the food to be 'safe' and satisfying at a great price. (I always have the Victoria's Filet)  Tonight I was a bit surprised that an assisting waitress was bringing my food - as I had not yet been served my salad.  She noticed the surprise in my expression and I explained jokingly the situation. She apologized, stated she would still bring it out and would be right back. I wasn't upset as having salad post-supper is common in Europe, etc. Not 10 seconds had passed that the manager 'Cody' was at my table expressing apologies for the mistake and offering me a free dessert.  My waitress also was quick to refill my beverage and remove finished plates.  She also apologized for the mistake.  Although I was not upset in the least, I truly appreciated the team's prompt response to even a minor mishap.    This is a very busy location, plan to call ahead or wait about an hour - if you have any concerns do not hesitate to kindly let the management know - they really want to please ever guest to the best of their ability."}
{"text":"Nettes Steakhouse am Strip. Essen ist ganz ok und die Preise vertretbar. Aber es geht sicher noch besser!  Klimaanlage war arg kalt."}
{"text":"I normally don't care for Outback, but I've been wanting to try the Alice Springs quesadilla so I ordered take out. I ordered online and it said 30 minutes. I got there 10 minutes early and they actually had it ready.  Everything was packed perfectly.   I got the small quesadilla and it was still 4 big triangles full of chicken and a side of honey mustard-tasting sauce. It was still crispy and piping hot, even after a 15 minute drive home.    I also got their blue cheese chopped salad, which is my favorite restaurant salad!   Warning: a little of the vinaigrette goes a long way.   I also got a mini double chocolate parfait and it wasn't that mini.  It was really good!.  And bonus, enough food left for lunch tomorrow  :)    I'd definitely go back for curbside take out...no crowds and no screaming children. :)"}
{"text":"Had the lobster, filet, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and Caesar salad.  All of it was nicely prepared and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Very busy on a dreary night...beer was ice cold and the Bloody Mary's were ok...Caesar salad dressing was bland but the chicken on it tasted good...Blooming Onion tasted like it could of been cooked a little longer..staff was great and place was clean"}
{"text":"The food was good but the experience wasn't.  We sat near the kitchen entrance. Waitresses coming out said \"corner\" each time. Understand the comcept. But they treated it like a game. Who could repeat it the most or say it the loudest. After an hour it was too annoying to stay."}
{"text":"Hey, thanks for the food poisoning from the undercooked steak I had last night. Sick as a dog. Ordered medium rare, but it was barely cooked. Lost appetite after a few bites. Sent it back and it was taken off the bill, but that doesn't begin to make up for my night, my morning, and a ruined Vegas trip. You should be ashamed of this location. We had to ask 3 times to get forks for a salad. Incompetent. Chefs can't even cook. Health department should shut this location down!"}
{"text":"We just had the privilege of having one of the nicest and best servers we have had in the Las Vegas area.  His attentiveness and polite ways made our meal at Outback even more enjoyable. The steaks were cooked to perfection too! Thanks to Rafael, hope you are fortunate enough to have him as your waiter. We will certainly return to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Went in for my birthday dinner and as usual had great service and food.  Their 3-course meal on wedn & sundays is a good value...great steak & baked potato. The key lime parfait is yummo as is the chocolate parfait. On top of that I received a free dessert for my birthday...a nice large slice if cheesecake with raspberry topping. So good!  And came with a candle and a cute happy face \"Happy Burfday\" note on the to-go biz.  Great job, Outback!"}
{"text":"We will never return. Poorly staffed. Burnt onion blossom. A well done medium steak. Everything over salted or way too much dressing. Sawdust baked potato. Etc etc. terrible. Save yourself the money and the trip."}
{"text":"Just picked up a large to go order from Outback and sadly my two sides that were supposed to come with the meal were not included in the bag. This is very disappointing and sadly this isn't the first time. I will not be frequenting this outback again for this reason."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Outback for years, and to this particular location ever since the doors opened.  What we love about Outback, they are always consistent, with good food, good service.  The last trip we had there was so disappointing, service was only fair, our dirty dishes from salad just sat and sat, it used to be if ANY server saw dirty dishes, they would grab them on their way past, even the manager stood there and asked us how everything was, and left without picking up one dish, very disappointing.  One of the best parts of coming here is, the servers, their attentiveness, clean restaurant, and by far the best steaks for the price.  We will try one more time, I'm hoping this was just a fluke, please go back to how you used to be, the customer is first."}
{"text":"Outback is always a great place to be! Enjoy the atmosphere and the fantastic steaks while sipping your favorite cocktail. The wait staff is very polite and helpful. I haven't much to say on the bad side of this place. We walked in, were seated and we were able to cuddle quietly in our booth for nearly an hour and a half.  Over all a great experience!"}
{"text":"Go after 7:45 PM on a Friday night. Thats when it calms down. Sorry to say that the next day I got sick. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I think they like to bait and switch the cuts of meat, its happened to me and my family at 3 locations we've visited, this one, Rainbow and Henderson. I've ordered the filet, but somehow they like to give me the sirloin, which is smaller and no way tastes or looks like a filet mignon!! Like we don't know the difference??? Every single time, they send the manager to apologize for giving us the wrong cut of meats??? Their apologies hardly seem sincere, it feels like this is their standard practice as I've heard other friends complain of the same thing. So you hired chefs who don't know the difference between a filet and sirloin?? Their side dishes were lack luster too, they gave us cold mashed potatoes, baked potatoes and broccoli! We really wanted to like this place but it just didn't deliver! Very sad!!! Go somewhere else where they really know how to prepare a steak and give you what you ordered!!"}
{"text":"This place smells like a deceptively empty subway car during rush hour.  The staff are very friendly, though."}
{"text":"Always a great meal when we eat there been to all the local Outback locations and this one is one of the best. Great service too. I liked that you can get the smaller portion of the blooming onion and they have a burger with that sauce on it, tasted great! And for you fellow AARP members you get 15% off by showing your AARP card."}
{"text":"The best onions ever. Great service, and the rest of the food I had was also delicious, but the blooming onions... Mmm, never thought food could be sooo good."}
{"text":"I had the Tilapia with crab and I must say it was quite good. Cooked right and the vegetables were a nice side.   I would give it 5 stars but our server was extremely slow greeting our table. I mean 4-5 mins before saying Hello. Major pet peeve of mine since I am a server myself. He seemed frazzled with the 3 tables he did have. It was close to closing time so maybe he was just over his day. Who knows.   Overall decent experience and I also must mention their very friendly and talkative hostess! Huge plus!   Restaurant appeared to be kept very clean also obviously a huge plus!"}
{"text":"I always get the prime rib cut to order. My cut is always 26oz lol. The prime rib is always cooked to perfection. The wedge salad is usually my side but I do ask them to leave off the balsamic....as I don't like the taste and would rather have extra blue cheese. The service is always pretty good and they have never given me a reason not to return but rather give me several reasons to return."}
{"text":"We like it better than the one near us. Service was good, food was good, we'd be regulars if we lived closer.."}
{"text":"You guys absolutely suck. We ordered our food to go, and sat there for 20 minutes, then you guys come out and tell us you forgot our order and had to make it. Then once we got home we noticed one of our meals was missing the most important part, THE STEAK! How do you forget the steak? Thats what most people go there for? So ridiculous!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner tonight and the service was outstanding CJ our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly we well be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We went to this Outback for lunch on Thursday just before noon.  The person that sat us was also our server.  I asked if we could be seated near a electrical outlet.  I have COPD & have a concentrator for oxygen and it depletes fast.  We have been told that there is no such thing in many places we have been.  She immediately said sure & lead us to it.  That was awesome we didn't have to worry or hurry.  The lunch Coconut Scrimp was excellent.  Everything was hot and the server was very good.    Overall it was an excellent experience."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern, Last night my wife and I wanted some good quality us time at a decent restaurant. But, last night was ruined for us service was extremely terrible. Our server took about 10minutes long to finally acknowledge us by that time we had already know what my wife and I wanted to eat. Finally she comes around introduces herself ask for our drinks, gets our order down with an appetizer we asked for. Then she leaves after that I don't not exaggerate when I say this but another server had to bring our drinks because she was taking long I usually don't finish my drink when she realize our drinks had already been brought she automatically assumed we'd need another one so left them in our table. Then 45 minutes later go by and our food is brought to us the server brought me the wrong food I didn't order I had order chicken tacos she brought me steak I asked for my fries to be smothered with bacon on them no bacon was on it my last taco was cold so I didn't eat it only reason I ate them was because I wasn't going to wait another 45 minutes worst service in my life."}
{"text":"It was okay.  We were looking forward to eating there and we're served by a very nice server, Lamar and the food wasn't bad overall.  We weren't served the bread though, for some reason, which was okay since we ordered the blooming onion and that was filling. But, what we noticed that was strange was that the manager walked by our table around three times and asked the other guests around us how their food was, but never bothered to ask us.  Not sure why that was the case, because he surely saw us. At the end, walking out the host and hostess were preoccupied talking to each other, I guess, and didn't bother to say, \"thank you for coming in,\" or anything polite.  This is not what I've ever experienced before at an Outback restaurant.  Not sure that I'll be going back to that location.  Didn't get the warmth usually provided."}
{"text":"Alice Springs chicken is always great here. I would avoid the Fosters Fish and chips, every fillet was only slightly larger than frozen fish sticks and they were all tasteless - definitely NOT worth the $14."}
{"text":"(singing) Outback steak house! Being that this is a chain restaurant and I have eating at many Outback's in my time. I can truly say that this particular one has the best service and great food.   Like most outbacks they look the same and serve up the same food but I was wowed by how great the service was here. The food came hot and fast. My drink was never empty and the waitress did it all with a smile. We had a great night and some really good food!"}
{"text":"I'd give this location 3.5 stars. There was no host standing up front upon arriving. We sat ourselves in the bar. From past experiences, you're welcome to seat yourself if you're going to the bar booths.  Took a little too long for someone to come greet the table and take a drink order. And the server seemed to be running around that seemed odd for how slow it was. The food was good and the bread was fresh and warm. The server was prompt on bring the check and was very nice when telling us to have a good day."}
{"text":"I went here Friday night and our server was very nice. We got our soup and salad very fast but once we finished those we waited about a good 45 mins for our main course to arrive. Our server wasn't anywhere around to check on us or for me to ask what was going on.. I understand that sometimes mistakes happen in the kitchen and get backed up (because I work in a restaurant) but the table behind us was seated after us and received their meals and were finished before we ever got ours. It also wasn't at a busy time, around 830.  Once the food came I was a bit frustrated because we waited for almost an hour. I would have definitely enjoyed my meal more if we didn't have to wait as long as we did.. Maybe we'll give it another try down the road."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you have limited options and are in for work and staying really close, if you have a car, which 100% of people should have whilst looking at this,  you should really explore a little and head elsewhere, if you have time of course.  You will receive medium burgers cooked fully and other similar things here.  This is located well for people that are on corporate contracts and apparently are willing to pay rather low prices for food that is not exceptional.   Good luck road warriors!"}
{"text":"I had a piece of metal wire in my soup. The server brought us a new carafe of wine to make up for the error. However myself and one other guest were going to barely finish the first one we had ordered. One of us has a bit of a history with drinking, and occasionally rewards self for good behavior. Having a free bottle appear was not good for keeping that discipline. So instead of asking what he could do for us, he just took it upon himself to bring the wine. Unwanted, not touched, not cool.  Thrity minutes later, at the end of the meal I asked for the check and to speak to a manager so I could get his response to the object in the soup. I shouldn't have had to ask, he should have come to me. While waiting I called the customer service number for Outback and reported my experience. I had previously told the host and the server that I intended to pay my bill but I just wanted to talk to a manager, who arrived about one minute after I finished the call with Outback corporate headquarters. He took my debit card and check and disappeared for about ten minutes.  When he returned he had a pleasant, glowing smile and handed me the check folder with the check and my debit card inside. I could see it had been zeroed out. Wow. All he had to do to get his head right was go back to his office, take a call from corporate, and realize he had better not take one penny from me. Do you think I'm stupid? If he himself wanted to comp the meal he didn't have to go through the charade of taking my debit card to the kitchen for ten minutes.  His expression and body language was so overly gracious when he showed me the zero check. As if he were doing me a great favor.  I ended up getting some gift cards, so I decided to give them another try. At a later date I went in EARLY IN THE LUNCH HOUR just to get a visual inspection, since other previous visits had the place dirty. I went to the hostess stand and told her I found the bathroom filthy and all the child booster seats completely covered in food. I mean every single high chair and booster, and every one of them really bad.  She had a smug, disinterested expression since she knew I was just complaining and leaving. It went in one ear and out the other.  A few nights later I called ahead and asked for a manager. I told him of all this, and told him that, against my better judgement, I was willing to give them one last try. I warned him that I would be especially looking at the cleanliness of the bathroom and what I had previously seen at the booster seats, and that I'm coming in with children.  I arrived a while later, took my son to the restroom. One urinal was completely covered in urine, there were wet paper towels and toilet paper on the floor and the. On my way out I noticed on particular triangle shaped piece of paper towel on the floor between the two bathrooms. The kid seats were not as bad as the previous visit, but not great. Granted they would likely be wiped down before being given to a family but they shouldn't be sitting there dirty.  An hour and a half later, I returned to the bathroom and found it in EXACTLY the same untouched state. That little triangle of paper was moved slightly from people walking around but it was right there.  I brought my concerns to the kitchen manager. I told her of my concerns that any establishment that takes hygiene shortcuts where the customers can see could potentially be taking worse shortcuts behind closed doors. She assured me that her standard at her primary job as kitchen manager is extremely high and sometimes gets grumbling from her employees that she's too harsh, picky and particular. That's a good thing. Well her high standards didn't prevent us from getting a stack of wet, oily bread plates.  Hey restaurant managers, do you really think your rushed servers are going to actually take accountability and inspect what they bring to the table? They just trust that the dishwashers did their job.  It was like an intentional slap in the face when I had called the dining room manager and said, \"Hey, red alert! On my way! I didn't like your dirty bathrooms and kid seats! I have gift cards from a previous bad experience! I'll be checking out the bathrooms!\" and then, to find, among all things, that the bathroom was horrible when I got there and untouched for the next 90 minutes.  And the hygiene nazi in the kitchen is putting out dirty plates.  They asked me to give them time to turn things around. Here's an idea: supervise and hold people accountable. Surprise inspections. Show up on your off time and see if your employees are bullshitting you"}
{"text":"On Monday, a friend and I went to the Outback for a nice meal. We go to this restaurant because we always had a great meal. This is the first time both of us were very disappointed in the bar drinks and the Ribeyes. They didn't know how to make White Russians and the Ribeyes were very tough. We must have been  given a Flat Iron Steak. We will not go back. We go out several times a week and we will find another steak house. Shame on management"}
{"text":"Service is always excellent, I love the macaroni and cheese! Great atmosphere, and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Usually I have better service but tonight was awful. I ordered curbside to go ordered two sirloin steaks with French fries, mashed potatoes, broccoli and a baked potato. My fries were beyond Soggy and there was literally like 12 fries in the box. I asked if I could get more fries the man says you would have to pay $3 for more, because they're weighed out. First off if I was inside  dining in I bet they would've got me different and more fries. Money was not the problem I pay the $3 for more fries and he comes out with a box that's not even half full. I ask for A1 sauce and he brings me A1 sauce in the carrier and it's not even filled up, mind you I have two steaks! The mashed potatoes were dry and the courtesy bread that's given was hard also.  Outback pissed my husband and I off tonight and I guess we're gonna have to go out our way to go to another location because I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I had undercooked chicken that had to be sent back to the kitchen for a replacement.  How do you undercook chicken?  The manager came to speak to me but did not offer to take it off my bill or give me a free desert.  Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Steaks were grilled to correct temp & tasted great. Service was nice. BUT, the place was sweltering hot! We asked to cool it off, but to no avail. Too bad, kinda spoiled our visit. Hey guys, its North Carolina in the summer...air conditioning is a must."}
{"text":"Great food I love the cheese fries and wings. The service is fantastic. They are friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Lost my business yesterday when we stopped in around 7 pm for a table.  Hostess looked clueless and mumbled something about servers picking up tables.  No greeting or taking my name.  I figured there were not enough servers or they don't know how to manage their operation.   Left it quickly and will only use the Westlake location as we have received good service there."}
{"text":"Extremely slow! Ordered take out at 6:45 and was told pick up would be ready at 7:13. Didn't get food until 7:45 pm and I wasn't the only one waiting.   Not just pick up. Came to restaurant 2-3 weeks ago and sat inside for 45 minutes before leaving to go somewhere else.   Don't go here unless you've got 3 hours to kill."}
{"text":"Looks like Outback has jumped the shark. What used to be a really quality and unique steak house is now as shell of its former self.  Arrived last evening to celebrate my birthday. We registered on line for seating and when we arrived were seated right away. Our drink order was taken and ordered a Blooming onion. The onion came and was very greasy. The steak was average at best sides were ok.   I must say though the service was great and watires was very polite and knew the menu. The remodeling of the inside looks as if they are  trying to look trendy.  You would have no idea that it is a Australian themed restaurant. It reminds me of a restaurant  you'd find in a hotel.   If I choose to go to a chain steakhouse,  I'll be going to Texas roadhouse. Same quality steaks,easier on my wallet."}
{"text":"It's been 2 years since my last visit, have things changed!! My steak was half the size I remembered. The mushrooms used to be so great, not this time .The baked potato shrunk to half the size as well. The only item that was good was the friggin onion or whatever they call it. Will never go back, to any location."}
{"text":"The excellent manager of this Outback, SCOTT, is the absolute savior of our most recent evening here. We were in a hurry to see a movie, so we should have allowed more time, not anticipating we would have a few mishaps en route. OK. Our hostess was friendly; our waitress, Kim, was cheerful, took our order quickly, and assured us she would do everything in her power to get us in & out quickly. Great!  We believed her, as she did not have more than a couple of tables to take care of. The food runner brought our Caesar salads & disappeared.  As soon as we lifted our forks we could plainly see there was not a drop of dressing nor a speck of parmesan on them. As we knew no one was going to do a tableside presentation to dress these dry pieces of lettuce, we sat mute...looking everywhere in vain for our waitress.  Fortunately, Scott was actually DOING HIS JOB and came over.  He immediately took the lettuce and returned with 2 delicious, properly-dressed Caesars! Thank you!  Our steaks then arrived via another \"runner\" and were cooked to perfection. Very nice. Not needing coffee or dessert (not that we were asked....as our waitress was no where around) we began to look around again for our waitress., as we needed the check.  No luck.  Clock ticking away. Finally, a polite runner was flagged down & she proceeded to go in search of our waitress.  Not finding her, she did produce the check for us, but we had to again ask her if she could now take our payment so we could leave.  She left & we were stranded again.... for quite a while. My hubs said, \"Sometimes it helps it you stand up\" and did so. From the far side I saw Scott notice him & go to the kitchen, apparently in another fruitless attempt to find our waitress for us.  In another minute, he was at our table apologizing. SCOTT is a true professional & has his restaurant's success in mind.  We were not angry, just in a hurry, and he comped our meal---to our absolute surprise.  Just as we left our booth, our waitress returned from Antarctica (or wherever the heck she was all evening) and she proceed to scoop up our credit card & tried to run off! We explained the circumstances & left her a generous tip (which she did NOT deserve!). Scott should be the President of Outback Steakhouse. His CREW is truly lucky to have such a leader present and on the job."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this location despite some of these reviews. I loved it. Janette was our server, she did a fabulous job. We ordered the filet portobella and porterhouse. It was amazing. When the manager, Patricia asked us how we were doing I decided to ask her a few questions. By the way how many restaurants have managers check in on you? Anyway, I asked her about things regarding the yelp reviews.   I asked her if I could sample the clam chowder and she said this location doesn't even carry clam chowder. So how can someone complain about the clam chowder when they NEVER had it? And I asked her what's the number one complaint she receives and she said either underdone or overdone steaks. Come on people, it happens! They didn't purposely do that. I'm sure they want to hear you complain right? No!   Patricia and Janette and everyone here at this location really make this place wonderful. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends on sunday evening.. We were promplty shown a table without waiting which is good.. The waiter is courteous and took our order for drinks and food..I ordered coconut shrimp and herb roasted prime rib(medium rare) which comes with a side and a salad.. I asked for Cobb Salad.. 5 mts later he comes back and says cobb is going to be 11.99 extra he can only do a house salad..bacon n chicken a dollar extra.. I asked him to go for it.. Tha salad is served but no chicken... Now comes my main course the prime rib.. Guess what.. Its not medium rare.. Guess it is extremely rare.. Since we had plans and couldnt wait.. I somehow gulped in some and left the rest.. I'm posting a picture below.. See for urself if it looks meduim rare.."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at this  restaurant.  Our server's name was Theresa.  She was very friendly and treated us as if were her only customers.  There was no hurrying even though the restaurant was very busy.  My husband ordered a steak medium rare.  When our order was done  I noticed that the steak was a little more done than he wanted. .  He would have eaten it as it was but  she went and got the manager who insisted that they make him another the way he wanted.  The next steak was just the way he wanted it.  I was very pleased and will definitely return there in the future.  My only suggestion is that you make a reservation as otherwise there is a long wait."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Two people in our party, one ordered the Prime Rib and I ordered Bacon-Bourbon Salmon, which was outstanding and would order it again!  However, when reading the menu this is what is printed in the menu:  \"Bacon Bourbon Salmon - Wood-fire grilled Salmon brushed with smoky bourbon glaze and topped with bacon.  Fresh seasonal mixed veggies.\"  The salmon arrived on a plate and that was all, no mixed veggies.  I asked the waiter about the mixed veggies and he said that the veggies are an optional side.  That is not what the menu states.  If it is optional, then it should state that in the description.  The waiter was very kind and quickly made sure I got the veggies.  But makes me wonder how many other customers did not get veggies when ordering this entree.  Their menu needs to be a bit clearer.  Might have given it 5 stars if not for this small hiccup."}
{"text":"Over all a great place to eat. there are color crayons and pics for the kids to stay entertained. the staff is great. our favorite is Nicole with the pretty black curly hair. ask for her!  the food is great and always fresh. for this price point, Outback goes out of their way.   obviously, if you come during peak hours of 6 or 7pm, be prepared to wait for seating, because its a poplar place. we like to go around 4:30 to beat the crowds.  I havent disliked anything on the menu yet, however, because they recently changed their pecan blue cheese salad recipe...so they get 4 stars...even the Manager said he was disappointed that Corp changed the salad recipe, it was my wifes favorite."}
{"text":"My wife got the wedge salad with steak and loved it, I got three crab cakes and was only able to finish 1.5. Waiter asked if I wanted something else and was very nice, but I told him that they just weren't very good. Manager came over and offered me something else, but I wasn't hungry after trying to eat the cakes. They both were awesome and ended up just taking it off the tab, excellent customer service even though my food was poor. Five stars for trying their best. I wouldn't recommend the crab cakes, but I do recommend this outback!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place ONE STAR... Me and my boyfriend of Seven years went there for his 35th birthday  with his grandparents.... Had 2 beers at the bar and ordered another beer at the table for food... AMY, the manager told my 35 yr old boyfriend he had enough to drink (3beers) ... And she wouldn't give him any more... How insaluting! We will NEVER be back.and its our first time. Whos right is it to say that? Three beers is the limit at outback? Funny how we spent over $100 on 4 meals but can't have more than three beers...  Never again! How Fucken Rude! Thanks AMY UPDATE: I Called to complain about it and they didn't care how I felt about the situation... Never again will we EVER GO.. UNLESS you plan on having 1 beer or less . ."}
{"text":"I used to avoid this location. I feel they must have new management. The last few times I have visited this location it was excellent service. I frequent the curbside takeout; my order is always correct and fresh."}
{"text":"Soo disappointed!! Outback used to be one of my favorite restaurants to go to. I had not been in at least a year and so I decided to go. I was disappointed beyond belief. How could a chain restaurant that I have been to countless times gone so down hill?? I think I found the reason: cost.  1. They cut waaaaayy back on portion size. I used to get enough food in a dinner portion to feed me and have leftovers or split with someone else. Now, they have these weird shaped plates that are kind of rectangular with an angle to them -probably to disguise that they are SMALLER PLATES! So you definitely get a much smaller portion when you come here. When I saw my plate I said, wait a minute, is this off of the lunch menu???  2. They may have majorly decreased portion size but they did not decrease the prices on the menus.. Which is quite frustrating.  3. The food quality- I had the Alice Springs Chicken here. It was BAD!! And I really do mean that. I actually cooked a copycat recipe of this a while back and it was so much better than the one I had here (and I am definitely not a good cook!!!). The chicken seriously it was completely bland. I had to douse it in the honey mustard sauce that it came with to hide the plain chicken. What was even worse, I've NEVER HAD BACON THAT TASTED THIS BAD!! The flavor of the bacon was so wrong. I don't know if it was the fact that it was overcooked or just bad quality bacon but it really tasted gross. Oh, as for the mushrooms that are supposed to be on here, I got a whole 2 slices for my whole piece of chicken!! Come on!! Soo cheap of them!!"}
{"text":"I ate at Outbacks around the US on my trip and this Outback because of the service was the #1 best. We ate in the bar and Melissa was our server. She was awesome  Food is always consistent ... I do wish Outback would put one decent  draft beer in as they use to instead of the second rate Blue Moons, Samuel Adams Dos Equis choices. Yuk  They use to have some type of Aussie Amber that was great. I hate the beer choices I love their food. Thank you for great attention to my last visit."}
{"text":"First time at Outback, steak was great,  service was excellent, and very reasonably priced. Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was typical outback food.  Good steak with ok appetizers and vegetables.  The service can be slow at this location, but it was busy when I was there.  I would go again if I want cheap good steak."}
{"text":"well figured I would give them another shot. still nothing it used to be, ordered the sirloin and was a tough grizzled peice, the brocolli came out with a funny brown hue, sent it back and the replacement was near raw. This tells me they simply don't know how to handle food, which is worse than than back quality meat, it's dangerous. I had a couple of discount cards and simple threw them away and will never go back. within 6 months they went from stellar to cellar. just avoid if you can."}
{"text":"So far horrible service. Asked for no lemon in my water and got no ice. Told the waiter separate checks and he said that would make our food take longer. 30mins for a cocktail. And then a dirty martini with no olives...hmmm. not really counting on my steak being cooked correctly...ugh! Never again in this place."}
{"text":"On 3/24/17 we went to the Outback steakhouse. Our server was TONY!! He was awesome. Felt like we were the only customers he had, although the restaurant was full. We had the unlimited soup & salad, baked otato soup and salad!! Recommend t the restaurant and ask for Tony!! You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"They made us wait 15min for a table, but there are at least 8 tables empty and set for seating right next to the waiting area. Bad servoce"}
{"text":"The food is solid, just not great. I would say it's slightly overpriced for the food quality and level of service. Get there early because they start getting a line at 5:30."}
{"text":"Consistent food quality with multiple people checking on us for bread and drink refills, confirming everything was okay and the manager even stopping by to introduce herself.  Hard to find the building but their new location will be great...the wait not so much."}
{"text":"Roxanne in the bar area is wonderful. She makes you feel like family. She remembers your name order and what you talk about preivously.   And unlike other outback locations they cook there steaks correctly. So if you ask for medium you get medium. I used to go to  two different locations. But on almost every visit they over or undercooked my food and would them explain how they do there.meat differently. However not at this one on  craig.   There filets are yummy and the garlic mash it a great side. And let's not forget the cheese fries just make sure you ask for layered cheese"}
{"text":"Food was good, service not so much! Server didn't know the menu and never asked how we wanted our protein cooked. We had to tell him. You would think it is second nature to ask being that its a steakhouse! Oh and our appetizer came about a minute before the main course. I'll dine again, but definitely not at this location!"}
{"text":"I patronized this location on Friday, March 7,  There were 4 people in our party.  The service was not great, but good.  One of the people in the party ordered the Victorian Filet.  It was not cooked as ordered and contained an abnormal amount of fat on the interior.  They were not able to  informed the waiter until we were just about finished eating.  The manager visited the table and a new steak was brought out, cooked as ordered and very good.  We paid our bill, left and discovered the next day we were billed for and paid a tip accordingly for an additional steak dinner.  I returned the next evening, asked for the manager, showed her the receipt with 4 people and 5 dinners.  There was absolutely no hassle.  I was refunded the amount by means of a gift card worth more than the cost of the dinner.  Because of this I will definitely return when back in the area.  I would also like to say that the rack of lamb was a little on the salty side,"}
{"text":"I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED SUCH GREAT SERVICE!!!! I really cant emphasize that. As soon as you walk in the doors(which someone holds open for you) you get a warm welcome. We were seated right away within 2 minutes our server comes over and introduces himself (OH MAN I WISH I REMEMBERED HIS NAME). He started by taking ohr drink ordera d asking us if we wanted an appetizer. I ordere an unsweetend tea and the Aussie cheese fries. He promptly returned with our drinks as well as bread and butter and lets us know that our appetizer has been placed. We went ahead and ordered... I was in the mood for a burger so I went ahead and ordered the Moonshine burger medium well...OMG...HEAVEN! The meat was nice and juicy the bread was slightly toasted it was stuffed with onion ring lettuce and tomatoes...Makes me hungry just thinkig about it. For dessert i ordered good ol cheesecake , im not gonna lie i didnt really care for the raspberry sauce but ehh cant have it all. Throught dinner the server cracked jokes and played alomg with our jokes. He IS the reason why im giving it a 5 star!!!"}
{"text":"OK location..not the best...food was OK...waitress was nice..restroom smelled a little bit & toilet was real low to the ground..."}
{"text":"Tony 1/9/14  The food was good..but this waitress was really extra slow on bringing our food..finally other women brings our food and with disappointment.. My moms food didn't have any veg.on her plate when she thought it said on the menu she could have veg and other side but this women kept talking over my mom explaining that my mom is wrong..but wrong or right she was so rude. All she should if done is sorry mam we got a mix up and just give her the veg. So after she left the table we called our waitress over explained the same thing to her and she just gave her the veg. With out making a seen in front of other costumer's. So that was nice of her other than being slow on our services she did good on the customer is always right  saying. Won't be back there for awhile.. So over all good food slow and rude service"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the food quality. Overly cooked meat, soggy fries, dry pasta... However, the staff were very kind."}
{"text":"The online system made ordering take out easy. The food was ready within 10 minutes of placing the order. My food was delivered to the car within 30 seconds of pulling up to the curbside parking. A friendly young lady delivered the food to the car and thanked me for my order. Upon arriving home I noticed a lobster/mushroom topping was not included. I called and a friendly guy named Will but me through to a manager in less than a minute. The manager was cheerful and refunded my card with no questions asked. She apologized for the inconvenience and explained the online system offered and option that the location had not served in three years. The food was delicious and a great temperature even for take out."}
{"text":"Outback Steakhouse in Malvern, PA is better than your average chain restaurant steakhouse. It's a good place for a casual evening or weekend meal. The food is quite tasty and the service is good. The servers and kitchen staff make an effort to be accommodating of special dietary requests."}
{"text":"First time we came we had very poor service.. So we decided to try this place again and same shyt!!! Not coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Oh I don't want to edit my review I wish to add.  Ashley you were so fun and on a busy Wed's madness dinner hour. You made us laugh and become part of the outback family experience I notice the entire staff was committed to enhancing your outback experience More expensive dining is easy to find however this staff is nit they all work well together and are happy you selected Outback and i promise you will be happy as well at the West Sahara location"}
{"text":"I'm not sure were you guys came from but you are not OUTBACK that i know.  Bad manager has ruined this other wise nice family restaurant Don't blame your staff for this one Brush up in your training and maybe you should be demoted so you learn first hand why you don't belittle your staff mid shift I really should have stepped up when I witnessed it Closure at last"}
{"text":"Very good deal was a welcomed sight...they have a special for $16 choice of soup salad and  steak and chicken choice with dessert ...really??? So affordable right?? Well I figure for that $$ ya get what ya get.... Nope the steak was perfect just as good as the $$$ cuts soup and salad( I got the pecan blue cheese ) was awesome and cheesecake for dessert perfect add a rum punch for$4 and your taking home left overs"}
{"text":"We were seated under an air conditioning vent and were very cold.  Despite two requests to have it adjusted, nothing changed.   My drink order was taken incorrectly (a Coke, please).  And my daughter's entrée order came out wrong (a steak was served when a filet was ordered).    The food tasted OK but we couldn't enjoy it.  We used to like eating at Outback but it's not as nice as it used to be."}
{"text":"Soooo the place is kinda small. Not the most professional staff but the House Manager is the BOMB!!! U can tell he likes people and does a great job with service. But yall gotta try the filet mignon it was sooo good. Of course it's not Mortons but definitely worth 20 bucks."}
{"text":"Got a packed house on Sunday and they seated us right when we came in. Veronica was our waitress and she was awesome! Very attentive to our needs. Food was extremely tasty I had the Surf and Turf and the steak was very juicy and tender. The shrimp tasted phenomenal with the garlic butter! I would definitely recommend, as the packed house did not change the service. The Manager came by to our table and asked if we were happy. That doesn't happen in many places. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while. Glad we came back. We got there early enough for happy hour... $4.00 Strawberry Sangria was excellent! Our waitress Michelle was outstanding. She was friendly and knowledgeable. She wanted to make sure our dining experience was memorable and she did a good job. I ordered the Alice Springs Chicken with a sweet potato. Very good. My husband ordered talapia with lump crab and mashed potatoes. He said he enjoyed it. My son ordered salmon topped with bacon... It was ... interesting , but he said he wouldn't get it again. All in all we had a great experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Service was great, didn't take it out on waiter. .... Kitchen is horrible.  Ordered a medium rare filet and it come out raw (blue). Sent it back and they gave me the same filet that was now cut in half and dried out, but it was medium rare. They also served me the same garlic mashed potato that must have been sitting under heat as they were crunchy.  My wife ordered a medium filet and it was over well done.  Kitchen doesn't seem like they care in quality. No one paying attention to final product.   Don't recommend.  Go to Longhorn as they are the same price range and they care."}
{"text":"Terrible. Keep trying to give them another chance and always disappointed. So inconsistent and very overpriced. Ordered two Ahi Tuna apps and cheese fries - the cheese fries are not a $10 worthy app! Called to complain since this is the third or fourth time they hardly put toppings on it, did not give us the dipping sauce and it was cold! My husband spoke to a manager whom said they would email us a $10 GC (which is not trying to win back the customer in my opinion, as we have spent quit a bit here). Never received the GC and that was Dec. 11 when we ordered and spoke to the manager. On top of that it was my birthday! I just had my fifth child in July and my one night to not cook was ruined and we spent a ton of money for nothing. Will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"I am in love with the spinach artichoke dip and the crab stuffed mushrooms. Which they serve with a buttery sauce that is amazing. Staff here has always been great and have never had a complaint."}
{"text":"My husband likes the ribs at Outback, so we went there on Father's Day. Before we received our food, the power went out on the whole block. We didn't know if we should stay or go. A few minutes later they brought out the food. None of us received our  vegetables we ordered they said because the microwave obviously did not work. The meats were ok, but it got very uncomfortable eating as the temperature rose without any air conditioning, since it was over 90 outside. We were surprised there was no accommodation or discount on the bill, especially since we didn't receive all our food. But my husband did not want to make a fuss since he picked the place. But I think this was very poor customer service especially on a holiday. Next time I would just walk out if this happens."}
{"text":"Just had a freaking delicious dinner here! The mild wing appetizer was very good, my beer was ice cold, and my steak was perfect."}
{"text":"Our server Daniel was very knowledgeable of the menu, he was very attentive and professional. Food was delicious , we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Jane.....slow...inattentive...and blatantly uncaring. The restaurant was very slow yet it was 45 minutes after we ordered before our food arrived. Then the order was incorrect. Very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! We went in about 8 and the place was not busy but it took about 10 minutes for our server to get us our drinks. I order chicken and he ordered a steak, both tasted great, however where over priced for what we got. We both ordered broccoli as our side, we got about 5 stalks of broccoli, the stem was so long it looked like a lot, the bad was cold and hard, and while there where servers running all around us, ours rarely checked in us. While friends have told us this has never happened to them, we will never go back."}
{"text":"Food was ok, went for lunch, SAT for 45 minutes waiting for the bill. I could understand if they were busy, but they were only a couple of the people in the restaurant. The service in this location is atrocious. Note to self, do not go here for lunch unless you're taking the rest of the afternoon off."}
{"text":"Double check your Togo order because they did not put anything I have requested in my Togo order. Not enough of sauce, wrong butter, and gave me the wrong shrimp."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the second time I've been to this location, generally it's a bit more than we're looking for to spend on a workday lunch but Outback is pretty good about sending out coupons every month or so and this time was 20% off.  The three of us got there around 11:30, service was good and everything was clean.  This time around I decided to try the double burger and fries, the burger was good but from seeing my coworker's bacon cheeseburger  it looked like they just cut a single patty in half to make the double.  I would probably recommend sticking to the steaks and if you want a burger go to Stone Mountain Grill.  I wouldn't wait to eat here but during the week when there's no line it's not that bad, only downside is trying to fight traffic to get back on the road."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  I eat at Outback occasionally  and I have to say the last two times have been horrible.  One evening I ordered to go and when I got to work our order was all wrong.  Tonight I took my mom and nephews out for a birthday dinner and the food was not good. My mom said her steak was cooked wrong and had a seasoning on it she didn't want.  The shrimp was just gross."}
{"text":"Let's face it, Outback isn't a 5 star steakhouse.  It's a inexpensive chain restaurant that serves steak.  But even with that said, I do expect good service when I walk into a restaurant and spend my hard earned money.  This outback was located within walking distance of the hotel I was staying at.  I chose to eat here instead of just grabbing something at the hotel bar.  It was a Saturday evening, and as expected the place was packed.  Took me about 20 minutes to get a seat at the bar, which I didn't think was bad considering the number of people in the restaurant.  Was slightly annoyed that none of the bartenders thought it would be a good idea to ask me if I wanted a drink.  After finally sitting, down I ordered my meal:  Cesar salad, 6 ounce sirloin with blue cheese crust and mashed potatoes.  For what it costs (I believe it was under $13)  it was a great bargain.  All is good until my entree comes out and I notice that my steak does not have the blue cheese crust that I ordered.  The bar was very noisy, and I'm easy to forgive the bartender for not getting my order right assuming that he just didn't hear my order correctly.  The handling of this mistake is where my night takes a turn for the worse.    I promptly tell the server of the mistake that was made, he apologizes and walks away leaving my order in front of me.  Knowing my order is wrong I don't touch the plate in front of me.  He comes out several minutes later with a salad plate and asks me to transfer the steak to the plate so he can bring it back to the kitchen.  About 10 minutes later my steak comes back out with the crust and he slides the steak back onto my plate (with my now cold mashed potatoes) during which the steak flips over and all of the blue cheese crust falls off.  The server then turns and walks away.  Now I completely understand that mistakes happen in restaurants but when one is made, I do expect them to be handled in a graceful manner.  The server should have just taken my plate back to the kitchen and fixed the order.  This just seems like common sense to me.  While the food was good for the price, the lackluster service was enough for me to not consider going back if I was ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I had to come all the way to Cleveland from Boston to eat at an Outback. Something about Austalian restaurants only serving steaks to me is not appealing. Anyway, it was the closest restaurant from my hotel so tried it. Food was uneventful...a very standard but juicy steak without any personality. The bloomin onion was pretty to look at..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come on down to this Outback Steakhouse and you will leave with a level of satisfaction that I can't describe but instead can only be understood through experience. Of course the steaks are awesome, along with their margaritas which I think they're known for. These margaritas are not your average margaritas due to the fact that they have a sweet and salty taste in them which I've never experienced in a margarita before. Incredible!! Plus, add some strawberry and you'll be happy. I'm just going to repeat that the steaks are nice and juicy and filling. Just make sure to get a sweet potato on the side with their cinnamon butter, and some green beans."}
{"text":"Extremely fast service!  Our waiter Josh was on point tonight!  Our order was put in, and within 10 minutes it was served to us piping hot. Food tasted great!"}
{"text":"I was visiting the area last week and stopped by this Outback for an early dinner. I was hesitant because of the negative Yelp reviews. I have to say that my experience was excellent from the waiter to the food. The steak was a good cut and cooked perfectly. My only complaint is that they do not have Sam Adams on tap which is contrary to the menu. Otherwise everything was great."}
{"text":"Sehr schönes Steakhaus mitten auf dem Strip.   Hier gabs das beste Steak das ich jemals gegessen habe. :-)"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Outback Steakhouse in Matthews,  I ordered a burger, medium well and it came to the table completely raw in the center.  After showing it to the other people at my table I decided to return it to the kitchen.  When the waiter saw it, he agreed it was way undercooked and was very apologetic.  Another woman, who I assume was the manager also came out the to table to apologize.  The waiter took it back to the kitchen and returned a while later with a new burger, which was properly cooked, however by that time, everyone else was finished eating, so they had to wait around while I finished my meal.  They did not discount our bill at all or offer a free desert or anything for their mistake.  I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This has been our local Outback for the past 2 years and it's always good. Usually get the outback special 8oz and very good, especially for the value.   Steak! Yum."}
{"text":"I can't even give them a star! My husband & I were excited to go there but, I'm really beyond disappointed at the event that took place there yesterday. We ordered the all you can eat shrimp and steak we asked for the fillets with it. We were given sirlions instead. When we told our waitress they made a mistake her reply was, Oh, they press them down.\" Are you kidding me! We asked for the manager as she was approaching us my husband snapped a picture of our meal. My husband asked the manager, \"Please tell me what kind of cut this steak is.\" She actually refused to answer him. Telling us whatever she says, she can't win. Win? This is your companies reputation and I believe we deserve an answer for why we would be served a sirlion (which by the way, is a totally different price) and not the fillets, like we ordered? So, with no apologies or admittance from the manager we choose to leave. I'm disgusted at that whole ordeal. So for anyone reading this.... know your cuts of meat or they will try and pass off a cheaper meat but, charge you for the 30 dollar filet. She didn't even say it was a fillet either. The only reason is that they were serving sirlion trying to pass it off as fillets! So if someone just wants a steak and really doesn't know cuts of meat...then they got you! Shame on Outback Steakhouse. You are despicable and your choice in managers leaves me to question this companies integrity and character. I'll never go to any of them again and I will never recommend them to anyone either! Thank you for ruining our only night out! I guess I can't post this unless a star is given; so know that the star is only there to get this posted. They are very dishonest and that doesn't deserve a star! You can look on their menu or Google a sirlion or filet."}
{"text":"The server was very efficient.  The steak was over cooked and he brought us a replacement very quickly. Martinis were excellent. The chicken dish was drowned in sodium.  I didn't appreciate being seated right next to the kitchen when there were 20 other booths open. Why do they do that? Because most people don't object ?  We only went there because my friend wanted a good steak. It was an OK dining experience."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife this evening & was very happy with the food both steaks cooked very well & very tender, sides were good & good sized beers, best meal in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"I'm not one to \"return food\", although I regret not sending my plate back this time. All I wanted was soup and a decent steak. That being said, my soup was fine. The filet, however, may have been one of the worst I've come across in a chain in a long time. The quality was mediocre...and my \"medium rare\" filet came out pretty much grey, with hints of light pink here and there. I cut through that thing, looking for any sign of deliciousness...and none was found. Throughout my \"bite searching\", I was never asked how the steak was. Which is probably another reason I didn't send it back. I figured they'd pick up on my disappointment. This is a friggen steak house after all, no?? Anyway, the bartender came and got my plate when I told her I was \"all set\". She scraped off my \"scraps\" (my 20$ steak cut up into multiple grey pieces) into the trash and didn't say one thing. Okay, so I'm thinking \"maybe chocolate could make this better...I'll order dessert and just write it off as 'not my day for steak'\". Well...here comes the bill. Guess I'm not having anything else? Such a disappointing visit all together. Basically, we're looking at 43 bucks for broccoli, bread, and two drinks. And a waste of good. Come on now, guys. Get your sh*t together...both front and back of the house."}
{"text":"I am so done with outback steakhouse. We went there last night for a birthday dinner and we had so many issues everybody was upset about the meal. Ryan our waiter did not put the orders incorrectly, they had to remake a chicken salad which took forever to get back out to the table, my girlfriend's salad was not correct, they tried to fix it and made it worse. Ryan was very un-caring and the manager did not offer to make something else when the salad was bad the second time. This is the third time I've had issues with outback and we will not be back!"}
{"text":"Sehr guter, aufmerksamer Service und natürlich sehr freundlich (in diesem Fall nicht einmal aufgesetzt). Die Steaks waren klasse (Qualiät + Garstufe). Nur der Cheesecake war sehr durchschnittlich. eDas Ambiente ist erher rustikal und teilweise ein wenig auf Sportsbar eingerichtet. Sauber und ordentlich. Die Preise sind natürlich nicht ohne, so isst man zu zweit mal locker für 125 Dollar (inkl. dem üblichen Trinkgeldsatz von mind. 15%) und wir hatten auch keine Weinflasche oder einen Cocktail auf dem Tisch. Wir kommen wieder!"}
{"text":"Go to Hard Rock instead  you'll be happier and they are around the same pricing!"}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with this place. The service was slower than normal, the food was good but not great, and some of our food came out cold. When we notified the manager, she was very nice and attentive. The meal was a bit pricey for what we got. Nice atmosphere, it did take a long time for us to be seated. You can find a nicer restaurant in Hard Rock Cafe."}
{"text":"The night before Mother's Day. I called and was told they had a Prime rib special for $19.99 which included salad, side, entrée and dessert. They took a pre-seating reservation and when we arrived we were immediately seated. The prime rib came rare instead of medium but that was quickly rectified. We had Scott as our server and he did a great job. We had a very pleasant dinner and good experience."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience with this location and with the managers and the owner of this outback. They say they care about there customers but in fact done care at all. We ate in this outback on a Saturday evening, first the bathrooms were trashed with puddles of urine on the floor and paper towels overflowing as well. Alerted the manager just to let them know. Our server was not attentive at all we could hardly find him and had to ask other servers for help. At one point the manager told us she would give us a discount on the check for the issues we were having. Well when the check came there was no discount at all. At this point we just wanted to get out of there. If you are going to offer something to customers and they don't even ask then they should follow thru. I emailed the managing partner who responded to me that she wanted to talk with me on Monday and also wanted us to come back and be her guest. She told me to call her between certain time at the restaurant. Well I was not able to call her and sent an email stating that and asked for a time u could. Well I never heard back from her. I have sent a few emails and still nothing. They claim they care about there customers but obviously they don't"}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly, food is good and predictable that you will get what you ordered. The place is really busy but they offer call ahead seating which makes the wait short.  Happy hour is fun and it is close to home.  All in all a great addition to Henderson!"}
{"text":"Prices are higher and food is worse. Blooming onion that we ordered was burned on one side and raw and bitter on another. Another one they offered in exchange was not much better.  Back ribs were good."}
{"text":"I go to Outback every week on my day off. Just want to spread the word about this great place. The service is excellent, the food is really the best value around. Where can you get a 6 ounce filet with baked potato and salad for $22.95? Their meat cuts are high quality and always cooked to your preference. Their friendly staff is great as well. I have lived in Las Vegas for 40 years and I am usually disappointed with the high price steak houses where everything is ala carte. Most are so over priced. If you are not a meat eater they offer lobster tail, shrimp and chicken as well. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this great place. It really is worth it."}
{"text":"I like to visit outback when I'm in the mood for a decent steak.  So disappointed in both the service and the food in my hometown Outback.  My server took 17 minutes to check on me after bringing me a salad that was loaded with brown pieces of lettuce. My steak was not cooked how I ordered it, and it was tepid in temperature and not searing hot as it usually is when I visit other locations. I received a new salad after being told by my server that they had to throw out all of the batch of romaine lettuce because it was all brown.  That's unacceptable. Waited another 6 minutes before my server returned and refreshed my empty drink glass (which was empty when she had brought out my steak). I asked to talk to a manager.  His response was that some locations are used to using the kiosks and some aren't.  ??? We had t used the kiosk so I was not sure what he meant. Offered a dessert but declined it since the rest of the food was lackluster.  I felt that he was not really interested in what I had to say, that my steak wasn't cooked how I asked (which I actually showed to him) or that my server was not attentive.  Avoid this location...I know I will in the future.  UPDATE I received a very prompt follow up call from Outback, and the gentleman I spoke with seemed genuinely concerned with my experience. I have increased my rating to 3 stars based on the customer service I received post-visit."}
{"text":"The service was great, the steaks were excellent - flavor, texture...top grade all around.   Recommend the grilled ribeye!"}
{"text":"The food and service both were great. My steak was dry but was replaced with  good one. Dean did  great job taking care of us."}
{"text":"Love thiestaurant.  They have as good  a steak as the high priced steakhouses and the drinks and apps are not expensive.  Always recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"Almost didn't come eat here when I read the reviews. When we walked in the place was pretty crowded . The service was good other then the waitress not knowing it was happy hour. If you eaten at any other Out backs the menu is pretty much the same. Their Tortilla Soup was better then most. AARP discounts are not available here on weekends so fit that they get two stars."}
{"text":"I went on a very busy night by myself, so sitting at the bar was an acceptable option.  Trevor helped with a beer selection, introduced me to his two teammates behind the bar.  Even though all three of them were moving non stop, they kept an eye on my needs, served my terrific salad with extra dressing in a timely manner, and I enjoyed a great meal and pleasant evening."}
{"text":"This place normally has really good food, but I was unsatisfied with my crab cakes. They were not in circle cake shapes and there was a blackened breading. Oh, did I mention the HOUR WAIT FOR THE FOOD?! I had a forty-five minute wait just to get seated. They didn't give us plates for our appetizers, so we sadly ate with COASTERS! I had 2 drink refills even before I received my food!! The steaks were not cooked to my family's liking, meaning they were undercooked and overcooked. The waitress was quite friendly though. My family was quite dissatisfied with their steaks saying they've had better.."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and only had 45 minutes.  I was able to get in and out with a healthy meal.  Service and food is always good here at the Outback"}
{"text":"Though my food came out wrong they made it right by fixing it and giving me free dessert. The manager made sure to stop by several times I check up on us."}
{"text":"The steak was excellent and the service was even better!!! Vianca at the bar was training a new bartender Andrew and both did a great job. Thanks"}
{"text":"Just not the same quality of service or food as the now-closed location on Green Valley. We have visited twice for dinner, once early in the week soon after they opened and recently on a Friday.  The first visit was barely two stars, with slow, indifferent service and incorrectly cooked steaks. Our second visit was better, but still below expectations. How is it a steak restaurant can't cook a medium steak? Still, much better than first visit and maybe worth another try."}
{"text":"I love their steaks and the curb side takeaway cant be beat.  I love to do the ordering on line, drive there, pick it up and have dinner as soon as I get home..."}
{"text":"Second time here and still just as bad as the first time. I live in Traverse City, MI and the Outback there is superb. This Outback in Mesa should send the chef, manager and wait staff there for training. I blame management when food and service is bad. Hire a new manager!"}
{"text":"My family and I visited the new OutBack at the Concord Mills location today. We had a 330pm reservation was seated at 3:50pm. It was busy but not overwhelming. Things went downhill for the time we were seated. Our waitress seemed very distracted and was not attentive. When she finally brought out our drinks 3 out of the 4 glasses very dirty, food particles and residue around the rim of the glasses. So we requested new drinks in to go cups. After waiting an additional 25 mins the waitress came back took our orders. When my sister's salad arrived there was a hair on her cucumber. She sent it back and reported it to the manager. A gentleman came to our table introduced himself as the owner and apologized for the hair being in the salad. We decide to stay. Finally our food arrives and right in top of my crispy chicken sandwich bun was a another Hair.  How disgusting to have this happen twice in the same day. We were in disbelief and sicken. Due to the limited parking my sister and I both paid 9.00 to valet park both cars just to eat here. Then to deal with poor service and then be served food with hairs in it was unbelievable. Another manager not the Owner this time came out apologized again, at this point we were over it there wasn't anything anyone could say that would excuse such and Unsanitary Experience in any Restaurant!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't review the food here, as we didn't stay to eat, but nevertheless this establishment earns a one star rating from me. Call ahead seating is a feature, so I called ahead, as I was taking my elderly mother to dinner and did not want to have her wait. I was told it was a 20 to 25 minute wait. I was added to the list and arrived there 20 minutes later. I was told upon arrival that it would be 40 minutes until we would be seated. \"How can that be when it was a 20 minute wait when I called 20 minutes ago?\" I inquired. \"well, that's what it was when you called, but now it is 40 because a lot of people came in before you. WE DON'T ADD YOU UNTIL YOU ARE GOING TO BE THERE.\" Obviously, that made no sense. We opted not to wait. Later, I politely called to talk to the manager to let her know her host didn't know how to do call ahead seating. She assured me he was right. That is how call ahead seating worked! HUH? What would be the point of calling ahead if they are not going to add you to their list until they expect you to arrive. I could put myself on the list then in person and save the phone call. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Love this location... The McKnight road staff is always friendly and prompt...  The food never disappoints, always taste great ...  And  the manager Natasha is awesome , always goes out of her way to make our dinning experience great ..."}
{"text":"We had a small issue with our meal, but Diana stepped in and immediately remedied the situation. In the end food was good, but the service from Josh and Diana was fantastic."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to an OBSH. Since my son and husband have never been, I decided this time we'd celebrate his birthday there. What a mistake that was! My one year old granddaughter was hungry and grumpy, so my D-I-L ended up leaving right after the appetizers were served to take her home. That left my husband, me, our son and other granddaughter for dinner. We had to get the attention of the waiter to finally take our order.   My son also ordered an entrée for his wife to go, but I mentioned to make that later (which most restaurants would assume anyway). My husband and I both ordered the parmesan linguine with shrimp. We both agreed that it had an odd flavor and we wouldn't order it again. My son ordered the sirloin combo with coconut shrimp. He didn't receive his dinner at the same time the rest of us were served, his was about another 10-15 minute wait. They actually served the TO GO order when our dinners were served, which was bothersome because it was a salmon dish. The manager came out and apologized and gave him a card for a free bloomin onion on his next visit. The one we ordered, sitting on the table looks nothing like any of the ones depicted on the website. This one was fried darker and extremely greasy.   In all the time he was waiting, my son's salad hadn't even been served, thus I called the waiter over to remind him of that. He apologized for it and brought it to the table. At this time, my son had put on his cell phone that it was his dad's birthday. The waiter acknowledged it - or so we thought. A couple of minutes after the salad was served, the manager came out with his meal. She had the nerve to serve burnt coconut shrimp. We were all so disappointed. And to top it off, no birthday acknowledgment for my hubby. They can keep their bloomin onion coupon. We aren't going anywhere near their bloomin place again."}
{"text":"Empty do to the fact it's on the 4th floor yet rite on the strip. The ribs are awesome and the service was great."}
{"text":"REDEMPTION...this time!!!  Right on top of it. The guy was out quickly and everything ready to go. Even the ice cream was good to go.   Soooooooooo much better than my last 2 experiences."}
{"text":"Not a five star restaurant,  more of a family steak house. Average decor great waiter though very attentive, checking in, refills, letting us know food on its way. Myself and kids tonite. We started with blooming onion which was a big hit. I ordered steak and baked potato. The steak was cooked really well. The kiddos ordered the chicken tenders. We all left full and satisfied. Great steak house on a budget."}
{"text":"It was super busy but it was the best service we've had from an Outback! Food was absolutely amazing, as well. Thanks to our server, Ben!  We will definitely be returning to this location. I would reccomend this location to everyone I know, over the others!"}
{"text":"We got the avocado and lobster dip entree. It cost $10 bucks and I kid you not we only got 15 little chips and the whole thing was so salty we couldn't even get through it all. The baby back ribs tasted OK and the fries were awesome but after about 30 minutes we both had upset stomachs. Needless to say the whole experience was a letdown (it was my first time there) and a waste of $50 dollars (which is way to expensive for a casual dinner, in my eyes). However, the servers were very nice and hospitable, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Excellent service on a slow, late Friday night.  Impressed by the servers and the host."}
{"text":"I stay away from chain restaurants as much as possible.   Today I went against my better judgment and tried this Outback.   For starters the blue cheese pecan chopped salad for $4.99 was the vacuum sealed chopped head lettuce with purple cabbage.   It had the strong taste of preservatives.   If they rinsed and drained  before serving,  this may have tasted better.  Now onto my entrée.   I ordered rack of ribs and add on of coconut shrimp.  I asked for my fries to be fresh and hot when they came out.  My wife had porter house.   The ribs were good but cold.  My fries were soggy and cold.  The waitress was fair at best.  We didn't have flatware when we received our salads, forget any refills,  and had to wave her down when I needed to send back part of  my burnt ribs.  The manager was standing around the bar surrounded by waitress.   It seemed to be social hour for the outback staff.  Not a good day for Outback.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the service I received last night at this Outback. I have many food allergies and am always hesitant to go out to eat. I explained to my server that I had food allergies and asked if they could accomodate, she understood completely saying that she herself has many food allergies too. She brought me a Gluten-Free menu and I made my adjustments from that.  After placing my order the manager came out to ask more specifically how I wanted my food cooked wether it should be cooked on its own, what spices were acceptable and she also offered different options for sauces to which I was able to choose from.  My food was perfect, I can't complain about anything, they went above and beyond my request and I am so grateful. I never felt like my many requests and substitutions were a burden. I highly recommend the Outback at Southern and McClintock if you have food allergies."}
{"text":"First of all the service was ridiculously slow!!!   It took us fifteen minutes to get bread. When our food finally came it was very mediocre. For the prices one would expect better food than a cafeteria. When I was in the bathroom there was a girl throwing up in the stall next to me!!!! When I walked outside to get fresh air from this already crappy restaurant experience a girl told me we were supposed to have gotten a free bloomin' onion for the 4th of July. When I walked back in to ask the server about it she said that they didn't offer it but that we were somehow supposed to just know to ask for it.... Seems pretty dumb to me. We ended up not getting it because we knew it would be at least another fifteen minutes before it was ready. I will never dine at an Outback ever again!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting this location is always fun. Tonight we popped in really late and sat at the bar with Amber.  The boyfriend ordered his normal. The salad was a little stale but the steak (medium) was perfect.   I know there's a lot of food choices in vegas but familiarity is always good."}
{"text":"Ordered 6oz filet with lobster tail, 'basically over sized shrimp\",  Steak was ordered medium and came out medium rare at best.  IT WAS RAW.  Sent it back and by the time it made it back I was done with everything else.  Manager said they would take it off and after suggesting several times we should take it with us \"which i said more than twice\" NO THANK YOU, I agreed.  Looked at it outside and it was beyond well done and gray looking. It was a really yucky cut of meat.  With all that why not comp my whole meal if your going to do anything. After all the whole thing was kinked from that point on and maybe I would come back and give it another shot, because the coconut shrimp was really good.  DON'T THEY WANT YOU TO COME BACK????  Isn't that the end result they are looking for???  Moral of the story, they blew it. It sucked and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Walked from the Sheraton next door for a quick bite to eat with a co-worker.  The service was fast and friendly, the food was great, the beer was cold ... everything you want in a casual dining experience.    As you'd expect, the Aged Cheddar Bacon Burger is a massive, messy, delicious sandwich.  No need for an appetizer or dessert ... just a long walk after dinner.  Even then, hard to keep my eyes open when I got back to my room.  (Like I said, everything you want!)"}
{"text":"My relatives are visiting from China and wanted to try some American food. I took them to the las vegas strip Outback. The food was pretty good and it appeared that for Las Vegas, the service was good as well. The total food bill was 82 and we tipped 12 (about 15%). Later when we checked the bill online, the tip was changed to $20. The servers name was Patrick. I have a message for you Outback: Patrick has changed my opinion of Outback, I will never again patronize your resturant in Las Vegas or any other city. If this happened to me, it most certainly has happened to others. You are doing a poor job of hiring and supervising your employees!"}
{"text":"We decided to give another try at this same place after a year or so and thought that they might change.  We checked in and waited by the door inside and sure enough they would messed up the waiting list and keep calling other customers that arrived after us.  We had to walk away again.  DO NOT go to this place.  They hired incompetent hostesses for the check-in and caused frustration.  Not sure if Outback Steakhouse corporate is even care about it or not."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this chain but I shelled out extra for \"Prime\" beef and it tasted like a fatty version of the regular steak that they serve. Good service from waitress, a la Vegas B.S.."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this was my first time at outback steakhouse. I went in at lunch time and was seated and waited on immediately. I ordered the 7.99 lunch combo of a house salad & French onion soup.To be honest I wasn't expecting to get that great of a meal because chain restaurant aren't always the best quality or best tasting food, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The salad was fresh & crisp and the Italian dressing was very tasty. The French onion soup was great too. Our waiter was friendly & helpful. I have to say I had a great experience here & will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Great place to get a good steak cooked just like you want it. The blooming onion makes an incredible starter dish if you don't completely fill up on that and the salad before you even get the main dish."}
{"text":"We love this outback, they are quick and accurate with our food. Super friendly staff, Laura was awesome on our most recent trip here. Delicious food, great staff, what more could you ask for?!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight and my expectations were met. I ordered the coconut battered shrimp and smoked Gouda Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was the best I've ever had ! The coconut shrimp was very good too.   The hostess greeted me promptly and I was seated. Within one minute my server came and took my order. I had the mixed berry lemonade to drink, it was spot on. The place was very busy and the outside of the restaurant is being remodeled.   I got eight coconut shrimp and plenty of Mac & Cheese and my drink for under $19.00, not counting tip. Overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of having a late meal here last night. The food was well prepared and the service was outstanding!  Our waitress and the manager checked in several times during the meal to make sure everything was to our liking. It was on all counts.  We were there just before closing but we felt no push to get us out of the restaurant.  This is a great place for a meal"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've ever had. Took 30 minutes for a waiter to come over and greet us. Then it was another 15 minutes to get the drinks.  The food came out quickly but the grilled shrimp came out cold and had to be remade.   The guy that seated us was incredibly unhelpful and rude and the manager that we asked to speak with took a very long time to come speak to us and provided no help whatsoever. The restaurant had maybe 5 tables in there at the most. Not once did a single person we spoke with give us an apology or say anything. We will never return."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here in the restaurant writing this because of how annoyed I am. Me and my mother came into the restaurant to celebrate her birthday. We were greeted promptly and sat down as soon as we walked in. We sat down and looked at our menus to decide what we wanted. We went unnoticed for about five minutes. Finally a waitress, Lindsay came over and asked what we wanted to drink and she turned around and left. We waited for another five minutes or so for her to drop off our drinks and run away. She finally came back and asked if we wanted an appetizer, we ordered the petals, she then said she'd put it in and scurried away again. In total it took us about 20 minutes to get any semblance of service and even then it was very sub par. It seemed that other people working there were OK, however we drew the short straw. I do not typically write reviews, but I will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"This is the best Outback in Phoenix! Their bone in ribeye is practically a gift from the gods!"}
{"text":"Filet mignon  was like a hockey puck. Horrible service. Bread came long after appetizer and salad came after meal. Noticed several people were sending steaks back. Don't know how an Outback can be this bad."}
{"text":"Wow.What a pleasant surprise!   I had never eaten at an Outback before and was a little leery... I dont care for eating at chain restaurants....but very glad we did.. (we had actually planned on eating at the bistro at Siena golf course, but it was closed for a private party.. Lucky us!)   We had the stuffed mushroom appetizer, excellent, then both of us ordered the steak and lobster. (I ate both lobster tails, he ate the steak).  We typically would go to Sedona, Tbones or  McCalls for  this type of meal, (and pay the price!)  but we took a chance and glad we did...My lobster was perfect, and his steak was outstanding.  The baked potatoes were just right (last time at McCalls they were not fully cooked). I always like just butter and sour cream on the side, and though they say \"all the fixings\" on the potatoes, they do accommodate  A little hint... If one of you wants steak, and the other lobster, do what we did and order the combo.... Saves $$...   Our Server was accommodating and efficient, not overboard. Great first experience. Will Return!"}
{"text":"An excellent dining experience. Typically we avoid chains, but with no car that evening and a hungry family we gave it a try. The food was delicious, beer was cold, and the waitress attentive (although she was trying a little too hard). Thank you."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend, Matt w. Was our server. Sat in the bar at a high top, bc we didn't want to wait the 20min. Matt, was very attentive and polite. Offered suggestions on drinks and appetizers.  Food was times perfectly.  Matt, was great with refills, and keeping the table clean. I love the food, great prices.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"We stopped at this place on our way to the theatre on a Saturday during dinner hours, the place was hopping and I thought we won't make it on time to our play. Needless to say, I was wrong, the waiter took our order and it only took a whole 7min. and that's with our drinks. BTW if you like mix drinks try the jumbo frozen Mango Margarita delicious!. In addition, I ordered the 3-course steak dinner that came along with the Cinnamon Apple Beignets dessert, and my partner ordered the Steak Paired With Chicken, Shrimp or Crab both diners were delicious for $11.99 each. Needless to say, we will be back to try other dishes on their menu, excellent choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Mediocre service. Took forever to get food out, more like 1 hour and 15 minutes. Food is ok, nothing to go back for."}
{"text":"Updated review: received horrible service after waiter incorrectly brought items out to our table three times. We explained each time the items weren't ours, he insisted before 'retaking' the order each time. Eventually, we ate whatever he brought because we were starving.   When waiter brought the check, he charged us for every item brought to our table over his three tries and argued that we should pay for all six meals brought to us. Very upset. Manager never responded to our inquiry about situation despite a promise to do so."}
{"text":"It was just like what I expected from OutBack. Food was ok and nothing special about it. The staff wasn't to friendly when we walked in and there was no silverware on our table. Bloomin Onion looks like it got smaller but it was still good! I would come back to this OutBack for the Bloomin Onion! Other then that don't expect to much from this place!"}
{"text":"Filet with wild mushroom sauce was VERY petite (3-4oz) and overcooked. Told server but no offer to correct.  Otherwise food and service pretty good. But we are leaving a tad disappointed."}
{"text":"We came for birthday dinner for my parents. From the moment we walked inn, everyone we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. Dinner was great and dessert was wonderful as well! Best Outback experience ever!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, brown lettuce in the chopped pecan salad. Appetizer came out after the entrees. The steak and fries came out cold the second round of fries came out extremely greasy and hot and the other came out cold, I gave up at that point."}
{"text":"I feel like outback is usually a safe bet because you always know what you are going to get. However, the sirloin steak I ordered was mainly one large piece of fat.  I don't know if they save the bad cuts of meat for takeout, but I was very disappointed.  I'll be trying something different tomorrow."}
{"text":"I was amaze at the service I received as a first timer. They were patient with me as I placed my order. The food was on point, it was hot and delicious I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered was delicious; sirloin with lobster, baked potato, and house salad is an awesome combination! The problems started occurring in their service. First they forgot my mom's mushrooms she ordered as a side and then messed up our payment. In exchange for a hundred, they were almost $10 short and the waitress would never come around (annoying when you want to just pay and leave). After receiving the right amount, we still had to pay a 15% tip that was required, and there were no hostess' (mind you there were 3 at the front desk) present who could give us change. In addition, the toilet was clogged in the bathroom. I don't know if it was just our waitress, but the service could have been better."}
{"text":"I dined at this location again a few days ago and was unimpressed by the quality of service -- not necessarily from our server but from the restaurant, itself.  It was a Sunday evening, the place was packed, and we had to wait 20-25 minutes for a table.  Even as there was a line out the door, the restaurant was shutting down for the night.  I couldn't order the filet wedge salad because they were out of filet, and my second drink didn't have garnish (a lime wedge and an orange wedge for this particular beverage) because the bar had thrown them all away.  And, this was all happening as business was booming and people were still waiting for tables to open up so they could be seated.  I suppose restaurants still need to close for the night, even if people are banging down the door to buy their dinner, but I think it was entirely unprofessional and discourteous of them to so blatantly close up shop with so many people still eating their meals."}
{"text":"I am always pleased with the food at Outback! It's a reasonable price for a decent meal. This was our first visit to this location. Service was good and we had an enjoyable ecperience overall."}
{"text":"Never tried this before, but I ordered a steak dinner \"to go\".  I requested the roasted sirloin \"well done\" and it turned out excellent along with the baked potato with all the toppings.  The Onion Petals were a very nice add-on.  I will do this again as the staff packaged up this meal just right so it was piping hot when I arrived home to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Went there more towards later evening. Ordered blooming onion had to send it back because it was burnt and did not taste good. They did give us a fresh one that was a little better. We ordered chicken tacos that were really good. And medium rare steak that was completely stuff and you can tell was not a good piece of meet. For the money we spent and the quality of food received. We were not too happy."}
{"text":"This was the WORST dining experience ever!!!  Not even sure where to start.  There were four in our party and we ordered two appitizers to share at $9.00 each - the servings servings were extremely small even for appitizers and shrimp barely cooked.  That seemed to be the theme for the entire meal.  All four meals took well over an hour to arrive at our table and were cold!!!!!   1)  One meal came out with very rare filet with wild mushroom sauce, undercooked lobster with a spicy seasoning - it was ordered med-well filet with a grilled (not with the Old Bay seasoning).  They ordered another lobster which never arrived.  2) One meal came out with overcooked filet and same problem with lobster - the fielt was taken back and another was brought out after a very long wait. 3)  Another lobster ordered with filet was under cooked and not as ordered.  Steak was overcooked, but not enough to be inedible. 4)  Strip steak was undercooked, but just slightly so it could be eaten - was cold.  We had ordered dessert as it was supposed to be a celebration and those came out more quickly than our meals.  Drinks ordered never arrived.    Although the manager and waitress were apologetic, neither one ever offered any compensation for such a horrible meal - the missing lobster was only taken off the bill because I requested it to be taken off - for as expensive as the bill was, I can tell you that we will never be back to eat here or any other Outback again - feel like we were robbed of our hard earned money for crappy, under and overcooked food.  They sure have gone downhill over the years."}
{"text":"Had dinner Sunday, got right in to the seating in the bar area. Server was prompt, ordered drinks & dinner. Had the victoria filet, little overdone, but good flavor, my friend had a ribeye which looked raw..Have been to better outback's, this location is closest to me. Will most likely try a new steakhouse next time."}
{"text":"i just left this outback and the service was amazing behind the bar by michael. Very friendly and was on point.. Though the service was awesome i ordered the 8 oz Alice springs chicken with chese and bacon on the fries... when it came out the chicken looked quite small like the lunch portion i usually get that was only 5oz. There was hardly any cheese on the alice spring chicken and also hardly ary cheese and bacon on my fries. and the funny thing is the cheese wasnt even melted on the fries or the chicken itself.. So though the service was excellent with refills i wasnt happy at all with the meal..."}
{"text":"This was my second visit of the Outback steakhouse. The first one was also in a very touristy place in a different state. The location is pretty busy and you might wait for the table easily. The food and drinks are OK, but nothing special. And overpriced. However, our server was very professional and helpful. Surprised us with a free starter - a tasty dark loaf of bread with butter."}
{"text":"Came to Outback to have dinner with my family tonight and it was interesting. We are huge fans of outback and we will back. I'm a corporate restaurant manager and I understand and appreciate service very much. Our server was absolutely horrible. The reason I'm writing a review is to let everybody know that the two managers that spoke to us and handled the situation were perfect. Felix and Christina really know what they're doing and we will be back because of them."}
{"text":"So it was my boyfriend's b-day yesterday and we decided to just eat at this restaurant. I let him order the steak and beer while mine was the shrimp platter. Take Note: I bought a cake back at home as a surprise when we get home. That means I don't want to buy any desserts at all after were done eating. So, while the server asked us if we wanted to get something for desserts, I flatly said NO! to save money a little bit lol! But my boyfriend said... Not unless it's free since it is his b-day. The server just said...OK! and left. Oh to our surprise, she bought us the dessert cake for free! We were so amazed and thankful for her generosity. Obviously, since she was nice I gladly tipped her the 18%. I'm not pretty sure anymore if you can get free desserts as to this day from any other restaurants but still feel grateful to even get one."}
{"text":"Good food and great staff.  Despite being one of the busiest restaurants in town, the staff provided really friendly  attentive service without being over the top.  The food was good and the margarita's were the best we had in town."}
{"text":"WHY IS THERE ALWAYS SUCH A WAIT HERE? I don't understand. Everytime we go, there is such a huge wait for just a table, and never enough room for the people waiting to sit down. Sometimes you can even see tables open even though they do call ahead instead of reservations (found that out the hard way). The food is good, nothing special. Definitely recommend the aussie fries."}
{"text":"**********Chew Your So-Called Steak Well**********              'Cause if you don't ...........You'll choke  Knives........extremely dull ......bring your own Ginsu knife My steak......like armour Flavor..........Guess its expecting too much for $12.99 ????? Sweet Potato Fries.......very good  Would I ever return..........not unless I lost my memory PLUS I don't own a Ginsu Knife"}
{"text":"long story short, the place is the worst experience i have had in years.  the blooming onion greasy the salad sparse one waiter must have taken a bath in his cologne,  and finally  the steak cooked medium rare was tough as shoe leather  i will never go back to that poor excuse of a restaurant"}
{"text":"I ate lunch there on 12/6 and was totally disappointed, especially after I had the \"runs\" all night. I should have left before ordering. The restaurant had an old dirty smell, not a clean fresh food, just made smell. I ordered the new quesadilla made with prime rib. What a mistake. It was greasy and the meat was not trimmed of fat. The order came with slices spread on a plate and a small cup of half melted sour cream. No lettuce, salsa or any type of edible garnish that would have given the dish a bit of appeal. I was hungry so I ate it anyway. What a mistake. Go eat somewhere else this place is a bad food dive."}
{"text":"Always solid experience at the outback.  Good food at a reasonable price.  Good atmosphere, my only complaint would be that it's always packed as its right by the movies."}
{"text":"Best salad ever. Best croutons on the planet. Bread is to die for. Not the best service."}
{"text":"Great bar service. They seem to have tons of fun and they made us feel like we were \"regulars\". Gold Star!  But the one compliant I do have is with the hostess/hostesses. They used to wear white shirts, but now they wear black shirts. It's confusing.   Thanks."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Outback I have ever dined at. After a long day visiting in Pittsburgh, my boyfriend and I decided to go with a chain we were already familiar with. The service was phenomenal. Our waiter was friendly and approachable and took care of us well. My Outback Special steak was just right and my boyfriend practically licked clean the barbecue sauce dish with his grilled chicken. It's too bad we don't live in the area or we would go all the time"}
{"text":"This was my last trip to outback steakhouse.  I've eaten at this location several times in the past. While I found their steaks marginal and less appealing than other steak franchises,  my friends appear to like the atmosphere of outback.  My last trip I ordered a ribeye steak, what I got was a strip steak. I called attention to my steak with the waitress and a manager came out and assured me it was a ribeye steak. ...No it wasn't!    As I was with friends, I did not argue with the manager, I smiled politely as I did not want to create a scene.    I buy ribeye steaks all the time, and choose them as my steak at restaurants. I understand the variations in ribeye steaks. What I received that night at outback was not a ribeye steak.    In the future I will pass on the opportunity to dine at this establishment."}
{"text":"We celebrated the 99th birthday of our friend at lunch on Wednesday.  We are all so impressed with help we received from the staff here.  We brought flowers, balloons, a cake and presents.  All of this was handled by the staff and they were very, very nice about it all.  Several staff members and the manager came over to wish our friend happy birthday and to make sure we had everything we needed.  We were not rushed in any way and made to feel we were as special as our 99 year old friend!  Thank you Outback Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints - love their salad with honey mustard and then their sinful sunday.  Filet is what I get here.  Always get good service and never really have to wait for a table at this location."}
{"text":"Usually their food is good, but ordered curbside and got the chicken on the barbie. My veggies were obviously old and the salad was rubbery. Just on the veggies alone...I'm done with them. That's gross"}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and i ate at the Outback in Monroeville. Sevice was okay,  but the food was terrible. I ordered the filet well done but when it came out it was raw. It appeared to be cooked for about a minute. Turned my stomach when I cut it. Sent it back and when they brought it backit was still under cook. I sent it back a second time and it was brought back to me it was still under cooked . I  was very disapointed. I was looking forward all day to eating at the Outback. The blooming onion was greasy. Will never eat there again. We paid $80 for a horrible experience."}
{"text":"We ordered curbside and they forgot our milk with our two kids meals and forgot our silverware which was a pain. The food was good portions were great. We love outback but this was a big inconvenience as were staying in a hotel. We ordered online and specifically asked for silverware so just check your bag before you leave"}
{"text":"Terrible, you expect food to be good at a steak house but don't count on this one.    Slow service, center cut sirloin was awful, did not even resemble the taste of beef.  Burger was scorched.   $40 bucks wasted!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular customer service. Drink refilled without asking. Food cooked perfectly. Manager made sure everything was good. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The Outback experience tonight wasn't a good one.  Jamie was our server and was very pleasant and kind.....when she was around.  Took 10 minutes to get bread and another 10 to get our salads.  I truly hate when I have to ask for a refill on my drink -this happened 3 times!  It appears that the customer service in this location needs to be revamped.    My special 22 ounce bone-in rib eye steak was not cooked properly and was very marbled / fatty / tough.  It this had been the first trip to Outback, it would have been out ONLY trip to Outback.  Probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I came in tonight, questionable about an outback on the strip, but I'm more than happy we all did. We were sat in under 5 minutes by a very cheery hostess, and welcomed by our server Dana. She was incredibly attentive and personable. She explained to our friend how his steak was to be cooked when he ordered it medium rare, and once he realized it was a bit undercooked for his taste, it was no problem that it was taken back to be cooked a little more. It was brought out with an extra potato, by the manager Billy who was also a delight. Our experience here was beyond 5 stars could ever rate, especially with Dana and Billy assisting us. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Friends and I went to this Outback a few days ago as I was frustrated over projects I was doing at home and decided to treat myself.  Our waiter was in training, but did quite well (although he could have gotten refills on our iced teas a little quicker and without us asking).  Food, as always, was yummy.  I did need to send my steak back to be cooked a little longer.  I had asked for medium but due to the thickness of the cut it was a bit closer to medium rare.  Manager himself brought the steak back which was a pleasant surprise.  We all had the mini shakes as a dessert!  I had another wonderful experience at this location."}
{"text":"Worst burger ever!  Burnt on the outside red in the middle. Bun was rock hard. Only about a dozen soggy fries with each burger. This was take out so I was 20 minutes away with a hungry family when we discovered this. Will never return."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here many times, for some reason... Time after time the food has been bad. The last time we went, we both ordered steaks medium. Mine came out damn near burnt. It was extremely hard to cut into. I'm not a picky person but I had to ask the waiter about it, he was so shocked about how the steak came out, he went and got the manager. My husband asked if he, the manager, would eat this steak. \"NO.\" Said the MANAGER. He went on to say how he doesn't eat his steak well done. Well neither do we! He took care of our bill, but that is the last time we have been there... and they always seem to be out of bread... not a fan anymore."}
{"text":"One of the better experiences at Outback not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but good. Service satisfactory and my partner and I were kept up to speed on the delivery of our steaks which when they did arrive were cooked as ordered, Good to see they've remodelled, but a little dark for my taste."}
{"text":"Great food! Steak was perfectly done! And Awesome Service! I will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Went to the Outback to celebrate my birthday.  Having been there numerous times before, I expected a good dinner. I ordered the Victoria fillet as did my husband. I was served something that looked like a fillet, my husband received the same similar cut.  It was rather chewy even though it was med rare and cooked perfectly. It did not seem like a fillet.  The last time I ate there, they screwed up my order and served a sirloin instead of a fillet.  I questioned it and the manager came out and did admit the mistake at that time. How could this happen a second time but it did. Again I talked to the manager about this not being what we ordered, he blamed it on the server. I wonder, are they trying to substitute a lower grade steak and hope it is not questioned. I am not the type of person that likes to cause a problem and make a scene but at my age I have learned to speak up and I refuse to be taken advantage of."}
{"text":"Went to dine late with my fiance and friend. We were sat right away. The main course was delicious and cooked to par, but the the walnut salad seemed old. They should change out the iceberg for a spring mix or even romaine, I won't have mind the extra charge as much. My fiance ordered a beverage but didn't get it till the food came out. I think the server forgot. I had to wave down a different server for refills. Last but not least my bloody Mary came with two olives not three like mention on the drink menu. That was not a problem just asked for more olives and got them. Overall the experience was 2 1/2 stars. Attention to detail in very important to me. I hope next time is better."}
{"text":"So we entered the restaurant around 9 pm (an hour before close) and to my surprise the host talked to me about his favorites and was very attentive.  After he talked to us at the entrance he got us seated EXACTLY where we wanted to sit and ensured us our server would be right with us.  Our server, Cameron, greeted us very quickly and was a just as kind as the host (I wish I got his name but he had dark brown spiked hair and brown eyes; sorry!!!) We ordered 2 recommendations, the steakhouse quesadilla and the bone in ribeye. I'm surprised this host isn't a server as he adjusted his recommendation to what we desired. Our food was made to order and came in a timely fashion, refills were quick which is very important to us. I'd highly recommend this location to others!"}
{"text":"No Outback can really deserve a 4-star rating, can it?  After all, it's a chain restaurant pushing out large volumes of food.  Can't be THAT good.  Well, this one can.  Service was exceptional with everyone friendly and smiling.  Wasn't real busy on a Sunday night, which was a nice surprise, and our server was the cutest and most attentive little thing.  I almost gave it a 5-star if you can believe that!  Started with a great Margarita for me, and my girl got some sweet peach slushie-booze thing.  Must have been to her liking, 'cause she ended up getting two of them.  Then came the salad - a blue-cheese wedge.  No exaggeration, this was quite possibly the absolute best salad I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  Ice cold, huge, crisp iceberg lettuce wedge drizzled with balsamic & blue cheese crumbles, topped with blue cheese dressing, bacon bits and onion slices that were easy to pick off (I hate onion) and surrounded by little cherry tomatoes that were cut in half - a nice touch.  I lack the vocabulary to properly explain how delectable this salad was, so I won't even try.  I got prime rib, which I ordered rare and served \"Outback style\" which was explained on the menu as seared on the grill with their signature spices before serving.  I like mine on the rare side of medium rare, so I figured the spice-sear would overcook the meat if I ordered it MR.  I was right - it would have.  In fact, even the rare piece I got ended up on the well side of medium-rare when done.  A little too peppery too, so I doubt I'll exercise the \"Outback style\" option on my next prime rib order there.  That's one reason for not getting 5 stars, which might be a little unfair since it's pretty objective based on one's taste, but oh well.  Still a good meal.  Sides were yummy (my garlic mashed and her sweet potato) and portions as expected.  She got a great sirloin dinner special, but the spices on the meat were a little too much for her over-delicate taste buds.  She finds even Taco Bell Mild Sauce to be hot though.  And luckily she was splurging and added a lobster tail to her meal so she didn't go hungry.  A bit expensive at $13.00 for a tiny little lobster tail, but I don't eat lobster and am inherently cheap, so maybe that's just me.  Still, another reason for 4 and not 5.   All in all, I expected a 2 or 3-star meal when choosing to go to this Outback, and was pleasantly surprised to find it was a great meal.  Great drinks, phenomenal salad, yummy sides and main courses that were prepared as we ordered them, we'll just have to order better next time and maybe we can push it to a 5-star rating that this location might actually deserve."}
{"text":"For me effort in life is everything. And that's what we experienced our first visit to this location. It seems effort is made by all the staff we encountered to make our dining experience pleasant. While the pasta dish I ordered was not the best I've had, it was good and our server Sierra made the food and our experience even more palatable. We will return."}
{"text":"The service there is really not that good, as far as getting you seated goes.  I arrived there at about 5:00 P.M. and they didn't have a table there and made me wait 20 minutes.  So if you are planning to go, expect to wait at least 10 minutes, usually.   But the food is always good, their bread is one of my favorites.  They have some great appetizers, like the Bloomin' Onions.  My server was very polite and was very good on the refills."}
{"text":"?????????????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????????????????"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.no silverware, no napkins and no straws....food took forever and the appetizer never showed up."}
{"text":"Worst service ever the old lady that runs the hostess desk knows exactly what I'm talking about but this review won't matter because people will still stand in line for 40 minutes for a piece of cheap crappy steak and a greasy blooming onion and you know this."}
{"text":"Haven't been inside so I can't really give 5 stars. Ordered curbside and everything was as it should be, and on time."}
{"text":"I love the Outback Steakhouse - just not this Outback Steakhouse.  Outback has always been a go-to restaurant for my family both when I am home or on the road. Good food.   Fair prices.  This particular Outback, however, consistently fails to meet a minimum level of quality.  On my last visit (the very last!) my food took 45 minutes.  It was beyond cool - approaching cold.  We had ordered (2) steaks and (2) burgers.  Appetizer never came.  Drinks never refilled.  We were returning from Las Vegas so we ate it anyway.  The only three times I saw a server was when we ordered, 45 minutes later with the food, and when he brought the check - well after we were done.  I spoke to a disinterested manager who said \"Sorry for your experience.\"  Even though I live in Waddell I will now drive to the Arrowhead Outback to eat.  15 additional minutes on the road is worth it for a much better experience!"}
{"text":"Call ahead on Friday and Saturday to check the wait. Searing around the bar is first come first serve so go there first and have a look. Ask for the Blo Me Blue(Great Drink) Aussie down under punch is great too"}
{"text":"Great staff and Erica the manager is awesome. Recently held my mom's 75th birthday lunch there and Erica made everything go smoothly. We had about 30 guests and she had extra servers for us, all food and drinks where brought out fast and fresh. Refills were constantly made and all 3 servers were super attentive and nice! It was an excellent experience, we will always come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed today. Our servers were very nice and did the best they could. Something is wrong with the kitchen process. It took 2 hours to get basic dinners and the place was not busy at all.  My sister's vegetables were cold. Our meats were warm but not hot."}
{"text":"Take out order...  1. steak well done instead of medium well 2. Lettuce seemed to chunks of a wedge (even for the Cobb salad) 3. Chicken for Cobb extremely salty"}
{"text":"Very bad service, when our food was brought out I asked our waiter for some condiments, he never came back. After waiting over five minutes (letting my steak get cold) I had to walk to the kitchen myself and ask someone for condiments. So we left the waiter a small 10% tip. A week later we found that the charge posted to our bank was $10 higher than what our receipt showed. After calling and speaking to the manager, we found out that the waiter changed the tip we left and charged us an extra $10 for his tip. This is unacceptable and fraud. We should of have called the cops instead of the manager. How many people has he done this to??? Be warned if you go to this Outback."}
{"text":"We got sat down and our server was nowhere to be seen. After waiting a while, the hostess finally went to the back to fetch them. I would have totally forgiven them for that if the service wasn't so slowww... Our drinks were constantly empty and our server... Again... Was nowhere to be seen.  I mean shit man, I'm not even asking for fancy 5 star restaurant supreme service. Normal would have been nice. At least the food was good as usual."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Outback Steakhouse in a few years. Tonight was the worst dining experience we've had in a while.  The steaks (both 6 oz filets) were ordered medium rare and delivered well done (no pink).  The tortilla soup was delivered with no cheese and NO tortillas. They did bring a replacement soup and did provide a $10 credit on a return visit (which someone can have because we won't be back). Final note, the service was very slow."}
{"text":"This is typical of what you would expect from an Outback Steakhouse.  The food is on par with the price which I would consider above average.  The atmosphere is nice and the service was good."}
{"text":"went to Vegas on a budget......and had a $50 gift certificate so Outback was a must stop.....Service was great, the manager was very interactive and friendly......Joseph the waiter was very personable and the food was great!!!"}
{"text":"I have just one word for this place,, don't come here I ordered a steak and it was so small that I had to order a cheese burger after..."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here last night for dinner. We decided to come here and after our experience, I wished we didn't! Our waitress was super nice and did a FANTASTIC job but we cannot say the same thing about the food. My bf ordered chicken & ribs--the chicken was NOT cooked through. How can a chef mess up cooking a chicken breast?? The center was so pink! Apparently it happened twice that day. They happily fixed it for us and apologized...but I was expecting more. The manager could have came out and explained why this happened (new chef possibly, etc), they could have taken something off of our bill, given us free dessert, given us an extra side ...something! This place was not worth the money we spent here! I am very disappointed. I have been to outback plenty of times but I will not be coming back anymore."}
{"text":"2nd time at this location... won't be going back.  It's a chain so I didn't come expecting much, but service was just bad.  The food was as expected not the greatest but fine.  The problem is service.  First off the waitress, Melinda, comes to the table complaining but at least tries attempts at humor to offset it.  Not the best start but I can accept it.  Then she messes up my wife's order, but she owns up to it and brings out the fries that my wife ordered, again not ideal but fine.  She offers another loaf of bread, I say sure but it never came.  I ask for some extra sour cream for my baked potato before I even start my steak and she asks me if I still want it as she's asking me if I'm ready for the steak because we're clearly done.  Not once were our drinks refilled but it would be hard to do since you know she check on us once (when she offered the bread and I asked for the sour cream) before offering the check.  The kicker is she charged us for the fries that she screwed up the order on.  I never complain or make a fuss at restaurants like the last time we were at this location.  But that's 2 in a row with 2 different servers.  Never had any issues at the eastside location."}
{"text":"Was there tonight. Second time in a few months. absolutely awful prime rib. Very tough and no flavor. Ordered medium rare which it appeared to be. Side salad and baked potato were good. Very slow service. Previous time here was also bad. Had rib eye steak then. Will not ever be returning here. Seems like outback has really downgraded the quality of their steaks. Used to be much better."}
{"text":"My family has been to this restaurant several times, good food and great service.  Unfortunately today was not a good day the food was way over seasoned to the point of spicy. The service was ok but not great.  Over all very disappointing.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal and fantastic service at this restaurant.  The lamb chops were cooked perfectly, and they had complimentary bread which was delicious.  There was ample food for the price and the restaurant was in a convenient location. The blackberry sangria was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Lunch today a disappointment.  Five meals ordered and three were served with wrong food.  Had to request a clean knife, the one wrapped in napkin had dried food on it.  This was a disappointment compared to other Outback restaurants, would not return to this one."}
{"text":"The Curbside Take-Away service was AWESOME! Ordering online was a piece of cake and as soon as I pulled into the special parking spot, the waitress came out to greet me right in my car. The meal was right on time and hot.  I will say that I felt the lobster tail was a bit small but the wood grilled steak was absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"We've only been here a couple of times...both times the service was mediocre.  I don't think the food is worth the price given the level of service.  It's very loud and hard to talk also."}
{"text":"I treated my wife to a steak dinner Friday night and the service was AWESOME!  If you stop by, ask for the tall, stocky guy with light brown hair (forgot his name), but he was EXTREMELY attentive and friendly!  The steaks were WAY overcooked and usually are at any restaurant that has a busy crowd, especially on weekends. For some reason when they 'rush' the food out they almost burn it.  I'd rather wait a little longer for a great steak, but it seems they'd rather get as many people in and out as fast as possible. Not really a great trait in the food industry.. so I went against my better judgment and ordered it medium well due to the waiter saying that they get a steak \"pretty right on\".  It wasn't, it was VERY Well Done!  He even commented about how it looked and apologized, which is wonderful, there were no excuses and he accepted fault.  Very Rare! Just like our steaks would have been if we'd ordered them Medium! lol  I would give 2 stars if the service hadn't been so Amazing! I'd give 1 if it wasn't.."}
{"text":"Worst experience. Service was beyond slow as well as being sloppy. Waiter put glasses down 1/2 on top of napkins. Glass of water was set down 1/2 on and half off coaster causing it to spill. Food took forever and when it arrived it was over cooked and cold. Parts of order were forgotten. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"For those of you who haven't visited Outback  on Craig Rd. lately, you need to. The place has been remodeled and is gorgeous inside. Not only that, but the customer service is SUPERB. They have ice cold water to drink while you wait to be seated, and they know who ordered what when they bring the food to your table. They didn't have to ask me what I ordered - wow. Every time I've gone, there has been a manager on duty that has come by our table and asked us how everything was. I haven't found a restaurant in North Las Vegas whose customer service even comes close to this place. OH - and the food has always been delicious and just the way we ordered it! Absolutely NO complaints here!"}
{"text":"We were in last weekend, and it was not great. The food itself was pretty good, however there were some other issues. It took forever to get our order, and when we did it was incomplete. They had forgotten my daughter's meal. This is the second time in a row at this location we've experienced very slow service and a forgotten meal. Also, there were cockroaches crawling around, and when I let the manager know he didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"35 minute wait with lots of open tables. Seriously, there were 5 open tables in the same area they seated us. Good burger. Wifes steak was a pretty bad cut of meat. She loves their sweet potatoes though."}
{"text":"Quick service, god value for money, tender steaks and Nice starters (incl. In steak price) Will recomand the out back steak with lobster/mushroom sauce (+5$)"}
{"text":"This location is convenient for meeting my husband for dinner after work. The food is consistently good. Service is okay. Love the ribeye and baked potato."}
{"text":"The wait on weekends can be pretty bad, and if you try to call ahead, you may wait on hold for 10-15 minutes. Hopefully they're working on that. I've had many good meals here, usually ribeye, a baked potato and broccoli with a side salad. The food is consistent. I have a gluten allergy, and they have a good gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Can someone please explain to me how this chain of \"restaurants\" is still in business?  I just don't get it.  Outback, for some reason I cannot fathom, is a favorite among many of my family members.  It is often chosen as the place to celebrate a birthday or some other special occasion, and each time it is, I dread the prospect of paying ridiculous prices for subpar food.  On this particular visit, there were multiple groups of people waiting for a table.  I pondered to myself, \"Why is this place so busy?\" After about 30 minutes, we were seated in a booth at the back of the place.  The waiter introduced himself, took our drink order, and scurried along.  A Bloomin' Onion was also ordered and we carried on our chatter as we anticipate the arrival of our deep fried tear-jerker.  Some time later, he came back to take our order, and the onion came shortly after.  Why this particular appetizer is so popular is beyond me.  It's looks greasy, it tastes greasy.  The plate it was served on looked greasy too, but that's just the damn thing sweating from its hot oil bath.  My daughter in law asked if we could get some of that infamous warm bread, to which the waiter replied, \"The bread is served with the salads.\"  Really?  Is the kitchen going to spontaneously combust if the bread is served out of order?  Soon our salads arrived.  They're fresh, they're tasty.  Three of us ordered the same salad; a wedge.  Two were very nicely portioned.  The third was about half the size of the other two.  Mind boggling.  Salads are done, bread is gone.  Tick tock - tick tock - tick tock.  Here comes the \"food.\"  I ordered the Alice Springs chicken.  For those who don't know, it's a chicken breast with bacon, mushrooms, cheese and some mustard sauce.  The waiter drops this plate in front of me and it's hardly recognizable as a cut of chicken.  It's drenched in grease, and the fries served with it are cold.  I cut into it, take a bite, and I am unsurprised by the lackluster flavor.  It tastes just as greasy as it looks, but I'm hungry and I absolutely refuse to send anything back to the kitchen - we've all seen \"Waiting.\"  Dinner is complete, everyone at the table seems just as disappointed in their meal as I do.  I decide to share a desert with my grandson and order the chocolate thunder from under, or whatever it's called.  It takes 15 minutes to get it, and when we dug into it, we wished they'd kept it.  The brownie is dry and flavorless.  The ice cream has giant chunks of ice in it, like it had thawed and been refrozen.  My grandson knows no \"bad\" desert and delights in it.  I'm a chocolate freak - I DO know better, and I know that this dessert should never have been served like that.  There's only one person to blame for this mess, and that's the manager.  From forgotten requests to poorly prepared food, there just aren't enough chefs in this kitchen."}
{"text":"Love outback steakhouse in matthews nc! Always great service and great food. I eat here at least 3 times a month! The only downside is its so busy and the wait is often very long for dinner . Went here for mothers day lunch  and got right in. Peach belini was amazing and so was the steak!"}
{"text":"I'm truly surprised I'm the first to review this location. I went last night with the folks for my little brother's b-day dinner.  The hostess sat us right away. The waiter Marcus was probably one of the best servers I've seen in a long time. He made sure to go through all of the drink specials for us. My mom asked for a particular beer and when he said they didn't have that one, he then offered to bring her a sample of something very close to it. After we got our drink orders we went ahead and ordered our apps, and entrees.   Food:  The ahi tuna app comes with two dipping sauces and is delicious! We also got the Blooming Onion, which I'm sure everyone has had before, so no need to elaborate.   Now here comes the interesting part of our dinner.... Once we got our entrees for some reason the kitchen plated all our food wrong, so we had to do a musical steak dance and pick up our steaks and place them with the correct sides that they corresponded with. This actually isn't the first time this sort of thing has happened to me. The last time my husband and I visited this Outback location we had the same debacle occur.    To give credit where credit is due: Marcus was an awesome server and he probably would have corrected our plates if he had been the one to bring our order out to our table. The kitchen had someone else bring the order out instead, so Marcus our server didn't get a chance to fix the kitchen mistake.  Also, the sides were not the proper portion.  Before we could even complain, Marcus went ahead and brought us out additional sides.   Marcus - You get 5 stars for amazing service.  Kitchen - You get 2 stars - You need to work on your plating.  = 3 star review"}
{"text":"I came here last night with a friend for dinner and received average service.. Our waitress was very nice and prompt. +1  The margaritas were way way too sour and basically tasted like slurpees.  I ordered the Bleu Cheese Chopped Salad (in which the cheese is made from vegetable enzymes and is imported from Denmark, containing no dairy which was nice +2) and it was very filling. The side of potatoes were very good as well.  I will most likely be returning."}
{"text":"Tony was awesome!!! Had a great dinner with superb service!! If you are looking for great price to value definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Call ahead seating worked really well with no waiting on arrival. Husband had prime rib and lobster which was very good. The baby back ribs came out as two separate half racks which seemed to have been reheated. They were dry and certainly not fall off the bone as in the past. This is the second time this has happened recently on a \" no worries Wednesday.\" Will not order again. Mini chocolate parfait was good. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service!!  Haven't had this type of experience in a long time. It was worth the extra cash!!$$"}
{"text":"Just ordered take out .  Ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The fries were like 4oz and the burger was way under cooked . It was redder then the tomatoes . Will not order from there again."}
{"text":"This location does a great job. I usually enjoy the Filet with broccoli as I did tonight and I tend to ask a lot about how it is prepared. I ask for it butterflied and medium with extra seasonig, and it came out just right,  like my last few visits. My server,  I think her name is Jamie did a great job. The manager Keri also speed by my table to ask if everything was good! The bar service was pretty good to. I recommend my friends and family go. At least to this location."}
{"text":"This place folded like a cheap lawn chair as soon as TR  opened.  My most recent visit will probably be my last. Bloomin Monday got me through the door. Our server was prompt to greet us and get our drinks out. The bloomin onion was good. I feel like I waited too long for entrees to get to the table and my steak was well done when I had ordered medium rare, but that's ok it was still good. My drink sat empty for long periods of time, and I never expected to get a third refill.  I noticed a lot of the wait staff either standing around the bar and talking to each other or hiding in the back."}
{"text":"We ate here Fathers Day and it was crowded as expected. If you're looking for a good Cobb Salad, go somewhere else.  It looks like any other dinner salad with a few pieces of chicken on top. Scant amounts of bacon and hard boiled egg and all mixed together, not in rows.....probably so you won't notice the lack of key ingredients that give the salad it's name. To add insult to injury, I got the worst stomach ache I ever had that evening into the next day. My dog got two pieces of chicken from it and she Had diarrhea the next day also. Not something you want after an expensive meal for a  Special occasion."}
{"text":"Notes: 1 visit, dinner Overall: Salty. (Probably even more salty than Olive Garden, which is quite a feat.)  Free bread - Best part of the meal!  Soooo good.  It's some sort of dark brown bread that's super soft and has a light honey flavor to it.  I should have just eaten three baskets of that and saved us some cash.  Baby back ribs - Came with virtually no sauce.  Dry and salty were the only two words that could possibly describe this horrible dish.  The fries that came with it were soft and mushy.  Ewww.  Ceasar salad - Salty. The croutons and the chicken were good, but a salty salad is still a salty salad.  Another reminder to always order dressing on the side at restaurants.  Coconut shrimp - Don't know if all coconut shrimp is like this, but I didn't like the coconut shreds.  They were too tough and didn't add any flavor.  Shrimp on the Barbie - Only decent dish that night, and I only say that because it wasn't too salty."}
{"text":"We had absolutely the BEST experience at this location on 1/15/15.  Four of us went in for dinner and were seated right away at a perfect booth.  Our server, Hannah, introduced herself quickly and took our drink order.  A couple of the orders were not quite correct and we mentioned it to Hannah who quickly sent the manager over.  He remade the hamburger even though it was not necessary.  Both the manager and the server went way above and beyond.  It was so nice to experience such excellent service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went with my 7 year-old. It was Saturday night about 7:00, ie busiest time possible to visit, without reservation, such a place.  We were both pleasantly surprised. We waited about 15 minutes, and the staff was very nice and friendly about it. The place was not al all understaffed -- just packed to capacity. I thought the staff did a great job considering how ragged they were being run.  Blooming Onion looks like a lot of fun and was fine, but nothing special. A fried onion. Not much spice or seasoning. Nice sauce.  Caesar salad, good. Smoked apple and bacon quesadillas, good. Loaded baked potato, smallish on the size but it was meant to be a side so that's fine, and it was delicious. Finally, I had a little steak which was good, coconut shrimp which were great, and green beans which were quite good.  We waited for an entree for a bit, although not enough to make me irritated by any means, and the manager came over and offered us their special desert, gratis. Even suggested we could take it home if we wanted: which we did. And not all slid into a box either; every component of the desert in its own little container, in one big box. It was a great touch.  Not inexpensive but not expensive either. Both my 7YO and I had a great time.  Kid friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so corp and really lost its charm.  First when I arrived and being seated i was asked \" what brings you here today?\" I thought that was an odd question since it was a sat night at 6 . \"To eat\" was my response - \"oh , we are made to ask that question\", the girl stated. I wish corp would allow hosts to just be them self and not shove \"lines\" of what they should say down their throats. Then our waitress came and  had her \"suggestions of drinks\" and then came back with \" selections of appetizers\". This takes so long to listen to - please stop this! Im not your robot for \"subliminal suggestions.\" They pushed this so much it was aggravating!  Your waitress didn't like doing it either.   As for the meal - wow has your prices increased!!! Steak which was my husbands - was subpar ( used to be great) was over 30.00 and tough. Your choices of sides are sectioned out and had choices of premium which cost more. ( ding, upcharge!)  Nickel and dime ing is exhausting!!!  I ordered the steak salad - so much smaller than it used to be! Looked like lunch portion with hardly any tomatoes, less crunchy pecans ( where were they?) and the steak was very tough.  This restaurant used to be great and now its way overpriced for what you get.  Corp rules have ruined this restaurant!!! Service was good - but who noticed that with bad over expensive food."}
{"text":"I had an outback gift card from a friend that my wife and I decided to use. I haven't been to outback in years and can't say there is any reason to come back in years. It was by no means awful but it wasn't great. I would say it was just average... blah. We did get to see a former NFL star there so that was kind of cool. I'm just baffled that there were so many people willing to pay for overpriced average food. If I get another gift card I'll use it but not sure I have any desire to pay out of my pocket."}
{"text":"A bad choice for a quick, weekday lunch. The service was slow, the salads overdressed, and the soup cold. We waited almost thirty minutes for the return of our credit cards after paying the bill."}
{"text":"I love this place get the porterhouse over fire and heavy spice very good. the service is always great!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. I usually love Outback, but this location is horrible. I ordered the steak and lobster. Lobster was way over cooked and my steak tasted like a cheap Walmart steak. It was hard to swallow, that's how bad it tasted. Then our waitress broke my debit card while away and didn't even mention it. I found out when she returned my card and walked away."}
{"text":"2nd time we have tried this Outback.  First time was a pretty frustrating experience, but it was a busy Friday night, so we thought we would give them a try for Sunday lunch when they weren't as busy.  After 2 lousy experiences we won't be back. Service is just very slow and at no point of the meal did we feel like the server cared. Tried the steak nachos. Not bad but so small they weren't worht the money.  Soup and salad all you can eat is not badly priced, but the salad dressings are awful and the sald itself had nothing to remember by.  Potato soup not bad, but not great.  You need to be very patient to get full at this location as they brought the salad and then it was close to 15 minutes before they brought the first bowl of soup.  Maybe we will try the westside location, but probably not. Too many other places to eat that give much better service and value for the dollar."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed this restaurant. As a result we decided to go here tonight for dinner and had a terrible experience. It took the waitress 20 minutes before she approached our table. Surprisingly the restaurant was half empty so there should be no excuse for the long delay to get service. She took our order for a blooming onion and we waited another 20 minutes before receiving this grease drenched blob. We had ordered water without lemon and now our water gets here with lemon. Okay easy fix but it gets worse... Well our server finally takes our order of which we wait another 40 minutes before we are served.  Total time from being seated to getting the main course was over an hour and 30 minutes... We should have left but it was late and we were all tired and hungry. Finally we see our waitresses with our food. You guessed it. The complete order was wrong. How do you bring chicken out when we ordered steak? And then say, \"sorry it's chicken, it that okay? The chicken is just as good as the steak\". We also ordered a salad that was ordered without dressing and it came to the table soaked in dressing. We also ordered an 8oz steak that was 5 oz at best... What a shame.  The quality of the food has really gone down hill along with the service. We will never return to this Outback.  Disgusting and utterly disappointing..."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Outback that we have been to.  My husband and I are not typically fans of Outback Steakhouses and find that the wait is not usually worth the food, but this location proved us wrong!  We have been here three times so far and the only downfall we have seen was the fact that others know how wonderful it is too!  There are always lines of people waiting inside and out of this location and so we would recommend calling ahead and making a reservation if you are going in as a group...or at least plan on waiting.  Each time we feel as if we should go somewhere else, but the times that we did decide to stay we did not regret.  It really is worth the wait.  Our servers have always been very friendly, our orders have always came out quickly and prepared as ordered, and everything that we have ordered so far has been mouthwatering delicious.  We WILL be going back :)"}
{"text":"Crisp evening air ruffled my jacket as I approached the fine Outback Steakhouse. Having been held hostage by family over the month long college break, any fresh air outside of the family compound is greatly appreciated.   Upon walking in it becomes incredibly obvious that there is a lot of activity going on this New Years Day, and in spite of that am seated fairly quickly with my family of five. The waiter, a fine gentleman with excellent bedside manners, quickly gets our drinks ready and an appetizer ordered.   For an appetizer, my father insists on these bizarre fried onion fingers with a sauce dip. Blind sighted by the sheer rawness of some of those onions, I shed a single tear similar to Denzel Washington's performance in the film Glory.   After accepting defeat to the raw power of the onions, my food gets in after a moderate waiting period of 15 minutes. I had ordered a medium done Double Burger. Due to my forced celibacy that is winter break, I was really looking forward to biting into a nice delicious burger as I quietly get off to the juicy tomato squirting in my mouth, but upon cracking open the buns I saw I had a single paper thin tomato slice. Obviously turned off, I figure what the hell, I'll get off later. But as I keep munching on the burger I notice the patties were not really consistently cooked... One was well done and the other was sort of medium, sort of raw in some parts.   At this point, I give up, eat the fries and call it a day. I clearly ordered the wrong things and should have just eaten a steak at a steakhouse. At least the fries were really good.   I also noticed the place is an awkward hot spot for seniors. May just be the holiday but I wouldn't recommend going out for a drink here from what I saw."}
{"text":"So if you're looking to get a huge punch of that smokiness, try some of the other steaks. In the end I wasn't completely dazzled and love-struck by this offering, but I'll give this place 3 stars for the groans of satisfaction that came from my friend as he polished his steak off."}
{"text":"We had not been to outback in a long time, but tonight we had gone to Texas Road House and they were not very accommodating for our group of 11. So we called outback I spoke to the manager Zeek he immediately worked out a table for 11 and told us to go ahead and come to the restaurant that the table was ready.  I thought this was amazing because we thought we would have to sit for 45min. He has awesome customer service and met all of our needs. Also our waitress Sarah was great.  If you have not been here in a while just try it."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite steak house in Charlotte. Servers immediately helped accommodate my family by allowing us to sit at the booth near the window. Our server was from Greenville and he was a total genuine host to us. Just loved his job and loved helping us. Kind, generous, (gave us extra bread). Thennnnn, our food was delayed (30 minutes). Didn't feel long because server checked up on us, but then the manager came and told us they had cooked the steak too much so they put a new one on and offered to reduce our bill. What excellent excellent service from the server to the manager. Impressed mostly from the service and equally with a delicious, medium sirloin, mashed potatoes and crisp broccoli, but most importantly an unforgettable experience. Seriously, won't forget this one. Thanks, Outback"}
{"text":"They are now open for lunch! Yay  When we got there, service was quick (I told them we were in a hurry when we got there and they were very nice about it).  My salad was fresh with yummy blue cheese dressing and my steak was very good.  I ordered broccoli as my side and was actually able to eat it, so many restaurants serve you tasteless under or over cooked broccoli, so that's a plus!  Definitely will be back, hope the service remains consistent"}
{"text":"When Outback has their unlimited shrimp special, HOLY MOLY. I think my group polished off about 12 plates of shrimp while we were there.  If you put your name on the list for a shorter wait, that helps a lot. Just give them a call. The worst case scenario is that you will have to wait for your table surrounded by tourists who googled \"steak in Las Vegas\", realized that almost all the steak houses charge 10x for everything, and decided to lower their expectations for fanciness and take their craving on DOWN TO THE OUTBACK! I feel bad because you know they probably hailed a cab from their hotel thinking at this Outback was on the strip only to realize it is very much not. Oh well. Everyone needs to eat, including cab drivers.  To be honest, I would eat their unlimited shrimp off my lap while sitting outside of a Burger King if I had to. It's such a great deal.  Our waiter was great as well. Great view of the mountains out the front."}
{"text":"I had a gift card from my birthday for Outback, Roy's and Carrabas and my wife had fond memories of the Salmon dinner she had at Outback in Tucson a few years ago.  The greetings upon arrival and seating process was very nice.  We ordered the salmon which came with mixed vegetables, and baby back ribs which came with french fries.  The vegetables consisted of broccoli, squash, cauliflower and carrots.  We told the waitress that we didn't like carrots and she said she would ask them if they could be removed, and they were.  Unfortunately the veggies were overcooked, almost tasteless and without seasoning, as well as a skimpy portion.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and reasonably portioned, and had a nice flavor.  The ribs were tender and fairly flavorful, with scant BBQ sauce and I had to request some sauce on the side.  The fries were excellent, seasoned well, crisp outside, tender inside, the best thing served to us that meal!  A small warm mini loaf of dark bread was OK, but wasn't good enough to tempt us to ask for more.  We skipped the dessert.  All in all an average meal and at almost $30 was acceptable but certainly not memorable."}
{"text":"I previously posted a review of this restaurant and the service that I received. I have dined numerous times there and have never had any issues. We dined there recently and the experience was awesome. Our waitress was attentive asking us numerous times if we were fine and if we needed anything else. This is what we are used to at this restaurant and I am happy to post our positive experience. Great food, great service. Thank you."}
{"text":"This was the 4th time arriving on a Sunday between 4 and 5 to a half empty restaurant and yet told there was 30 to 45 min wait.   During to the awkward time.   Really 430 on a Sunday no servers 4 times in a row.   Terrible service.   Other locations much better"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chains, but when I craved a steak this place really delivered. I got a small filet mignon, which was cooked perfectly. OMG, it was gorgeous. With it I got an iceberg wedge salad with bleu cheese dressing -- I wasn't fond of the balsamic glaze they finished it with, but I still ate it all.  They were out of mashed potatoes, so I got a baked potato. Which was completely forgettable. The wait staff were courteous, friendly, and quick. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Once you've reviewed an outback, you've reviewed them all, so I'll keep this review short. The staff here is great, we always get our food quickly, and they're all nice and friendly.The food is incredible, it always is at Outback. You really should try it out if you haven't already done so."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Each time I have walked away a little surprised by how good the food and service was. If you want a great tasting tender sirloin then outback is the place. I would suggest getting the seasoned and seared over the wood fire grilled. A lot more flavor with the seasoning and searing. I also had one of the best lobster tails I've ever had here. It was very meaty and full. It was perfectly cooked. I had it steamed and the butter and lemon made it taste perfect. One of my favorite deserts is the sea salt caramel cookie with ice cream. If you have enough room then you need to try it. The service has always been prompt and friendly even when they have been busy. I would recommend this Outback to anyone."}
{"text":"Took the Wife here tonight, and ordered the Salmon and Potatoes, and the Chicken and Ribs. Ordered some coconut shrimp as an appetizer. The appetizer arrived quickly, and the shrimp were hot and crispy! The Salmon, Chicken, and Ribs were fantastic! The fries that came with the Chicken and Ribs were \"So So\", as they were not very crispy. However, This isn't what you come here for. Our server, Lucas T, was very friendly, and attentive. He was well spoken when asked questions, and knew the menu very well. The manager (I cant remember Her name), was also very friendly, and asked how our meals were after we had finished. The prompt, friendly service (From the hostess', server, manager, and the gentleman that took our names when we walked in) is what many restaurants we visit are lacking. To add, the food at this location was better than we remember from the last time we ate at a different location. Cant wait to visit after the remodel!"}
{"text":"I just ate at the Outback on Sahara and Durango. The South was delicious their house salad and I really enjoy their steak I asked medium rare and it came medium rare. The service was excellent the staff is very friendly. I'll definitely come back to it I never really had a good experience at any of the other other Outbacks."}
{"text":"Just served sirloin surf and turf when we ordered filet.  Mgt wouldn't acknowledge what it was \"that one looks more like a filet\". Out of baked potato and apparently now out of filets..neither facts were we told when ordering."}
{"text":"Cold food, slow service  this chain has went down the drain!! Avoid if your in a hurry and want good food a a fair price.Alsp all veg/ salad product old and brown . Bad quality control"}
{"text":"Not a huge chain lover but occasionally go to outback.  Unfortunately, this review isn't that great but what you might expect from take out.  I know that food gets cold and I'm fine with that but the food should be the same quality and quantity as if you ate there.  Also, if you ask for certain items they should be included.  Especially when the order is done online and everything is detailed and typed up nice and neat.  Not a phone order where they actually have to listen.  Seriously, you don't even care enough to take 10 seconds to read the order details.  Ordered 16 oz prime rib outback style, side salad, baked potato, and the brownie dessert.  Luckily the prime rib was pretty decent but super lucky we ordered the 16 oz version because it was mostly fat.  Again, I know prime rib can be fatty but this was a bit much.  I can live with that though.  I told them no butter or sour cream just extra chives, bacon, and au jus.  Didn't get any extra, still received the dairy I can't eat, and the portions of chive and bacon were so small it was a joke.  Maybe 6 actual pieces of green onion, cheap chive substitute.  Pathetic.  The brownie, in the restaurant you get a nice decent piece.  We received what looked like a small leftover piece in a small triangle.  Seriously three bites.  I usually don't eat like crap so this is a treat for me.  This wasn't a treat at all.  Never thought eating at outback was outstanding but in the restaurant it's been a 3.  This should have been better and wasn't.  Read the online notes and directions and give people what they ask and pay for.  Will not waste money on that again.  Next time, In and Out it is, cheap and way better."}
{"text":"a great alternative when u get tired of being gouged for price. we typically don't eat chan restaurants but outback is our only exception. as usual food quality was great. service is always good however, Douglas was one the best of the various outbacks that we have experienced. great Job Douglas!"}
{"text":"Not sure why Outback is always so picked on as it seems most locations get so so to poor reviews. Went last night and it was good stuff!!  Food was hot, big portions as I got the tilapia and other party got a sirlion. Server Jamie S was outstanding. Place was busy, good atmosphere and quick service. Can't find any complaints. Join the Dine Rewards program they have and after 3 visits you get half off next visit up to around $20.00--"}
{"text":"Wonderful service at the bar. Our wait was seriously misquoted. Our food was served cold. We could tell that the food would have been delicious if it had been hot, but instead, we received slow food served cold."}
{"text":"Not very often you have a perfect  meal w perfect service. The prime rib for my husband and i cooked differently and results were on point. Our server Jordan was bomb! Always checking up on us and delivery of our order was prompt. Thanks for a great experience Outback!"}
{"text":"You just can't beat the quality of steak for the price! The filets are fabulous and the salads and steamed vegetables are spot on. If you are looking for healthy quality it is found here."}
{"text":"Service was pleasant but don't sit close to kitchen door otherwise you will feel like your dining with server zombies that consistently yell \"CORNER\" when entering or departing to warn other to avoid a collision. Simply install a mirror works the same. Ordered wings for appetizer and porterhouse steak. Salad came first then salty wings. Really when I asked that this not occur. Steak good ate half of both took home. Later that night had food poisoning. When I called day shift manager was abrasive and defensive this in my opinion was unprofessional. No attempt to compensate or make amends. My next call is to health department . What a waste  of time and money can't wait for Longhorn Steakhouse to open in Surprise."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the portion sizes have definitely gotten smaller. This use to be my families favorite spot to eat at, but now we don't go here as much. The service was slow and their were only 2 families in the restaurant. The waitress definitely needed to be trained again."}
{"text":"Came in with my family tonight got seated right away it was pretty dead in the restaurant. Waited for our server Anthony to come take our drink order and we probably waited about 6 min but as a server you have 90 seconds to greet your table after they have been seated. Eventually he came over and took our drink order and it took about another 6 min to get our drinks. When he came back he took our order when he left we could see him standing behind the bar talking and sipping on a redbull. Our food had been brought out but it wasn't even by our server it was from a different guy which is fine. He seemed much friendlier and happy. I'm a server myself I usually tip 20% of the bill but not this time. He seemed a little careless. I'm only out here visiting so I don't have to worry about returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at this Outback that I have had great food and great service.  Also Dana the manager is wonderful. The positive energy and great attitude that she brings to the team is plus for you all. She's a keeper."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here and would not recommend this place. Dont waste your time or money.. not only was the service poor but the quality of food was not worth the price... was served food with no silverware and had to get then ourselves to eat.. management was poor in how they handled my complaint..."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place if you ask me...  I've had every server in there, Jared, Tony, Tim, etc.  they're all exemplary.  The food is what you'd expect from a chain restaurant.  Their sips'n'snacks drinks are definitely good deals.  Two rum punches and you're set.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.  They always take care of you.  i had a steak come out wrong once and not only did they fix it but they took it off the bill as well.  Above and beyond, I'm tellin ya!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Outback restaurants for years. We started going to the one closest to us and we were faithful there for 9-10 years. Eventually the service and food quality went down hill. Then we started going to one 1/2 hour away. That one started out great and then went down with the previous one. Now we have been going to this particular Outback and we love it! The owner is very personable and willing to make her customers happy. The managers and other staff are well trained and personable as well. It's 40 minutes from our home and well worth the drive."}
{"text":"This Outback is awesome!  I had the Ahi as an appetizer.  Great taste and quality.  Service was fast.  Just as we finished a drink the next one came.  Good came fast and hot also.    I had the Ribeye and it was still sizzling when they set the plate in front of me.    My wife had the No Rules pasta with Scallops.  It's her new favorite dish.  She already told me that that's what's for dinner again on Friday night!"}
{"text":"So we just finished a wonderful meal at outbacks  and we go to pay and find out that they don't support the military.    I will stick to place that actively support the military."}
{"text":"I have been here twice once in 2008 and again in 2013. The steak and the pasta was good. I had the no rules pasta, hubby had prime new york strip steak. We enjoyed our meal. The server was nice always keep are drinks filled and gave us plenty of bread and salad.  Good meals !"}
{"text":"Steak was awfull, sent it back, was way overcooked. Ordered the chesseburger and have to say it was very good. The waiter \"justin\" was very good. They need to work on there steaks but otherwise from what I ordered the place was decent."}
{"text":"What an awful experience! Checked in online on Sunday evening, and got seated about 5 minutes after arriving. We then proceeded to order our appetizer and our meal. The appetizer came out fairly quickly, but our dinner never came! We sat there for OVER AN HOUR, and we were never served our meal. We had another appointment to get to, so after waiting for an hour, we left money on the table for the cost of the appetizer, and we walked out. Frustrating considering that in the hour that we sat and waited for our food, several other large parties were seated, served their food, paid their bills, and left. I can't speak for the quality of the food, because we were never served ours!! Their service really stinks. At one point during our visit, what appeared to be a manager came by our table. We asked him to check on the status of our order, because we had been waiting an hour, and we had another appointment to get to. He said he would check on it, but he disappeared and never returned! Next time we'll be trying the Larsen's Grill in the Galleria Mall. Don't waste your time at Outback!"}
{"text":"Ok guys...long rant going on here.  I don't normally do this, but I feel the need to share this.  Last Tuesday, (10-24-17),my better half, Michelle and I went to go eat at Outback Steak House, located at 5605 W. Bell Rd.  We walked in and sat down at a booth in the bar area right behind the greeting hostess.  As we were sitting there, I noticed Michelle began fidgeting in her seat and began slapping her legs as if a pesky relentless mosquito would not give up on her.  I asked what was wrong and she told me something had bit her....I figured it was probably a mosquito and did not think much of it.  We continued talking and she continued fidgeting until she finally moved over to my side.  I thought, what the heck?  She said there was something down there and she kept getting bit or stung....we both looked under the table using her phone light and saw some bugs, but we did not know what the hell they were.  Michelle finally slapped her leg again and caught a small bug, but by the time she brought it up to the table to see, it popped, and her fingers were full of blood.  A small bit of this bug was left on her finger along with the blood and we put it on one of the cloth napkins.  By this time, we had the Hostess' attention.  I asked her to get me a manager, and she asked what the problem was.  I told her something had stung Michelle and showed her the back of her legs, which were bright red by now and welted.  I showed her the small bug on my napkin and she stated, \"Oh my God! Hold on to that thing, the same thing happened to me when I sat on this booth last week and we couldn't figure out what it was!\"  She runs off to get the manager and we wait patiently, but she did not show up.  Meanwhile, Michelle continues slapping her legs (she was wearing knee high yoga pants and I was wearing jeans) and she finally said, \"we gotta move, whatever is here is eating me alive!\".  By this time, the hostess is back and I tell her we have to move.  Michelle and I had to go back and forth from the crappy booth to our table to move our food because the waiter did not do it for us (what the heck?!).  We move onto another table that was NOT a booth and I bring my cloth napkin, which like a normal person, I had it on my upper legs when I was eating.  I put that sucker over my shoulder as I am carrying my plate and set it on the table.  As we are trying to figure out what just happened, I ask another employee to get me the manager.  He goes off into the kitchen and again, nothing from the manager.  As I am talking to Michelle, she sees a bug on my shoulder.  I panicked, and about took my shirt off in plain restaurant.  Michelle calm's me the hell down and tells me to hold still so that she can get it and figure out once and for all what the hell bit her.  She grabs the little fellow and I immediately recognize the darn bug....it was a BEDBUG!!!!  I about pucked.....to think...I had wiped my mouth a few times with my damn napkin....WTF?!!!  We were able to hold the damn bug and put it under a glass and walked up to the hostess once more and told three of the employees I knew what those damn little bugs we had seen were now...the booth was infested with bedbugs and by this time, demanded the manager come out...this being the third request!  Believe it or not, that's not the only bad experience....oh, there is more.    Manager comes out, a nice lady by the name of Marci Gackle, and we show her the bug.  She begins playing with the bug...trying to squash it with her nail against the table.  At one point, the bug falls on the floor and she can't find it.  I google a picture of bedbugs on my phone and show it to her.  Well I'll be darned, she agrees they are Bedbugs.  She tells her employees to shut down that particular booth.  There are plenty of people still sitting by that booth....pretty darn sure these bugs were not just in that booth....but hey, I'm no bed bug expert.  So, our nightmare does not end there.    We get home, we strip off ALL our clothes in the garage, including socks, shoes, ball cap, purses, my gun bag....everything.  Toss all that shit in a plastic bag, fumigate the shit out of it and toss it in the garbage.  Purses have liners in them and I just did not want to take the chance one of those bed bug eggs end up in my home.  I fumigated the inside of my truck and even pucked my dinner...I was grossed out...anyway, showered and still felt the bageebies after.    The next day, I spoke to someone by the name of JL with Direct Insurance.  This person works for the Insurance that covers Outback.  This lady spoke to Michelle, and then to me.  Her question was, \"What are you looking to get out of this, we only cover medical costs\".  Hmmmm....really?  What price can you put to possibly eating one of these damn bugs?!"}
{"text":"Used to be a quality restaurant. Prices have gone up and quality is the worst I have ever seen. Don't waste your money here ordered Lamb and it was almost impossible to eat. Never have I seen lamb served anywhere with so much fat on it!!! Aussie Fries are now horrible and no longer the quality this chain is known for. Their Corp. Marketing is the worst I have ever seen running misleading commercials in an effort to get more customers. I have given them so many chances and each meal just gets worse. I have been enjoying meals at OutBack ever since they opened!!! Never again will I consider recommending or taking friends and family to this restaurant. When they first started out they were very good. Now they could win the worst restaurant in Las Vegas Award if there was one. So sorry to see this chain drop to such poor quality"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger cooked medium well.  Burger came medium if it was cooked that much.  Made server aware of it but said we didn't want another one.  Burger had no taste.  Manager came over to see if there was anything he could do for us.  Explained what we told waiter and showed him picture of undercooked burger.  Didn't comp anything off of bill.  Not going there again."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of steaks and Prime Rib.  Appetizers are great.  Make sure you call ahead or use the app to get on the waiting list.  Otherwise you will be waiting a while.  This place is always busy."}
{"text":"I never had such a good steak in my life! Took the USDA Center Cut Filet, the only thing to say: Amazing! Service is very kind and helpful. Food is prepared fresh and is delicious. No objections! Next time I visit the states I won't miss to eat there (or in another Outback Steakhouse). Be sure to make a reservation if you go for dinner, or take a seat at the bar which is first come first serve."}
{"text":"Great food,service, and atmosphere. \"80% of the time its great everytime\" Cant ever get enough of their steaks!!"}
{"text":"It's good enough. Beer is cold. Service is predictable. For similar money I prefer the charm of stockyards, but this is a good restaurant.   Get the chopped blue cheese salad, you'll thank me. It's really really good."}
{"text":"When I was younger, my dad use to take my sisters and myself to the outback as a treat at least once per month. We always got an awesome blossom, and they were awesome, and anything else we ordered was always perfect. So imagine my disappointment when my sister and I went there last night for the first time in probably a couple years. We of course ordered the bloomin' onion,......is it a bloomin' onion or awesome blossom, I forget, however it doesn't matter because I will never order it again. It seemed as if the poured a little extra oil over the onion AFTER taking it out of the deep fryer, it was in a pool of oil. We did eat some of it but I think the onion may be the reason that I got sick soon after and am still feeling the effects this morning. Then we both ordered the ribs. I am a rib fanatic, basically you can never go wrong with ribs. They went wrong. I couldn't hardly eat them, they were SO salty! I like salt, I'm a total salt person, but this was way too much, it was practically inedible, but since I was spending my money on it I managed to choke down a little less than half of my half rack. Needless to say I won't be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Love going to this location always great food and service. The hostess shayla is always smiling and friendly"}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate our 11 year Anniversay dinner with a good steak. We chose Outback Steakhouse. We were seated rather quickly for a Saturday night. The service however was horrible. The waiter decided to pull up a chair and take our order. Then he gave us someone else's appetizer FOUR different times. Then when our dinner finally showed up guess what... It wasn't ours. The manager came by as she saw me sawing on my steak like I was trying to saw a piece of wood and asked how our dinner was. After telling her about our experience she laughed it off and didn't really seem to care. I think next time I will buy some steaks and grill them at home."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Outback I have been to. I know it's a newer one, so of course it looks nice, but the service matches it very well. The service I received here was amazing. I will however visit during a busy weekend as well to see if the service is still as great. The food was good, nice and hot. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food great staff and management. Its barely more than  macdonalds ,especially for 11$"}
{"text":"Good steak and good service . A little wait on food but awesome experience. Thanks Tommy for the great service and suggestions."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst food I have ever had at a reputable restaurant. Some food was inedible salty and the veggies had no seasoning whatsoever. Terribly disappointing."}
{"text":"Best Outback I've ever been to and I've gone all over the US.  The service is phenomenal ass is the food.  Love the atmosphere doesn't feel like a typical Outback! No worries Wednesday gets me every week"}
{"text":"I'm not sure when outback got so expensive but never again. $45 for curbside and we didn't even get steak. Alice chicken, pasta with chicken and some $10 cheese fries. Ridiculous! Food was a little over cooked even. Outback needs to step back down from these high prices. They are not a fancy restaurant. What happened?"}
{"text":"Outback is one our favorite restaurants.  However, after today I'm unsure I will be returning.  As we were walking in my husband said, \"watch out for the roach\".  As I looked it was not just one there was at least 5 in the foyer area.  Then we walked in and there was 2 more than I didn't even have to look for.  All I could imagine is what the kitchen must look like.  I just could not eat there, how unsanitary.  I did mention to the hostess my we were not staying, she said she was sorry.  I'm just not sure how she or management could overlook such filth."}
{"text":"We had a gift card and decided to go to Outback. First time there and when we told the waitress, the manager comped us the blooming onion. Seriously addictive! I'm not much for steak, but had the prime rib. It was done done very well. A bit pricey for me , but you definitely get plenty for your money."}
{"text":"This place is Fantastic. The food is Fabulous and the service is Excellent. Gillian was our Waitress and she took excellent care of us. We had the Prime Rib. Gillian recommended the Steak House Macaroni and Cheese to my husband. He said it was Excellent. I had the Onion Soup and it was Fantastic. The Prime Rib was so tender you didn't need a knife. We'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic view of the strip and good service, -1 star for price then again it IS located on the strip so. There are other Outbacks around the strip but some close early for some reason. This one is located next to the Coca Cola shop and you take the elevator up- the elevator is in a Coke bottle!"}
{"text":"MEH....Arnold Palmer are watered down. Salad are washed with city water? Has a strange taste."}
{"text":"The food was fine it was the service that needs work. We came here at 10 , and it's open till midnight, yet they get lazy . They take a long time to bring the simplest thing. You see your waitress talking instead of helping you out. Lastly, they barely checked to see if you were fine. I"}
{"text":"Food was very good.. Can't stop saying good things about their service.. One of the best in a while.. Props again to our server, Ryan.."}
{"text":"Baby back ribs were awesome and the bloomin' onion was delicious."}
{"text":"I took my twins for their 16th birthday and the staff and manager were wonderful.  The food was awesome and cooked perfectly.  Overall it was great and we will go back."}
{"text":"Hot bread and a good Bloomin' Onion. No silverware and two under cooked steaks. Reheated to the correct color, but of course it tasted sub par after that. This visit wasn't anywhere near as good as my previous visit."}
{"text":"The beer is nice and cold, our server is super! Otherwise I would not make the trip. Our bread was terribly dry and our steaks way over done. In addition the shrimp was too salty and the ahi dry. It was such a surprise as this is one of or favorite places! The manager was very receptive to our feedback."}
{"text":"Outback is a chain resturant ~ so they have their formula perfected.  Each time we hav eaten at OUTBACK we have had a great dinner and good service.  Lately each time we try to eat at OUTBACK there has been a 20 to 30 minute wait  ~ we don't always wait . .  .but it's wonderful to know that things are picking up and that there are quality resturants that have waiting line ~ to me this is a blessings.  : )KC"}
{"text":"I have been an Outback customer since the very beginning. I understand that the economy is also not what it used to be and cost have sky rocketed. I am in business for myself and in my industry everything is the race to zero ( who can sell it the cheapest). Personally I am not cheap and dont mind paying more for better quality. I have been to the Mentor Ohio several times and each time I am disgusted at the mediocrity there and at other restaurants in the city. Is it the demographic that causes this. I am however a bit picky because I am a former Chef. On the other hand I have seen the OUTBACK make changes that have been really bad maybe not for your margin but for what you get at your establishment. The salad from quality to chopped NASTY salad. Now granted they made it for me the old way and it was great! I typically order the outback rack and it is always good or the Sirloin it is also usually good. My favorite was the Rock Hampton Rib Eye or the Melbourne.   The last two times I visited I had each and have never been so dissatisfied with a Steak in my life. It was to be compared to what I would expect to Dennys!!! The worst ever as I will explain. THINNER THAN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE CALLED A STEAK. Price went up, ok I dont mind paying more to get a good steak for dinner. For $23.95 I should have gone to Flemmings or even Dennys! This evening was a real letdown and I know that business looks good there but I will not be returning until I hear people ranting about the outback. I really wanted to have prime Rib but at 8 pm they were out ok difficult to forecast sales I understand a little. I once again spent $75.00 for dinner with my wife and a childs meal No WINE,Beer or Drinks.   A bit high for a thin *  1/2 inch to be precise Grizzley porterhouse steak I would say!  I wish you corporate guys would see this but I am sure it will just be automatically sent to the Proprietor who is very friendly and I am sure busy. Not enough for someone who likes to go to a Steakhouse. The Waitress did a great job this had nothing to do with service.  Signed,  Hells Kitchen They get a Failing grade and wont see me ever again at any location I had to give it 1 star but I would have given XXX if possible"}
{"text":"The cheeseburger off the child's menu they put in our to go order was burnt to a crisp including the bun. I wish I could post a picture.  Shame on you Outback!"}
{"text":"The food is standard. Steaks are consistently undercooked but that's my only food complaint. Service on the other is terrible! We walked in and we're seated by a host listening to music through earbuds. The waitress was extremely rude and slow. The table in front of us asked for their soup and she bluntly replied, \"Really, you ordered soup?\" Notice there was no sorry. She also seemed to be a hermit in the kitchen and rarely checked on us. We've had similar experiences before even! In summary service=terrible, food=pretty good. If visiting I would recommend Chili's (right down the road) and Beer Belly Sports Grille a few miles west."}
{"text":"To get straight to my point, we decided to go to this Outback location for New Year's Eve dinner to order their Steak filet. With two small children in tow we got there early around 4:30 pm. When we placed our dinner order for the Steak filet the response we were given was  \" We don't have that\". To which I responded that I saw the item listed on the menu and have ordered it many times in years past. The waitress then informed us she meant they were sold out of Steak filet. I was in complete disbelief. We had ventured out of the house with our toddlers for this special occasion and chose Outback for the Steak filet, and they are sold out of it at 4:30 pm on New Year's Eve? How can a restaurant be sold out of a main entrée item that early on in the evening/afternoon? That reflects poor planning. Coincidentally, the last time we dined out at this location a few years ago they were sold of the Lamb entrée - which was disappointing, however, a manager apologized to us for the inconvenience that time and offered a free alternate entrée. This time around we finished dining out at this location but I remain disappointed about the experience. A manager never came around to apologize this time or ask us how our meal was, nor were we offered anything for the inconvenience. Outback has food items that are tasty but entire menu is very over priced and I feel as though our money would have been better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Showed up at 730pm on Friday night, maybe 7 tables of people - practically empty. Took forever to get service. Outback has been promoting the endless shrimp meal - here's the amazing part, they were out of crispy, breaded shrimp. REALLY!!!!  Not only that, the shrimp they did have, the creamy garlic shrimp, took 20 minutes each time you wanted a refill - of 8 tiny shrimp. Never going back. Too many other great steakhouses in the area - no need to waste my money at Outback."}
{"text":"Loved the Ahi Tuna and blue cheese chopped salad!!!  Service is always spot on.  One of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"We love going to this location. We started going more often because the food was great and we were getting awesome service. We especially like sitting at the bar with two of the regular guy bar tenders. I think its CJ/Casey and I forget the other dark haired bartenders name, but they rock. We will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the blooming onion is always good. Just wish that small sirloin didn't cost 10$. 4 stars for the service."}
{"text":"Upon arrival  I went  to  the  hostess stand , hostess said  she  had  immediate  seating. We followed her to a dirty booth. We return to the wait area. First thing I notice is that the hostess didn't iron her shirt. Working in a customer service orientated restaurant I criticize highly of the image employees have. We were seated shortly. Server Jonny P. serve us a party of 4. We ordered the blooming onion to start off. App came shortly. We ordered drinks, had to return the mojito because the glass was dirty. He came back shortly with a new one. Flavor lacked in the mojito but was drinkable. Server was attentive and efficient. He had a bandaid on his finger which means that he is protecting my food from getting any of his bodily fluids on anything I consume. Overall I was pleased with the meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic staff and owner!! My husband and I came in for an early dinner. I was not feeling good and Jenn the server noticed I wasn't eating my chicken and I explained it was just my stomach not the food. Next the owner Susan Thompson came and checked on me. A couple minutes later she came back with a bowl of simple chicken broth and noodles (something not on the menu)... the perfect thing that settled my stomach!  She had the chef make it special for me. She said it was the mother in her that wanted to help. Not many places would go to such lengths. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Cameron was awesome!!!  He was prompt and attentive.  The food was great and the service was even better.  Steaks were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"VERY decent food for a good price ($25-$35 for the steaks, including 2 sides). Good, tasty food, without being too sophisticated.   Service very professional without being too much. Open relatively late (at least till 11pm)"}
{"text":"I know...its a chain and should be good right....well RIGHT!  I love this place and crave it from time to time.  Went and had dinner with a couple of my peeps.  We chomped on the bread-and who can say they dont like that bread.  Good God!  =)  My BF and I both ordered the Chicken on the Barbie and I was so happy when mine came out shaped like a heart!!!  \"Outback loves me!\" I screamed!  I know I crack myself up.  Anyways, we had salad with our meals and I must say this is the salad I dream about....Tangy Tomato is all I have to say!  Oh AND the homemade croutons.  Yummo!  The chicken was good with my mashed potatoes and my BF had a baked potato.  It was perrrrfect!  The BF said he should have gotten a steak because that is what he was most in the mood for...oh well, guess we will have to go again. ;)  The service was awsome...the waitress was super friendly.  I think she wanted to sit down with us because we were having so much fun.    I am rarely disappointed.  I think only once that I had to complain but they picked up the bill for next time.  Always awsome-I love you too Outback!   See ya soon!"}
{"text":"2 meals for $25.  Sounds like a plan.  It comes with your choice of their selected 3 appetizers, soup or salad, choice of entrees (I think there was like 5 or six to choose from) and choice of one side.  Appetizer - Alice chicken quesadilla with honey mustard -a little weird with the honey mustard but it was ok.  Salad - tangy tomato dressing all the way.  Love love love their salads  (we both ordered) Chicken on the Barbie - overcooked and dry :(  the BBQ sauce is yummy  Mashed potatoes - Nothing to write home about but I do like the little chunks of potato Baked potato - BF explained it as a scrub potato (thumbs down)-it looked small and bottom of the bag *for the \"2 for\" special there lacked a little love in these dishes.  Bread is always awesome.  Chelsie was our waitress and a pleasure.  It was my mom's bday and we all sang and Chelsie joined in.  The service was great....food was an eh.  Outback is always a favorite of mine so I will definitely be back but maybe the Rainbow location. ;)"}
{"text":"My family goes to Outback often and this is our favorite location.  The service is always great and they are more reliable on cooking steak.  It's always a great experience."}
{"text":"I ordered 4 steak dinners to go.  Upon opening the bag to serve the meal the bag contained 1 loaf of bread.  Stingy to me.   I called to complain the next day and the manager said it was fair to only give 1 loaf.  Won't order or eat in for awhile until I get over the dumb response."}
{"text":"This is pretty much a standard Outback Steakhouse.  If you've been to one of these suckers, you've pretty much been to them all.  Plus, lets be honest, the free tiny bread loaves are too legit to quit.  On this trip in early Feb, we did get particularly outstanding service.  Our wait staff was as awesome as the Blooming Onion that we ordered."}
{"text":"Not happy with our takeout order!! All the meals were mixed, prime rib was like rubber, food was cold and there was no condiments with our baked potatoes or sweet potatoes. Not only did we spend a bit of $ now we have to spend more to replace food we didn't even get to eat.....would not recommend it at all!!"}
{"text":"Order two steaks is med and med/well.   One looks likes a hockey puck and the other still had a heart beat.     So much for this thing called pride in one's work.    It was a take out order.   I assumed it would be done correctly the first time.   No point in ordering ahead, go check to see its wrong and wait while some food gets cold while they correct their mistake(s)."}
{"text":"Outback is SPECTACULAR! Whenever I go here I wonder why I waste my time going anywhere else. The beer is cold the bread is delicious and the entrees are always fantastic. My husbands sticks with the Outback special and I get a house salad with ranch. Their ranch dressing is great here. You can't go wrong with the baked potato either which is baked with salt in the outer skin. I highly recommend Outback!"}
{"text":"Great food!  I was impressed by the new decor and the staff was incredible. I am definitely going back soon. BEST RANCH IN TOWN!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  We arrived, and the parking lot was pretty full, but found that it was for Bonefish Grill, which is located in the same building.  We were seated immediately, but our server (Travis) was slow to arrive for our drink order.  We needed to look at the wine and beer list, and he got bored waiting for us to make a choice, and just wandered off.  He finally took the orders and turned to walk away before we could tell him we wanted a Bloomin Onion as well.  The Bloomin Onion was overly browned and parts of it were hard, and the onions tasted like Scotch tape.  The steak I ordered had a huge piece of gristle in it, to the point of being difficult to cut.  I've never seen this happen at Outback before.  My boyfriend ordered shrimp, and it was overly browned and hard as well.  Our server started to clear the table, then just left the empty dishes sitting on the edge of the table, which was an accident waiting to happen.  My friend had the blackberry sangria, which we agreed was very yummy.  Our server disappeared and it took a while to get the bill, and then he took forever to ring it up and then bring it back.  Once he dropped the bill off, we never saw him again.  All in all, food was VERY subpar compared to other Outbacks I've been to, and the service was less than good.  Go to Bonefish Grill instead."}
{"text":"The curbside take away service was horrible. We waited 15 minutes past our pickup time before being acknowledged by the staff. Then we had to wait another 5 minutes before actually getting the food brought out to us. The food was good but I wouldn't order again because of how terrible the customer service was. I've never posted on Yelp before but felt compelled to because this experience."}
{"text":"We go on Wednesday for the special menu that includes salad, entrée with 1 side and dessert!  We love their Pork Porterhouse cooked well done.  This is our favorite place when we need a good meal and it gives me a break from cooking at home!  Love this place!  Senior Citizens who have an AARP card get 15% off."}
{"text":"The prices may be pretty expensive at this place, and maybe you have to wait a few minutes to get into the seats, but after you taste the food sudden bliss fills into your mouth.  TRUE HEAVEN!! You have got to also try the sautéed mushrooms. Best OUTBACK with best customer service. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food was cold and undercooked and an employee used the restroom and didn't wash their hands.  First time having a bad experience at this establishment.  Wasn't servers fault the foo was cold it was the expeditors fault."}
{"text":"Tonight the service sucked big time. Was slow as hell and was not that busy. Normally have good service and food. I hope tonight a one time thing."}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday and got food poisoning later that night. Had the sirloin n shrimp. I am so exhausted from all the vomiting.  Never will go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of all the Outbacks in the area. The service is always great, and the food has always been delicious. I've had multiple servers recommend dishes and each dish ends up being my new favorite. I can always count on the staff to be knowledgeable in their menu, and go above and beyond to provide great customer service."}
{"text":"For the price. I do not think you can beat this place. I know they do not serve prime meat but the food has always been consistently good here (as for all outback steakhouses). The steaks are always seasoned well and quite tender for prime cuts. The sides are good, I always get a side of green beans and the sweet potato. The bread is awesome but sometimes it is not that fresh. Service is always average.A good steakhouse for the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this to be an excellent restaurant. The prime rib that he had was tender and delicious. My salmon dinner was really good a little heavy on the sauce but next time I would order it on the side. Our waiter Kadeem was funny and Charming. I would come back again anytime. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant ever this is the only steak hoise we go too .. Lindsey is the best manager ever she goes above and beyond it is unbelievable!!! We love this place !!!"}
{"text":"This experienced my family and I had today was outrageous the food was cold undercooked and when you send it back the waitress got annoyed The Bloomin Onion well what can I say I don't know what they've done with it but it's not anything what it was before it'll be a long time before we step foot in this place again if ever the biggest part of this is they don't care."}
{"text":"Bloomin' onions are by far the best thing here along with a Foster's beer. Went with a larger group for lunch on Sunday and service was slow. All the food didn't come out at the same time and when they did bring it out one steak was raw in the middle. When we sent it back they refired the same steak even though it was already cut in half. The manager did come out and apologized but should have comped the steak since everyone else had their food and we had to wait ten minutes for them to cook it right again."}
{"text":"I use to love going here, but after going back the food has completely went down. My baked potato was completely burnt and the cashier overcharged my card and had a very dry attitude when I brought it to her attention. I have not been back since and don't anticipate on returning."}
{"text":"Rib eye steak is the business after a night of hard drinking and throwing your money away at O'Sheas!"}
{"text":"We have gone to Outback for years! That is until now - every time we've gone this past year the food has been so disappointing in the following ways: cold food, over cooked and way over priced for what we got. The portions are not worth $25.00 (on average) and the quality of food is not good. Salads were limp with over ripe tomatoes, and the ribs were dry, bland and fatty. The baked potatoes were even a joke.  Thought we were getting punked  NEVER AGAIN will we throw money away on any Outback Steakhouse - too bad too, they used to be the best."}
{"text":"Alway a great steak here!  Gotta come check out the Valentines Day weekend special...bread, appetizer, 2 steaks, 2 salads, 2 sides and a cheesecake all for under $50!!!  Definitely pick an upgrade!  They make the best steaks...better than any of the steak chains by far and not as pricey!  Hubby was in Heaven and I was stuffed...kids always love the dessert! It is always a g'day down-under mates!"}
{"text":"Awful. Waiter had the personality of a wet rag. Took forever to get our food. My filet was had a good flavor but was a little tough. My husband's Steak was over done so we sent it back and it came back still over done. Both of our shrimp came out over done both times. My husband didn't  even end up eating and when the check originally came out there was no concession at all. I know it is not a high end steak house but come on."}
{"text":"Wow! Always Great Food, Great Service and super nice people! Wife had the Salmon...delicious! I had the Outback Steak Special...big one...always consistent and always tasty!"}
{"text":"Not bad but most likely won't be visiting this location again. Our waiter sucked, honestly. Took a very long time to get us our drinks and was not friendly at all. He talked to us the very least he had to, we never even got asked how everything was! The food wasn't bad but everything seemed to be seasoned with the exact same seasoning, over seasoned as well."}
{"text":"I stayed at Harrah's so location wise this place could not be beat. When I'm out of town, I make it a point not to eat at places I can eat at when I'm at home. However after my horrific experience with BB Kings across the street earlier that day, I yearned for something familiar.  I love their ceasear dressing. It tastes homemade and fresh. Delicious!. Coconut shrimp was hot and flavorful per usual. Outback has always been a winner in my book. Reasonable prices definitely worth the try if you've never been there before."}
{"text":"I like my steak rare, but they seem to overcook it often.  My wife loves Outback, so we eat here about once a month.  I would say they get the steak rare 3 out of 12 times.  When I have sent it back to have a new steak cooked, it seems to come out cooked more.  The wait staff is hit or miss in my opinion.  About half of them are great, and the other half seem as if they just don't care at all.  We try to sit in the bar area at the dining tables when it is busy, and we tend to get better service there."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from the time we walked in the door till the time we left!  Fabulous!  Normally we eat at a different location.  Moved to this side of town and WOW!! Thank you for such great service and an outstanding meal!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this Outback at least a dozen times since I moved to Westlake, and I'm always impressed. The waitstaff is always courteous, prompt and personable, the building always clean of clutter on the outside and inside and the food is always delectable. Generous portions for great prices. It's always worth very penny spent. My current favorite item is the Victoria filet and I'm not even a huge red meat lover. I get mine well done and it still cuts like butter! I'm always impressed and cannot recommend this place enough. The manager actually introduced herself to our table one night, and you can tell she takes pride in her restaurant and staff. 5 stars absolutely!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! They got my order wrong, my drink wrong ... It took forever to get our food.. The waitress spilled sauce on our table and didn't clean it up!! I will never go to this location again. AND there were never an apology for getting anything wrong. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food wasn't. Tasted very greasy and like they have not cleans the fryers in a while. Extremely disappointed. Won't be back...."}
{"text":"I have eaten at too many Outbacks over the years.  This one one of the worst.  From a martini 3/4 full to a steak ordered with crab meat that never appeared.  When I asked our waiter about the missing crab meat, he apologized and ordered it for my stak.  Eight minutes and 3/4 through my steak, a manager full of attitude appeared with the missing crab meat.  I refused it, and asked about the egg-sized baked potato.  His comment was, \"Do you want another steak and a potato?\"  I refused.  They did take it off the ill, but the attitude was uncalled for."}
{"text":"Food was pretty standard.. Almost $60 for two of us not including the tip. Our wait to be seated was about an hour. They were missing quite a few items that you would usually find in an outback steakhouse in your neighborhood. As to be expected in the strip the prices are more expensive. I would pass on outback.. might as well hit up something you wouldn't find in your neighborhood if you're going to pay almost as must as some of the other restaurants in the strip."}
{"text":"This Outback is now out of business.  I really liked their prime rib, but given how the servers were constantly complaining about the management I'm not too surprised they folded."}
{"text":"My neighbor and I went there today to have lunch. Well we should have know when our waiter came to us after waiting for our appetizers to arrive that something was wrong. First, he did not even notice that we had no silverware. So we had to dip our bread into the butter and spread it around with our fingers. The hostess was less then thrilled to be there because the way we were greeted and seated was like she was doing us a favor. Anyway, our waiter comes to us and tells us that they are redoing our blooming onion because the first one came out looking like poop. And they did not want to serve it to us so we said ok and waited. This is when I had to ask for silverware. He told us that the manager was going to bring it to us. She arrived later with our blooming onion and asked us if this was ok and we said we don't know because we never seen one before let alone tasted one so we were not sure if it was ok. We also the told here we never saw the first one. This was sign #2 that this was not going to go well. My French onion soup came and that was on the warm side so I kind of let that slide. Well when our meal showed up it was horrible. My sweet potato was cold and the glob of butter would not melt let alone all that cinnamon on top of it and on the side of the plate. It looked a mess. My meat was cold and it looked liked someone took bites out of it and then tried to cover it up with gravy. It looked like it was served before. You could tell by the broccoli that it was over cooked just by the color of it. The same was said for my friend that had the beef with the Marsala sauce. Both were cold as well as the risotto. We talked with the manager and I told her that we were done and that there was no apology that could make me want to come back and she needs to talk to her staff about the words they choose to describe their food because poop was just the deal breaker for me. So I really don't know what is so good about Outback Steakhouse. The service for me was not what it is cracked up to be. Also the owners name is about the entrance to the restaurant. My one comment to the owner is take your name down. Your staff just made an embarrassment of your name as a franchise owner."}
{"text":"Just got back from Outback Steakhouse. It was Grandma, Auntie, Cousin, and me. We went for Mother's Day. I had a salad, Sweet Potato with brown sugar, and a 6oz Steak. The meal was so damn good, that I will be going back there very soon. The Sweet Potato with the brown sugar was the best. The waitress said that it could be even considered a dessert. That Shit was good. The steak was good too with the A1 sauce and the salad with ranch sauce was good, but I LOVE SWEET POTATO.. but to have it with brown sugar, definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out from here and as much as I love their crab cake topped talipia, I was not impressed with my meal this time!   The dish comes with a lemon sauce that they typically put on the side for you, however, after getting my order from my husband that picked if up, they barely included any sauce and honestly, that makes the dish.  The crab cake was delicious, however, I had an hard time finishing the talapia  It lacked flavor even after putting my own lemon juice on it.   Typically the food is good but I would recommend eating at the restaurant and not ordering curbside."}
{"text":"I will spare you the details and just say that I have had three bad experiences in a row at Outback Steakhouse. (three different locations too) I give up!"}
{"text":"Been here 2 times in the last year and both times i had a great experience.  A beer in the bar and a sweetheart bartender named sydney...  whats not to like."}
{"text":"We had not been to Outbacks in a while so were really looking forward to a great lunch.  Boy were we mistaken.   As we approached the hostess she was distracted and finally just said for us to grab a booth in the bar area. Strange but ok no big deal. I ordered the Victoria filet medium-well. It came back like a hockey puck on a plate.  We informed the waitress. She said she'd fire one up right away.  Well 30 minutes later i still had not gotten my food.  By the time I received it, everyone else had finished eating. The least the manager ciuld have done was offer to comp my food. Nothing.  We showed the waitress a 15% coupon from RetailMeNot and the manager came over to tell us they did not accept those.   Needless to say, lunch was horrible."}
{"text":"These people have Horriable cooks !! I order my steaks \" well done\" and i have received it like shoe leather, HPD could arrest me if i threw it at someone for assault!! Lol ( but serious u would think a \"Steakhouse\" could it Steak? Duh, it's NOT or should be that hard, my last there times i ordered, i can't eat medium or any other way because of my stomach issues, i guess time to become a vegan!!"}
{"text":"Will not be back.  Was seated at a dirty table had to point out that the coasters were all dirty. Food was not as good as recent visits blooming onion very greasy and ribs appeared to have been warmed up then just cooked my opinion"}
{"text":"Met some friends from back home here for dinner before we went to see a movie and probably will never be back again.  There was a wait when we got there which was fine Friday night so there is a wait everywhere and seated pretty quick.  Once the food came out I was pretty upset.  I had ordered a filet and it was burnt on the outside and we'll done to say the least when I said medium.  The waiter never asked how the food was nor did a Manager stop by the table.  Not paying that much for a filet that was burnt.  If I wanted that I would have cooked it myself."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Service was nice and I loved the Maple bacon sauce for adding onto steaks delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to really like the Outback chain, not a Ruth's but not sizzler either. However I can only give one star because of the corporate attitude. I am retired military and always enjoyed the military discount, not any more. I patronize a lot of  business's without a discount, but always having one and then \"sorry, we stopped that\", well then I asked about a senior discount. \"You have to have a aarp card\". What about the conservative senior group? Nope, aarp or nothing. Adios outback"}
{"text":"Started out bad and it got worse. Ate here Sunday 3/25, party of 7. Was told wait would be 25 minutes it took over 50 minutes to be seated. They were not that busy. Ordered and it took forever to get the salads. Three people ordered steak and prawns. All steaks came over-cooked and the shrimp was not hot warm.  One serving came naked, not served on a bed of tomato caprese and covered with garlic butter sauce. My serving of pork tenderloin was over cooked and excessively salty. The macaroni and cheese was good. The waitress was friendly but oblivious to the restaurant's short comings. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Outback Steakhouse is a Outback Steakhouse.  I am not a big fan but my friends wanted to treat us out.  What set this one apart of others Outback Steakhouse was our server.  I didn't get her name but she was amazing.  She took her time and listen to us.  I didn't felt rushed at all and explained any questions we have.  Thank you to our server...our meals were more tasteful."}
{"text":"Food: Of all the restaurants I have gone to that served bread while we waited for our entrees, Outback's bread is the best (slightly above Cheesecake Factory)! For my entree, I had the grilled shrimp Caesar salad. The dressing was lightly tossed into the salad, which made me happy because a lot of restaurants douse their salad with dressing. The salad was enjoyable and was the right portion, but not something I'd return to order again. I loved the croutons in it though. My husband had the Porterhouse steak. I'm not a fan of steak, but this one was very nicely seasoned and prepared well. It even made me think perhaps I should have ordered a steak! We also had the blackberry sangria which was nicely sweetened and refreshing, but the husband thought it was too sweet.  Atmosphere: Same as all the other Outback Steakhouses. It is pretty popular. When we left at 9, I still saw people coming in.  Service: We ate here on a Monday night. We got there around 730 and were seated at 8. Our server at the bar was extremely helpful and attentive. Even though I was waiting for our table, she offered to get me a glass of water. Our table server was quick, and she also let me have more bread after I finished it. Two issues I had about the server though was: (1) I asked for my salad to have dressing on the side. It arrived already tossed into the salad. (2) We had dinner with a colleague and asked to split the check. She did, but she put the colleague's drink on my and my husband's check. (I thought it would be common sense to put the drink on there too and I won't have to specifically tell her what should be on each check.) Overall, I had a good dinner and she was helpful when I asked for a takeout bag, so I let it go, but I'm still a little annoyed about those two points. :)   Other: My napkin smelled moldy. Thank goodness it was black. If it was white, I think it would have looked horrendous.  Bottom Line: The experience at this Las Vegas location is no different from eating at any other Outback Steakhouse. What stood out to me that evening were the double servings of bread, the sangria, the steak, and the croutons in my salad."}
{"text":"Date night at the Outback was a little crazy. We had about an hour long wait to get in and then ended up being seated in the bar area to avoid an even further wait. The food was okay.  The waiters seemed to be spread very thin and rushing from one place to the next but we didn't see ours very often.    All in all, probably not my number one choice for date night again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. My mom insisted on outback. I'm not huge on chain restaurants. Service was horrible. We waited over 10 mins to be seated in an empty restaurant. When our food came my moms food was laughable. Her half of sandwich on a huge plate. The sandwich itself had a little, thin piece of meat in it. It was a bread sandwich. Nobody wants a bread sandwich, especially after you give them free bread. When the waitress asked how the food was my mom told her complaint and the waitress said well it's because it's a half of sandwich. She asked if she could make her another one. My mom decline saying no she didn't want to eat that. The waitress said ok and left? She never offered to make her something else or remove it from the check. My mom didn't eat it and had to pay for it. I will never come back. That is ridiculous. This is probably why I never eat at chain restaurants. Quality is poor and service is worse."}
{"text":"Outback is Outback. I like the pork medallions here but don't get there too late or else they run out. The wait staff here is quite nice.   *serves coke products"}
{"text":"This was high priced cafeteria food. The shrimp was greasy,and the prime rib sandwich looked and tasted like it was from a low end sub shop. We where very disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"This evening tried once again to have a meal at Outback. Ordered the Steak salad and the picture in the menu and what I was served was not even close to the picture. If one advertises menu items it needs to serve as depicted. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad enough a fly  was landing on the kids food today,  as cold as it  was today where did it come from?  My au jus was barely tepid and my lobster tail was overcooked and rubbery.  I sent the au jus back and asked to have it hotter and it came back barely hot, so after finding out the lobster tail was overcooked I didn't want to chance sending that back.  The prime rib was tough at a med. rare.  and not hot so that is why they should make sure the au jus is hot. We got there when they first opened so there shouldn't have been overcooked lobster.  We barely got any butter for the bread, so when the kids wanted more there was no more butter.  I don't know if they are going down hill but for what they charge there should be a much better experience.  Also our waiter was pretty much not around. Very disappointed in this visit, esp. for the cost."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. Would definitely come again. Went the extra mile to make us happy! #thumbsup"}
{"text":"First off, let me begin with the fact that nobody in my party wanted to go to outback because of their previous shi**y experienced & me being the optimist pushed and pleaded and we ended up at outback. The service was subpar- the hostess didn't greet us with a smile or any friendliness at all. She never made eye contact with us and grew our menus on table In a jumbled pile. the waiter approached us the second we sat down asking for our orders and drinks (we didn't even get a chance to open the menu). We got steaks & neither of them were cooked the way we wanted them, but the waiter never came back to check that everything was alright, or if our steaks were cooked right- which most servers in steak joints do....Then at the end of the meal, the promo we ordered was supposed to come with dessert. He dropped off the check without even asking what dessert we wanted & when we asked for the desert to go, we got a dinky piece of crappy cheesecake. Now I know why people don't go to outback. Clean up your act, Outback."}
{"text":"It's not $80 filet mignon and a high-end steak house on the strip.  It is what it is and will do in a pinch. Usually I get the $11.99 special on Wednesdays - 6oz Outback special, side, salad, and dessert.  Not too shabby for 12 bucks.  I can only speak for the curbside take out.  The service is usually prompt, but sometimes they forget extras I've requested like steak sauce or salad dressing. As far as the food, it's standard fare but at least for take out, I would order one temperature grade less than you want.  I usually get medium but often get medium well - maybe carryover cooking in the Styrofoam containers.  Overall, good value for what traditionally is a once-in-a-while kind of meal."}
{"text":"Had an issue with dinner 2 weeks ago.  Owner (mike) invited us back for a second chance.  My wife and i were blown away!  The maple pork chops were sooo tender and delicious and the prime rib sandwhich was as tender and juicy as u could ask for.  Wr also had the peach sangria which really added a nice kick to our meals.  I would definitely reccomend this place and will for sure come back."}
{"text":"We love this outback as it is close to our office. We only go there for lunch but the service is always great. I got the soup and salad and it's great. We order the honey butter with our bread which is the best way to eat it.. The only issue with this location is if you go for dinner there is alway a long wait."}
{"text":"The food we ordered (nothing interesting here, we are watching our weight) was quite delicious and well-prepared: both of us had a 9 oz. Sirloin, broccoli, and some sort of spicy chicken tortilla soup.  Meat was cooked as we ordered, broccoli was tender but not mushy, soup as tasty.  Prices are very reasonable, and modest portions are available, which is nice.  This chain does not prescribe to the \"force them to eat a lot or take home a bunch of food so you can charge them more\" business model, and I appreciate that.  The server did a good job, stayed on top of things, and corrected his one little mistake graciously and quickly.  I reserve 5 stars for restaurants that distinguish themselves with outstanding food, or else this outback would have gotten 5."}
{"text":"We went to the Tempe Outback around 5:30. They were busier than we had anticipated. Only had to wait approx. 15 min. I had the 6 oz. filet and lobster special. The filet was cooked exactly as requested, med. well, and it was excellent. The sweet potato was yummy and the broccoli was cooked to perfection. My husband had the 6 oz. sirloin. He requested medium and he was very happy with it, the sweet potato and the broccoli. It was so good we ate too much. NOTE: please ask before putting a lemon wedge in a glass of water. Thank you for a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I believe this was my worst restaurant experience ever. We arrived at 5:45 on a Saturday. After waiting an hour and a half for a table with two kids we were really hungry. We ordered a bloomin' onion and, it took about 20 minutes for that to arrive. It was the smallest, most pitiful little thing, undercooked and barely breaded. We ate it, and didn't complain. We proceeded to wait another hour for our food. Our waitress was kind but it was obviously out of her hands. When our food arrived, three out of four meals were literally refrigerator cold and the fifth meal (my 6 year olds chicken tenders) just didn't show up. My 5 year old didn't have his fries and my dad had a \"loaded\" baked potato with nothing on it. We got our food back, and then waited another 15 minutes for the chicken tenders. By the time we received them it was 9 pm and my daughter was so tired she had lost her appetite, and we were done with our meals. Not to mention the over cooked liver, I mean steak, and the extremely small salmon that were also laid on our table presented as a \"serving\". After complaining they did take care of our bill. Our poor waitress was doing the best she could but the tables around us were all having similar problems. Save yourself 4 hours and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This was pretty good this time. In a room for kids so nieces could move around.  Server was pleasant and helpful. Only prob was two steaks were too over done but was quickly remedied.  Go there often and will probably go again."}
{"text":"Great service.  The ribs I had were pretty darn good.  They're pour on a Crown on the rocks was full.  The owner was very courteous and friendly.  If you're going to go chain, this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"We've been coming to visit Teri & Nick for a while now before we head out to the movies & now they have James ! Such an attentive team, checking on us non stop and always remembering us! We feel very welcome here and they know how to keep our glasses full!!!"}
{"text":"We went for my wife's birthday, despite the negative reviews.  Service was prompt and knowledgeable...Dana was simply great.  The filet-lobster combo was delicious, the steak medium rare and the wood fired lobster succulent.  Get the picture?  We really had an excellent experience.  My only complaint involved being told to mention my wife's birthday to our server and they would give her a gift sundae.  I did and they didn't.  My wife didn't care, she was full...but I would have enjoyed it.  Oh well."}
{"text":"On Tuesday July 10, 2012 my family and I dined here.  We arrived around 5:30 p.m. and we were seated right away.  The restaurant was not busy yet.  I know that when it gets busy, people can eat at the bar.  I have done this and I have found the service excellent and the bartenders attentive.  However, this particular night, we were seated in a nice, clean booth.  Our waitress, named Candy, was clearly experienced and attentive.  Our drinks came within a reasonable amount of time and we were also served a nice loaf of dark bread.  Among the three of us we ordered, salmon with vegetables, a steak, and a burger.  We asked for the steak to be cooked medium and the burger to be cooked well.  We also asked for no cheese on the burger.  All of these came in a reasonable amount of time and done correctly.  The fries with the burger were a touch soft yet warm but I have come to not expect amazing fries from this place.  That is not their specialty.  I noticed that the manager and all of the waitresses constantly checked on all of the tables around us and everyone was taken care of well, it seemed.  We can say that this has been another pleasant, enjoyable, and relaxing meal that we have eaten here.  We are planning on returning soon."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a delicious slab of prime rib last night and packed up the family. We headed to Outback as per a recommendation. Although our server David was outstanding, the food quality was way below standard. Even the Army can serve up a melt in your mouth prime rib. The prime rib that I was served was very tough to cut and hard to chew. Our kids ribs were dry and cold have been package and sold as BBQ jerky. Unless you are wanting a good jaw workout, you should dine elsewhere.   They are getting one star because you have to select it in order to submit."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great food- Service was excellent. Super quick, and fun people- despite seeming solidly busy.   Brett, our server, was awesome- couldn't be friendlier. Also Abby (the manager I believe) was above and beyond. Super easy going, definitely made it a great experience.  Will definitely be going back. This location has it together!"}
{"text":"Always been a fan of outback. They have a great happy hour. Tried the strawberry peach sangria for $4. It was very refreshing and nice to sip on while we waited for a table outside. We started off with the aussie fries and the bloomin bites. Great like always. Daughter ordered the chicken fingers and broccoli from the kids menu. I preferred that over the maple mustard pork chops I ordered. Kind of dry and the maple sauce wasn't as expected at all. We also ordered the double burger. That was alright. The fries were way too salty. Aside from the food, Cody our server was amazing. We came during a busy time and he was still great."}
{"text":"The food quality of the steak at this location is below that other Outback Restaurants. The meat occasionally taste spoiled here. When I spend $50 at Outback I want my meal to be worth eating. I don't want to complain when I eat here so best not to eat at this location."}
{"text":"I'd never eaten at a Outback before, but I was in Vegas on a budget, and was very pleasantly surprised.  In fact, a little later on in my stay I pushed the boat out and ate at a more expensive alternative at one of the casinos - and it wasn't as good. Friendly service, a decent steak, and a price that won't make you sweat. When I'm back in town, I'm sure I'll go again."}
{"text":"6 of us went here tonight for dinner. For my birthday. The waitress was one of the worst,  I have ever encountered. We ordered drinks to start. 25 minutes for the drinks. She had an excuse for everything, but had a true \"I don't give a crap attitude\" We ordered appetizers, the waitress screwed up and didn't put them all in and we didn't get all the apps we ordered. Then we received some of our soup and salad,  most of them wrong. Literally less than a minute after soup and salad came,  even though wrong, our meals came. Several of them also wrong. And/or over cooked. So all of our meals got cold because they were delivered immediately upon receiving our wrong soups and salads. The manager was at our table 3 times because we could never find our waitress. Asking the manager 3 times and other servers multiple times for something as simple as EXTRA NAPKINS, took 7 seperate requests. Each order of a drink after the first order took no less than 15-20 minutes. And the experience just got worse and worse. Literally everything this place could have screwed up, they did and the manager seem so spaced out and lost in general, each time she came over. Not to mention shrimp tails and food all over the floor is a major slip fall risk and such an unsafe environment for children or people of any age. We spent a lot of money on dinner tonight and left utterly and completely disgusted with the entire experience and lack of care for the customer. We are not picky people in any way. We are as easy going as people can be. I wasn't going to mention this, but since the entire experience was so absolutely horrible, shortly after being seated, a waitress was cleaning a table and sprayed me 4 times in the face and once in the arm with the table cleaning solution. We laughed that off. But the horrible experience after that, was not anything that could be laughed off. We will never return to this restaurant again. None of the 6 of us will. We all completely agreed on that and the only reason I gave this place 1 star is because I had no choice. You have to give atleast one. Do not go here. It was one of the worst experiences at a restaurant I have ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to visit Outback restaurant just North of Ray near I 10. We ordered a nice meal. While we were waiting a family with 2 young children  (3 and maybe 6 years old) were running around, climbing under a booth, laughing loudly, chasing each other.  After 10 minutes or so, our meal arrived. The children were still playing. They had turned it up a notch now.  This became very distracting to my attempt to have a relaxing meal.  I was hoping that the Manager would ask the adults to get the little ones under control.  I asked a passing waitress to please have the Manager to ask that the children settle down.  Finally after a few more minutes of the more ramped up play I could not relax or tolerate the McDonald's playroom behavior anymore,  so I  got up from my meal and respectively asked the parents of the children to get them under control because it was very distracting to my supper. They responded quickly and quietly.  About 2 minutes later their food was delivered to their table.  Afterwards the manager came over to my table and asked if everything was okay. I  told him no, and explained the disruption to him. His response was worth the rating I'm giving.  His response was first my wife and I could move to a different part area in the restaurant. Then explained that he was waiting for their meal to arrive, which would prompt the parents to get the toddlers under control.   I guess no one else's dinner or comfort mattered."}
{"text":"Tony.Tonya,Jennifer,Tacos all great bartenders and great customer service. Keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome service from the entrance reception to Max the waiter he was attentive, friendly, and nows his stuff, he was also helpful in helping me choose my lunch and never forgot to come by to check if I needed refills for my soda or anything else. I looked around and he was nice to everyone I specially liked that he was very nice to an elderly couple next to my booth. The food was nothing to cry about the stake was just perfect specially since I have found out how hard is to have medium/rare since they either come out medium to well done, definitely not what I asked for, even the baked potato and vegetables were good as they were not under cooked or over cooked. Overall from the service to the food it was excellent I even got a soda refill to go. And they now serve lunch at 11am, hurray!!"}
{"text":"The worst curbside takeout and service I've ever experience.  1.  The amount of time to get service was completely unacceptable.  2. The order was incorrect. We were missing an entire entree.  3. The hamburgers were still bleeding. My husband was afraid to eat it in the fear of getting sick.  When I called the manager was unprofessional and would not credit the amount back for the missed entree. My only option was a gift certificate"}
{"text":"We had the greatest experience tonight with Justin, our waiter, and Trevor, the manager... my husband and I came in for the tomahawk steak we had gotten the week before and thought it was the best steak we'd ever had so we were back for more. This time the $51 steak came out so rare it was purple! We sent it back to get it the medium we ordered and when it came back it was burnt and super well done. We felt bad but sent back for a new one (which we've never done, but at $50+ we wanted to be happy). They gave us new sides each time, were incredibly patient and apologetic.... just the best experience with a steak issue. We always have great experiences but this was over the top."}
{"text":"I remember outback being much better overall.    Porterhouse had WAY too much salty seasoning on it.     I ordered the side salad and there was hardly any dressing on it.  Seemed like a teaspoons worth.  My husband even asked where the dressing was when they brought it to me lol. He was being serious.    Fries were not the best fries I have had.  Not even mediocre.    And the breaded shrimp I ordered was disappointing.   Small and Soggy.    They don't even serve tarter sauce.     Server went to take plate away from one of us that appeared to still be eating ( there was food still on the plate ) without asking if we were done.   Felt rush at the end.    I was really looking forward to our dinner.  And left disappointed for the first time from an outback.  I haven't eaten at one in a long time and may not for a long while."}
{"text":"Once again thank you for ruining our dinner meal and getting our very simple order messed up as you have frequently done in the past."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we last visited an Outback Steakhouse.  Have to say it was pretty good.  We pretty much ordered steaks and the grilled salmon. Our sides were fries, veggies, and house Mac & cheese.  A side of hot wings as well. All was really good the only thing was that two of the three steaks we ordered were cooked medium when we asked for medium well.  Thought the cost was a bit high.  But overall it was good."}
{"text":"Normally, I would say the Outback is a great place. Today however I have to say don't get Curbside Takeaway. I think they gave us the food that couldn't be served in the restaurant. For appetizers, our blooming onion is cooked to the point of being black and hard. Our Outback fries are hard as rocks. Our macaroni and cheese bites are charred to black.   When I called the restaurant to let them know, I was transferred several times and told over and over that they do not send out burned food. I did finally speak with someone who was able to refund the appetizers.   I realize that when you get takeout you should always check your order, but I thought as this is one of the better chains, I would be okay with what they gave me because it would be good food. Sadly, I was wrong. Buyer beware and check your order before you drive away!!!"}
{"text":"Good old outback you can always count on a good steak or great shrimp and I enjoy the clam chowder when they have it. My favorite is the prime rib with the dill horseradish sauce it's way good."}

{"text":"DON'T GO to the Concord Mills Outback unless you're ok with them saying they will seat u in 30 mins and it takes them 1 hour and thirty mins  DON'T GO unless u keep checking with the host because one family was bumped off the \"iPad\" waiting list with no known explanation just an oops sorry so DONT GO UNLESS U PAY ATTENTION  to know who should've been seated AFTER U  DON'T GO Unless u are ok with valet parking $9 versus circling the few parking spaces available to the three restaurants in the same SMALL SPACE BONE FISH GRILL, Outback and chipotle RIDICULOUS  DON'T GO unless u just are shopping in the area  I won't be back for this experience.   This location is just a ridiculous idea.   After my sister and I waited for the hour and thirty mins, and I begin to read the reviews and the people kept filling in ... I didn't believe in the Outback brand anymore for THIS LOCATION so we wasted $9 valet just to go to a better OUTBACK. We recommend you do what we did and go to the Chancellor Drive location--the WAIT WAS 10 mins and Mac bites, volcano shrimp, lobster and steak was Perfect... Concord sucks PERIOD"}
{"text":"The steaks are on point at this location. However the personnel who run the front is completely clueless.  I call at 605. Speak to Eric. He takes my reservation.... 2 for a TABLE BOOTH at 630. He lets me know there may be a wait. No problem. It's a Friday night I fully understand. We arrive 620, check in, told they'll text us when table is ready. They call us about 15 minutes later. We walk over and it's a booth. Seriously?  My husband likes booth side and I have to sit in a chair. Not a slide in seat. I tell them that I had called and spoke to Eric and explained what we needed. The young lady with red longer hair and glasses with a tattoo on her neck or behind her ear says that it isn't showing up that he wrote table booth. So I call back and get Eric. He walks up and speaks to them and then walks off. I approached the THREE ladies at the desk who tells me another 20-30 minutes. I don't mind the wait. But I expect the staff to know what's going on. I call the gm \"chris\" after we left and explain what happened. Maybe it's a break down in technology he said.., it's frustrating cause I drive past the outback closest to my home because they are great cooks here. Sadly I may venture to a diff steak joint."}
{"text":"Service was fast for during the dinner rush. Steaks and ribs were delicious and cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"We don't eat red meat, but the chicken quesadilla and the wings were good. Not very spicy, though. Go during happy hour for $4 blackberry sangria at the bar. They were awesome! There was a misunderstanding with the pricing of an item and our bartenders (Kristen and Wendy) had the manager take care of it right away and didn't even make us feel uncomfortable about it. I'm pretty sure we misunderstood them... Never the less, great customer service!"}
{"text":"Today I went to outback for the first time and was greeted by a hostess that was so helpful and attentive. I was then seated and greeted immediately by Deja. She went through the menu with me since it was my first time and was so helpful. I decided to order their grass fed burger with a sweet potato. When the food came out I was pleasantly surprised after the first bite that they cooked it perfectly to a medium rare temperature. In the middle of the meal their manager Joey asked how everything was. All in all my experience at outback steakhouse was phenomenal. I will definitely come back. I highly recommend going to this specific location because their staff is so attentive, polite, as well as very welcoming; something that I do not see as much in restaurants."}
{"text":"We had 10 people at the Outback on McMurray Road for a birthday celebration and the service was fantastic! Jared was our server and Tim visited with us throughout the evening. We had one steak that went back because it wasn't cooked properly and they removed that meal from our bill. They brought out two appetizers for us at no cost to help us celebrate. Jared even helped us cut the cake and served that for us. I couldn't recommend them more. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Outback contacted me about this complaint and made it right to our satisfaction."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is always consistent so we don't worry about a bad meal. Have not had the same experience at all Outbacks, so this one is exceptional.  Gotta love that Blooming Onion!"}
{"text":"Ahh what a relief. I hadn't been to an Outback Steakhouse in YEARS! Not sure exactly what kept me away... but after my experience here I know what will keep me coming back! Greeted extremely politely and promptly - as well as seated. I was seated in Haley's section and she was great in recommending some Mac n Cheese bites ( which were great ) as an appetizer. I took the Prime Rib which was cooked to perfection. The manager Joey even came to the table and chatted for a bit. I definitely felt welcome and would recommend the dining experience to anyone looking to enjoy some solid food, drinks, and an atmosphere hard to find at most places.. thank you!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Outback in years and was looking forward to a good steak. Unfortunately, my medium rib eye was cooked well done. My mash potatoes were warm and the sautéed mushrooms tasted as if they came out of a can. I don't like to complain and have my food redone but had to do it this time. The steak and mashed potatoes were good when they came back. I told them to not bother replacing the mushrooms. The service was OK and overbearing at times. We had two waiters. The first one kept interrupting to make small talk and was a bit pushy. At one point she sat down next to my friend to take the order. That was strange!  Then it switched to another waiter who rushed me to finish talking when I explained about my steak. I guess he didn't want to her it."}
{"text":"Ummm isn't this supposed to be a good steak place?  I order this steak that was apparently \"premium\" and I tried to cut into it with the streak knife provided, and even it couldn't cut into it, thats how tough it was.  My fiancé got pork and that was over cooked as well.  Luckily were have dogs that enjoyed it, but how disappointing and a waste of money."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for my husbands birthday and was not impressed. The portions were small and overly priced. I remember going a few years ago and it was great.    Service was okay but I'll give them credit that it was late and they prob were winding down to get and ready to clean up and go home.  Cannot say we will return."}
{"text":"Our exercise group loves to go to this restaurant. They always make us feel welcome and give us excellent service.  Good food!  Good service!   Good people!"}
{"text":"Our exercise group loves to go to this restaurant. They always make us feel welcome and give us excellent service.  When we do our special monthly birthday celebrations we go to Outback. Good food!  Good service!   Good people!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of confused why this place doesn't have higher ratings, but I had a really good experience when I ate here.  I ordered the T-bone steak and it was cooked SO WELL.  The flavor was really good, and it was cooked to a nice medium rare (a lot of times if I order medium rare it's hit or miss - it either is too rare or it's medium/well done).  I also had the sweet potato side which was great.  The sweet potato was nice and soft and naturally sweet.  The butter and cinnamon were a nice touch.  Overall I thought the food was great."}
{"text":"This Is The Perfect Dinner Date Place. Martinis, Bloomin' Onions & Steak Dinner! I Think So..."}
{"text":"We were seated next to the kitchen even though we arrived at 5pm and the restaurant  was not busy.  Our appetizer blooming petals looked like they scraped some pieces  from the fryer and threw it on a plate.  Greasy and unappealing  expensive cut rib eye and filet were tough.  An obnoxious  sound was coming from the kitchen that made conversation impossible.   I asked twice if the noise could be stopped.  Maybe said the waitress.  After an hour of not very good food in a even worse environment we left.  I spoke with the manager who said the noise is the ice machine and they need ice to run a restaurant and  cannot turn it off.  They did not seem to concerned about our disappointing experience. I asked why sit people by the kitchen ?   Because they want butts in their seats even if they are unhappy  butts.  We won't be back"}
{"text":"Lousy service. Got seated in a booth with 2 kids and got attitude when we asked to sit at a table. Our food order took a long time to come despite only maybe 5 tables. Order was not right, ordered steak tacos no cheese. When told server he argued. Failed to ask about beverages. Asked for kids drinks and server argued again. Food was mediocre at best. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I went for their No Worry Wednesday deal, which was quite good.   They were not very busy and I was able to be sat immediately when I arrived.  The restaurant seemed to be a little dark, but was clean and open.   I got the prime rib and lobster tail.   The prime rib was cooked fine, but it was a little more tough than I would have liked it to be, especially the outside with the seasoning.  There was not much flavor to the prime rib.   The lobster tail was great and my salad and dessert were very delicious.  I highly recommend upgrading the salad to the wedge salad.  It was fantastic.  I don't like bleu cheese so they did it with ranch.  My server was superb.  She checked on me multiple times and gave me great suggestions.   I will likely go back."}
{"text":"Nice steak, very fresh. Worth going. I know little about steak, so we ordered 3 most expensive steaks with two sidedishes each. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"This 5 star only goes to the manager her name is Tracy. The restaurant would fall apart without her. I have a long story. But she saved the situation. Thank you Tracy."}
{"text":"The food was good, which is why it got any stars. The service was horrible. Was really disappointed when we went there this evening. I don't like to complain but our waitress seemed to not have working on her mind. I felt bad for leaving 1 star only so gave 3. The steak was awesome and I really enjoyed the baked potato and salad. Great job cooks! Waitress staff really needs some help and motivation. Not what I want to deal with on vacation."}
{"text":"Was there just last week with my husband. The staff was very friendly & speedy with our orders & drink refills. Our waiter was also great (sadly, I don't remember his name). I will reccomend this place to our friends & family."}
{"text":"The place is only 2 weeks old and is located right next to the Coke bottle in the Showcase Mall. Michelle was our waiter and gave great service. I was a little bummed that their menu didn't have my usual (Toowoomba Pasta), so I settled for their No Rules Pasta with shrimp and scallops, which was good. My friend had the ribs, which were really tender. I could've downed their sangria in seconds, and their Chocolate Chocolate Tower is delicious, not to mention rich (which is okay because I LOVE chocolate). Hopefully they'll add more items to their menu in the future. For a new location, it's quite promising of a good time."}
{"text":"Probably the absolute worst Outback experience I've ever had.  Empty  restaurant,  15 minute wait.  Drink order took another 15 minutes and we had to ask our waitress to find out where our drinks were. Ordered the special that comes with only,  steak,  fries and a drink... and they forgot the fries... how do you allow a special to leave the kitchen with out fries??? Salad came with the wrong dressing. Horrible experience and I'll never go back to that restaurant.  Everyone should stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"Outback Steakhouse has always been one of our best choices for dinner.  Tonight we used the online check in, which worked very well. We were seated right away. Our waiter, Bryan O was awesome, he greater us right away and was quick with our order. I have noticed through the past few visits that the portions of the meals seem to decline. Tonight I ordered the Full Rack of ribs. It was served and was only 3/4. Though the price has stayed the same... I have also noticed the same with the Salmon.  Overall our experience was great, but it seems like we are paying more for less."}
{"text":"I was searching for gluten-free food on the strip.  I got out of a concert at 11, and restaurants were closing.  I finally arrived at Outback at 12:30.  Despite being very close to closing time, the servers were very kind and accommodating.  Outback has some great food, but the service at this location puts it miles above the rest."}
{"text":"I love Outback we have eaten at them all over the country. But this restaurant I have a hard time getting clean tables. There is always food on the tables, booths and the floor where we sit. You have to clean the table yourself and watch where you put your feet. I have mentioned the conditions to the management. They always say, \" Gee thats never happened before\""}
{"text":"I have been to many but this one is the worse. Took forever to get our order. Then everone got their food and my kid had to wait 45 mins for her kids meal. Our food was cold but we waited so long we did not send it back. My vegetables were raw with a funny taste like if they boiled them together with fish. Horrible. We never got our desserts and they were charged. Will never be at Outback again."}
{"text":"Not the standard menu, it was called the \"international menu\" good food, great service."}
{"text":"We had the best service and meal last night. I love prime rib and wasn't sure if it was still being offered. Our waiter Christian C. was phenomenal. He quickly brought our drinks, water and bread and went to check. He was very attentive to our needs and the service was great. My prime ribs were available and were off the chain scrumptious . Hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"The good, the bad & the ugly......  Good:  Sirloin was good, nicely cooked as ordered. Excellent fluffy baked tater. Good house salad.   Not so good: Beef Kabob had weird sweet flavor and was very chewy. Canned corn. Chili flavorless. Bread ok didn't like cinnamon butter.   Bad:  Dirty silverware - twice! (what is up with their dirty silverware!). Server was hyper (exactly like the obnoxious waiter from the movie \"Office Space\"). Constantly checking in at least 10x Very irritating.   Overall:  Not great but sufficed. There are much better steakhouses out there."}
{"text":"I would give the food only 1 STAR, but our server was excellent, so I've given 2 stars.  Pros: -friendly, fast service  Cons: -salty, salty, SALTY. EVERYTHING was too salty. our entire table agreed. -stuffed mushrooms were clearly frozen -really scrawny-looking steaks -house salad appeared and tasted like it was straight from a bag  I would not go back here."}
{"text":"We love outback!! We come here every week:) Nate was our server, He was awesome and attentive. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"Visiting LAS on 9/5-9/7 2017 Met my wife's family at this Outback location. Topic of conversation this night 9/6, Hurricane Irma. Her aunt and uncle were flying back to TPA 9/7. I'm writing this review on 9/12. All is well with her family as of this writing. Ok, so it was a Wednesday night at the Outback. Ordered the 6oz sirloin w/sweet potato for $10.99, also came with a 8oz (wow) beer. Then I saw an ad for a lobster tail@$9.99 Damn it! Had to have it! The steak tasted great and sweet potato never disappoints. Lobster - NO BUENO!  Presentation was nice but then I took the meat off the shell and . . . Well, look at the pic I took. Size of a crawfish tail, well maybe an inch bigger. I was able to cut it in 3 pieces. Ate TEN DOLLARS in less than 5 minutes. Come to think of it, I loss the same amount in 5 minutes gambling too. If ever I return, it'll just be to meet others that wanted to eat here. Not my 1st choice."}
{"text":"The 4 course was a great value and the food and service were outstanding. Great visit after a long day"}
{"text":"Love the food at Outback but not a big fan of some of the appetizers. We usually hit this Outback about once a month for a good lunch because the service is great, the food has yet to disappoint and we never have to wait for anything. Outside of dinner after 7 pm here you can get in and out fairly quickly and feel that you got what if not more than you paid for."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the blue cheese chop salad. I ate there twice this week and sat at the bar seating both times and each time service was very good."}
{"text":"A well meaning family member kept giving us gift cards to Outback so after a few years we diplomatically explained we don't enjoy Outback. For a few years we were off the hook but much to our surprise this past Christmas they gifted us a $50 gift card to Outback... We decided to use the gift card tonight. I feel like Outback needs to pay us $50 for eating there. Tonight the service was so incredibly slow. A large group came in from the hotel across the parking lot and it must have thrown them off. I'd have thought the manager would have stepped in to assist, but no. They actually took our (good?) waitress away to help with the large group and gave us a new (so so?) waiter. My husband's Alice Spring Chicken didn't come with the special sauce. It took a good 10 minutes for the waiter to bring it out. Refills took forever and it felt like an eternity for the waiter to come by at the end so we could ask for a doggy bag and our check. I'm crossing my fingers we've received our last Outback gift card!"}
{"text":"We went right at 11 am , NO wait, our server was AMAZING, EVEN AFTER MY MILLIONS QUESTIONS.  I am a vegan and she was VERY hehelpfuAnd made some good sugestionsi. Joe the owner even came by. Had a great lunch with my daughter. Thanx"}
{"text":"Went to have a nice dinner out and thought the Outback was the answer.  Not so much. Our waiter Dalton T was less than helpful.  He took the order just fine but I guess I was stumped by the continuous question of whether we wanted our water refilled.  Especially considering we were only still eating the appetizer.  We sat for a lot of the time with nothing to drink. For some reason the used appetizer dishes needed to stay on the table for the entire meal. Overall very poor service.  We will probably go somewhere else from here on out."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Badgers game. #Sweet16  We started with a round of drinks, Long Island Ice Teas ($6) and a 22 oz Blue Moon ($6.50). The LIIT were really good, the first few sips were sour but once mixed and balanced with the ice, it was great.  We all ordered the Outback Sirloin, they were having a special for $12.97 for a 12 oz.  Bread was brought out, the appearance is that of the Honey Wheat bread from Cheesecake Factory, alas the ones at Outback are slightly more dry and not as doughy as the counterpart.  We ordered a Volcano Shrimp appetizer ($12.95) to split. They well small sized shrimp (probably 51/60), battered and fried and covered in a buffalo-sweet chili like sauce. These were really good, the abtter stayed on the shrimp, remained crispy even though it was thoroughly coated in sauce.    I liked how you can choose from salads and soups as your side for no additional charge. Well I should say, some sides (French Onion Soup - which I don't understand - isn't that just beef broth? and Blue Cheese Pecan Salad) were $1 extra, only $1 more! Great deal. I opted for the house salad and chicken tortilla soup. The house salad is your mundane ice berg, with few cherry tomatoes, red onions, and croutons. The soup came in probably (eyeballing) a 5\" ramekin, it had strips of tortilla and cheese on top, and it even had some real strips of chicken in it!  The sirloin arrived shortly after, cooked perfectly to medium well, just like I requested. There were no gristle throughout the meat, and the only sliver of fat were on the outside, which was easily removed by using a fork.  We were all happy with our meal, for the price we paid we felt the steak was of decent quality and well prepared.   Service was okay, it was a busy night so understandably service was a bit spotty. People in our parties didn't receive their sides with their order, water glasses were not offered when the drinks were dropped off, and later when we requested it, it was not refilled.  Lookout for coupons for free Bloomin' Onions and %-off discounts when you sign up for their email list."}
{"text":"I am tired of spending 300 bucks at Morton's and Capital Grille for a steak.  This place is great.  My fiancé and I  had 2 appetizers, 2 drinks each and each got a big ole steak and potato dish.  Total bill 70 bucks.  I gave the girl a 20 dollar tip because she was great.  She almost passed out because people in the greater Charlotte Market are cheap and do not tip properly.  BUT I DO."}
{"text":"If I could give this less than 1 star I would. Service was terrible. They were out of a bunch of different foods. How do you run out of rice?! The waiter couldn't care less. Dirty silverware. Total lack of caring by any of the employees. Took forever to get bread. Didn't get our drink order right...4 waters. Really? Avoid this place. Worst dining experience I've had in Madison..."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this location for for first time. I was greeted warmly by the host .. We sat in the bar area thinking we'd get faster service , but it was the same .. I felt our server just gave us enough time to enjoy our meal from our appetizer to our dessert ... My boyfriend felt he wasn't attentive.. Our food was delish! So on point havent had this great of a salad in while .."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food.  We went in late,  but the food not one but 2 of them came to the table below room temperature and we had to send it back to get it reheated.  Very bad experience.  Don't ever try their chop steak - one of the worst food I have ever eaten in an resturant."}
{"text":"Treated my family of eight to dinner as we had two birthdays to celebrate, ordered steak & all you can eat shrimp. Steaks were done as ordered and shrimp was delicious, server was Kara M. she was outstanding with drinks filled without asking. Can't understand some negative reports as everything was perfect."}
{"text":"I love steak.  My family and I go to Outback frequently, and most often we go to this location.  The food is great, it's affordable, and it's close to my house.  Unfortunately I can't remember her name, but there is one waitress who has happened to have our table several times.  The second time was months after the first, and yet she remembered us...down to our individual orders!  The manager Amanda was very helpful the one time we had a small problem (the salmon was a little underdone in the center) and went out of her way to take care of us.  There are a couple of other servers who haven't left an impression one way or the other, but I have had no negative experiences.  I have no doubt we'll continue to choose this location when my parents are in town!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at an outback. The service was amazing. The good was so delicious, they did forget our potatoes but they brought them out right away."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a really good prime steak, I let you in on a little secret.  This Outback offers them at a very reasonable price.  For $39.95, I had a delicious New York Strip done to perfection.  Mind you, if you went to 9ine at the Palms, you'd probably  be paying about $95 for the same thing.  This is one of the only Outbacks that I know of that offers prime meat in addition to their regular fare.  The sides were good; the Caesar salad dressing was a might to salty for my taste, but other than that, dinner was great.  Hats of to my server Lex.    This place can be hard to find.  It's next to the M&M Store.  Just take the elevator to the 4th floor.  A window seat is a plus if you want to see the hotels and the Strip."}
{"text":"Matt & Lorenzo are the greatest bar tenders at this location. They will take care of you and keep you company throughout your stay at Outback."}
{"text":"We had my daughter's wedding reception there on a busy Friday night, on a holiday weekend 11-25-16. I called in advance to make reservations for 25 people. When we arrived a few minutes early, the staff immediately started setting up our table and we only had to wait about 15 minutes before being seated. The food was great, the service was fantastic  (Sam and another person-girl),  and the manager and staff were all very friendly and helpful. We brought in our own bottles of champagne and they were very helpful when it  came time to serve it (small cork fee). Thank you Outback for making this special night so pleasant and enjoyable."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Outback on a Wednesday evening so you know they were not that busy we were greeted by the hostess (very friendly and nice)...unfortunately went down hill from there....  when the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink it was 5 waters and an ice tea- he was literally annoyed that we were not ordering drinks....  took our order and 3 of the 5 meals were wrong...ok they got two meals right...and when they had to bring my salad out twice because they do not know what seared means for tuna- first time it was raw and it was obvious it was not seared- the second time it was butchered over well done...the manager came up...apologized and said we're not going to charge you for this (really- like I would pay for it anyway).  Never offered to fix me something else but did offer dessert.....  With so many choices out there I'm really surprised this quality of service and food preparation continues...  it will be the last time I set foot into this Outback Steakhouse again along with the 5 other people that were with me...  very bad service, food and the oh well attitude was noticed.  Charlestons and Carrabbas is in the same complex...  hello C's"}
{"text":"Food was good once it arrived. Service was poor. Thought it was the waitress's  1st night but she said she has been doing it several years. Messed up the drink order & took 3 requests to get bread. When the manager came by to ask \"how was everything\" we told her, but she had no response, seems like she heard it before. At least we didn't have to wait for the check since they now have the electronic devices on the table to process your card, more inpersonable action by the company."}
{"text":"THE WORST.  I have eaten here twice, 10 years apart and both times were terrible.  I've never had such dry, tough, tasteless steak. I could only eat half of my steak this time.  There are so many good places to eat in Vegas, and this isn't one of them.  DON'T GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Always good food, but was very annoyed last time I went in.  I sat at the bar area and my service was not as usual.  The waitress took for ever to bring my change!  Very frustrating!  I has to find her just so I could go back to work."}
{"text":"Best time to come is during 1100 to 1200..fast service and fresh meals.  Personally I believe they have one of the best milk shakes ever....great lun check meals for me and my children to eat good and good prices"}
{"text":"Horrible service and found hair in the food and silver wear dirty. And the employees are just plain down rude I would not recommend going to this location ever because I know I will never come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. Want to give a shout out to our server Tina today. She was nothing short of wonderful! She was prompt and friendly, our food took no time at all and was hot and delicious! We will be back soon!! Thank you Outback!"}
{"text":"Came here last night. Victoria was our server! She was amazing!! My 9 year old son chose this place for his birthday this year because they have better food and service than Longhorn (up the road). We had a party of 12 on the patio, Victoria was on it, made our night sooo special. Thank you so much to your team for all coming out and singing Happy Birthday to my son! Well done! Keep up the good work!! See you very soon!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a Saturday afternoon. It was quiet and we chose our seats. The Alice Springs Chicken is consistently good and my husband's steak was also cooked properly. Our waiter was Denzel who provided exceptional service. We asked that out salads be boxed for taking home rather than served and that butter / sauces be served on the side. He accommodated us graciously and got everything exactly as ordered."}
{"text":"I have been to this Outback many times, since it has opened. The food and customer service has always been five stars....until Friday, March 25, 2016. My grandson and I got there at 6:30, and had reservations for that time. As usual, we had to wait about 15 minutes, but we have come to expect that, and are fine with it. Our buzzer lit up, and we went to the front podium. As we were standing there, the young lady behind it, said \"She (pointing to a young lady) will take you to your table.\" \"She\" was already standing at the table with the menus. Now, usually, the hostess, will smile at us, and say \"Right this way\" or something to that effect. When we went on to the table, she said nothing, not even a smile. She put the menus down, and left. Now I understand we all have bad days, and perhaps, she was upset about something, but I am old school, and when you have a job, you leave your troubles at home, and go to work with a smile, and a mindset to do a good job. On the other side of the coin, we had a great server. I didn't get his name, but he had an accent. Very positive attitude, very attentive, etc. I realize the hostess thing is trivial to some, but when this old lady goes to spend her money somewhere, she expects good customer service at the very least."}
{"text":"Our favorite Outback. We come here about 4 to 6 times a year. Food tastes great. Bloomin onion tastes really great. I wouldn't send someone here for the nutritional content though.... once in a while treat for naughty great tasting food. Wait staff always working hard to please and succeeding. Good parking and access. Comparatively short time to be seated."}
{"text":"Walked into this Outback a few minutes ago. Parking lot had about 6 cars, empty tables galore inside. Hostess asked for our name and then seated the couple ahead of us. She came back and began sorting menus. We were the only customers in the vestibule. She made no move to seat us. We looked at each other and said to her, what about us?\"  She said it would be a few minutes. She babbled a few more words which I paid no attention to because I was frankly dumbfounded at the terrible service. We left very disappointed because my wife was really looking forward to it the lobster. The hostess made no attempt to correct the situation. This is the worst Outback we've been to. Never again, our money will go to a restaurant that values customers. I intend to badmouth this place like crazy."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in tonight. We asked to be reseated to another booth so we could have more room for our 7 month old. The next thing we know, the \"hostess\" a 6'3\" 65 year old Yak named \"Tracy\" was mean mugging both my wife and I.  We wrote it off like maybe she was having a bad day...however, each time this beast walked past our table she would give us a nasty death scowl as though we had intruded upon her territory and had challenged her to a dual. I hardly ever write yelp reviews however this encounter with Tracy the Outback Beast had to be accounted for.   Note- The waiter Jeff was awesome and was very accommodating."}
{"text":"I needed MEAT so hubby & I choose Outback on short notice. About 7pm on a Wednesday night. No wait for a table. Waitress/Emily was very attentive and helpful with suggestions. I had a featured Cosmo and hubby had a cute little strawberry shake. We both choose the three course steak special with salad and dessert. All the food came out in a timely manner and was tasty. I took most of the meat home to have room for all the rest."}
{"text":"We frequent this specific Outback because the food and service is top notch. The owner took really good care of us! My favorite dishes are the grilled shrimp, burgers, and steak."}
{"text":"Food was great, steak cooked perfect!  ive been to so many steak places that get it wrong!! The service was fast, friendly, and efficient! The price was average for steak place. The lobster tail add on could have been bigger. But no big complaints, will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is the nicest Outback i have ever been to. We came in for a late lunch. I cannot remember our servers name but, he was great.  Wine is only 2.95 a glass all the time and it is fantastic!                                  My friend and i got the soup and salad (all you can eat) and it was only 5.99. There are a few different salads to choose from and a few different soups. Really good on all levels.       Had no idea how cool this place was, decorated very nicely and the bathrooms were nice and clean as well. We actually cannot wait to go back there. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with family, food seems to be always good at this location never had a problem with it. The reason for the 4/5 stars was for the horrible service I was seated at 0430 and had to get up to ask the hostess if someone could take our drink order finally at 0453. Then we kept having to ask other servers to refill our drinks, our servers name was nick. The restraint wasn't even that busy at the time, there were several empty tables. Hopefully  the service improves here or we won't e coming back. The servers name was nick FYI."}
{"text":"I have eaten in Outbacks, literally, all over the United States.  Unfortunately, this one is closest to my home and I had a one star meal yesterday 07/25/14.  Let me say, that I usually go here with a crowd. Yesterday, I had lunch, just me, after a business meeting...I took myself out. Was starving, in a great mood, and wanted Steak and Lobster.   I sat in a bar booth. My waiter was an older woman with short white hair who tried to rush me, was prickly and EXTREMELY unfriendly and in a big rush. I was her only table and she was walking away while she asked what do I want to drink. She never brought my water  She threw my salad in the bowl to serve it to me. Everyone else (in other sections with different wait staff)  received normal looking salads, but whatever. I asked for dressing on the side..and it came on top.  The AWFUL waitress surely was responsible.   It took 1/2 hour to get my meal after I noticed waiting after I just pecked at that boring salad. Then a table of three men came in and she was sweet to them, friendly and said \"thank you\" Worst wait staff experience. I only left a tip because I know bus people need it. too.   So the FOOD was only acceptable and NOT normal yummy-like Outback.  The steak was cooked properly, but tough and nowhere NEAR the flavorful steaks this chain really puts out.  The very small  lobster tail (I ordered steamed) was about  30 seconds under-cooked, but I ate it and it was tasty.  I had asked my waiter for my potato dressings on the side, but alas it was on top already, again what would she care?  So all this for my \"atta-girl-treat yourself  special lunch for $35. Previously,about 3 months ago I was there and  they had to re-fire my steak TWICE to get it to medium-rare.  However, the staff has always been -except for this little lunch of mine--usually very nice.  I mean why else would I stop in if I wasn't usually comfy there.  After the last few meals, just in the \"meh-had better\" range, considering the price, and now the hiring of a nasty white haired witch server?    I'm done with this location.  Finding another go-to steak house immediately."}
{"text":"Pretty new to reviewing. Had a terrible experience here. The kitchen was blasting music, the whole restaurant could hear it. Ordered a Medium Well steak, and it came back medium rare. Kindly asked for it to cook a little longer and it came back burnt. Will not return unfortunately."}
{"text":"Got there at 7:30pm the dining room was not full however it took over 30 min to get a seat. Once seated I counted over 10 tables open on the side we was seated. Took another 20 min to take our order. This was the worst I have seen. When I asked why such an open area with no people was told. No servers. Most of the staff didn't seem rushed worked normal pace. Finally saw a manager but he never came to ask how was everything than as we left the manager was at the front joking with the hostess and a waiter the waiter said very loudly to the manager twice \" that's my sister don't say that to her\"   The only up side was waitress was nice food was only ok just didn't seem like anyone working really wanted to be there."}
{"text":"The first time I came to eat at OS , I tried the Onion Blossom ,very good dipping sauce. Well 7 years ago I haven't been back to OS until this weekend. We tried the 4 Course Dinner Special. We loved it started with the Appetizer Onion Blossom, then our Potato Soup with the Salad , then the the Firecracker Salmon & Sirloin Stake and Baked Potato. Then our choice of dessert. I liked that the waiter brought out food one at a time, every time we finish he brought the next dish. Decent price and we took our time , awesome ! I will come back again."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here. My husband and I ate here and Lo was our waitress. She did tell us it was her second day on the floor, but she did great. She was very tentative and prompt. The food was better than I expected to be honest. I will say the steak was under medium rare it was more of a rare. I didn't mind because I do like rare. The drinks were pretty good too. What I really enjoyed is that the place was nice and cool. I don't like a hot stuffy restaurant unless I'm eating outside. Overall I would come back. My husband and I only got entrees and drinks. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent excellent. The sirloin is delicious. Broccoli is always great. The bread to start is decadent. The booze? Priceless."}
{"text":"A great meal  Ordered Newzealand lamb chops  meal came with rack of lamb  x 6 chops and vegetables  Lrg portion serve and chops very tender Partner had serllion steak & vegetables  Cooked beautifully  Service great Price very reasonable Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was awful. Everything was so salty, or way too much pepper. The shrimp was mushy and gamey. Really nasty. Never again."}
{"text":"I drive for Postmates for extra cash at lunchtime.  I had an order to place and pick up for a customer.   The bartender is who I'm required to place my order with, she could have cared less about me or the fact that what I do is all about speed.  I felt like she moved slower the second she knew why I was there.  I was there from the time I hit the bar till I left for 32 min, all that was ordered was a blooming union and Ahi Tuna appetizer (that is pre cooked and served cold)  There was a table that came in to the bar after I got there and had a blooming onion in less than 10 min...  I am very disappointed in the customer service I received and felt very disrespected."}
{"text":"Fairly dead! Jeff was decent, knew his menu well. Not to satisfied with the food flavor though."}
{"text":"Went to Outback Steakhouse this past Sunday night. We have been there before & the food was pretty good. But Sunday was our worst experience. Frank was our server, have nothing but kudos for Frank, very attentive & the service was great. Now lets get to the food.....I had Ribs & Chicken just soso. My husband had Chicken Alfredo, the man was sick all day Monday with bathroom issues. When he was eating it he had to add salt & pepper to spice it up. He said it had not taste at all. That should have been his first clue....So sad to say Outback Steakhouse on W, Sahara has seen the last of myself & my husband...."}
{"text":"The bartenders here are down to earth, honest, and friendly. I go eat dinner at the bar with my dad and they kept the bread coming. They had been closed for 20 minutes before we realized and didn't try to hint that we should wrap it up."}
{"text":"Ate here with a $25 gift card from my boyfriends work. We didn't come with any high expectations, other than a free meal.  I knew there weren't going to be many vegetarian entree options, but there were NONE. Oh man, so insert the part where I have to look like a total jerk asking for a frankenstein-style salad with no meat, while the waiter looks at me like I'm crazy when I ask him which dressing is the best.  The salad was boring and small and overpriced, but it was edible.  We ordered a Bloomin' Onion for an appetizer. It was actually pretty tasty at first (or maybe I was just ravenous), but the more I ate, the more I could feel my mouth, face, and fingers getting soaked in oil. Ugh.  I left the restaurant feeling kind of gross, but at least the facility was clean and the staff were polite."}
{"text":"The wait for our booth ended up being 25 minutes instead of 45 that was good. Then our waiter Richard greeted us and let us know he will do our best to take care of is and said its extremely busy. Yes it was. My husband is very picky and Richard assisted us with excellence. He kept my coffee cup full and my husbands ice tea glass filled. Kept the unlimited shrimp coming. Everything was 5 Star service. The manager personally came by our table and we told him we were going to Yelp about the great good and service. Kudos to Out Back, the manager Jason and Richard our awesome waiter.  Next time you go to the Out Back on a Stephanie in Henderson ask for Richard."}
{"text":"We were informed wait time was 1 hr- 1 1/2 hrs but it was longer than that. Another thing as well was there was a commotion when some protesters were able to get inside unnoticed by them. They were protesting against eating meat and it took them quite a while to act on it. It was just irritating to wait that long and we have been told a couple of times that the table is getting cleaned up which took like 20 mins?! The only good thing about this situation was our server who was fast and was able to get our orders moving and got them all right. I forgot her name but she was a good server.   Food wise, I did not find their steak extraordinary. For me it was not worth the price and the loooong wait to try it.   Will not go back again."}
{"text":"How can a \"Steakhouse\" run out of prime rib at 5:00PM We went twice and both times out of prime rib before 5:30pm"}
{"text":"Its my 1st time eating here since we go to Lucilles for ribs. I ordered baby back ribs and they're sooooo good, tender and tasteful. It is not dry. It is also cheaper compared to Lucilles. And I love the bloomin onion as well.   We will definitely come back here.."}
{"text":"Monday night .  1 hr to get our food. Offered us bread... never received it. I had to ask for my salad. Wont be back here"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner after a movie. Very good attentive service. Manager walked around checking on all the patrons. My hubby had the coconut shrimp and steak which he said was good. I had the filet. Ordered medium rare but it ended up medium. Still, very tasty and tender. Wine list was short but no prices listed, corporate thing I guess since it is a chain."}
{"text":"We were hungry, and were looking forward to a a good meal at Outback.  We had not been to this location for several years.  They have done a great job at renovating, it reminds me of a cozy ca. seaside vibe, lots of wood...any way I went on yelp to see the reviews, noticed raves about  the food server Phil so we asked for him and we were not disappointed.  From his warm greeting and his attention to making our drinks perfectly, and keeping them full, to his great knowledge of the menu, to, as the meal progressed, letting us eat and enjoy.  The food was really delicious...lobster cooked perfectly, my filet was tender, juicy, and just what I'd been craving.  Hubby loved his steak, and the ice cold wedge salad was excellent.  Talking to Phil was inspiring as a young man working and going to school full time, with a young son.  Wow!  We were so glad to meet such a great young man.  All the way around, a real treat."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable and they are accurate with temperatures for grilled items. They manage to cook a rare steak for me and a medium well steak for my husband without one of them sitting in the heat window for too long. We take advantage of the car side to go when we are feeling lazy and items are always cooked and delivered curbside within 20 min. Nice choices of side items including grilled asparagus and delicious sautéed mushrooms. If I dine in I enjoy the strawberry sangria. They have an email program that is not too spammy and you occasionally receive offerings for free appetizers and weekday specials."}
{"text":"Typical Outback experience.  Service was fine, although the host that seated us mumbled so we couldn't understand a thing he said. Menus were a tad chewed up, kind of third tier for a fairly expensive place. Salad was obviously someone else's custom order. No dressing and no crutons. Bread was delicious as were the steaks. I must say that a 6 Oz steak is friggin tiny though. I felt like a model on a diet eating that thing. Lobster tail was 2 minutes past done which I expected. Cheesecake was to be expected, dense and commercially prepared. Atmosphere is nice, low lighting and loads of wood. It's weird, reminds me of a dark Ale house. We left stuffed, 2 people for under 100 dollars. Certainly not horrible and fairly consistent if you keep your expectations reasonable."}
{"text":"One of my to-go restaurants in the Chandler area. Clean, friendly and nice staff. Food most of the times really good, but sometimes too salty. You can never go wrong ordering a chicken quesadilla, my favorite out of all of them I tried at different restaurants. Sign up for their mailing list; you can get a coupon for a free bloomin' onion and Wednesdays are always good to eat there for their special $9.99 (at the moment steak, fries and a beer)."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and super friendly service! Love this place, it's my week day go to. Try the Aussie Cheese Fries! And sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"I am midway between the Dilworth and Gastonia location. I'm sticking with Dilworth. Butter cup hit me in the head. Butter in my hair???  Got the 7 ounce steak. It was served cold while they prepared the other meals in my party. I didn't return it. Southwales sangria was weak. For me a place like this is hit or miss.  No need to complain. For me this was a miss. My food is always served hot at the Dilworth location.  Drinks aren't watered down. My brother prefers this location but again for me -- no thanks."}
{"text":"I've never had a steak that was this bad before.  I ordered a prime rib (medium rare) and what I got was almost like a rubber steak..  It tasted like rubber, felt like rubber, that I almost thought that it was one of those fake foods from Ikea.    My friend ordered bleu cheese crusted filet mignon and it was definitely better than the prime rib, however I am utterly clueless as to how this restaurant received a Zagat review for best steak...    At least the mashed potatoes were good..."}
{"text":"Today is Mother's Day.  My family decided to dine at Outback.  We arrived at Outback on Market Street at 5:35.  We had used the automated \"get on the waitlist\" before leaving home. We were seated in about 5 minutes and our waitress waited on us promptly.    We did not receive our food until 7:00.  The restaurant was not particularly busy for a Mother's Day.  We were told by the waitress that a breaker had blown and that was having an impact.  A family member said she could not understand why the manager had not been around to talk to diners regarding the delay.  The waitress said that the manager had said \"everyone is upset, she's upset and she doesn't have time to talk with the customers.\"  My response to that was that \"I'm upset enough not to come back.\"  When we left the building, another patron mentioned that she had voiced her displeasure to the manager and was comp'd  a dinner.  Big deal. By the way, this patron said they had been waiting for their food for 2 hours.  Whatever the problem, it was handled very poorly and the attitude of the manager left a lot to be desired and does not sound like someone who should be dealing with the public.  As far as the food, nothing was hot or even fresh looking.  I meant 'No' stars and no return trip required."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever commented on Yelp but I have too. I took my family of 4 here and the food was the worst that I can remember from any Outback.  I usually like Outback but this location was bad. The service was fine but the cook must have been pulled off the street. My 1 year old daughters grilled cheese sandwich was two pieces of unmelted cheese stuck between two burnt pieces of bread, my 3 year old sons cheeseburger was burnt to a crisp and the fries were soggy and raw. I ordered a medium rare steak and it was purple cold in the middle. I sent it back and they brought it back dry and tough like beef jerky. I forced about half of it down because I didn't want to make a scene since it was with my 2 kids and wife. I just paid and left and won't be back. From my experience do not go to this location and just drive a little more to the Robinson location"}
{"text":"It was my birthday so we went out for dinner and we chose Outback Steak House ...1 because I have ate there before and it's always been good and 2 because it's priced better then most other steak restaurants. But this time was diffrent we got the Father's Day special 3 course meal between me and my wife and it was bad the steak was not good at all Meadium Rare is not supposed to be completely pink but it was like eating flesh :( the best part about the meal was the Dessert and that's unfortunate because I liked this place at first now I sadly don't ......"}
{"text":"Ordered a full rack of Ribs and I got 7 bones of Ribs,  I asked my server about how small they looked and she said Most Outback's  serve 12 bones of Ribs on there plates.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE!!  I told the server about this review and the manager came to my table and offered my more Ribs. Go figure you think they doing something wrong here?  Everyone Should be treated the same no matter what location you're at!"}
{"text":"I just had the Crab and Avocado stack,  did not taste that good, kinda sour.   Hope the bloomin  burger is better,  burger was good fries Sucked soft and full of grease, manager did offer to replace.  Server said she got locked outside."}
{"text":"We had stopped going to the Outback because every time we ordered the steak medallions or a sirloin steak the meat was tough and full of stringy cartilage. We decided to try it again to see if the food had improved. We had the steak salad for lunch and it was very good. The meat in the salad was tender and tasty. We went there for dinner tonight. My wife's shrimp were good. The mac & Cheese and my sweet potato were good. But my sirloin was so bad it was very hard to cut. I was only able to eat part of it. I should have sent it back to the kitchen but based on my previous experiences I figured it was a waste of time. We will not go back. If you do go, I suggest that you don't order a steak."}
{"text":"Just not happy about our food tonight. Steak was dry and (we ordered takeout) they completely forgot one of my sides. For $50.00 there are many better places to get a good steak. We are done with Outback."}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes for lunch... Don't come here if you are in a hurry!! The food was alright once it arrived."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I didn't know what to expect. But, it turned out to be an excellent lunch. The mango-lemonade, house salad and prime beef sandwich were 5 stars. The service was fast and friendly. The waiter took the time to explain the menu. I will be back."}
{"text":"Too salty.  Server was interruptive to our conversation.  Manager was also interruptive and checked in 4 times.  Don't you trust your employees?"}
{"text":"Either Outback has deteriorated in quality and variety or just this particular Outback was nothing special. We had a Steakhouse Salad and a kids tenderloin w/ fruit cup meal. The kids meal was about 3 bites. We had to order another one because my tiny 10-year-old girl was still hungry. My salad was just a pile of salad mix, clearly from a bag, with slices of steak on top. It was very tasty steak, I'll give them credit for that, but the whole shebang wasn't much to get excited about. Maybe if we were bigger eaters and ordered the giant entrées this chain is famous for we might've been more impressed. The bloomin' onions and giant steak platters going by looked a bit better. Moral of the story: if you're looking for a light healthy dinner, like a paleo-friendly protein + veg option, you won't be very impressed here."}
{"text":"Wow. I hadn't been to Outback in maybe a few years and decided to go tonight. First thing we noticed was the menu options had been reduced significantly. Not very many choices and the choices left weren't great. So I ordered the deal that comes with lobster tail, crab cake, and shrimp skewer with two sides. My husband ordered the Philly cheesesteak and fries. Plates arrived looking about half the size of what's shown in the menu picture (typical, but way overpriced for the size.) I'd never had crab cakes before so upon first bite with the cream sauce it tasted ok. After a few more bites, there was a weird, not-so pleasant after taste. Got the baked potato with everything on it. That was ok. Lobster tail with butter was ok. Shrimp on the skewer had good taste.   Now onto the Philly cheesesteak: completely dry and tasteless. Husband had to dip in ketchup or even the sauce for my crab cake to make it taste better. For my toddler they brought out a cheeseburger with burned, very tough buns. We won't be returning despite the manager taking off items from our bill, which was nice, but doesn't really cover the poor quality. This Outback has really gone downhill. Shame. We'll stick to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"I got a gift card I had to use and ordered curbside service. The waiter was hella nice but the food was eh.  I mainly am writing this review to say the Idahoan premium steakhouse loaded baked potato POWDER (let that soak in) soup is way better than the potato soup Outback had to offer. It was a free meal so I will stop hatin but POWDER FTW. Later mate."}
{"text":"Took my family  to dinner here the other night had exceptional service by everyone from the moment we walked in the front door..... since i have young children that do not go out for steak often, I was not too sure on what to order for them...... but our  server Anthony gave us great suggestions and went above and beyond ...even posed for pictures with the kids!!"}
{"text":"Ate here this past Saturday night. We called ahead, but still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.  The service was slow and the waitress seemed rushed.  The food took FOREVER and was average at best.  We are members of the dining club, gave the waitress our number, but she did not run it. So we had to wait another 15 minutes to sort that out as we had a free meal that we needed to use since it was expiring soon.  All in all this place is okay, but has a few things to work on."}
{"text":"We both ordered the $22 petite fillet. They were a terrible disappointment! They were delivered to our table, we looked down at the tiny piece of flat ugly steak, we looked at each other and said, \"that's a $22 petite fillet!\" At Outback Steakhouse, I guess it is. Two nights later we went to Longhorn ... paid $1 less and got twice as much of a petite fillet! Delicious!  Bob"}
{"text":"Time and time again, the service at the bar is top notch. It doesn't seen to matter who is working at the time. The coconut shrimp is always a great starter. Tonight it's tilapia with crab. Awesome!"}
{"text":"A new favorite. Thank you Casey and friends at the Outback bar for quick and attentive service. You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call my self a \"food snob\" because I am not a snob about anything, but I too found the food well prepared and tasty. I ordered fish and it was fresh and juicy. The worst thing you can do to a fish is to over fry it or over bake. No, the worse thing you can do to a fish is to take it out of water. They are incapable of breathing outside an aqueous environment."}
{"text":"Its been years since Ive been to an Outback and I was so pleasantly surprised how wonderful everything was this evening. My boyfriend and I both got the 4 courses for $15 which is a screaming deal for the amount of food you get! The french onion soup was a $1 up charge but totally worth it. We asked for our steaks medium rare, unaware of how thick an outback special would be. They came more rare than medium rare so I did what I absolutely hate to do, I sent it back. Our server Christopher was so nice about it and seemed more interested in making sure we were actually enjoying our evening. The manager stopped by to apologize (even though it was no one's fault but my own) and told me the steaks would be up in a minute or two. We were so full so Christopher boxed up our desserts for us to go. ALSO! I ordered the skinny rita which was also amazing! very light and refreshing. perfect to start before a 4 course dinner!  We will be back because of the food, management, and our awesome server Chris!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience. Went in late at night after a show. Wish I could remember our waiters name he was awesome. The food was fabulous, like so amazing! We had the ribeye (with the garlic butter enhancement) with coconut prawns, Caesar salad and baked potato. We weren't super hungry so decided to split our meal. Some places are so grumpy when you want to split, but our waiter was very kind and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. And the view is so great!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Food is disgusting overcooked Burger waitress showed up at the table 20 minutes after we sit down, no condiments on the table. I would give this place 0 stars if I could. Been here two or three times and everytime I leave disgusted won't be returning after today. Shortly after getting home I found myself on the shitter for about 30 minutes purging that crap from whatever it is they put in your Foods. How does this place remain in business my God what a disgusting place to visit can't wait to see this business go under."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner pretty late, about half an hour before it closes and our waitress was super nice, very attentive and quick. I ordered Ahi Tuna Sesame Salad and it was one of the best salads I have ever had! Delicious!  Wish we could come back but we don't live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Two stars is about right.  Sat down at bar at 1135am and no one noticed me until 1150am.  Ordered quickly and now waiting 10 minutes just for my side salad and bartender is nowhere to be found.  Then she brings the salad and quickly leaves...and I have no silverware. On a positive note the blue cheese chopped salad was very tasty, the steak was good however the veggies were way overcooked.   Bartender was very nice just preoccupied with other things elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm a new fan of the Outback Steakhouse. It probably had been ten years since I had last had it until a couple of months ago. Now I have been there a few times and I plan on going back. I love ordering the shrimp as an appetizer and I have found that the Filet Focaccia Sandwich is awesome! I am not a steak person, so this suites me fine. Eating here can be a little expensive, but I really like the food!"}
{"text":"Just went to this location near Chapel Hill area in Akron and had an excellent dinner. Food was excellent, waitress was friendly and courteous. The manager was very accommodating. Had minor discrepancy and manager handled everything professionally and when we left we were really happy with the service and the food. I think that managers was John from what the employee by the door said. Anyway, thank you for such great food and service!!!"}
{"text":"To the proprietor of this location:  Please...will either you or one of your managers please talk to Nick the daytime bartender and get him to stop in always ending everything he says to the customer with \"boss\"?  It is very annoying and unprofessional.  From my recent lunch How is it going boss What are you drinking today boss What are you going to have for lunch today boss Here is your lunch boss Do you need some more water boss How is everything boss Here is your check boss Thank you boss  That is a lot of \"boss\" for One customer to be expected to listen to.  And all of this when after the first time he said it to me I said in Return... I am the boss of no one"}
{"text":"Well, it's outback so you know what you are going to get.  It's place was okay the first time, then 2 days later horrible.  Everything was sooooooo salty (especially the blooming onion, we couldn't even eat it).  Then, when the waitress came around and asked how everything was, we told her it was too salty and what did she say? \"Oh, but its so good\" and walked away.  Really? That's what you say?  They forgot my cousin's horseradish crust on the rib eye steak, then brought it out 15 min later on a plate and slid it onto the steak (and it got all crumbled and fell apart).  I can't believe it.  Lucky for them, there are so few decent places in Surprise people choose to eat at this dump.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 1 star reviews to burgers. I love my burgers and if you've read any of my other reviews, you'd know that.... We decided to go here for lunch because I revived a coupon in an email. you can't go wrong with a $6.99 burger!! Well as always we were ready to order pretty quickly when the waiter came to our table. We ordered a blooming onion and we also ordered the burger to share like always (portion control and no left overs). We ordered the burger with cheddar cheese and no tomato. The waiter even double checked a few minutes later to make sure he placed the order with the right cheese. He was very nice to start off and quick with the service. When we got the blooming onion, I had mentioned to my husband that it tasted burnt. He though maybe it was just their time to change the oil. We ate around the onion hoping to find some better parts, but it mostly all tasted burt. Just to make sure the business was aware (I'm sure they don't taste every item they serve) I wanted to let the waiter know that it either was burnt or they should test the oil to see if they need to change it. He gave a hasty sorry then went to the back.  Then we go our burger. We didn't ask them to, but they were nice enough to even cut the burger in half and put it and the fries on two separate plate! I took the top bun off to add some salt and pepper and noticed there was no cheese on the burger at all, and there was a big juicy tomato on the burger.... My husband has NEVER been one to complain about his food at a restaurant. \"you eat what you're given\".... I believe that if you order something a specific way, and you're paying extra for cheese, It should come the way you order it. Not wanting to upset my husband, we began to eat. The waiter came around asking how it was, and at that point, I let him know that there was no cheese and he had saw the tomato picked off on the side of my plate.  He had offered to take it back and remake it, but I always get nervous about restaurants remaking food.... I have see the movie Waiting too many times to feel comfortable doing that. I wasn't expecting money to be off my bill, but I was expecting a big apology and a thanks for the heads up that the cooks were not doing their jobs properly.... I didn't get any of the above...  I am so utterly disappointed with the service and food quality we received. Outback is one.... WAS one of my favorite restaurants. I don't think we will be going back. At least never to this one again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Outback in years.  I was on a road trip with my brother and we wanted to go out for a steak dinner.  I was buying.  I checked out some other local place but everything was really pricey.  We settled on Outback because the prices seemed reasonable.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla appetizer, which was not traditional but still very good.  My bother ordered the sirloin and lobster tail ~$23.00.  The lobster tails were three half tails, and a little on the small side but perfectly cooked and very tasty.  His steak was beautiful rare to perfection.  I ordered the prime rib, a 12 oz cut for I think it was 16.00.  It was excellent, perfectly rare, perfectly tender.  I was also able to get a baked sweet potato with brown sugar and honey that was fantastic.  The service was great too.  All and all a very satisfying meal for around $55."}
{"text":"Had called ahead but they totally lost the call ahead and we waited over an hour to be seated.  Staff at front was ver rude and nasty.  Not helpful at all when we went to check on the status of our wait.  We are very nice and free fly people but they were not nice.  Go somewhere else if you can."}
{"text":"1} THE WAIT STAFF  WAS WONDERFUL 5 STARS  We had reservations for 7:00 PM for our family gathering on 17.  They were going to set us in a banquet steal at several tables.  This could have been Communication problem I was not the one that made the reservations.  We were not seated until 7:30.    Our table was chairs on one side and one long bench on the other.  Half of use had to slide a very long way to get settled.  This was not easy for some of us.    The food was standard and typical Outback.  I do not like Outback.  I can not tolerate hot foods or very spicy foods.  You can not tell what you are eating do to the seasoning and marinades used.  For a lot of people it is what they go to the Outback for, the Outback Taste.   I do not eat at the Outback, it is not so much the food but the long wait and table arrangement, and then the non-a compensation for people that can not handle spicy... For any reason.    I am one of those that knows what Colorado Beef tastes like vs Beef from Florida grasses.  *Chicken (Road Island Red/Wyandotte/Orpington etc.) and *Heritage Turkey that has taken time to grow up vs CX and broad breasted turkeys that go to markets in weeks and will fall over dead with conjunctive of heart failure if allowed to live to long as 6 mo.  {*note: price of these fowl would be $5.00 -$10.00 a pound)."}
{"text":"I'm trying to lose a hundred pounds. No small challenge. But using my Argus app we were able to go and have a good dinner. The sweet potato option as a side is great and the steak was nice and rare. Service was excellent, bathrooms were clean and it was basically everything we've come to expect from Outback over the years. We do like this location in particular. It seems like the food that we've gotten here has been more consistent than other locations. We'll be back. When we aren't looking for adventure, just some decent red meat and a cold drink, Outback is an easy stop."}
{"text":"Someone needs to re-train their cook staff.  \"Well done\" does NOT mean overdone and dried out to the point of being closer to beef jerky than a nice cut of fillet!  And you can ignore those photos on their website and menu .. my wife's 6 oz fillet was only 1/4\" thick and looked like a hockey puck.  We even had to ask them if they were sure that was the fillet.   I gave then 2 stars because my prime rib was good ( tho not medium as I had requested .. more medium-rare), the other sides were good, and the service in general was good.  Our waitress was promptly attentive.   But don't order the so-called \"fillet\"."}
{"text":"Like this place. People are nice, food is fresh and really delicious.  Try their chocolate thunder dessert with brownie, something cheesy and warm and ice cream! So nice. And it's really busy place so how one had suggested here - grab a seat at the bar because it could be 30 min."}
{"text":"Consistently good!  I come here 3 times a month and the service and food is always terrific. I usually sit at the bar and Sean always offers fantastic service. Unlike other Outbacks, the steaks are always good. Keep up the phenomenal service and great food."}
{"text":"I was a vegetarian.......for a week. The first day I was doing good. I had the basic green salad with some croutons, oil and vinegar; no problem. I mean it was not as good as my before vegetarian days salads with bacon bits, eggs, cheese, turkey and ham, and all the other sides that come with a salad like....steak and lobster.    As days passed by I realized that being vegetarian would be harder than I thought, my mood started to change I felt like I was growing fangs and I wanted to bite every neck that passed by just to get a little taste of blood, After a week of meat restricted diet I started to feel tired, dizzy, I started to hallucinate.......by now I could eat anything!.... and there it was! I slammed on my brakes.... Roadkill! Couldn't tell what it was, kangaroo, koala or koyote, all I know is that it was bloody and I was starving, I couldn't pass it by, I picked it up and......ok, I'm kidding, I went into the outback steakhouse and ordered a steak, I took my knife and cut it into pieces, as I took my first bite my taste buds screamed with joy and the juices of the steak  ran through my veins like heroin on a drug addict two minutes after being released from rehab. I stared at the baked potato and the vegetables for a minute and decided to skip them... oh what the hell, I'll eat that too, don't want to stop being a vegetarian cold turkey.    When you get the call of the wild and feel the need to feed the beast in you, the outback has a damn good steak!..........mate.    Oh....almost forgot to review the place!   Attentive and friendly service, affordable and good ambiance.            And like the boomerang said....I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Since I am accustomed to being dissapointed by Outbacks, this one was a pleasant change. Food was great, service was great, and the beer was cold. Hats off to this unit. They need to teach other Outbacks how it's done."}
{"text":"Just had a very pleasurable dining experience. The food was cooked to perfection and out server Gwen was just a delight. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is comfortable, and friendly. It is a good place to take your family.  They have good service. The food tastes good. The only problem is that the meal did not fill me up, and it is pricey . I will come back in the future."}
{"text":"I placed an order on line including a baked potato with all the trimmings. When I got home I found a baked potato with... nothing! Obviously I didn't go back, but I called and spoke to the manager. She apologized and promised me I will receive a free meal identical to the one I had ordered on line. She took my name and said it will be added on a list, all I have to do is show up. A couple of weeks later I decided to give it a try, but I was wise enough to call ahead and check that my name is still on the list. I was told that there is no such list. Goes without saying that I had dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant. Price is not that bad for a restaurant on las Vegas strip. The food is ok but not expect too much."}
{"text":"Best food, drinks, and service around. The staff is attentive and very genuine. The food was so good, from the apps to the zerts!"}
{"text":"Well outback steakhouse read my review and actually sent me 2 comp cards to try again and what a suprise. My Victoria's filet on this visit was butter soft and melt in your mouth tender, so I went from the worst steak ever to one of the best iv ever had anywhere, I don't get the inconsistencies on each visit but I will return and if it's tough and chewy I was told to send it back right away, if it's this good again they will get 5 stars easily. Good too know that they actually read the reviews and make it right, fully recommend this location again!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a rainy Saturday afternoon after seeing a movie. We don't eat here often but we had a gift card and a birthday to celebrate.  As someone else mentioned - We had the same wonderful & entertaining experience with the bar tenders. Coco & Kris (I think)....   very good service and they were happy and attentive!  Seriously, he is so funny, I told him he should be down at the Improv in Tempe instead of behind the bar. But we were glad he was there! We had a blast.  We enjoyed a new local Red Ale brew from Desert Eagle brewing in Mesa. It's nice to have a local beer on tap.   We enjoyed sharing one of the new  steaks - a filet with shrimp and 1/2 lobster tail. It was very good.  They now offer a smaller version of the chocolate thunder dessert so we were finally able to order dessert for a change! It was excellent as always.  We also met and had a nice conversation with some other locals who are regulars. So we just may stop in here for a happy hour again soon.  The service and the bar tenders make it worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great 4 courses Steak Dinner for under $20  First: I received a tasty house bread with butter.  After than, I ordered a 6oz. Roasted Garlic Butter Sirloin with French Fries. For a starter a Soup and House Salad. Dessert was a Cheesecake. Drink was a Coke. I paid for all together: $18.36  This food was amazing for this price. fantastic!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in the Industry so I get when things happen in restaurants! I know this is no fine dinning Steak House off the strip! But the service here is alway terrible. You may see your server to give order and when they drop the check! They can never cook my steak to rare it's always medium, the side dishes always come out cold. I don't complain much because I don't want things for free I want the problem solved when things are ongoing in a  business! Hopefully this in particular establishment someone will see the problem and make some adjustments until then I will just visit other Outback Steakhouse's!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is now open for lunch on Friday and Saturday. The blooming onion was delicious and we had the double hamburger. The food was good, and our waitress was attentive. We were cold when we were seated but our waitress had the manager adjust the thermostat. We enjoyed our dining experience today."}
{"text":"Every time I come to the Outback Steakhouse i'm very satisfied with all of the food, the variety of offerings, the quality of the steaks, and every other aspect of the restaurant. This location is no exception, the staff was great and the steaks were amazing, I can't believe I'm getting in the chain restaurant and I am so happy with the results. And things are much cheaper than if we went to a more expensive place, like Oscars Steakhouse, which we went to yesterday. (It was great, but not twice as good as Outback.)   Today's dinner was incredibly satisfying, with two full steak meals with sides and two beers, which was less than what we paid for alcohol just this afternoon at our hotel. So we are very happy."}
{"text":"We gave them one star because a negative 5 star rating wasn't available. . Sloppy salad was , well. It was sloppy and floppy. Wilted would be a compliment. The blooming onion , gave me a fear fried foods that I didn't know existed.. also the dressing for the unburied remains of \" salad\" cake 25 minutes later and by this time  I would've classified  the salad as soup. The rest of meal would require me to use potty words and even more offensive and barely grown  up language."}
{"text":"We love this Outback and go there very often.  Perfectly Grilled Salmon was my favor dish. Food is always good and consistent, service was good too.   If you don't want to wait...go there for lunch."}
{"text":"I love the drinks they have here....And the deserts!!! --When you ask for a sampler size desert, they bring out this monstrous sized thing (for two) and charge sampler price. That is amazing.   The steaks are alright. They need a little boost of je ne sais quoi. And the seasonal veggies are all year round veggies so it seems.  But for the most part, good prices, decent food and fabulous drinks and deserts.  You're going to leave nice and full and merry with not too much damage done to the wallet.   You can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"Decent Outback. We had lunch there and it wasn't very busy, so the service was good. I ordered chicken strips and they were a bit skimpy and small. The staff could have been a bit friendlier as well. Overall not a bad location, but could have been better."}
{"text":"Great location! Went on a Saturday night and the wait was only about 10 minutes.  The place was clean and the service was friendly.  My porterhouse was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, and our waiter was attentive.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  It took them foreeeeeeeeever to serve the food.  We're talking 30 minutes to serve salads and soup when the restaurant is dead.  Pretty ridiculous.  Water glass was not kept full, and wasn't refilled for a good ten minutes despite me asking the server for it pointedly.  Waiter got one order incorrect.  Brother's steak took extremely long because the waiter said it wasn't well-done.  Coconut shrimp were small but tasted fine.  Potato soup was good, not too oniony.  Do NOT order any grilled chicken or fish.  It will be extremely dry."}
{"text":"Here is the $9 outback Burger I got tonight through curbside. Suppose to have lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle and mustard. Could have got this down the street at McD's for $3.50. Called outback and manager gave a comp for a burger. Big deal I'm hungry! What sucks is I been sick for 2 days and haven't eaten anything. My wife was shopping nearby so I thought it would be convenient. Oh well first and last time for curbside and possibly last for outback."}
{"text":"Welcome to Outback this is a really good steak house with someone expensive steaks now be careful what you take your bike is a 14 oz New York strip steak is $25 but hey it's not that bad if it's really good right it's super delicious I have ordered it before and it's so good like it might be a little budget River but it's delicious"}
{"text":"Steak was very undercooked and chewy. When we tried to tell the waitress she left before we could even say anything! Very loud music and kitchen was too loud. Probably never going to come back!"}
{"text":"Because I have to give a star, I will only give one.  Where to start....  First let me say thet this is the second time we have had poor service at this location.   We decided to give it another chance, but alas it was worse this time.  Our server was forgetful, and refused to write anything down.  1st, my husband ordered a beer, the brought him Bud Lite when he ordered a Blue Moon.  We ordered our appetizer  (a blooming onion) it was well undercooked. We were offered bread but it was not produced until afer we got our appetizer, and that took 20 minutes.   Then we ordered our food.  My salad was fine, but the wedge blue cheese my husband ordered was so small i would never call it a wedge, and to pay an extra cost for a \"premium\" side, I dont think so.  We had a better wedge salad from Applebee's.  The entire meal the server never asked us if we needed our drinks refilled and tried to box up our appetizer before our main coarse even made it to the table.  Just before our meal did show up we were able to ask for a refill on my drink, and the correct drink for my husband.  When the food arrived we were both full from waitung so long that we only took a couple of bites of our food.  My husbands meal was fine.  Mine on the other hand was over cooked.  I asked for rare, the server put down medium rare, and I received well done.  Mind you while all this was happening our server kept walkkng past our table ignoring our questions, and anoylther server was constantly walking between the half wall and my chair as a short cut back to the kitchen.  Each time she passed she would bump my chair.  When all was said and done we never got to eat our main coarse, the server sucked and the food was cold.  When we asked to speak with the manager his attitude made us feel like the poor meal and service was our fault.  He did take $10.00 off our bill, but when you are spending over $100.00 that was a slap in the face.  We had no problem telling them we would not be eating at Outback Steakhouse ever again.  While the atmosphere is very loud, Texas roadhouse seems to be the better place to eat.  So Outback Steakhouse we bid you farewelll and hope that your business improves because you were an utter disappointment to two long time loyal customers."}
{"text":"Service was very slow and my $23 steak was tough.  Not the expectation I had when my mouth was watering for a steak dinner.   Waitresses never even came to check on us.    Was going to buy their gift certificate special that give to daughter for holiday, but went to Macaroni Grill instead for  gift card."}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday night with a party of 7. Called ahead no problems, table was waiting for us. We had 5 steaks and 2 kids meals. Everything was fantastic. Have been coming to this location for many years. Have never had a bad meal or service. Michael was our server, he was on top of everything from start to finish. Thanks for the great meal."}
{"text":"Ate here last Saturday evening.  I won't go into detail about the problem with my entree , because the evening manager came over to us, apologized, and the kitchen made me a new (and improved) entree right away.  The issue that I had trouble with, and I would think the higher management would to, is this;   As we were eating our dinner (at the bar) one of the bartenders, who had been working, helping us all night, clocked out, and took a seat next to us at the bar. The manager, who had respectfully introduced himself to us earlier, and apologized for my meal, was standing behind the bar counting a register, or something, I really don't know what he was doing, but the bartender , who in my eye, is still an employee and who just waited on us (along with a really good blonde bartender) began throwing ice (from her drink) at the face of the manager. The first ice block hit him in the ear and he looked up at her and said. \"Ouch. That hurt\".  She giggled and proceeded to throw more ice at him and giggle.  One chunk of ice hit him in the eye.  He seemed like he was upset, but just walked away.  Makes me wonder what kind of manager he is to A) allow an employee to throw ice at him, on the dining floor, in front of customers and B) Why was she so comfortable doing it.   It totally made me disrespect him and feel sorry for him, and he was the manager on duty.  If he would have approached me about my meal after that scenario played out, not sure I would have taken him seriously.   The awesome blossom is delicious though !"}
{"text":"The service here was great!!  I went for lunch on a Sunday and they serve their lunch menu on the weekends too.  A lot of places do not do that.  I had the endless soup and salad.  The potato soup is fabulous!!  I mentioned that I would like to take some for my lunch tomorrow and my server said he would get me some.  Because it is endless after all.  He also packed the cheese and bacon bits in separate containers. That was great!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Steak was overcooked.  Had to wait for new steak while everyone else ate. Then they added mushrooms and onions to my bill, which I neither ordered or received.  Took over 15 minutes to get correct bill. Food was good otherwise."}
{"text":"Well Outback has totally remodeled their restaurant but forgot to remodel its customer service.  Sat with my wife for10 to15 minutes as the wait staff just walked pass.  They appear to have enough wait staff but they are unclear what tables they are assigned to.    The new appearance is nice but if they don't improve their customer service it will be wasted."}
{"text":"Sirloin steak was tough and tasteless, Brocolli was over cooked.. olive oil on broccoli was old or disgusting or both.  Is it my imagination or are the salads getting smaller?  Great service/server.  Fast service and friendly.   Have had much better from Outback in general but not tonight."}
{"text":"I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me."}
{"text":"Usually have a good experience here, but Monday night the service and food had issues.  Waitress took forever to help us and they ran out of the 2 desserts we ordered.  My main course was the chicken and shrimp and everything tasted fine.  The restaurant was not busy and we were seated immediately, so not sure who ate all the desert and why the service was slow.  Must have been an off nigh for them.  2 stars for mediocre effort.  My tip was also very mediocre!"}
{"text":"I have tried and tried to like this place.  I just cannot give them more than 2 stars.  Their major problem is consistency, one time food will be good and the next two times it will suck.  The blooming onion is just pure grease and their bone in wings are absolute crap.  The service is spotty at best.  The steak I get that can be decent is the ribeye.  It is really hit and miss at this place...I would personally recommend you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Got the Ribeye steak & this being a steakhouse & the best cut I expected a thick juicy tasty steak. Far from it! What I got was all fat not even edible I had to search around just to get one nibble of steak! Are you kidding me? This was terrible. I sent it back and they took it off my bill. I won't be back changed my opinion of outback!"}
{"text":"My Fiancée and I had a Late Sunday Lunch February 21, 2015.  The Salad was good after I returned the first one, which looked like it had been cooked. My Fiancée's salad had the dressing on the bottom of the bowl. When our entrees came out they looked like they where in a heat lamped way to long. Both sandwiches where very salty and over cooked and dried out. The  French fries were soggy from the juice of the sandwich and where over salted and cool. When I complained to the duty Manager I could tell he didn't take me serious as a customer. The server was good that we had and I felt sorry for him, because it not his fault they had bad cooks and management. I have to say I will not go back to this Outback again. Burger King would have been much better or anything else:-("}
{"text":"The ONLY reason they received stars at all was for our server Brandon...he was AWESOME!!! My son ordered the tilapia with lump crab which came out cold, I ordered the bacon bourbon salmon which was soooo salty I felt my blood pressure spike with every bite! My wife had the  filet which she said was ok but felt something was off but she could not tell me why.  I had 2 martinis while I was here and normally with 2 my wife takes me home and they make for a restful nights sleep...I cannot swear to it but I think they may have poured from the Sparkletts bottle instead of the gin bottle!  My wife and I like to consider ourselves regulars here usually eating 3-4 times a month here and have noticed a decrease in the food quality over recent times.  We chose not to speak with the manager while we were there because Brandon was so phenomenal, however we did place a call, they took my number and have not reached back out and it has been over 2 days and the phone has been silent.  I think this will be my final visit to this location and maybe try another...just do not want to drive that far but sometimes it is warranted.  I think this location needs... \"some rules, and TRY to get it right!\""}
{"text":"Amazing staff, prompt service and great food. All of the staff is incredibly nice here and gives unbridled service to all gusts"}
{"text":"I go to Outback because you know what you are going to get. The food is good, place is clean, service is average or better. This location meets all of the above. 2 of us went at 5pm for dinner beating the crowds."}
{"text":"Overall the experience wasn't great. When we walked in there were multiple tables available but the hostess was very disorganized and eventually said like 15 minutes after she asked us THREE times how many people and we said 2 THREE times. The food came out in a timely fashion but the waitress was acting like she was on something. She got my drink wrong and was just very awkward about everything. The food wasn't horrible just average. We decided to get coffee and dessert after. The coffee came cold so we ordered two fresh new ones, she brought one then swiftly walked away. The dessert however was good. We had the salted Carmel cookie."}
{"text":"What is a veg' doing reviewing Outback, you wonder? well. . . I like to give cred where I see fit. It wasn't my choice of restaurant of course, but my friend Angie gave me that doe-eyed look when I suggested that our dinner spot could be her choice.   I will admit that upon arriving I assumed I'd be stuck with an option of salad and....salad. Much to my delight I had some options to choose from and this is what I indulged in:  Complimentary bread- Comp bread is just that... you're stuck w/ what you get, but surprisingly it was fluffy and not rock solid when taking a bite and the waitress didn't mind bringing multiple refills to enjoy w/ our entrees.   Caesar Salad-  Salad was fresh and made perfectly as requested with NO dressing and blue cheese crumbles added on top.   No Rules parmesan pasta- I loved this. They have an actual pasta listing where I can ADD meat if I want to or just get the pasta independently. Also, the waitress was good about asking me how \"spicy\" I want my noodles and made sure I was aware that they use cayenne pepper to add spice which I appreciated knowing.  Strawberry Peach Sangria- Light floral notes w/ floating strawberries on top. Delicious to say the least and something refreshing I could sip throughout dinner.  Not my first, second, or third choice to eat as a vegetarian, but as far as being accomodating to my diet, I'd say above average."}
{"text":"Love it here!  Service and manager Christina are GREAT!!!  The food quality and portions seem to be back!!"}
{"text":"Great date night with the boo. Hostesses were nice, wait was shorter than quoted, food was delicious, food runner was nice and helpful, everything on point.... But the server had the personality of a dirty dishrag. He seemed like he wanted to be ANYWHERE but where he was, didn't smile once, wasn't engaging at all, and not much of a thank you at the end either."}
{"text":"I love ordering car side to-go here. My food is always perfect and the service is prompt. My family owns a steakhouse back in Nebraska and I find love how perfect Outback cooks their steaks every time. I'm typically a anti chain restaurant but they know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"I hadn't visited an Outback Steakhouse in a couple years, but I left this one extremely pleased. The service was fantastic and made me feel appreciated. I look forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch.  Food came at a good interval.  The food was very tasty and warm.  Service was good.  We ate the pasta dish and chopped tenderloin.  Both were very good."}
{"text":"Every other Saturday I buy two of their wonderful desserts, their chewey brownie covered with delicious chocolate topping called \"Down Under\" and take them home.  Tonight I'll indulge and freeze the other for next Saturday."}
{"text":"A few issues on this visit. Hardly any dressing on the salad, we got the wrong soup and the soda was flat. Everything was corrected. What really burned my butt was that the waitress shorted  me my change in her favor. What is wrong with them. My husband knew I was tired and didn't tell me bc this has become a pet peeve of mine so he didn't tell me till later. I really want to take someone to the mat on this issue. Why do waitstaff not give coin change? Did I miss some memo on this? I let it go a few times but I'm all done with miss nice now. Don't assume I'm leaving the coin change as a tip. I can't wait to call the next person out who short changes me!! They're a business and should have adequate change for the day. If anything -short yourself and not the customer & give me extra change if you really ran out. Watch out when you go here & check your bill and check your change!!!! Outback is not looking out for you!!! They are truly going to nickel & dime you!"}
{"text":"I ate here 3 times in less than  2 weeks because I had some coupons to use up. I found the staff to be very attentive and the manager ask me how my meal was 2 of the 3 days I visited. I had the medium sirloin steak all 3 times. One time I believe it was a little under cooked but still within reason.    Although I did find it some what hard to cut as the first reviewer said it seemed to be free of grizzle except for the end of one of the steaks I had. All in all I would say the help was above average and the meal was typical of an Outback."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner and an amazing service. The wait was worth it. Everyone there is very friendly and outstanding service."}
{"text":"We ate here on 12/30/16 we were able to make reservations which I like. Las Vegas was packed for the up coming New Years celebration and we didn't want to wait forever to get a table. We got there a few minutes late but our table was still available and were seated right away. We ordered drinks and wings for an appetizer. My beer we nice and cold btw. Service was very good in spite of the crowds.   The wing came out quickly and were moist, tasty and with just the right amour of spicyness (is that a word?) anyway we ordered steaks, I a ribeye and my wife a New York strip.   The steaks came out quickly as well and the were perfectly cooked medium just as ordered. The steaks were amazing, last time I had a steak so good was at Morton's. Oops I mean one my wife cooked, then Morton's. Ok you think I'm crazy comparing an Outback steak with Morton's? Yes I agree that is crazy but this was a great steak, my compliments to the cook. Everyone here like most of Las Vegas is super nice and friendly. The steaks were so big we couldn't finish them and ate them for lunch the next day. Highly recommended this Outback."}
{"text":"I was at Bonefish grill on the 5th of January. Had steak and Coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp wasn't just good, it was fabulous. On the 7th, we went to Outback on Sahara and Durango. I had the steak and coconut shrimp. The shrimp was an already breaded one that you buy at the store. And they give you a coconut- pineapple sauce to dip it in. This should  not be called COCONUT SHRIMP., It was terrible !!!  Service was just ok. Our waiter sorta neglected us but there were plenty there so they were walking by all the time. Bonefish Grill should teach their sister company how to make their Coconut shrimp.  Just saying"}
{"text":"We love to go to Outback Steakhouse in Gastonia. The food is great and has great customer service when dining in. However, visiting to take out (Curbside service) needs improvement. The past two times we have ordered out and have been given a set time for order to be ready, we have had to wait an additional 20-25 minutes for our order while waiting in the car. It takes us 20 minutes to get there, so we order before leaving home so it will be ready when we arrive. This has not been the case the last two times we ordered."}
{"text":"Everything was dry. I got a double chesse burger really it's was two very thin patties like McDonald's. And my moms steak was very dry. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Place was quite empty on a Tuesday night so we thought we'd have a pretty fast service but boy, we were WRONG.  Server was quite friendly & I know it's probably not her fault but our food came so far apart and took WAY too long. We got our appetizer 10 minutes after we ordered everything. 5 minutes later, we got our bread and butter. We tried to wait for our soup and salad to come cause we usually like to eat it with them but it took too long. We were starving! 20 minutes later, our soup and salad came in. Then moments later, our entrees came in.  The order of the food coming in was unusual and not good. Food was tasty though but I just can't seem to comprehend why they take too long for the food when no one else was in the restaurant. I've definitely had better, for sure."}
{"text":"Went here the other day.  I've never been to Outback and I must admit that I gave my friend the \"side eye\" for the suggestion!  I'm a vegetarian going to a steakhouse and a chain steak restaurant at that!  But \"allegedly\" they had this onion thing that I just \"had to try\".  Our waiter was cute, attentive and made great suggestions.  The bread was actually really good and on this day they were giving out a free Bloomin' Onion per table!  Ok ,so the onion thing was surprisingly good, a little greasy, but good.  I ordered the chicken artichoke flatbread sans chicken with a side order of sweet potato.  My friends had the soup of the day (potato) and the Aussie chicken Cobb Salad sans bacon.   We all liked our food and everything was cool."}
{"text":"Came here on one of my first nights to vegas on a Saturday night and we had excellent customer service. We where a party of 8 and we truly enjoyed the server and the blonde bartender. The host was under the weather or something but that didnt stop us. Will be back here the next time we come to vegas."}
{"text":"was NOT impressed at ALL. the steak I got was wood grill roasted and the flavor was horrible, way too much SALT- and the croutons are supposibly \"fresh made and crunchy\" but they were stale and wet ! would not reccomend to anyone. Go to DUmas and buy a great steak for like 10$ and cook it yourself, much more worth it"}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be years ago...However, we had the father's day special recently and it was delicious and a good deal...The bathrooms here, as well as the floors are filthy...Greasy as you try to get to the bathrooms...Check your shoes, I just about slipped about 5 feet from the bathrooms and almost killed myself...I wasn't even drinking..."}
{"text":"Mean 3 of my friends ate at this Outback this past Saturday for a birthday dinner and had a GREAT experience. We did walk in (but they do have call ahead available). When we came in it was around 2pm and there was a short 5 minute wait.   After being seated, we were greeted by our waiter and water was brought to us immediately and our drink orders were taken. The waiter was very attentive but not overbearing. I had the 28oz Ribeye steak  (it's big enough for 2) medium well. My friends had the porterhouse pork chop, 18oz Ribeye (bone out), and chicken. And we shared Kookaburra wings which is my favorite appetizer from Outback. Needless to say, our food was DEEEELISH and was cooked perfectly The way we asked it to be!  This is by far one of the best Outback I have been to and iVe been to quite a lot!"}
{"text":"So let's start this off with I used to cook for an outback so I am pretty familiar with the menu and how to cook it... First off our blooming onion was raw, when I mentioned this to the Manger she tried to explain why. I quickly told her I used to work for outback and have cooked a few blooming onions in my life, she just turned and walked away and ignored us the entire rest of the meal.  My Alice chicken tasted like it sat under the warming lights and counted three mushroom under the pile of burnt cheese....piss poor service and shitty manager."}
{"text":"Don't order the Artichoke Chicken Flatbread, Total Flop. First of all its not flatbread. It's made with a tortialla. It's basically an open Quesadilla. When I asked the waiter about it  he has no idea about what he was serving."}
{"text":"This place is quite busy on weekends, so you'll probably be waiting around 15-45 minutes for your table, but in the end, it's usually well worth it. Our server for the last time we were there was Emily - very sweet and accommodating. It's like every other Outback I've been to - great food (usually). Just be warned that the wait time here, like most other Outbacks, can be pretty long."}
{"text":"This is the second time my awesome wife and I have been to this restaurant.  The first time, the food was excellent.  This time the food was awesome.  The service was also awesome. Ammon was our server and he was great. I ordered the filet 9 oz. rare and their awesome Caesar salad with a baked potato.  I eat the whole salad take a few bites of the steak and potato and bring the rest home.  MY wife ordered the 6 oz. filet but she ordered it medium (which I told her to order medium rare but she like most wives refuses to listen to the one who loves her so much) and commented after dinner that she should have ordered medium rare. She ordered a salad and mashed potatoes and both were excellent. Bottom line....Awesome service, Awesome meal.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Terrible service here tonight. They made us wait for a pick up order over an hour because we did not leave a tip. I personally think it is stupid to tip on a pickup order because they make you too before you even get the food and see if the order is right. In the meantime, many cars came and ordered and picked up and got their food. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This Outback Location is absolutely on top of everything.  From the moment you walk in, the place is so clean. The service is always excellent.  I was there yesterday and was just so amazed at how attentive the wait staff was.  The Manager, I believe his name is Jim, is always at the Restaurant.  Numerous times he has come up our table and made sure our meal was excellent.  Yesterday, my friend didn't like the tea he ordered, the waiter could tell from a distance and came right over and asked if there was a different drink he could get him.  Now I am the first one to be critical of an establishment but this place definitely deserves 5 stars.  They go above and beyond in every aspect.  I live in Far West Valley but it is worth the drive to go to this location."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Outback in a while. Two thumbs up for this location. Food was great & the service was impeccable for a chain restaurant. Well done! Definitely will return"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Great spot for special occasions. Get there early, it gets busy."}
{"text":"Change of heart. Only takes one bad server. Came in for 12.99 special I got an email for. It's even on Web page and facebook. He told me no. Why? Does he not like good tippers who also like deals? Or his job?"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a nice dinner with the man & it wasn't to good. We were seated right away which was nice. For an appetizer we ordered the blooming onion & it was good other than the fact that it was drenched in oil & grease. My boyfriend got the Caesar salad with broccoli and the 6 ounce steak and the salad had way to much dressing & we got two small broccoli and the steak was cooked really good. I got the chicken tender platter and it was good other than the fact that they had forgotten to give me any sauces with it, so I had to wait to wave someone down. We waited about a year and a half to come back from getting food poisoning last time & it'll unfortunately be the same wait again just cause we didn't feel it was worth the time anymore."}
{"text":"I come here every week or so and the staff have always been beyond amazing. The food is always delicious too. For a steakhouse they have decent variety of seafood too. The bar is also pretty chill they have Tv's everywhere so you can watch the games playing while waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Server was great and that is the only compliment I can offer for this location. The blooming onion was raw and soggy. The lobster was tough and flavorless and the steak was impossible to eat. With a hundred dollar tab for a family of four all I can say is save the money and eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"We visited the Outback in the Aquarius Hotel in Laughlin, NV on May 26th, 2016. It was really a delicious filet mignon and the servers were awesome! But we live in Mesa, AZ and I'm leery of going to the Outback here, after reading the unfavorable reviews. Have they changed management in Mesa? I would like to go there for our anniversary in August, but am hesitant."}
{"text":"The food taste was good, portion vs. price is very good. service was very good. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Everyone was too lazy to drive to Ping Pang Pong and wait in the long lines so my mom suggested we go to Outback for Mother's Day since we haven't been here in like 10 years.   I ordered the Char Grilled Rib-eye - rare w/fries and mixed vegetables. It was good. I ate a bunch of bread because the food took a long time because they were so busy. The waiter called me a \"eating machine\" because after eating all that bread, I still managed to clean my plate and drink two Arnold Palmers.  My uncle wanted me to write about his salmon in my review. He said it was cooked perfectly but the portion was too small.  I just changed my review to 4 stars because our sever Robert kept us entertained during the long wait for our food."}
{"text":"I am usually not big on chain restaurants. However I can't help but give the local Outback at Chandler Blvd. and the 101 five stars! The wife and I dined there last night with some friends and here is how it went:  1. The doors were held open by two waitresses. 2. We were greeted with smiles from both of them welcoming us and we were also greeted with a smile and a welcome by the hostess.  3. Expecting a wait I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated immediately.  4. We were immediately greeted by our waitress with a smile and a welcome. She was prompt, helpful, and you could just tell that she was there to make our experience a great one!  5. Our friends got some cheese fries which looked awesome but I couldn't eat them because of my diet (low carb). I was laughing when I pointed out that they just HAD to put bacon on those fries. The waitress smiled and left and came back with a bowl of bacon ON THE HOUSE for yours truly! 6. When my steak came out it was cooked to perfection.  7. My drink glass was never empty the entire time.  8. I was asked if I wanted a box for what I couldn't eat.  9. Oh and the manager came by to check on us with a smile. She also asked if we needed anything and when my buddy said he would like some more iced tea instead of sending the waitress back to do that she got it herself!  10. When we left we were again thanked for coming and the doors held open for us BY THE MANAGER!   I have to say that I have never received this high level of service from any restaurant anywhere.   BRAVO!   I give this restaurant and its staff and its management two thumbs up...way up!"}
{"text":"Attention Las Vegas.... This is the worst outback location in the city! It is worth the extra drive to not take out from here. I've done curbside pickup 5 times and they have messed up my order 4 times. This is the final time I have decided to not say something. Attached is a picture of my online confirmation email that shows I ordered mushrooms. Also attached is the 6 onions I received instead of mushrooms. Sure it doesn't seem like a big deal but it's the little things that matter. Last time I carried out they forgot to put a rib eye order in. Please do yourself a favor and do not dine or carry out from this location. They do not care about customer service what so ever!"}
{"text":"We never get to go out and were so excited to actually get off in time to have dinner with our kids. Our food was sub par at best and the service was awful. We were seated right away but our server forgot we were there and took forever to get our order which isn't ok with a toddler. Our food literally took 28 minutes because my sons baby Einstein video was over by the time it got there cold. She took my drink to refill it and never came back. My husbands steak was over cooked and it was always someone else we had to flag down for anything we needed. Cleanliness was also pretty poor and the restroom was deplorable. It wasn't busy they just were not on top of anything. Likely won't go to this location again."}
{"text":"Take out order was wrong.  Now they charge extra for the wedge salad.  I regret tipping the young man who brought out the order since he failed to ensure the order was correct."}
{"text":"Usually this Outback is great, but not today. My family and I go here every couple of weeks and usually the food is terrific value and friendly staff. Today we went the waitress didn't bring any bread and didn't come back to check on our drinks. My husband and I both ordered the Outback special medium. My husband's came out fine, but mine was hardly cooked and rare. When I asked the waitress that I would like mine cooked more to my disbelief she told me that is how they make the medium. After showing her my husbands medium steak cooked how it should be she took it back to be cooked more. Not a good experience. My guess is she was having a bad day or just new to waitressing.  I don't think the staff should argue with the customer about how cooked the steak is. Just take it back and cook it properly."}
{"text":"This location sucks.  I ordered a steak salad for takeout, and it was basically the bag lettuce you can get at Harris Teeter with absolutely none of the other toppings from the menu.  The steak was average at best.  I would have returned it had I not arrived home.  I'll never go to this location again."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing dinner I've had in a while and the service was amazing! I was sitting at the bar with my boyfriend and was helped by Andy (I believe) and nick and they were very happy to help us with our drinks and order. I had the maple mustard pork chops(AMAZING) and my boyfriend had the steak an shrimp. We both had a great time and dinner was delicious!"}
{"text":"I know everyone complains about parking but that's not on the restaurant, that's on the people who decided to open it there.   The food here is good. It's a decent place to eat. Our waitress was kind and helped accommodate my lady (who has very specific eating requirements) and was prompt. We'll be back again. And to visit their sister restaurant Bonefish."}
{"text":"Meh!! Alright, probably my last visit  Warm brown bread- decent  tequila Sauza & soda- didn't like the taste of this tequila   Blooming Onion- not great, but it was free   Peppered Ahi- my friend said the Tuna was ok, slaw was better  Quesodilla- only ok  Mac n cheese- pretty good. A bit too cheesy"}
{"text":"The worst Outback I've been to so far. The waitress was impatient and rushed us to order. I ordered chicken on Barbie and it tasted like frozen chicken. The mashed potatoes were really creamy. I've had this same dish two days ago at an Outback in a different city as we are traveling and they were completely different and way better! She over charged us and said she even asked her manager and that was correct. When I asked to see the menu again she got a manager over and obviously I was right. Not only the waitress had got our order wrong but she wanted us to pay for it.  We are definitely not coming here again! Awful experience!"}
{"text":"I know it is easy to rank on chain restaurants and it is true most Mom & Pop places can beat them with one hand tied behind their backs but they aren't all horrible. I used to think Outback was OK. Of course as far as steakhouses go they are no where near the top of the list, I don't even think they know where the list is or that it even exists. It is cheap, for a steakhouse, and the food was good but this last time I went I was really let down. I know it's the hip new thing is to have smaller square plates but when your smaller plate still looks half empty it is not a good thing. Dress it up a little. Put something else on there beside the steak and potato. It looked a little pathetic. Then we come to the steak itself. It was cooked just the way I want it but it was tough. I felt like when I was a little kid and tried to eat steak and spent 5 minutes chewing one piece. It was very disappointing. Now the service was great. The waiter was really good. Easy going. Friendly. Making little jokes. The place was clean and looked good. Everything was served in a timely manner. Now some places can't even get any of that right but when the biggest factor, the food, falls short. When you are expecting one thing and are so let down it is just disappointing. Will I ever be back? Who knows. Never say never. They do serve Coke Zero which I would normally give an extra point for but I have beer with my steak because the last time I checked I'm a man."}
{"text":"Worst Outback experience ever!  We were headed to the Dells and decided to stop or lunch. Let me preface this with I always trusted Outback to be decent food especially when traveling. We stopped here for lunch which we thought would be quick since it was pretty empty. Our visit however turned into an hour long stay. This would be acceptable I guess if we ordered steak but we ordered salads and soup. Seriously how long does it take to make a salad when you have 5 tables. Our waitress was atrocious. First she never brought bread to our table. It took her 30 minutes to bring my son's grilled cheese and she never refilled our glasses of water or asked if we needed refills. In fact it was hard for us to pinpoint where she was. By the time our salads came out they were soggy from the dressing. My husband's chicken sandwich was cold salty and the bread was soggy, the fries were the only edible part of his meal.   What was even more annoying was the people at the table next to ours received their salads minutes before we did and they received bread without asking. All I can say is if you see this place keep on driving."}
{"text":"Employees service  is just ok. managers seem really good. Glen is great. Employees just need better training. Food is good for the price. I enjoy the house salads with red onions, tomatoes.... Steak sauce should be offered on to go orders."}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars because of the customer service. It was excellent.  I met the owner and he provided great customer service. As far as the food, it's steak, order it medium rare and it's all good."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner Wednesday evening after receiving a gift card from my boss & his wife. We hadn't eaten at an Outback Steakhouse in years and never at this location, which is near our home although a bit off the beaten track. While the first hostess we encountered was quite unfriendly with an attitude that seemed to be discouraging us and other diners from waiting the estimated 15-20 minutes to be seated, and she was later very unsympathetic after she seated a family with 3 noisy young children next to us when we'd conveyed that we would appreciate having a peaceful anniversary meal near other adults, Christy (acting as another hostess and perhaps a member of management?) and our server, Alex J, totally saved the day and our happy occasion. They were both awesome and personable, and they seemed to really care that we had a great anniversary dining experience. I had twin lobster tails with mashed potatoes and asparagus, and everything was prepared perfectly. I was actually amazed at how moist and flavorful the steamed lobster was, and the asparagus was great, too - neither overcooked nor undercooked. My husband had a filet with coconut shrimp, a Caesar salad and sweet potato, and he loved every bite. The salted caramel cheesecake we took home with us was to die for, so I'd highly recommend ordering it.  Again, Christy and Alex J went above and beyond to make this a pleasant dining experience for us. Thanks to them, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Keith was a fantastic server! We had a slight issue with my daughters steak and he fixed it and got Jake the manager involved right away.  We would certainly eat here again, fantastic all around!"}
{"text":"Giving this place three stars is probably generous given my first experience.  The wait time on a Wednesday night was not bad, less than 10 minutes.  The place was not at capacity.  I accompanied my parents to celebrate my dad's birthday.  I ordered the crab cake dinner for 18.99 and got the chicken tortilla soup and mixed vegetables as sides.  Dad's delicious sirloin appeared to be the best deal at 12.97 with one side and my mom ordered the \"dry\" prime rib sandwich.    Here's the deal breaker.  Besides me getting a tiny ice tea spoon for my tortilla soup, we had to ask the waiter for utensils after my parents got served house salads as their sides.  Other wait staff just ignored our hand signals.  Our waiter finally came and didn't even apologize, but blamed it on running out of them.  Seriously?  Give us plastic forks if you run out, but don't leave us hanging.  Anyways, besides not filling our waters because apparently when you order just water, they don't treat you the same way as if you order priced beverages, the waiter anxiously wanted us to leave mid way through our meal asking \"is that it for you guys or did you want to order dessert?\"  Sorry sir, I am still finishing my salty, over fried crab cake savoring it because of the price and not because it tastes any good.  Of course, I didn't say that :). Well, it could have been worse, and we are just thankful the food was filling and service was not extremely, extremely awful.  We won't be coming back anytime soon, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Service is always good but I've been here about 5 times and the food always disappoints. I'm not that much a steak person but sometimes my family drags me along, this time it was for Father's Day. I've tried the wings--they suck and aren't saucy. They said it was buffalo but that's a joke. The macaroni is a fail and so is the pasta. Just not tasty! Finally for Father's Day, I tried the Philly Cheese Steak and it was good in the restaurant (certainly not close to the best philly) BUT it was better that night when I reheated with my microwave!! It made it softer and the cheese gooey. Please serve it like that instead of your way, Outback Steakhouse, you're welcome."}
{"text":"Food was undercooked steak, tiny lobster tail and a baked potatoe that was rock-hard, from being left in the oven way too long.  Server took his time, saw many others getting their food before us, who arrived 15 minuets after us. (guess it is who you know?) Prices advertised for entries on-line had $3 dollars added, to each one, because location was \"franchised.\"  Per waiter(one of the few conversation we had, didn't seem to care about quality.).  I suspect that this restaurant, that caters to an older crowd, have convinced them selves and others, that ok food, that doesn't make you too sick, is good enough.  I have been to this location twice, there will not be a third."}
{"text":"The wait is usually pretty bad so I call ahead. The food is great, but the portions are small for the pretty large price. I would like to be able to take a doggy bag home, but at least the food is wonderful. I always get a steak, I've never been disappointed! I've had some good waiters but I have also had some who needed more training. Their food keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to an Outback Steakhouse before. Won't bother again.  Appies were nasty - deep fried mushrooms and an onion flower. Salty, dull, tough.  My companions both had racks of ribs and seemed to enjoy them. I had a rib eye steak, which probably could have been very nice had it not been immersed in a salty rub.  The atmosphere is very dated, second-rate, typical theme restaurant, and the Australian theme is pretty laughable. Other than a couple of decent Australian beers (Boags and Coopers) you won't find anything here that you can't get at just about any other mid-range steakhouse in America. You can't even get a burger with a slice of pickled beetroot and a fried egg."}
{"text":"Ed is the best server !!! He's amazing! Never had to ask for anything super attentive !!! I suggest you ask for Ed !!"}
{"text":"The food is good and I have to give respect to the staff...but  First, everything basically has an up charge.  I feel bad for the staff because they have to push it.  So if you don't want the fries or a small salad, the other 10 possibilities are either $2.99 to $3.99 more.  Second, and this is not unique to outback, but it was too obvious.  A rack of ribs has 10-13 bovines.  So a half rack should have about 6.  We got 4 tiny ones.  So they split the rack into thirds and sell it as half.    So I won't come back, but I have to be fair.  All of the food tasted really good.  My burger was a perfect Mid-rare.  The table bread was hot.  Blooming onion crispy.  And staff was great.  So if you can get over some of my pet peeves, you will enjoy."}
{"text":"I ordered 2x recently, disappointed twice. 1st time baby back ribs, it was not baby back, just regular ribs, thick and chewy. I ended up threw 1/2 rack away.  Tonight, I had salmon, from normal 7 oz size reduced to 5 oz, very skimpy and dry, yes, I weighted on home scale, just so I didn't misjudge. Don't know if I want to go back any time soon. Prices have gone up and quality and quantity going south."}
{"text":"Outback is solid. The food is consistent, good, and always cooked the right way. I'm obsessed with their bread!  This night, our service was sub-par. I don't remember the guy's name, but he was boring, slow, and paid way more attention to an older couple than he did to our younger-aged group. I hate when servers do that."}
{"text":"When im with a group of people and the consensus is to eat at a particular restaurant, i usually just accept it and not try to make an ass of myself. So it pained me that the group i was with decided to eat at OUTBACK about an hour after landing in Vegas. Outback. Outback folks! I love Outback. But not when i go to Vegas.  A man has to eat. So i suck it up and eat some meat. I order my usualy New York Strip. Everyone gets their food but me. I dont complain. I hate to complain at restaurants. They work hard. Besides, i dont like flem on my steak.  30 min pass and the waiter notices im munching on squaw bread still. He hurries back to the kitchen and apologizes that they forgot my plate. They cook it up and it came out decent, considering it was rushed.  The check came. And it was comp'd. Along with my beer and a chocolate cake. Now thats awesome service!"}
{"text":"Always great, fast, attentive service.  Food is consistent and cooked as ordered.  Love the seared ahi ahi appetizer. We also tried the salted caramel cookie last night and it was to die for, wish it wasnt a seasonal item."}
{"text":"The bartender Sierra and server Cage are the combo to have. The wife and I sat down for a Sunday dinner and unfortunately the steak the wife ordered came out over done... Sierra and Cage took care of it. Cage insisted that it was cooked to order. It was a great experience having such great customer service and the wife and I will be traveling back to that specific outback because of them two."}
{"text":"This is definitely not the place you want to work for as an employee. As a customer, it's fairly decent. The reason I feel this place is going down the shit hole is because of how the owner treats his employees personally. I've spoken to several who have either left on their own time or let go. I have never witnessed and heard of such unfair treatment in my life. The proprietor John Johnson fires people left and right for the poorest of reasons. I've seen it happen now sever times. John is the epitome of evil on how he mistreats his people. I've been told the majority of his employees never get lunch breaks. They can work 11 hour shifts and still maybe be allowed to eat a loaf of bread within 5 minutes. If you find his perspectives or choices unreasonable and voice your opinion on him... Consider yourself history."}
{"text":"We love Outback! The food is great and the service is great! This last time we went was extra special though! Our server Athea was super sweet and was very attentive to us! We had no clue what we wanted to eat that night and she walked us through the menu and recommended some different item. When we got our food, which didn't take long at all, we absolutely loved the recommendations we made! We will definitely be coming back and requesting her!!"}
{"text":"Ordinarily, I don't write reviews on chain places I've visited dozens of times, but this visit to Outback probably merits a little constructive feedback. I'm rating three stars to a store that seems to average only two which is kind of weird in and of itself. I like Outback, their formula has always worked for me and they do a fine job with their menu and their take on chain-outlet beef, chicken and ribs. I was disappointed to notice that the rack of lamb was no longer an option on the menu but I imagine that was a corporate decision based on cost - I know it costs more in the stores these days than it used to.  We visited on a Friday evening around 7 pm. We were able to find parking despite it being fairly busy; we were seated right away because we opted to sit in the bar area. There were people waiting for tables.  Our server was named Olivia. She did an admirable and attentive job taking care of us. She was kind enough to bring us samples of a beer she couldn't describe for us (Great Lakes Cloud Cutter) and we opted for different beers. I had a flight of beers that went light to dark, they were all pretty good. My wife had Brew Moon.  One thing that I noticed was that it seemed like people were being trained on Friday night there, one particular pair of young men in all black (but with no name tags) kept standing near our table and talking and went everywhere together. Not a huge deal except that it was busy in the bar where we were seated and they walked by us at least 10-15 times, and sometimes stood right near us. I suspect Olivia was new as well, she was accompanied by a silent and stern-looking manager when she brought our beer samples, and sadly, did not bring us any bread until we asked, which was after we got our salads.  The food was as we ordered and it was good; a blooming petals appetizer, a wedge salad, a side salad, a large Ahi appetizer stood as the entree for my wife and I had the 12 oz prime rib with a baked sweet potato. Everything was good and I do love a baked sweet potato! One beer and one flight brought the total to $70.00 including tax and tip.  Anyway, looking at many of the other reviews it seems like this store has had a chronic issue with executing customer service and I will say we had minor customer service issues on this visit. I like how Outback does steaks, and I don't mind a little bump in the road of service - If I wanted a flawlessly executed steakhouse experience I wouldn't look for it at a chain restaurant near a suburban strip mall, and I do think that this kind of restaurant suffers from unfair expectations and comparisons...but given the period of time over which the low reviews seem to persist, and mostly over customer experience, clearly there is room for improvement and that would fall on management in my opinion. But the food was good."}
{"text":"I remember a time when I was ecstatic to go to the Outback steakhouse.  Enjoy an excellent piece of steak cooked perfectly with enjoyable sides.  Not anymore is that the case.  I started my meal with a cup of potato soup.  It was just ok, a bit over salted.  Tried the bread but it was a bit doughy, we couldn't cut it with the knife so it ended up folded instead of sliced.  Next the steak & potato.  I did enjoy my sirloin, it was seasoned well & cooked within requested temperature, quite enjoyable.  The potato, blah.  It was over cooked & tasted very dry.  No amount of butter or sour cream helped rescue the potato.   Overall, I enjoyed my company & my steak but that was all.  It seems the Outback, like most restaurants, have given up on creating a complete meal with excellence.  It would be nice to enjoy my complete meal."}
{"text":"I use the call ahead or online carry out here.  Great service in a timely fashion!"}
{"text":"Blooming onion was burnt. Alice Springs chicken was rubbery. Pasta with shrimp was so dry. The only item that was actually good was the French onion soup. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go because she has been craving a blooming onion for, well, a long time.  We finally went for lunch.  We started out sitting in the bar but couldn't get service so asked to be moved to the dinning room.  She was serving all of the people at the bar as well as every table in the bar area.  Not sure if this was due to greed or poor management.  Anyway we ordered the blooming onion that my wife had been craving.  This was the worst onion I had ever had.  I will admit, it's not like I have eaten at several Outback's, but from what I do remember, they were awesome.  The one we had was soaked with grease, almost like it had been sitting there for awhile.  It actually gave me an upset stomach for several hours after.  My wife had the chicken strips (if you have read any of my other posts, you may see a trend) and I had the fish tacos.  Both were ok and that's about it.  It is typical chain food."}
{"text":"During the previews for Iron Man 2 at Sam's Town, Outback Steakhouse boasted a free appetizer with entree purchase with our ticket stub. Being Mother's Day and since my mother and I are both fans, we decided to head on over.   Even though upon arriving they told us it was a 20-30 minute wait, we got in there in less than 15 minutes. We let our server know about the deal which he did take off our bill at the end of the night. My mom got the Outback special with snow crab legs, with a side salad and baked potato. I got the bloomin' onion to share, a side caesar salad and a baked potato as well. There aren't too many vegetarian options obviously (and I didn't feel like getting the Parmesan pasta dish that they did have) but the sides are a meal on their own.   The pacing was very nice on the food. Got the bloomin' onion first which was hot and fresh and super delicious, then we got the salad and the bread (the salads definitely needed more dressing, but our server brought us more right away - also I'm pretty sure they changed the dressing recipe as well which is not as good. And $4.75 for a small salad bowl is kind of a rip-off.). Shortly after my mom got her main course and I got my baked potato. The potatoes are always great but I got mine with cheese, but there was hardly any on it. Although with the amount of butter I have consumed today, maybe that should be a non-issue.   My mom's steak was made to her satisfaction, and holy shit at the crab legs. I think this was a good winter because these snow crabs were freakin' mutant-size. They were so big my mom only had one bite of her steak before calling it a night.   Overall I do love the food (the salad was the only \"meh\" part, I really hope we got some weird dressing batch) and the price wasn't bad, evened out to $15 each including tip, and we got the bloomin' onion free. I was also expecting the customer service to be awful since they were extremely busy but we got excellent service which is the main reason I will continue to come here, butter overload and all."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than sitting outside on a coolish night enjoying the company of your husband and eating good food. We were out and about and decided to stop in and have dinner, since it was so nice out we asked to sit outside. The waitress was friendly and attentive and even laughed at my husband when he said they sat us here at the end so we can just leave after we eat no need to pay..lol. We asked here about a few different choices as we were torn on what we wanted to try that we had not tried in the past. She was engaging and offered her opinion on the food. She also gave her suggestions on some of the drink specials they had. We both ordered a cocktail and our meal. The food was great, My husband ordered the talipia with lump crab(which he had before) and he said it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. I had chicken with Monterrey jack cheese mushroom and bacon(forgot the name) which the waitress said was delish and it was, the chicken was moist and had a nice honey mustard sauce on it. The food and atmosphere made for a great evening"}
{"text":"By far the worst outback I have been to its started with waiting over 5 mins for someone to come and seat is 2 servers saw us waiting said nothing finally a girl came from the back chewing and sat us no sorry for the wait nothing. Then we waited 10 mins for server then after we got our drinks and bread he asked if we needed a minute we said we did we waited so long for the server I forgot we had not ordered our food came out my potatoes were cold it took about 7 minster a waiter for me to tell him then he wanted me to scrape the potatoes on another plate I was like I would like the whole plate re made I wait another 15 mins my husband is done eating and waiting for a refill that took forever because waiter forgot my food comes out its the same food I know because my potatoes I smashed them and they came back the same way they just added a few extra pieces of broccoli to the plate if they were just going to microwave my food why did I have to wait 15 mins I will not be back to this location if there was a 0 star option they would of gotten that"}
{"text":"We have Dine-Rewards with Outback and so we either dine in or order from the Outback on Clearview Avenue in Mesa all the time. Our dine-in orders are fine, but the staff just can't get our order right when we place it to go. Either they don't give us credit towards our Dine-Rewards program or they mess up our order...EVERY SINGLE TIME. About a month ago, we ordered four meals and my husband's meal was missing entirely when he got home and discovered it. He called the manager immediately and had to drive back over there to get his entrée. Then a couple of weeks ago, we place a \"to-go\" order and when we got it home my order of broccoli was missing. I wrote the manager but haven't heard a thing back.  We are pretty tired of our takeout orders being messed up each time, so we may have to forego going there, even though we love the food."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner for my mother-in-law and she really wanted to come here. We were all satisfied and the food was good, not great. The french onion soup was way too salty but the steaks were good, not great. The best part of the meal was the service. Carli was our server. She and the team did a great job of taking care of our party. Very impressed with the service."}
{"text":"Almost any Outback you walk into is going to be a good meal. This one has the added burden of being next to the eternally busy, Concord Mills. For the amount of traffic they deal with, the staff was attentive and the food was good. If you don't want a wait, sit at the bar. It is rarely busy there."}
{"text":"I quit going to this place years ago as it was a sh-thole then and sounds like things haven't changed much, plus the allure of the \"bloomin' onion\" wore off a LONG time ago......with all the great steak places in Charlotte to go to, why would ANYONE still want to go here?...a little hint, as far as chain-restaurants go, Texas Roadhouse serves a GREAT steak and a great meal, I'd compare some of their cuts w/anything I've gotten at a Sullivans or Ruth's Chris...as far as an upscale steakhouse I don't think you can beat Sullivans"}
{"text":"We stopped by Outback on Sunday. It was very crowded. I almost left and went to another location however I am happy that we did not. There was no delay in service. Michelle was our waitress and boy was she pleasant. She had an amazing personality and provided great service. Our food and margaritas were delicious so that was an additional plus. I will go back again and hopefully Michelle will be there."}
{"text":"Lunch at Outback Steakhouse while Pearle Vision puts new lenses in my glasses. This is my first time to get out of an Outback for under $100, but it's my first time there alone, and for lunch. Coffee, a lunch combo with soup and a burger, bread, plus tip ran about $18. It was delicious and well worth the price. The service was great, too."}
{"text":"Service was better this time around, I went for lunch and the server was very nice,I still think it took a long time but maybe that because I was in a hurry."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean and very curious staff for an outback steakhouse. Very surprised by the staff. They must have a very good manager  I don't typically like chains but this place always keeps me coming back"}
{"text":"So disappointed... actually posting this from my bathroom...usually go to Roadhouse but thought would stay closer to home...ordered bone in ribeye..: they charge $6 more than Roadhouse charges but I guess you have to pay for the extra gristle and fat...so much garlic in the mashed potatoes I felt like I was Corey Haim trying to find out if the guy my mom is dating is a vampire....and the coffee...Folgers Crystals would have been more enticing. Save your money, this place is a dump.....speaking of, did I mention I'm posting this from the bathroom?"}
{"text":"Terrible service. They said we had a 25 minute and ended up going waiting for about 1 hour."}
{"text":"Omgosh. It has been a while since I came to this location. It has been remodeled and the ambience when you walk in the door is amazing. The waiting area is like a lounge space in a club or bar. The upgraded bar is almost swanky.  As far as the food, I always rely on old faithful. Medium wings and a 1/2 order of Aussie fries. You can't go wrong. They did have a special for a 3 course steak meal for 11.99.  I just took a sip of my Wallaby Darned drink, frozen daiquiri peach flavored and it was only 4 bucks.Yummy."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Outback in about 10 years and couldn't figure out why.  It obviously wasn't that great a decade ago otherwise I would have visited again.  My husband and I were out running errands and dinner time came upon us, so the closest thing was Outback.  My husband wanted a steak, so I didn't mind.  We got there at about 6:50ish and were told the wait would be about 15 mins.  The restaurant was packed with people waiting, so the only seating available was outside.  It was about 112 degrees and felt like a blow dryer with the wind kicking up.  I also had my 2-year old waiting outside braving the heat.  There was a complimentary water jug for people waiting outside, but it sat empty the entire time.  About 25 minutes passed... So I decided my daughter's red flushed cheeks were a sign I should squeeze inside.  We basically stood right in the doorway just to get some AC, having to move out of the way every time customers entered or exited.  Another 35 minutes went by, and my daughter grew increasingly restless and hungry.  I told my husband to see if they skipped us or something and he was told we were up soon.  It was probably another 10 minutes before we were called.  I already decided at that point that I would not be coming back.  I thought about going next door to Yogurtland for dinner numerous times.  I don't mind waiting 5, 10 or even 15 minutes past what I'm told, but don't lie to me when you know the wait is no where close to 15 minutes.  Terrible customer service.  I would have rather them be honest and tell me it would be over an hour.  That way I could make the decision whether to stay and wait or find some place else.  After being seated, I ordered the salmon and it tasted like a cup of salt had been dumped on it; it was bad.  The price of the nasty fish I just ate pissed me off further.  My husband ordered a medium-rare steak and what he got was medium in some spots and well in others.  He doesn't complain much, but I could tell by the way he kept inspecting it, he wasn't too happy.    For the price of average food (way too high), I was extremely disappointed.  The wait time is what basically pushed me over the edge, especially having to wrangle a hungry, hot 2-year old for over an hour.  Hopefully I don't make the same mistake in another decade."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly but not the most attentive. I had salad ....can't really mess that up. But my husband's steak was extremely tough. The manager was accommodating and tried to replace but the replacement  was just as tough. Place was noisy .... will not be back"}
{"text":"Service was great but the 22 Oz bone in ribeye was very disappointing.  Mainly fat and bone. Where's the Beef? Taking a break from Outback."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but they make great steaks. Simple cooked beef. I don't even bother going elsewhere for steaks anymore"}
{"text":"I give a four star because of the quality of food and I have always enjoyed Outback Steakhouse however, on this visit we had a waiter with a bad attitude. Nonetheless, Tiffany the manager was more than extremely helpful with restoring peace and our love for Outback Steakhouse. I'm a firm believer in one bad apple can spoil the bunch but, in this case I can't blame the whole chain for this one rude server. Tiffany replaced him with a vey cheery waitress and balance was restored. She comped our visit which was more than we expected and offered a  gift card that just further help to restore my confidence in the Outback chain. I look forward to having a great experience next time!"}
{"text":"Although there were quite a few people waiting our  wait was very short.  After ordering the food,  came right away did not have to wait long for the food.  Food was delicious steak was great juicy.  Our server Shea was great. Cheesecake was true New York cheesecake was delicious..... I will even go to say it was better than the Cheesecake Factory.   Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and were there a couple minutes before they opened. We were seated immediately in the bar area. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful but it took about 15 minutes to get the bread and butter and when we did get it it was hard. Like they just toasted an old loaf and served it to us. My husband ordered the grass fed burger with cheddar and i had the prime rib french dip sandwich. My husband said his burger was ok. My sandwich however seemed like had stale or day old bread. We notified the waiter in regards to the bread and he apologized and said the head waiter whom is supposed to have fresh bread ready was 20 minutes latr that day and they just were really not ready when they opened today. He did offer to bring us fresh bread but it was a little late at that point but he brought it anyway and it was better.  Outback is pretty expensive for lunch and I do expect a bit more for my money when eating herr. I can say I am now over Outback and will stick to Texas Roadhouse even though they don't serve lunch during the week."}
{"text":"Service here gets worse each time I go. Called today for a curbside order, genius starts to tell me, they are open, yet can't take my order  Mgmt needs to address the staff here, I'll take my business down to 131 Main."}
{"text":"Best staff I've ever seen at an outback. Great food! Great atmosphere. I'll be coming back for more very soon. Also I love that you can call in Togo and they will bring it right out to you!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for dinner. Always can count on them on their quality and great service.  Thanks outback"}
{"text":"I went to this outback when Betty was the manager on shift and Christina was the server their way of the place was spectacular and amazing. I know A-1 service when I see it and it's been a month and I shall remember  their names and how amazing their service was. It was a memorable time thank you so much!!! You both were awesome"}
{"text":"This was my first Outback visit in several years.  Our waitress disappeared after the food arrived and she never fulfilled the requests of some of our party so that was thoroughly disappointing.  The manager did take care of the check and brought another entree for that person so that was nice, but sad that the waitress couldn't just follow through.  Overall, service was extremely slow.  As far as food, the onion is still good and my burger was alright.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"on new years eve we were sitting at the bar when we both witnessed the waitress drop a fork on the floor and pick it up and place it back on the salad and served it that way to her customer.  on the way out we mentioned this incident to the general manager who showed no interest in the matter. he never bothered to ask us which waitress commit this disgusting infraction, no reaction whatsoever, said nothing, like he did not give a damn about the situation.  after numerous visits this shall be our final visit."}
{"text":"Went to this location for a late lunch with a couple of friends.  It was my first time.  Since it was sort of between their lunch rush and dinner service, we were seated quickly.  Our server was great.  She arrived at our booth with a smile and a welcoming greeting.  She took our drink orders and before we even had a chance to look at the menu, she was back with the drinks.    Two of us had steak and baked potatoes and one had a burger.  The food arrived in a timely manner.  The food was prepared just as we had requested.  The steaks were surprisingly tender.  I guess I had thought they wouldn't be very good since this is a chain restaurant and sometimes the food isn't up to par.  Not so with this place.  Also, the burger was just as my friend ordered it.  I asked for some extra sour cream.  She asked if we would like some more bread.  She returned with the sour cream which was enough for two of us and the bread.  Throughout the meal she returned occasionally and asked how the food was and whether we needed anything else.  She also brought refills for two of our drinks, but not for the milk.  Guess you have to pay if you want a 'refill' on the milk.  Seemed just a bit petty.  Overall, I was impressed with the service and the food.  I would certainly recommend this location and will definitely try it again for dinner."}
{"text":"Been here 25 minutes waiting, water glass has been empty for 20 minutes, server just realized she forgot to put my order in..."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar after flying and was promptly greeted by a friendly bartender and quickly served. Food was the quality that you would expect a good outback & came out super fast! I was in and out in 30 minutes which was perfect for me."}
{"text":"We were given a gift certificate to Outback Steakhouse and have been here twice for lunch.  We're not too impressed.  My wife hasn't found anything she likes.  The first time we were there I ordered a steak medium (hot pink center).  It was served well done (no pink whatsoever).  I told the water.  Try number 2 was rare - Blood Red center.  I could tell just by touching it that it was barely cooked.  I showed it too the waitress.  The chef came out with the try number three - Largely red center, some pink.  His attitude said \"try to send it back\".  I just didn't want to fight any more about it, so I took it.  If the chef can't tell how a steak is cooked by touch then he's not very good.  We went there again yesterday for a late lunch.  They seated my wife and I immediately and gave us Brandon as our server.  We waited several minutes for our daughter and then another several minutes until Brandon came over to greet us smelling of cigarette smoke (did they give us a server who was on a smoke break?).   He took our drink orders and came back.  My daughter's order was wrong (steak tacos with only steak and taco).  I had a hamburger, but there was no ketchup or mustard on the table.  We had to wait (a while) to get our server's attention, then he came over.  I asked for ketchup and mustard and then another wait began.  He got several people water, took another table's order and then another person came out with the Ketchup and Mustard for the burger (why wouldn't you ask about that when you take the order).  Anyway, not a good experience.  We still have enough on the gift card for one more meal.  After that we won't be back."}
{"text":"This location does not honor the advertised prices on the Outback commercials. This was really disappointing and in our opinion, misleading and deceptive. We probably won't go back to this location unless they start honoring their marketing ploys."}
{"text":"Just walked out. We had some good experiences with the food recently. Took my daughter for a quick bite after soccer. They must have been busy because it was a 15 minute wait on a Tuesday. Host said it was first come first served in the bar so we went to a high top table. No menus? Sat for 2-3 minutes and another couple came in behind us. Bar tender came out - to the other couple -said sometime would be right there. Gave us the same message. Did not offer water or menus. Waited 2-3 more minutes. Finally a server came out... And helped the other couple first. ( it was not first come first served!) A clue for the non-parent servers: kid in soccer uniform = hungry. After almost 10 minutes with out menus, water or a server we got up and left. Host (who talked to us just 10 minutes before) did not seem concerned we were leaving. Bummer because the food has been good lately. Poor service is preventable."}
{"text":"Our waitress and the manager went out of her way to make our visit pleasant. Even sending out a sample of their special  shrimp sauce which was delicious! Service and food were great"}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised how much I like Outback.  I think it is one of the better chain restaurants.  I'm consistently had better steaks at Outback than a lot of the more high end, expensive restaurants.  I don't get to Outbacks too often, but every time I do, I leave very impressed by the meal I just had.    I came in here the other night as I was staying in the area and this place was pretty close to my hotel.  I grabbed a booth and was greeted by my server very quickly.  Service was good and attentive throughout the meal which is always appreciated.    My go to order here is the Outback special.  I went with the 9 ouncer on this visit.  I ordered it with fries and a caesar salad.  Outback makes one of the best caesar salads I've ever had and it is always served on a freezing cold plate.  The salad was excellent.  I hate to go on and on about a salad but it really is excellent.    I ordered my steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Once again, it was a phenomenal cut of meat.  At about $15 or $16, this steak was much better than others I've paid $40+ for.  It was so lean and there was barely any fat/waste to it.  I was very impressed by the steak and I'll definitely be getting it again.  The one negative to Outback is that their fries aren't very good.  I kind of always forget about that before I order them.  I'm definitely going with another side next time.    This particular Outback can actually be a little difficult to find and I recommend they put some better signs out on the road.  The parking lot is huge so it's not hard to get a spot.  For the quality of food, the prices are very reasonable and they weren't too packed on a weeknight.  I'd have no problem returning."}
{"text":"No more!  Wish I had read the reviews before eating here. Like to sit in the bar but the help is not so friendly.   Can hear them talking about how they want to be off work and away from this place.   Rewards program is a JOKE!!!!!  Manager Michael is not for helping customers.  Plenty of places to eat in Las Vegas. BYE BYE"}
{"text":"Bad service, food was OK only real problem was the food was slightly undercooked but still well seasoned. Vincent was our server and since we had a father's day coupon I guess he assumed that we were just going to be ten percent tippers, we'll he was right and to receive that little from two servers with over a decade of food service experience you had to really slip up especially when we saw that every other table in his section got great service. Won't say I'll never come back but if he was our server the next time we would probably ask for a new server."}
{"text":"Great for lunch. Dinner? No. Closest compliment you will get from me. Food was gross, drinks were too sweet and the menu was a mess. They wanted to rush us out of there before we even step foot in the door."}
{"text":"Great service & amazing food! If you go, you must get the mac n cheese bites and/or the cheesecake; ask for Seth he was funny and entertaining!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I love their call-ahead service. It was great to be able to walk in and be seated so quickly. The bread is always great...one of my favorite complimentary breads. The blooming onion was a little disappointing...super greasy...not up to it's usual standard for sure. The steak was good...for the price. A little fatty though. The veggies were perfect, well seasoned and well cooked. The service was fantastic. And I love those new mini milkshakes, perfect size!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here a few times.  I don't recall that we ever had a bad meal or any sort of negative experience."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the female blond bartender. It took me a few days to get over what had happened. She tries to be sweet in your face by calling you \"Honey, Sweetie, etc\" but she is really in the wrong industry. She snaps and has an attitude without listening first. The bar was full the night we came in but seriously not our problem and when she makes mistakes and has to call for a manager she makes comments and tells her bar back to call the manager because \"she's not going to call the manager again\" (her words). I mean she is the one making a mistake and has the nerve to have an attitude about fixing it. We eat out often and we like to tip well- I did give her our regular tipping because I do understand that this is a livelihood and it was the holidays but her arrogance still bothers me. I don't want to go in full detail because it does get my blood boiling and don't want to re-live this night but I do have to mention one more thing- when you go for happy hour, their menu is not updated so when you ask for a drink and she has to fix it, she has attitude and instead of apologizing for not having accurate pricing or menus she tells me to \"remember for next time\". So if I come in 2 months from now I need to memorize their specials instead of going off their happy hour menu. Its the stupidest thing a bartender has ever told me. She should know her stuff but if not (we're all human) just fix it without making it seem like we're the dumb ones asking for the correct price. Thanks Outback for hiring an employee that makes us feel stupid for asking for the happy hour prices during happy hour. This was only a couple things that happened throughout the dinner. I have thought about complaining to corporate because it was such a bad experience. I just haven't decided if its worth it yet."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I arrived in this area. Always eat at the bar area. Food is very good. 2 of the servers, Amanda and Megan give OUTSTANDING service while keeping up with the drink orders. Friendly and attentive staff. Great folks. Marlboro man."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a very busy Thursday night. We had the pleasure of having Brandon as our server.  It was obvious the night was busy as other servers asked for drink orders while Brandon ran the bar top full of patrons.  As an ex server I noticed his computer system was giving him a lot of issues but he kept a clear head.  Happy I came in tonight to see such a hard working individual who works with great heart. A patron left her card and Brandon ran after her.. with a full bar and drinks needing to be filled he did the right thing and put forth the extra effort."}
{"text":"This review is not the food itself since I left before I even got seated. This is more about the hostess service. Yes, it was a busy Saturday night so I asked her how long the wait was for 2 people and she told me, without hesitation, 25 minutes. After waiting about 30 minutes, i went up and asked if it was our turn yet. She told me it would be ANOTHER 20 minutes wait. And I overheard her telling every single person who were barely coming in the wait was 25 minutes. How is that even possible? You are wasting people's time by giving them BS wait times! Please do your job and actually check first."}
{"text":"Between the Belz South Strip location and the newer Stephanie St. location in Henderson I've had very few problems.  The meal is generally well executed and as requested (sometimes asking for \"rare\" doesn't get you RARE), service can fall behind easily during rushes but that's anywhere, too. For fair portions with better than average flavors at a friendly price, it will do."}
{"text":"SO ANGRY! I will note that, for a chain, outback is pretty good. Sadly, chandler blows. I am so angry and I want my $34 back.   I ordered curbside to go. Please understand that you have to give them the make, model, and color of your car. So I ordered and it said online it would be ready in 20 min. I got to outback in 18 mins. Thought that was great...   When I got there, the 4 \"to go\" spots were taken - one by a car which had no driver and was clearly not waiting for food. I parked in the very next spot - no to go sign, but right next to those. Left car on, lights on, watched, waited... Nothing... For 41 minutes. At that point I thought, they know what I'm driving, they know they have food sitting in the kitchen getting cold, it can't possibly be that I'm one...parking...spot...over... Can it? So I back up my car and park on the OTHER side of the douche that took to go parking. I sh** you not, 4 seconds later a server brings my food. I dressed her down asking why she left me out there for 40 mins when she knew what I was driving and the spots were full, she meekly said I parked in the wrong spot. I am still pissed at her. Great customer service. Moron.   Got home, guess what? My medium rare burger is now well done, stone cold, and inedible. My husband's med rare steak is med well and also cold. This particular outback owes me $34.  Don't get curbside here. The waitress decided not to pay attention, then not care after I called it out, management didn't care, and the food blew (though it was probably correct when they bagged it - I doubt it's the chef's fault). Go to McClintock and Southern. They actually give a sh** about their customers.    BTW, if outback management reads this, I hope you talk to your staff about looking at the CARS you expect, not zeroing in on a spot. I'm starving, ripped off, and angry.   And I still want my $34 back. We're not all rich."}
{"text":"Service was quick and good. I ordered a well done steak and when I got it still had red juicy on plate. I had to send it back to kitchen and they cooked it a bit longer."}
{"text":"Justin is the best waiter ever! He was super friendly and super in tune to everything we needed. Our food was absolutely amazing! The best steak I have had in quite a while. Thank you so much outback team and Justin!!! We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here late Tuesday night and I received the best meal and the best service I've had in a while. There is a outback right near my house in N. VEGAS but would totally be making the drive to this location for the customer service."}
{"text":"Overall the dinner was fair. The broccoli wasn't cooked all the way through, the medallions were more medium when I asked for medium-well and although the server didn't have a horrible attitude, she made plain responses such as \"ok\" when my girlfriend said her salad was very soggy and sent it back."}
{"text":"I paid $15 for a tiny overcooked steak and a tiny baked potato. I ordered my steak medium rare and it was well done. Server apologized but didn't do anything to make it right."}
{"text":"The last time we came here it was horrible. We thought we would give it another try tonight. We made a mistake. I gave 2 stars because the poor manager was running around putting fires out at a lot of tables. He was doing the best he could. First our blooming onion came our burned. The waitress said yes I thought it looked bad. It's her job to take care of that before it hits the table. We got  another onion. It was greasy as all get out. The salad had a funky taste to it. Had to send the steak back. Waaaayyy too much seasoning. While sitting there we saw 3 other orders go back to the kitchen and that was just in our small little area. The cooks need to get their acts together and the servers need to know they do not have to serve crappy food. Will be a long time before we give this one a try again. The manger did refund the onion and gave us a discount. I felt bad for him."}
{"text":"Called ahead and put our name in and were told 25-35min. Ok, time to drive there & get gas on the way.  Showed up 25min later and they told us 25-45min wait. What?! Not so brilliant hostess says your wait time was cut in half! This service didn't meet any expectations.  Fuzzy math left us laughing as we eat at Charleston's next door with no wait."}
{"text":"Ordered two wood fire 22oz rib-eyes medium. The steaks took awhile to come out. My wife's steak was better than mine but was more rare than medium. My steak was truly tough! I had it sent back and the manager agreed it was tough and ordered another one to be sent out. When it arrived it was just as tough and poorly cooked. It was rare. Although I'm grateful that she didn't charge me for the one steak it was a drag to go out and look forward to a nice dinner only to be deeply dissatisfied with our experience there! I vow NEVER to eat at Outback ever again. You'd think they'd have it together when it comes to knowing steak... Ten thumbs down!  Ps. The staff was very nice but I feel sorry for them having to defend such a poor product!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Outback, this location many times. I have always had no problems with my meals (but I would usually order the Salad with crispy chicken.. can't rememberr the name at the moment). But my husband had a problem a couple months back with his steak. It was raw, I mean 'still mooing', raw.   The other night, on our anniversary, we decided to go give it another try. We were seated promptly and had a wonderful waiter. He was so attentive and personable. We told him it was our anniversary and chose Outback to eat because I was craving a margarita.  We both ordered the special, 'Turf and Surf' but upgraded the meat to a filet. We discussed with outr waiter (Josh ?) that we wanted it pink inside, not raw, and he told us what we already knew: order it medium.  He said medium rare is RARE! Medium is pink inside and just a touch of grilling on the outside. A different server delivered our plates and I immediately saw that my filet was black. Shriveled and black. I cut it in half (not easy either)  and the inside was gray and tough. My husband's was the same. Our waiter happened to be at the booth behind me and asked how our food was. He looked at the plates at the same time as I said, 'This is NOT medium, this is burned!'  He apologized up and down and went to tell the manager and order us 2 more correctly cooked steaks. We ate the lobster tails becasue they were getting cold and pushed around our potatoes. Meanwhile, across the aisle from us and one booth back, the same thing was happening over there. The woman got her order which was incorrect, the manager came out eventually (after ours was served) and apologized and handed her the newly cooked meat. The customer  cut into it and it was wrong again. The manager came back to her once more and I saw the woman point at us (as she had seen what happened with our food.) When our food did arrive,  it was pink but our centers were blood red. I did not want to re-order because it was getting late as it was and honetly, I was hungry. It was also served with fresh mashed potatoes, but our anniversary meal was kind of ruined.   I thought maybe after all that mess, we maybe could have gotten a free 'dessert'? (No!) Something definitely was wrong with the kitchen that night. Either the cook was asleep at the grill or they have defective equipment, as in a 'timer'.  We are going to say goodbye to Outback for now, and it's ashame because we had enjoyed it in the past."}
{"text":"What you say: We take pride in serving the freshest, highest-quality food possible. Everyday we start fresh, making all of our soups, salad dressings & sauces from scratch. What we experienced: Worst meal AND service EVER!!! And the manager on duty, yeah, his give a damn is busted! No offer to take anything off our meal, KNEW we were upset so he offered us a dessert \"to go\". You really should investigate the Bell Road Phoenix AZ location. Bloomin' Onion was dripping grease, medium steaks we medium rare, coconut shrimp was burnt to a crisp and the service we received was absolutely deplorable! Only good thing about our date night at your \"used to be fine\" establishment was the company of my husband! To think, we drove 80 miles to put up with that...what a shame! Thanks for nothing Outback!"}
{"text":"I like Outback Steakhouse, but have had a few bad meals here recently. My steak has been very over cooked. I order it medium, and it comes out beyond well done. One visit, I could hardly cut my steak, and when I flipped it over, I realized it was completely black underneath and they had put that side down in attempts to hide how charred and over cooked it was."}
{"text":"It's been years since I have been out an Outback and you know, I don't know it has been so long!  I forgot what a great place Outback is if you are looking for a meal at a larger chain.  My boyfriend and I ate at the bar and we enjoyed very pleasant, quick service.  I had the Outback Classic and he had the Ahi Tuna and both were prepared and cooked perfectly; I was truly impressed! It was just the right amount of food and I didn't feel like I just consumed a processed mess. It may not be high on my places to re-visit (I like t frequent locally owned places as much as I can) but I look forward to coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE!! I've been going to this Outback for years now and this is the first time I have ever received bad service.  Our server was pretty rude and he did not smile at all, not even once. I even tried to crack a joke but he didn't even laugh whatsoever. He was also a one word type of person and very monotoned. I just felt so annoyed the whole time I was there. Seems like he didn't care about the customers. I really wish we could've gotten a better server, because he definitely ruined my mood.  Oh! And when we were heading out, the hostess didn't even say bye or thank you to us. I had to be the one to say thank you to them and they didn't even acknowledge it -__-"}
{"text":"Our waitress Michelle was amazing! She kept up with our table with drinks and food, she knew the food and drinks and she was fast with service! The food was cooked just how we asked and Jason checked in on us as well as doing other duties in the restaurant! Best food experience I've ever had"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and this was the best experience! We had Richard as our waiter, he kept up on drinks and was very helpful when ordering. He had a great personality as well as the hostess'. The food was cooked perfect and we are leaving with full bellies!"}
{"text":"I normally avoid reviewing places that already have a bunch of reviews that pretty much say everything there is to say about that place (usually it's restaurants), but my family hosted a birthday dinner for me here last night, and I have to write about my experience.  The first thing I noticed was how busy the place is. So when they started messing up some of the orders at the table, it was understandable because the waiter and waitress were really trying hard to keep up with everything. I was the last one to order and they actually forgot about me for a while. Whatever, s'all good. When I placed my order, and they asked me what kind of dressing do I want for my salad, I replied \"Italian\" and that was exactly what I was in the mood for. First shocker of the night: she looks at me and says \"We don't carry Italian dressing.\" I just looked at her for a minute, looked around at my family with a face like \"is this lady serious?\" So I asked what they DO have, she said honey mustard dressing. GAG! I ordered balsamic vinagrette, which they also didn't have, but she assured me they had a balsamic-like dressing. I thank the stars it was brought on the side because a) my girlfriend's salad was SOAKED in dressing and b) the balsamic-like dressing was honey mustard dressing! I couldn't believe it. As far as the steaks went, mine was great, but my girlfriend had to send hers back three times. We both ordered the filet mignon, and hers was really, really fatty, not worth the $23 it costs. They brought another one, then had to recook it because it was slightly too raw, but then it was perfect.  They brought me ice cream and sang me the birthday song and all that, then when it came time to leave, the final shocker: they cancelled our bill! Family members took the money they were going to use to pay for the food to give it to me for a bonus birthday present.. WoW Outback, good on you! We were all glowing when we left. They handled things well, all things considered.  I gave this place 4 stars not 5 because well, I'm a fan of this place, I don't love it to death though. Didn't seem right to bump it to 5 stars just because when you rate a restaurant, you have to take into consideration every factor that goes into running a restaurant, and I haven't been here in such a long time. When I come back again, if the service, atmosphere, and food continue to be superb, I will change my rating to 5 stars. For now, I wanted to bring attention to what they did last night that totally made my birthday!"}
{"text":"Out of full disclosure, this was probably two-years ago...   Went with my brother and mom, we each ordered a filet mignon. The cuts they gave us were a joke. I sent mine back. My mom and brother didn't, but were upset because of the half-inch thick cut of meat that was NOT a filet, but perhaps a top sirloin.    After I sent mine back, the manager came over asking if everything was ok.  I said no, and told him that my companions were too polite, but that all three steaks were terrible, and NOT filet mignon.  He explained that the sad little cuts of meat were necessary because they wanted their steaks medium well. Wtf???  (That's rubbish, and doesn't explain the trash they tried to sell to me.)  So basically, his response was \"Suck it, that's the garbage we sell here.\"  I used to think Outback was a good value with decent food for the money. Well? Not anymore, or at least not this one. Beware. This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"I'v been there twice just recently....GREAT....onion petals a little late, but good, an not charged for them! BONUS! Nice wait staff, nice booths, really good food!"}
{"text":"Have not been to this Outback since the Texas Roadhouse opened next door. But today I decided to give them a  try with take out ribs. Surprised that the ribs only come with one side a second side cost extra. The person taking my phone order was pleasant and the food was available as promise in 20 minutes. The ribs had little taste and were very dry. The sauce on the ribs was over done almost burned. The mashed potatoes were  typical restaurant food butt the salad was bland and the bread was dried out. The bread seemed like it had been microwaved to make it warm. Very disappointed in the food. Will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Rave reviews about our $11.99 steak special!  We had great service, got right in on a Sunday night and our dinner was delicious.  5 stars for this Outback!  Fabulous!"}
{"text":"We go to this place every time we're in town and always have a good experience. The last time we were there, it was during March Madness, and the place was packed. We were afraid it would take forever to get anything. But despite the crowd, our server, Pablo, did everything he could to make sure we were happy. That guy goes above and beyond for the customers, and I hope his manager recognizes that. When we go back to Las Vegas, we'll stop in as we always do, and we'll request Pablo as our server."}
{"text":"The staff and manager of this Outback are excellent. Today in Las Vegas there is usually crappy customer service but not here. I was very impressed by them."}
{"text":"This Outback Steakhouse is located right on the Las Vegas strip, which is great if you're looking for a less pricey bite to eat in the area. It is located on the 4th floor and a few minutes away from MGM.  I did have a drink from Fat Tuesdays with me, which they could not allow inside. However, they kept my drink in ice for me while I enjoyed my meal inside. I thought that was a really nice gesture.   Our waiter was extremely friendly & although he messed up my friend's order, he was more than happy to fix things immediately.   My friends & I enjoyed the shrimp & crab cake appetizer that was very tasty. I ordered the Outback special, which was steak and my side was mashed potatoes. It was a really good meal.  Overall, no complaints."}
{"text":"Fillet minion, onion soup, desserts. It is a real steak house. The food was good, and waiter knew our next wishes one step before us. Total $123 for dinner for 4."}
{"text":"When I arrived at Outback we were greeted by two hostess who were very welcoming! As soon as we sat down our waitress came forth and asked if we'd like anything to drink, which in my book is always good, while making a few jokes in between.  She was very helpful and attentive! She definitely made the whole experience more enjoyable. It was my boyfriend's mom's birthday so while she was in the restroom we slyly notes that to our server which she took note.  I wish I would have gotten her name, but she was very helpful as I didn't know what to order she suggested the Drover's rib and chicken platter which was literally right on the money. The ribs were juicy, tender, and fall off the bone good! Their bbq sauce that was on top of the ribs and chicken was sweet yet tangy. The chicken was so succulent I wish I could have finished it all in one sitting but it is a big order so I took some to-go. I also got an appetizer before that which was he volcano shrimp which I honesty thought was going to be really spicy but it was mild, still really good, just not what I expected. At the end our server brought out a nice ice cream with a chocolate sauce and a candle. We really had the best time there."}
{"text":"Overall just alright . Very simple menu . The steak comes either classic with just salt , pepper, and a little garlic powder on a flat top grill, or grilled over oak coals . Next, you pick the temperature , then your two sides. I would suggest the baked sweet potato with brown sugar and honey butter , a salad with mustard vinaigrette , asparagus, or broccoli .  Their bloomin onion is always good but they are shrinking year by year . I would also suggest the pork tenderloin . It is slow cooked and comes with an apricot chili sauce (not spicy) and it is out of this world . Also , the prime rib is on point . I would avoid the desserts unless you are getting a milkshake. They aren't worth it . BUT the bar serves a mean gingerbread martini for the holidays!! Make sure you get your hands on one of those this season!! The servers are very nice and I didn't feel rushed for dinner"}
{"text":"I love Outback Steakhouse, and I know they are especially busy on Saturdays. So my friend called and told them to put his name down for a reservation at 6pm. My girlfriend and I arrive there first to be told there is no reservation under that name, and that she(the manager) had been handling the phones all day as well as the scheduling for the reservations. I call my friend he tells me a guy answered and put us all down for 6. So I wait for him and his wife to get there and it's an hour wait without reservation. They give us a 20 minute wait for inconvenience...even though we shouldn't have had to wait with a reservation made. So we sit down and order. My friend ordered the porterhouse which he orders all the time. They bring him or a t bone and say it's a porterhouse. So all in all I love outback but this location I probably won't be going back to."}
{"text":"We went to dinner here, and it seemed the service was slow, (although they were busy on a Friday night) finally our waiter came and turned my whole attitude around! His name is James and he was great. The manager Crystal also came by and was so sweet, she wanted to make sure everything was fine, way to turn my frown upside down! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went for Father's Day my Father is 88 and the place was so hot couldn't even eat it was the worst experience ever will never go back put us in a booth for six which made it even hotter and nobody was doing anything about the situation!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After waiting 45 minutes from the time we ordered our waitress told us the meals were being plated and would be out soon. 20 minutes later our plates arrived at the table....cold steaks, cold mac n cheese, ice cold broccoli and cheese, dry & plain \"loaded\" baked potato. 3 cranky and hungry kids later. Tempted to walk out but allowed manager to make it right. Now our meals are coming out separately one at a time. So much for a family meal to celebrate a birthday. Geez!! Disappointed to say the least"}
{"text":"Excellent service !!! Meal was good, maybe had a mishap or two with getting orders correct but they made up for it with incredible service. Everyone had wonderful personalities !"}
{"text":"It is unfortunate that this chain got low rating. Been here couple times a year and never had problems. One time my awesome blossom looked dark and I gave them a feedback. The manager asked if I'd want another one but I was almost finished, so I said it was ok, just a feedback. The manager instantly took it off my tab and offered me a dessert. I didn't take it bc we don't do dessert. She insisted that I take it home after dinner. I felt awful bc that was not my intention. I don't know about the management now bc I haven't been there in the past 6 months."}
{"text":"I love Outback always have and as long as some something on the menu never change, I always will.  My favorites are the Bloomin' Onion and the Alice Springs Chicken.  On the day I visited this particular location,  We were running a pretty tight schedule due to seeing a movie across the street.  I thought I had given us plenty of time to spare and though the house was busy, we did not have to wait and were seated after entering.  Sadly, from the time the we ordered which was shortly after seating, time kept ticking away and the food never came.  After telling the waitress about the time crunch, she went to see what she could do but alas, after forty-five minutes we had to leave.  There was some tension when I said we had to get going between me and the waitress but all in all she handled it professionally.  She said the sodas and BO app we ordered were on the house.  I said we would pay for what we ate, and she apologized.  I gave her what the cost of what we consumed would have been plus a tip.  My thanks to her dealing with a stressful situation with no attitude.  As a result, I will be back to enjoy all the OS has to offer."}
{"text":"Went to this Outback today at 4:00 pm.  Waited to be seated and the hostess said to just pick a seat in the bar area.  That area was too dark for my sight-impaired husband so we walked thru and went to the booths by the window.  She came and informed us, very rudely, that we had to be seated by a hostess in that section.  We picked a booth and she said, very rudely, that we had to wait til the table was cleaned.  We went to the front and waited.  She wiped the table and walked toward us but passed us by to seat another person.  She then walked by us again and we followed her and she AGAIN started wiping the table.  So I went back to the front and sat.  She walked past us again and we followed her and she sprayed the table and wiped it again.  I cannot believe how nasty this woman was.  I will never eat at this Outback again!"}
{"text":"Was craving a steak and seen their advertisement for unlimited shrimp so made the 20 mile drive to the nearest Outback which happens to be in Surprise.  Ordered a blooming onion which was cooked way too long so it was very dark and had a burnt taste. Could not eat it but didn't complain just decided to let it go. Our waiter was never around and left the dishes from the blooming onion stacked on our table through dinner.  I ordered the 8oz Sirloin (first mistake ordering a sirloin steak) and it had a huge piece of gristle through the entire steak so I could only eat about 4 oz of it. I asked for medium and it was cooked well done.   The one bright spot was the fried shrimp, you can't screw up fried shrimp. Overall we left disappointed that we drove that far for such an unimpressive dinner."}
{"text":"Was  disappointed. We did not get drinks until after we asked for them after our meal was served. My wifes steak was killed even after we got specific with them how we like it cooked ( Medium well). We asked for another as she was disappointed after the last time it was rare when we went out. this made us miss all our movie times except the last option.     The owner actually was there and came and appologized. He also took care of the whole bill. I asked him if we could pay for the other portion and refused as he wanted us to return. I Thanked him then, and as we say him as we left. They corrected the problem and even went thr extra mile. That is service from an owner. I definately recommend going again and supporting great business men like that!"}
{"text":"Blooming onion is the bomb. Gift Card program good."}
{"text":"We go there on occasion.  Not a great variety of steaks on the menu but they have a decent  children's menu.  Service is always very good the food though is just average.  I would recommend Johny's Italian Steak house over in Greenway Station.  For the same price you will get a far better meal."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times over the years. Good food, great service! Only wish they would open sooner on weekends!"}
{"text":"If you can only go to one Outback Steakhouse, this is your place. There was a little bit of a wait, but we were offered samples of their Shrimp on the Barbie while waiting to be seated. Our sever was Megan who is a wonderful person. A great Server makes all the difference in a dining experience, so if you want a professional, quality and friendly person to serve your table - ask for Megan! The Filet Mignons were prepared to a perfect medium well and the Salmon was awesome. The location in on Las Vegas Blvd but we'll South away from the bustle of the Strip. We're locals, so we'll be back. But if your a tourist and need to take a break from the action and go to where the locals hang for a great lunch or dinner, give this place a try."}
{"text":"We had the new nacho chip and beef appetizer and it was nothing special and a very small portion for the price. Aj's urban grill has a BBQ chicken nacho plate that will blow you away. The bread loaf was brought out cold and hard not warm and chewy like in the past. My wife and I had the ribs and they were hard to get off the bone and overcooked. Not juicy or very flavorful.  I buy $200-300 in gift cards for my customers every Christmas and you get a $20 reward card per $100 spent. They gave us a hard time about using 2 of them to pay for dinner but after arguing with the manager she finally gave in and made it work. Overall not worth the effort. Looking for a new BBQ place."}
{"text":"Went to Outback Concord Mills for dinner with family. The very best dining experience I can remember having in a very long time and we do eat out a fair bit. Food was great but our server made the experience fantastic. Thank you Zachary H."}
{"text":"Ryan was probably one of the best servers we've had, not just at Outback but at any restaurant we've been to in Nevada. He was so extremely friendly, and he kept checking in on us to make sure we were doing good.   The food was great, my Prime Rib was cooked perfectly, and my Husband's ribs were super tender and so tasty.    Definitely want to come back to see Ryan!"}
{"text":"Eat here regularly.  Usually a coin flip on to go orders.  Ate at bar.  Bartender A+++. But best meal in a long time.  Steak cooked perfect.  Mixed veggies cooked perfect.  Baked potato cooked perfect.  Thank you.  Much needed today."}
{"text":"Excellent food and especially great service.  The baby back ribs were tender and delicious although way too much.  The steak and fries were very good and the chimichurri sauce was excellent."}
{"text":"I travel all over the country and I go to Outback's wherever I go.  I love the food, I love the service, I love the atmosphere.  But of all the Outback's that I have visited, this one is the best.  And if you want the best service of all - ask for Taylor, she is the best! We haven't had to ask for refills and all food has been prompt and perfect.   And if you want amazing steaks come when Mike is on the \"barbie.\""}
{"text":"House special steak was under cooked because it was cut thin on the end parts, thick midsection. Tougher than I expected. Salad & service was good. Appearance is good and clean."}
{"text":"I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5."}
{"text":"The food always tastes the same. This visit our first steak was cooked wrong, and after 5 minutes of it being dropped off, we finally had to flag someone to re-cook it. Ok... so we waited for the second steak. Then waited 20 minutes after we were done eating to have to ask the bartender to find our waitress so we could pay and leave. Then we paid full price for all of that waiting. And come to find out, they upped the prices. No apology or explanation from anyone about all of the unnecessary waiting."}
{"text":"We've been to this Outback Steakhouse location at least 10 times and always received wonderful service and good food for a chain.  The service is still great, but the food quality has seriously deteriorated.  I don't know if they are using a different supplier, but the filet was very poor quality on our visit tonight.  It had little flavor (odd for Outback), was fatty, and had a sirloin texture, as opposed to a buttery, melt in your mouth filet texture.  It's alright to try and cut costs, but for a \"steakhouse\", the steak is not the place to cut quality."}
{"text":"We had about a 40 minute wait to be seated.  Not a problem when ya can get a drink at the bar.  (Do they plan that on purpose?)  Tipsy people don't notice as much, lol.  Once seated, we ordered an appetizer....mac-n-cheese bites.  Let me tell you.....these beat out cheese sticks and fried pickles as my go to.  The white cheese bites where super gooey.  The macaroni is just a binding agent to give the cheese shape..  I could barely tell there was any macaroni in it.  Thats a good and a bad thing.  I liked how gooey they were, tasted delicious but I like it better when I know the noodle is a little bit more al dente.  We got the complimentary bread/butter going on.  Just a thought but I wish they offered a balsamic vinegar/oil/spice mixture like other resturants do.  Not everyone eats butter and the bread alone is dry.  When looking at the menu....they have options!  I think its a trend now to offer \"premium sides\" for an upcharge.  If I am paying $27 for a meal....the premium upcharge should never be more than $2.00.  After all, I'm already paring for a side as part of my $27.00.  Not like I get to keep that side that I am already being charged for at the $27.00.  Outback keeps the side I am paying for in my combo AND charges $5 for the new side (premium charge is right!!!)  This is such a crazy trend.  We had a wonderful waitress named Jasmine.  Super nice and solicitous, just as a waitress should be.  We ordered water and I Asked for no lemon.  Does anyone know how germ-filled lemon and lime wedges are?  There's a study on it.  She didnt listen and brought mine with lemon.    We had a nice meal.  Steak came out correct.  Fun times"}
{"text":"I have to rate this outback at average at best. There wasn't one glaring thing done wrong during my visits here it's more like a lot of little things that snowball together that leaves me disappointed with the experience.   For example the atmosphere isn't \"welcome, sit down and enjoy your food we'll take care of everything else.\" Or even \"welcome, what can I get you.\" Here it's more like \"welcome, hurry up and eat so you can leave.\"  Every time I've eaten at this outback they've always messed up at least 1 thing I ordered. Whether it's getting a rare steak when I asked for medium or either a raw or burnt potato it's always something. They do fix it right away but it still happens."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Had lobster tails that were just right not over cooked as in some spots."}
{"text":"I like this particular outback. I guess no two Outbacks are the same so each one has to be looked at individually. Our waitress was really nice and the food was good. We were seated right where the kitchen was so it was noisy and a ton of traffic from the the staff running in and out but wasn't too bad. I would recommend going to this location and stay away from the Henderson location. See my review of that dump."}
{"text":"I grew up in San_Diego and the Outbacks Ive been too there were fine. Always got a table even if we had to wait. We also always got our food which should be a no brainer but... Ive always liked Outbacks food, when you can get it. So this isnt a review about there decent food but about this particular stores service. During the week they're closed until 4pm. So me and the fam are the first ones in right at 4. We're seated and there we sat for 45 minutes. We got to watch other people eat whle we continued to wait. People who got there much later then us were already eating. We did ask the waitress before we walked out whats going on with our food and she said the food is coming out slowly but surely. The funny thing is her other tables were all eating except us. I honestly think because we got there first they kicked our order to the back. We got up and left. The manager followed us out and asked us if there was anything he could do? Im thinking '\"dont fucking ask me! Tell me what you can do for us!\". Just stupid because you know he wasn't going to offer anything. Richie Cunningham look alike...lol."}
{"text":"Something has changed over couple years.  Salads are smaller, Coconut shrimp are tiny now with less served, even the cost of the steaks are much higher.  We now order the 6 oz option for the price we used to get the 12 oz Outback Special. Cheaper to make better Filet Mingnon steaks at home with red potatoes from Wegmans minus the gristle. Total bummer since its nice to get out of the kitchen once in while."}
{"text":"Me and my friend just ate there but they took 20 minutes to get to us to take our order and we were just about to leave and I said where's our server at and apparently that was the manager therefore I would never ever return it was very poor service the food was not cooked the way I wanted on my burger I said medium well and it was half red on the inside and almost burnt on the outside I would fire to cook honestly I think they should shut it down by Metro Center"}
{"text":"I like this Outback place.  I have always found it very consistent with their quality of food and service.  Remember consistency is only a virtue if you are not a screw up.  LOL This trip I had the pork porter house, mashed potatoes and mushrooms.  The food was good and really fresh."}
{"text":"The Outback Steakhouse is always pretty solid for food even though it's a chain. I find it to be pretty consistent across their various restaurants. The service staff at this particular Outback was great.  I ate at the bar and found the staff to be very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband, 2.5yr old daughter and I visited tonight. Excellent service!! Our waiter Steven p was wonderful and treated our little girl like royalty!   I got the teriyaki medallions. So good!  I also got the onion petals as my side and they were very tasty.  Hubby had the sirloin and thoroughly enjoyed.   Food was great but service really stood out for us"}
{"text":"1. This location does not have the TV advertised $15.99 steak and lobster special. The \"special\" here is the same thing for $18.99. Not cool. We asked about it and our server said that the location was bought out by ____ company, was no longer a franchise, and that might be the reason. I know they DID have the annual $15.99 special here a year ago. Not anymore. Maybe they can change the name to Outback Stakehouse to differentiate themselves from the real locations.  2. The 15/20/25% tip suggested amounts seemed wrong. I calculated it, and apparently, this location thinks people should tip on the tax as well as the check. Um, the tax is paid to the government, not the server. Tips are calculated before the tax! Ticked me off.  3. The food was good. The steak needed a bit more seasoning, but the lobster was perfect. Our server was good too, and did a great job getting our food to us even though she was busy. But, I just can't get over the first two issues."}
{"text":"Came in tonight and had Cameron as my server. He did an awesome job and was super attentive to our table. By far our favorite server. Will be coming back! Thank you Cameron!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is within walking distance from the hotel I was staying at so I decided to have steak.  The picture on the menu looked so good.  Sometimes looks can be deceiving.  I ordered the bone in ribeye.  Now I know that ribeye is one of the more fattier cuts of beef but this was beyond normal.  It was as much fat as it was meat.  The vegetables were frozen but tastey.  All in all, it was a meal but not a quality meal."}
{"text":"Service and quality of food have declined.  This Outback used to be very good.  Now is  a waste of money."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday dinner. Salad was good, main course was good. Desert nasty and service was terrible. Way to many people working not enough for them to do!  Groups of servers chatting and laughing, not impressed....."}
{"text":"After having a sub par meal last night a table that wasn't bolted to the base took a tumble and i ended up at urgent care for stitches.  The owner didn't bother comping our meal ($135) and my MIL had to fight for her to bring it down.  She ended up paying $24. What an insult.  Then, after getting the 8 stitches needed in my ankle, i called to speak with owner and she never called back.  Worst customer experience of my life."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Outback in awhile, but I went last night with friends, and it was a very enjoyable experience.  Atmosphere was good (not too busy or loud, very chill).  Food was delicious, I had the steakhouse quesadillas; very filling and ample proportions.    Special shout out to our waiter Richard; he was very personable and didn't make any mistakes.  If I go back again, I'll definitely ask for him."}
{"text":"We had Easter dinner here last night.  The food was pretty good.  Service was great.  It wasn't too busy.  They have call ahead seating so we were seated as soon as we arrived.  I liked that service immensely!"}
{"text":"We have frequented this restaurant for the past couple of years and had good and bad experiences, mainly relating to our service. The food has always been pretty consistent which is why we have gone back despite the subpar service we've had. Tonight we didn't even make it to a table.   We pulled in on Saturday night around 5:00 and I dropped my wife off to go in and get us on the list. I parked and brought my three kids in from the car to find that we had only been quoted a 5 minute wait. After watching a few tables that arrived after us get seated before us, I went to the host stand and inquired about where we were in the que. The hostess said that we were next to be seated and that they were clearing a table for us right now.  After this we watched two more parties, both of which were parties of 6 or more, get seated ahead of us. At this point we were at a 20 minute wait on a quoted 5 minute wait and had watched too many tables that arrived after us get seated so we decided to try our luck at another restaurant.   As we were dropping off our pager at the host stand the manager overheard us telling the hostess that we were leaving and asked why. She was very polite and offered that we were next to be seated. After hearing that we were \"next\" once before and waiting 20 minutes on a 5 minute wait, we had had enough, though, and left.  I suspect it will be a while before we head back to that location as the service has been less than stellar on multiple occasions. We still will visit other locations and enjoy Outback, but this particular store needs some help in the service department."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Outback for a birthday party; there were about 22 of us. The staff was excellent and on top of it for the most part. I ordered the 4-course meal for $14.99. The baked potato soup was very delicious; just the right amount of chives and cheese. Very good flavor overall. The Caesar salad was your average Caesar salad. The 6oz sirloin was very tasty and tender. The mashed potatoes were okay (I just love the potato, can you tell?). And lastly the cheesecake...I usually look forward to a crunchy crust, there was no crust but I have to admit that it was very creamy and tasty especially with the caramel sauce. You can't go here and not order the blooming onion. The batter was excellent and crunchy; the onions were soft, as they should be!   Our waiter was excellent and very attentive to detail. He asked if we wanted our soups and salads before our entrees or accompanied by. He checked in quite often. And he packed up our desserts to go. I was slightly annoyed when the manager brought out our entrees, and she asked who ordered the 6oz sirloin and mashed potatoes. I expressed three times that it was mine, and no one else claimed it. Instead she insisted that it must have been someone else's because of the order it came in. Well, I'm no food service expert but if only one person is claiming to have ordered an entree for 3 minutes, then just give it to them! She even put my plate back on the tray while she passed out other entrees!   Other than this, everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ate there this week.  I saw the many poor reviews, but it was the closest one to where I needed to be. Hoped things would have been improved since the others were posted. The service was good, except our waiter evidently had friends in another booth and spent all his time chatting with them. Food tasted good, but that had to have been the toughest steak I've ever eaten. Not sure if I'd ever go back or not. There are a lot of other steakhouses with good food and service in this price range."}
{"text":"I give up!!! I used to LOVE The Outback Steakhouse. My whole family did but every time we go here either the service is horrific or the food or both. We went here on Easter again to give them another shot and the service was good for the most part but 2 out of 4 of us were really unhappy. I ordered prime rib medium well with a little pink and got the driest piece of meat ever! Not one bit of pink in it and it looked like shoe leather. My father got a more expensive cut and ordered his medium rare and got a dry, thin piece of steak. When you're paying about $175.00 for 4 people call me crazy but I expect better. Not 2 out of 4. Again, we keep trying in hopes that we are just running in to a bad day but this seems to be pretty standard I guess. Off to the Lone Star and Texas Roadhouse...we haven't tried them yet but I'm thinking we have no choice.  So disappointing. The Outback USED to be so good, great portions and a wonderful experience all around. Gone are those days I guess."}
{"text":"This location opened a few months back.  After the craziness of a new restaurant opening, enough time passed.    We stopped in for lunch to be greeted and seated immediately.  Our waitress gave us great service.  Polite and friendly is all I ask for and she nailed it.  The manager even stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying our meals. Very nice!  I had ordered the lunch portion chicken Cobb salad.  It was the perfect size with plenty toppings.  The chicken had a wonderful flavor.  I'd order this again.  My husband ordered the filet.  Of course I had to try some.  It was perfect! Medium rare and so tender.  I loved it.    For a chain, I enjoy outback.  This location did a good job!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with wife and her friend. After reading reviews wasn't expecting much. Surprise we had a great lunch and our server Sarah C was attentive.  Had the lunch specials.  The soup and salads we're excellent. I had the chicken taco's which were large and excellent.  Will try again for dinner"}
{"text":"We had a real good lunch here. Our waiter was very friendly & attentive. Steaks were very tasty. We were very satisfied with our lunch. The only disappointment was that the hostess seated us right next to another booth with young children. There were plenty of open booths in the restaurant that she could have given more space between us & the other customers."}
{"text":"Haven't ever been thrilled with this location. A few really good servers, but food has never been anything special. Tonight spent $70 to get food poisoning, never going back to this location. Need I say more..."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Outback in years & decided to eat there tonight. We were immediately greeted by who we thought was the host; upon talking to him he introduces himself to us as Dave, the new owner. Dave is an incredibly kind & personable guy who took the time to talk to us. We received exceptional service throughout our meal. Brad, our great server brought us our blooming onion and stated that \"We don't feel that this is up to the best quality & we will be bringing you another one shortly. We wanted to make sure you had something to we in the meantime.\" We were thoroughly impressed with this. Everything that we ordered was prepared exceptionally. Wishing Dave success with his new store!!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience there.. Food wAs horrible and service was below avg... Management was bad. PLEASE DON'T EAT HERE"}
{"text":"I used to love this place...what happened?!  My steak was purple and inedible and the waiter never commented when i basically ate nothing on my plate.  The bread was stale and we left without ever getting a refill, after having to flag someone down to pay our check.  Never again."}
{"text":"Back again great food at a reasonable price. Will be back. Wifi Great. It's Easter this time and food just as great as ever."}
{"text":"We like outback. Consistent food and drinks. Prices are reasonable. Our only issue this visit. Keep our drinks filled. I had 2 cosmos, could of had 3 if our waiter had come around more often. Filet med rare, delish, Mac n chz, delish, Ceasers are my favorite here, homemade dressing and yummy croutons. Friday night, seated quickly."}
{"text":"Came to Outback to celebrate Father's Day for my brother in law because he loves steak. We were greeted by the host at the door and were seated within 10 mins. The server (Veronica) was very nice and efficient. Our food came out in a timely manner. I ordered the crabcakes, which was ok but really salty. My sister had the parmasean pasta, which she said tasted great. My niece (4yrs old) had the kid's meal of mac n cheese and my nephew (2yrs old) had the grilled chicken and fruits. My brother in law had the porter house steak which he said was overcooked, dry and lacked seasoning. He was very disappointed with his meal. To make matters worse, my nephew got a pretty bad scratch on his right arm from our table! The hard laminate was peeling off the edges of our round table and a sharp part was sticking out, nicking my nephew's arm. My sister alerted our server, who notified the manager. Two managers stopped by our table. One asked what she could do for us. My sister explained what happened and pointed out the sharp edges. The other manager, Laura, took down my sister's name, phone number, address and a statement of what happened. She said it was for insurance purposes. When we asked for the bill, we were disappointed that the managers didn't take off my nephew's meal ($5.99) for his troubles. My sister didn't want to make a bigger fuss about it because at that point my nephew and niece were already tired and wanted to go home. We were just really disapointed at both managers' lack of customer service. We will NOT be returning to this Outback again."}
{"text":"I've had a couple bad meals at outback in the recent past but this meal restored my faith back into this chain.  Sangria was good, my prime rib was perfect. We had a manager touch our table twice and our server was very accommodating with my sisters gluten free children. Yum! I will be back to this location"}
{"text":"I love this place. When ever I'm craving large cuts of delicious meat and some steamy mashed patatos I head over to Outback. The steaks are undeniably perfect but my absolute favorite item to have is the Seared Ahi... I usually have two...  AMAZING..."}
{"text":"Alright so, I have been to several Outback's in my time, but this one was different in a good way. I was visiting my brother who lives across the street from this place and we went for an early dinner. Since we were eating so early I wasn't especially hungry. We sat in the bar area and were immediately greeted by our waiter. He took our drink orders and suggested the peach sangria. I ordered the \"sharable pitcher\" after ordering it, I noticed that it was more of a large drink for one rather then a sharable pitcher. My brother and his friend ordered the Outback special to eat there and another Outback special to take home for my brothers girlfriend. Our waiter was so helpful when it came to suggesting ways to re-heat the meal we were taking home. After I finished my pitcher I mentioned to our waiter that is was not very sharable... realizing my disappointment, he brought another glass of sangria to our table on the house. This place is awesome. Good food and just as important, great service. I will definitely be returning upon my next visit to Vegas :-)"}
{"text":"Went in at 3pm on a Sunday wasn't busy... Drove all the way from Scottsdale to get some Outback Steakhouse since the one in Scottsdale closed years ago. The hostess seated us and we sat down... Had time to decide what we wanted to order and 15 minutes in we still weren't greeted by a server for drinks or NOTHING. But another couple came in after us & got seated and asked for drinks and we didn't. I am very appalled by the service I received here."}
{"text":"I HATE chains. I especially hate ones claiming bogus Australian roots. BUT, in a world where an 8oz steak costs $34 in a fancy steakhouse, Outback is a winner. My steak was very very good....given pricing etc. Service is attentive albeit good for people who don't eat out...as in artificial friendly. But it was very good as for all the points one wants in service quality.  My steak was very tender, very tasty and very good....and I am not easy to please. Best of all, reasonably priced. Outback is defying my stereotypes of a chain.....at least in the food quality. Great value...good taste....not gourmet....but then I get that at home."}
{"text":"Friday night. Got a table quick. Service was good. Apps not so good. Main course was good."}
{"text":"We had tremendous service by our server Jason, formerly our server at Red Lobster. Knowing that he's at Outback now makes us feel secured for great service. I'd say the hostess is the one that needs improvement, to me even though they just seat us they should have a more positive attitude not the look that says they wanna go home now. I didn't get her name since she just gave me a bad impression once we entered the restaurant. We ate there yesterday around 3pm and wasn't busy crazy but regulars that knew about the free bloomin onions were there. Check out their specials online before you go so you don't miss out on freebies. When you do go, ask to have Jason as your server, then you'll have guaranteed amazing service."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this location on a busy Saturday evening. After we were greeted by the hostess and given our pager we were treated to two samples while we waited. One was the bone-in rib-eye and the other was their chicken quesadilla appetizer. Both came out fresh from the kitchen and were very tasty. I think other restaurants should take a note and if there's a long wait, give the guest something to munch on! It also helps make the wait for a table not seem as long!   Once we were seated, our waiter was prompt and attentive despite the fact that it was super busy that night. He kept the bread coming and our glasses full!   For the meal, I went with the Blue Cheese Wedge salad, Victoria's Filet and a loaded baked potato.   The Blue Cheese wedge salad was okay. I really like the balsamic reduction that add which gives it a really good flavor mixed with the blue cheese. My problem was the lettuce, it wasn't crisp and there were some brown pieces. The filet made up for the miss with the salad. It was cooked as requested and it was indeed a very tender. I may make this my go-to item when I return. The potato was classic.   All in all, we had a good meal with good service. And you really just can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time here. Shout out to Josh who took real good care of us tonight. Wont ever go back to Metro Center again, will always come to this one because of the great service and phenominal food!"}
{"text":"We had a great time our waitress and the manage Tanner was great we had a minor problem at the outback in glendale and Tanner made good on it even though it wasnt his location awesome my new best place to go"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. While other Outbacks close at 10pm on a Saturday night in Las Vegas,  this one closes at 11pm.  Got there, all staff members were pleasant. The food was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Got a prime rib steak outback style seasoning with a ceasar salad and a spicy mac&cheese.  They even brought out a ice cream bowl with a candle for my husband's birthday. We really enjoyed our night. Loved every minute!"}
{"text":"Never again in life!  Our daughter picked Outback for dinner for her 10th birthday so we choose this location. When we arrived we were told the wait would be about 30 to 45 minutes for a booth, which was okay with us. We were given a buzzer and went and sat down.  There were about three groups waiting when we arrived. Every 10 to 15 minutes groups that were ahead of us were seated. After about an hour people after us were being seated and we were still waiting! By this time I was pissed! I calming asked the hostess what was going on as we had been waiting over an hour. She looked at her seating chart and said \"It will be about another half an hour for seats at the bar\". I have a ten year old, why and the hell would I want to sit at the bar when I had asked for a booth?! Now I am extremely PISSED THE HELL OFF! I told her forget it and that we would never be back!  I haven't been to any Outback since!"}
{"text":"Bone-in, fire-grilled and the fat marbling contained in this ribeye made for a tender, very flavorful and juicy steak. Outback Steakhouse sure got it right with this ribeye! I ate that 22 ouncer like a boss!   The side that I chose that came with my dinner was not too shabby either. The baked sweet potato had honey butter, brown sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on it . Oh yes! It's a winner with me too!   Wait time - hardly if you book online and get on the waitlist.  All you have to do is fill out info and time you plan on arriving [http://www.outback.com/Restaurant/Locations/NV/Henderson/Henderson ] your name is then put in cue on the waitlist in order of real time. Booked 1/2 hour before arrival at 6:15 just as we were finishing up shopping.  Arrived at 6:15, checked in with the host in front that had the tablet. The waiting area was full, but our pager lighted up no less than 5 minutes.  Location - I like they moved here on Stephanie/Warm Springs. More convenient and easier for my friends to meet up here. We've had multiple dinners here already.   Vibe -  It's casual, unpretentious. Local scene.  Family friendly. I like dining at the outdoor patio area. It seemed less noisy.   Service has been great every visit here so far.  No complaints. Steaks are made to order so complain to the person in your party who orders their steak well done for the longer wait.  Price - spending under $100 for two steak dinners ..a freaking bargain.   To think I blew off dining here for the longest time when someone suggested we come here because it's a chain restaurant. I was uber surprised that my experience here was just as good as having dinner at some of the more upscale steakhouses around town. So say yes to Outback! And go for that 22oz Ribeye!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and trying to bust out of the taco and enchilada rut we seem to get into when visiting Phoenix, so we thought we'd go someplace familiar and predictable.   The food was great.   The service was very lacking.   It was quite noisy and our waitress was a bit short with me when I asked her to repeat something, or maybe she wasn't short because she basically repeated what she said, but slowed down her speech like I had a comprehension problem.   It was a bit insulting.   After taking our order, we barely saw her again.   When our order was brought out by a different person, my order came out wrong.   My husband's food was totally left off and we had to wait for it to be cooked.  It was also brought out by another person.   Our waitress showed up again after everything had been corrected (except my wrong side item- but in their defense, I didn't say anything, as it paled in comparison to my husband's steak being completely forgotten).  Pretty disappointing experience for the price paid."}
{"text":"Well, it's not like we were searching out some gem to eat at.... we have been to Outback hundreds of times. Tonight was just a total nightmare. We waited a good 15-20 minutes just to have a table wiped down so we could sit down.  We ordered 2 appetizers, a soup and 2 salads, + a meal. Before we got 1 appetizer, we were about an hour in. Still no sign of other appetizer. Ahi Tuna appetizer was good, but incredibly small pieces for $10. About hour and a half in we got salads. My wedge \"premium salad\" was soaking wet lettuce. Literally water on the entire bottom of plate. Waiter buzzed by a few times and ensured us stuff was on the way throughout the time. Manager stopped by and was very sweet and accommodating. She said she would love to treat us to a free dessert, and if we didn't want dessert, she still wanted to look at our bill and see what she could do for us. Funny thing is, we never complained once. I guess she just knew that it was kind of a shitshow? Chicken was very tiny portion with soggy bacon and no mustard-sauce. Wife's soup ice cold by the time it came. Stale croutons on her salad. She barely ate anything as it was pretty bad, and we were tired (both nurses coming off 12 hour shifts. We decided we would opt for a dessert, but manager never came back, and thus we got charged for it, (it was also sub par). Bathroom was filthy! Not sure if they're understaffed, or we just caught them on a bad night. It was busy, but not anything crazy. For the price (about $60) I have had better meals/portions at Chilis for half the price. Kind of a bummer.  About 2 hours + start to finish. Not sure we will be back to this location."}
{"text":"Things started out a bit rough. We did not get our drinks for 10 minutes. We also asked for bread but it never came, well not until we were almost finished with dinner and that's because we had to ask our new waiter for it (waitress said she put it in and it would be out in 5 minutes....) Oh, waiter, yes because the waitress was pulled from our table (we did not need to request this, the manager noticed the poor service we were receiving). A new waiter came and took pretty good care of us. Unfortunately I do not remember his name:( but he was very attentive to us. I just had dessert, the salted caramel cookie skillet. It was pretty good but had a very small dollop of ice cream on it and the edges were meh. But the middle was tasty. One person at our table had a pasta dish but she did not finish it. She said the noodles were not fully cooked (less than al dente). Her husband had the prime rib melt. He finished his and seems to enjoy it. He ordered a beer expecting it to be in a bottle but it came out a little late and in a glass. He did not drink it and did not want another since he had already started eating.  The manager came to our table just before we were ready to go. She apologized for the service in the beginning and asked how the new waiter did after the original waitress was pulled from the table. She also accepted some constructive criticism from my husband (he is in upper management and deals daily with customer service issues). They were apparently having multiple issues that night because another table got up and walked out without having dinner.  Because the waiter tried hard and picked up the slack of the original waitress, I am not giving 2 stars. Overall things were just ok. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Outback has great food, but the service at this location is not good. I went with another family so we had a total of 8 people. We ordered the kids meals first, so that the kids are happy. The kids meals came later then us adults. When the kids meal came out the food was not warm. The server did not give us utensils and we had to ask several times. For the adults the food was good. It would of been nice if the service was better. I am sure the cook did a good job, it is just the server left the food in the window to get cold. Someone should of stopped that food from being left to die in the window."}
{"text":"We called ahead and they told us we would not wait more then 25 minutes and they got us in right on time! Nice new location! Food was good as Outback always is. We had 8oz Filet (awesome) Outback special (good) Chicken Caesar Salad (excellent)"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Outback Steakhouse on Memorial Day. When we arrived we were greeted immediately and taken to our table. Our server arrived very soon after and was very polite and professional. We started off with a Sam Adams draft ($1 off due to happy hour) and the coconut shrimp appetizer (always delicious).  I was unsure of which kind of steak I wanted, but our server was very knowledgeable and steered (ha) me toward the sirloin cut, assuring me that it would be tender so long as I didn't want it well done. I was very pleased to hear that they knew how to cook a steak \"Pittsburgh rare\". My husband and I ordered the exact same thing: sirloin cut with potatoes and caesar salads. The salad had a bit too much dressing, but that's fine. I'm not there for the vegetables. Our steaks arrived in a timely fashion and were absolutely PERFECT! My husband and I were very happy with our meals and overall experience. The service and timing of everything was great, and the manager even stopped by to make sure all was well.  My only reason for giving 4 stars is because I had to ask for the bread and butter, when I was under the impression that it's supposed to arrive with the drinks or salads. Not a huge deal, but that bread is delicious. We had a great time and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good quality food that hits the spot. It's a chain & known for it's steaks but I usually stick to the pork chops which have a heavenly sweet mustard sauce drizzled over them, mashed potatoes & a wedge salad which is always satisfying.  The bar seating is extra casual & the service is always great. It's conveniently located down the street from our home so it's a regular stop.  Glass of moscato only $5 bucks which is a steal :)"}
{"text":"wow! What a surprise this resto was for me. I have been to the Outback on Sunset and Green Valley and do not remember it to be anything like this one on So.Las Vegas Blvd. I had the burger topped with their 'bloomin onions' and fries as a side dish. My friend had the ribeye and baked potato and a side salad. Our food came at a reasonable time. I noticed that both our dishes were inordinately shiny (translate to - greasy!) but I didnt think much of it. I didnt finish my burger (ate about a 3rd of it and boxed the rest) finished my fries and my friend polished off her plate. Then we had coffee and key lime pie. After dinner, we headed out to the mall to \"walk off\" all that grease we had consumed. But as soon as I left the restaurant, I felt my mouth dry up. Thirty minutes after shopping, my friend wanted to go get a long cold drink of soda and so did I. We were both so very very thirsty. After much thought, we were thinking about what could have possibly triggered such voracious thirst in both of us. Sodium. That restaurant served our food laced with maximum doses of sodium.  I realized, my body reacts to MSG, and that what happens to me - I get very thirsty and  a bit swollen. Sure enough~!  I will never eat there again - ever!  Dont bring your kids there although I saw very many families with young ones gobbling up the food. They put too much sodium, cook with way too much grease. Sodium is used as a preservative. I hoped I wasnt eating week old ground meat. Or worse(!) below standard quality ground beef. All I can tell you is that, the following day - I got the runs, Eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"3 Stars, more for the food than the service. I sat for 10 minutes before ordering my drink. Not because I didn't know what I wanted mind you... Actually I'm subtracting one star because 10 minutes is too long to wait to order a drink. Most corporate restaurants give servers 60 seconds to get a drink order."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Below, I mentioned that the 9oz filet has been reduced to 8oz. Well, I just visited today, and found the size has been slashed to 6oz and still costs over $21. The cost of many menu items has skyrocketed in the last couple of years. The blooming onion is now almost $9. It's a vegetable dipped in batter.  I can just picture the Board of Directors discussing how far they can squeeze their customers. Outbook is no longer the affordable, family-friendly place it once was.  The Outback (used to be) a family favorite when we want give ourselves and the kids a \"treat.\" We have always enjoyed the food, and the service and atmosphere have been satisfactory. In the past year, however, the experience has been less enjoyable. It seems this chain has decided to reduce portion sizes while simultaneously raising prices. For example, the 9oz filet is now an 8 oz filet, and the Mac 'n Cheese (my kids' favorite) is now served on a much smaller plate. As a result, our family has started to look for alternatives, and we find ourselves visiting Outback less often, although when we do visit, the quality of the food is as high as always. They know how to cook a steak to order, and their Caesar salad is possibly the best I've had anywhere. Overall a good place to eat - I just wish the owners had not tried to be so sneaky with the smaller portions."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this location this is the third time now because the food while I feel is over priced is still a good tasty meal. The problem is the service and the fact that they allow children in the bar area. We are while not old are old enough to enjoy a meal without kids screaming for nothing. The service is at best bad. This is our third visit to this place in the last year with every visit worse than the last. If a want a good meal and don't care what it costs you as long as you don't want to hear whoever your with talking then this is your place. Tell them I said hi because I wont be back for a while."}
{"text":"I Have been to lots of Outbacks, but this one was REALLY bad.  Bad service  I had the prime rib and it was o.k. but my dad got the porterhouse and it was not good at all. The cut was horrible and it was not cooked properly. They had to take it back 3 times to re-cook, with no success of getting it right. They get two stars for at least taking the Porterhouse off the bill, but it just made the whole experience worthy of a bad review. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"So happy we started going to this location. We are originally from Chicago, and loved the one out there. We would go a few times a month. The only thing is that they really do not have them in the city, you have to drive far out. So when we moved to Vegas we were excited to have one down the street from us. We went a few times to the one on Sahara and Durango, and it was terrible. Everything was gross, and undercooked. Even the blooming onion was not done right, one time it was undercooked with raw batter, and another time it was too burned to eat. We even witnessed a kid get sick while eating there. Just terrible. We hated it so much that we did not go back to ANY Outback for about 3 yrs. It grossed us out that much. We recently moved to the NW, and decided to give the Craig location a try. We are so happy we did. It rekindled our love for Outback. We have been to this location about 5 times and each time they never fail us. The cooks get it done just right. Right flavor, and the right way we want it cooked. Service is always great. The best server we had was Ashley, she said she is known as the \"Girl with the tattoos\" haha. She is an awesome attentive server, and very friendly. She even held our baby for us, while my wife was getting a bottle ready for the baby. As long as this location stays up to PAR we will continue to come back. Thank you for having pride in what you serve and in the service you give! :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy outback steak out in general, however I am starting to lose faith in the Monroeville location. Every time my boyfriend and I visit there's a problem. On one occasion they forgot to bring out half my meal. Second occasion my bf found a damn hair in his broccoli (the waitress said she would inform the manager and never did ...didn't even over us any compensation for we were kinda grossed out . Now don't get me wrong here, it's not about getting free stuff but hair is gross . To top it off  Just Saturday they switched my steak(to be well done) with his (to be medium rare) and I started eating bloody steak. Now it's Monday and I feel as if I have food poisoning (not even exaggerating) . The manager is always kind when fixing our problems, but if it's not just bad luck why does this always happen? We never even caused a scene, ever. They need to step up their service... I'll go back cause There isn't many outbacks around. I guess I'll just have to watch their EVERY MOVE."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for dinner. We usually come to this location when we have a taste for steak. Food is always consistently tasty. Staff always friendly. Never had an issue here and the managers usually walk around to each table and introduce themselves. We really like the quality of this location and their great customer service."}
{"text":"1ere expérience pour déjéuner à Vegas. Très agréablement surpris ! Service au top (probablement l'un des avantages à ce que les serveurs soient rémunérés aux poubroires). Je recommande le steak frites avec salade, suffisant pour nourrir 2 europées ou 1 américain ^^ Les pichets de margarita ne pardonnent pas, si vous décides d'en commander un préparez vous à une longue promenad digestive....."}
{"text":"great go-to place for a decent meal when you don't have a reservation somewhere - they wait is usually not too long and they even manage to accommodate groups of 6-10 of us without any trouble, even when we just walk in on a Saturday night.  food is reliably decent as is service and the prices are fair.  and its right there in the middle of strip."}
{"text":"The Outback was just ok, it's has good family friendly atmosphere but the servers seem to do just the bare minimum. Our waiter wasn't rude and the food was served promptly.   We had the sampler appetizer which was good, cheese fries, fried Mac and cheese balls and onion rings. The normally they serve it with small pieces of bacon on the cheese fries, although it's not mentioned on the menu, I don't eat pork so they replaced the cheese fries minus bacon.  My wife ordered steak served well done which was dry, expectedly, and salty. I ordered the philly steak sandwich which was just ok.   The restrooms were nasty, My wife refused to use it, vomit in one stall and sh!t all over the other toilet and on the floor. The Men's restroom floor had urine on the floor, the paper towel dispenser was not working and the other dispenser was out of paper. So all the guys were air drying their hands. Tons guys walking out without washing, I had to wait for someone to open the door to slip out without touching the handle. We most likely won't be going back here."}
{"text":"My husband and I hadn't gone there in many years - no idea why, but we always seem to end up in Arrowhead restaurant row,  fighting traffic and long waits (unless we're at Cheesecake Factory which always seems to have ample tables). It was our anniversary and we decided to try a different restaurant.  We were glad we went!  On a Friday night we only had to wait about 20 minutes, which we did at the bar - just enough time to have a drink.  The drink prices are really good and the bartender got our drink order as soon as we sat down, even though the entire bar was full (we got the last 2 seats).  About 10 minutes after arriving, the hostess found us in the bar and asked us if we wanted a table (she could seat us then) or if we wanted to wait for a booth (we did) - instead of just dragging us to a table.  We should have requested a booth when we arrived, and forgot, so it was nice that they asked before we vacated our seats at the bar.  The food arrived in a timely manner and was terrific - great steak and lobster and, again, great prices.  We really like the fact that you can order your steak to size according to your hunger: no reason for over eating unless you want to.  The veges were cooked just right - not too crisp nor too limp. The portions were all good sized except for my baked potato.  It wasn't as large as other restaurants, but maybe that's why I had room for dessert (usually don't).   For dessert we got the sampler, figuring it would be 3 small portions. Wrong!  They were all full-size as far as I'm concerned.  We both looked at it and said, \"how are we going to eat all this?\" (we did lol). My husband liked the carrot cake & cheesecake, and I loved the pecan fudge brownie with ice cream/whipped cream/hot fudge.  Last but not least, our server was full of personality - we really liked her and tipped her accordingly...  All in all, a great night! We won't let so much time go by before visiting again."}
{"text":"Worst Outback I've been too. First time they gave away my order yo wrong client at curbside takeaway. The second time they were understaffed for traffic, provided incorrect rate times and served all the customers first who walked in after I pulled up. What a way to spend a Friday watch as they walk away with your card that's waiting for you to sign after waiting 10 minutes to be acknowledged only to be told it might have been faster if I went in and didn't participate in their offering of curb side takeaway. Go to the Outback on Chandler Blvd and 54th street. Better service all around. Shame on me for going back a second time to this location. Food was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this particular Outback. It was fantastic the last time I came here and it was fantastic this time. We sit at the bar because it's a good atmosphere and the bartenders are quite pleasant to be around. Chad and Lindsey were our bartenders. They were able to keep up with all of the patrons at the bar and the orders coming in from the tables and the large wedding party all while staying cheerful and humorous.  I ordered Victoria's Filet with the Parmesan Herb Crust cooked medium rare. I got a side salad and the mixed vegetables. The steak was juicy, tender and perfectly cooked. The herb crust was phenomenal. The herbs used were my favorite herbs (especially the rosemary) and the breading was light and crunchy. The side salad was fresh and I got their 1000 Island dressing with it. It's not often that you find a 1000 Island with an\"eggy\" taste, but this one had it and I do search for it at times. I loved it. The vegetables were also well cooked and well seasoned. I also got 2 Blackberry Sangrias. They were sweet and refreshing. A perfect meal for the end of our vacation."}
{"text":"Went to the steakhouse for dinner tonight and had a terrible experience. First of all the hostess barely acknowledged our presence for the first two minutes of walking in and was unprofessionally talking to her co worker about her bellybutton ring. Second of all they were OUT OF STEAK. You can't call a restaurant Outback STEAKHOUSE and have no steak. An lastly the waiter was making sexual inferences towards my teen daughter. Terrible location will never be back."}
{"text":"We visit Vegas from England every year and make a point of going to Outback every time. I've eaten both steak and burger here and have always found it to be delicious every time.   The one we visited this evening was in Casino Royale and the place is quite depressing inside and is in need of an update,  there is however, a really cute guy who works there who always reminds me of Brandon Flowers so at least that is a bonus.  Prices are reasonable (especially compared to the equivalent in England) and service has always been good although there tends to be a mega wait if you get there after 7pm.   All in all I enjoy it every time and have no complaints. Shame the brand isn't open in the UK."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch at the bar this past Monday before I picked my daughters up from school. The Chicken Caesar and French Onion Soup were worth ordering. I was more impressed with the service. The bartender was very friendly and on top of her game. I didn't catch her name but she was worth every penny I tipped her. I look forward to not only having lunch here again but having another pleasant conversation with the bartender. Thank you Outback!!!!!"}
{"text":"The server was great and really went out of his way to make sure we were happy.  They are always courteous and my burger was on point.  When I say medium well they know that does not mean burnt to a hockey puck! Love the fries and potato soup.  Will definitely be heading to the outback again soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE the outback but this was by far the worst experience I have had at one. We got here at 4 and were seated in the bar. Erika G was our server and she ran past our table a dozen times before acknowledging us. She brought us bread (which was horribly stale) and disappeared for longer before buzzing by again to speedily take our order. She seemed to have no patience. I told her it was my friend's birthday and she said they didn't do anything for that, but could maybe get a scoop of ice cream. OK, yes we'd like that. My baked potato (which I usually love because of all the salt on the side) was cold and a bit hard and my steak was SO thin!! I also remember liking their caesar salad, but this time it was all light green/white lettuce which is not what I like...   Overall I was very disappointed with the dinner. If I pay $50 to go out for a friend's birthday I want to enjoy it. I didn't. Wouldn't recommend this location. I've heard the one at superstition springs is good though."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with their lunch menu, which is offered even on the weekends - score! Lots of options under $7, some a little higher (my hubby got the fish tacos). Be sure you grab a coupon out of the Sunday paper, or sometimes in the mail. 15% off the bill, or other good specials are always going. I love their bloomin onion - it's a must try (again and again)! Endless soup and salad on the lunch menu was ok. I thought the potato soup was a little too salty though.  Overall, I'd recommend (especially for lunch with the low prices) and will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Outback in this area.  We went two days ago, and experienced great service and a ribeye that was OMG delicious. My husband got the ribs and chicken and ate up every bit.    I also love their outdoor seating - cozy and cool!"}
{"text":"A no-brainer.  Outback Steakhouse is my favorite restaurant of all-time.  From their hot honey wheat bread and butter (with a hint of vanilla) to their succulent, fall-off-the-bone baby-back ribs and their mouth-watering delicious ribeye steaks, you can't go wrong at Outback.  You won't end up breaking your wallet here, either.  First off, the baby back ribs are the best I've ever had anywhere.  And I'm speaking of Outback Steakhouse in general, not just this location.  Second off, I was surprised to learn that they don't serve Teriyaki Ribeye at this location...I've seen it at practically every one I've been to in California.  When I inquired about it, they said they can serve the teriyaki sauce on the side, which is definitely the way to go.  The Teriyaki Ribeye is also my favorite steak I've ever had, anywhere.  Just an FYI.  And that bread...Jesus Christ, that bread.  It's to die for.  Seriously, if you haven't been to one of these restaurants before, you owe it to yourself to check it out.  You won't be sorry. (I should get paid for this review or something.)"}
{"text":"My first experience ever eating at Outback Steakhouse wasn't all that great. I was really excited for this location to open. So the wait wasn't all that bad considering they were busy. I think we waited 15-20 min at the most. The server was at our table fast. We ordered the seared ahi which was delicious. My husband ordered the steak salad and I ordered ahi sesame salad. The food was finally here. My husband's salad was missing the steak. How bad of a cook do you have to be to forget the steak on the steakhouse salad????? My salad had the ahi and the lettuce. Nothing else!!! The 5 other ingredients it came with were missing. Red peppers, cilantro, sesame seeds, almonds and sesame vinaigrette. We sat there waiting for out waiter to show up. I even looked up the menu to make sure I wasn't going crazy and my salad was missing all that. He showed up and we showed him the salads. He said I'll be right back. Came back with what looked like a fourth of a steak cut up. Looked like someone was in a hurry and that's all they had so they slap it on the plate. All my stuff was still missing. And his reply was \" we don't have the brightest people working in the kitchen\". Really? Nice of you to talk like that about your coworkers. So after we gathered all the ingredients for our salads they weren't really bad but nothing I would go back for. I know they opened not too long ago but come on get your stuff together. I'd rather eat at miller's ale house across the street."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. Don't waste your time. All I can say. Sitting here with dirty dishes for a long time. Our server has been MIA forever too. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"The only reason they are getting a 2 star review is because the manager came over to us to try to reconcile things.  This was my first time in Vegas so I was hoping for a good time, unfortunately from the moment we walked in,  everything was bad. We wanted a view of the strip and they took us to the back of the restaurant away from a window, then we get a new table on our own...  The tables and chairs were filthy food all over.  The waiters we rude and combative. We order a soup with no toppings and they brought it out with toppings. I understand mistakes happen,  but when the waiter was told about it, he acted like it was an inconvenience. We ordered a well done steak and it came out rare. Very red. When we told the waiter \"Todd\" about the steak,  he said \"well you shouldn't have eaten any of it before telling me\". They were very rude and just didn't seem to care.  Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Outback as really gone downhill. Used to love this place. My last Filet Mignon I had there looked like a sirloin that would come off of an all you can eat buffet. My baked potato had 4 micro-looking chives on it. Has completely went cheap and lost it's class. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"A four was given because half of the food was perfect and the other was a little off or had issues.  The manager Megan was super sweet and really made us feel comfortable giving positive feedback and took care of us.  She went over and above and I mean that.  Thank you for a wonderful Easter experience!"}
{"text":"Service was so-so, the servers always seem overwhelmed with big groups. Food was great came out correct, hot and fresh."}
{"text":"So we came in for the date night special.  We were seated right away. All I can say is it has been a great night! The food was perfect and the service was spot on! Our waitress Stephanie was prompt and although they looked very busy Stephanie's service was perfect. Thank  Stephanie.! We will see you again on \"date night\""}
{"text":"And now class lets have a lesson.  Can you spell    H-O-C-K-E-Y     P-U-C-K ???  How about this, spell  O-V-E-R P-R-I-C-E-D ????   I was actually really surprised at how expensive and just bad my to go order was.  I am by no means a regular at Outback Steakhouse but based on reputation I at least expected something edible. My steak was burnt on the outside, red in the middle and DRY. It was shaped like and tasted the way I think a hockey puck would taste. The potato was loaded and tasted okay once I added some salt. The Bloomin Onion was the best part of the meal. It wasn't greasy and had decent seasoning.  A positive was that the order was ready and waiting when I arrived. This was really a letdown and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Outback has just lost it for us.  Steaks have gotten small and tough and the last few times have just been disappointing.  Even the salads have shrunk.  We have moved on to another steak place for our everyday dining and to Perry's for the really good stuff."}
{"text":"Great experience tonight.  Went with the family for a Birthday / Mothers Day celebration.  We made call ahead seating arrangements for 5:00 and showed up right on time.  We were surprised at how crowded the restaurant was considering how early it was; we were lucky enough to get the last parking space.  We put our names in with the hostess and only waited about 20 minutes ( FAR less than the actual wait time).  We took a while to order because we had trouble selecting our meals, but the waitress was very pleasant and checked back often enough.  The food came quickly and was delicious.  The only problem was that my wife's steak was cooked to medium instead of well done.  The waitress noticed as my wife cut into it.  Before my wife could even say anything, the waitress said \"Ooh, that's not well done....let me take that back for you\". I was impressed that a) she remembered how my wife wanted her steak cooked, considering she had a lot of large tables on a busy night, and b) that she offered to take it back before we even asked.  The manager came back a few minutes later with the steak and personally wanted to make sure that we were happy and that all of the food was good.  He even made small talk with us for a few minutes.  Both the waitress and manager went above and beyond and made our experience great in addition to great food."}
{"text":"ordered pickup online for lunch.  Little did i, or the door dash driver ahead of me, know there is no service to your car at lunch time.  the order asks make and model and color of your car so i am not sure why my food was not delivered to my car.  there is no indication on the outback website that you have to enter the restaurant to get your food.  if it wasn't for the very kind doordash driver i'd still be sitting there."}
{"text":"Actually came for burgers today!!! Tried the grass fed burger came out really good! The service was great and will definitely come back for that burger!"}
{"text":"Everything was going ok. We went on a Saturday night and did call ahead seating. When we got there there were a lot of people waiting. We checked in with the hostess and sat down. I think we waited another 5 to 10 minutes to be seated. Not bad considering they were telling people there was a one hour wait. Our waitress was very friendly and responsive. She told us we could use the kiosk to order appetizer if we wanted. We chose to do that so we didn't have to wait for her to come back. She even exchanged one of our beers for another because it wasn't as expected. We had the prime rib which was good. Crab cakes were ok but they had more cake than crab in them. Overall at the time it was a decent experience until I got home and looked at my receipt. I got a $1.99 charge for the ziosk!!! BEWARE don't even touch that thing! It has trivia questions displayed on it trying to lure people into playing and after you answer the first question then it says something about $1.99 for unlimited play. We didn't play but got charged anyway!! I didn't see the charge until I got home. Boo Outback."}
{"text":"Get the petit filet. It has the best consistency week to week. Sometimes the other cuts are a little tough.   However it's generally very good. I come once a week."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Outback for dinner tonight. We were served by Tracy. She was absolutely amazing. She was friendly, pleasant, fun and totally ON TOP of her game. We eat at Outback all the time but have never had Tracy as our server before. We will ask for her from now on because she is the best! She went out of her way to take excellent care of us. This particular visit was sooo much more enjoyable, just because of the OUTSTANDING service!!!! Our food was perfect, like always, but Tracy is what made this dinner exceptional!!!  Thank you OUTBACK and Tracy, you ROCK!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Outback on January 27 2016 with my daughter. The waitress Nicole L. Was very inattentive. She was too busy talking to the hostess instead of seeing if her diners had everything they needed. I wanted A1 sauce but she never came around,by the time she came back the filet was cold. When someone first brought the meal to us it must have been sitting for awhile as the baked potato was semi warm. Extremely disappointed in the service ."}
{"text":"The food here was great, but the service was terrible.  Our server, Amanda flubbed the order, blamed the kitchen and never came back to let us know what was going on.  When my food finally came out, my husband had finished his meal.  This girl never checked back to see how the new order was.  Completely ignored us save to drop the bill.  She didn't offer to take care of anything.  When I suggest she do take the meal off, she became very hostile.  No manager was present.  We left angry and will not return.  There ate so many other places to get good food in this town,  why pay for crap service?"}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant but on the strip it's one of the best values you're going to find.  Don't bother ordering off that little card on the table...the steaks on the menu are the same size and $10 less.  It can get crowded on weekend nights but it's a good place for the groups and the steaks aren't bad.  For the price and location, hard to beat.  Little to no atmosphere, but at least this place doesn't take itself too seriously like some of the places on the Strip."}
{"text":"I am writing this review, because I think it is important to bring out an issue. It is relevant to point out that this might be insignificant for some people, however it was meaningful to me and my wife.  I have been coming to this restaurant for about 10 years, as it is close from my office. We also like to go there on Sundays. This Sunday I went there with my wife, and we ordered dishes with onion soup. No big deal so far, until the soup came, with THE CHEAPEST IN THE MARKET BLACK PLASTIC SPOONS. I  made a joke and showed the plastic spoons to the server..\"You guys are loosing the glamour\" the server said: \"I am sorry, I guess they did not have any clean ones back there\"..She did replace the spoons with regular metal silverware with the respective apologies which were accepted...How strange!.Such a well known franchise compromising its quality and service that way. Was it an innocent mistake? Was it a miss-judgement by a careless new employee?, or was it a deliberate attempt to offend us?. Racism does exist and we have to be aware of it, but I guess we will never know. Other than that, Food was good as always, service was below average considering the incident."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!!!   If you want a great server go in and ask for Julia. What a great server and very attentive. She made sure we were completely taken of the whole time we were there. She was so nice we didn't want to leave.   If you want great service and someone to have a great convo with ask for Julia. She will be the only server we will let serve us for now on and she is the reason we will be coming in more often. Thank you Julia for your great service And making our experience and awesome one!"}
{"text":"Awesome...excellent...delicious! My husband and I were prepared for a wait when we saw that the parking lot was crowded....not so...we were seated immediately. Our waiter was one of the best we have ever had. Our salads were fresh and delicious. Our drinks were awesome! Our food was excellent...cooked to perfection and served hot! Thank you Outback...we will definitely be returning soon!!!"}
{"text":"Monday night and the wait was 45 minutes can't make reservations  Ended up leaving  Huge disappointment"}
{"text":"We go here often because I love steak. The steak is always good, but the service really varies. We came here for a birthday dinner and had eight guests. We were seated and one of the large, round tables which was perfect for our group. We ordered two blooming onion appetizers and really enjoyed that. But our entrees took an hour to prepare before they were brought to our table. We had a toddler with us, so that was just too much of a wait. I'm not sure what was going on in the kitchen. When the food finally arrived, everything was good. Our server was excellent."}
{"text":"I love outback! This is my third time (first to this location) & our server, Lillie, was nothing shy of extremely helpful, kind and outgoing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another great dinner at good old trusted Outback. Our server, Veronica, was superb!! All three of us ordered the steak and lobster, and as usual, very tasty and cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"One thing I can credit this chain for is decent consistent service.  I have dined at this location inside twice and carry-out three times. The service is always the same. Easy access off Mayo Blvd, plentiful parking, easy back out again.   My suggestion if you are getting a steak from this chain is to order their named steak cuts (Outback Special, Victoria's Filet, or The Melbourne. Their ribeye is average but decent) they tend to be the best they offer and are really an excellent value for the money.   I have never had anything other than decent wait staff. And my experience with carry-out has been better than I expected. You order on their web site and drive to the building and park in the special curbside pick-up area and wait for it to be delivered to your car window. They include all the stuff you would get inside,(even bread and butter) except drink refills and flatware. Last time they did mess up my order, but a quick phone call to the manager and she gave me a credit for my next carry-out order, she was polite and eager to please. Despite the mistake, it was very well handled.   They have a large menu, so it is always best to check it out online first. Their average order to table time is in the realm of 23 minutes unless someone orders a steak well done.  I do have one question though, is it proper to tip the kid that brings the bag of food out to my car, I am sure he's only getting minimum wage? I haven't done so yet.   If i could change one thing there, I would lower the booth tables about 1-2 inches.  I have done internet ordered meals for curbside pick-up 3 times now, two of the three had wrong sides. So if you go you must check your food before you drive away. I don't think I will be doing curbside pick-up any more because of the horrendous failure rate. I wonder if there is a glitch in their order software that gets me the wrong sides almost every time."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here about 14 times. Each meal ended with no complaints or issues. Roughly 19 minutes from order time to meal delivery is their average. My steaks have always been prepared properly. The place is clean and well run. Good parking, easy access from Cactus or Tatum. Only wish they were open for lunch!  Beware, Outback has many menu items that are extremely unhealthy and thick with fat and salt. And I feel their prime rib is big disappointment. Eating a blooming onion is like eating half a tub of Crisco lard.  I kind of recommend you not order the big price steaks, like prime rib or new york strip. Stick with the house cuts or the rib eye, they do these better and they are actually decent steaks."}
{"text":"Today was (I think) our third trip to Outback.  My daughter requested it for her birthday. Service was so horrible that I will probably never be back.  The food was delicious, but we're not really pick eaters so.... we usually like everything.   Two of us did not get drinks refilled till we were finished with our food.  We asked for extra bread because the bread is pretty small for a family of four.  We asked three times, and we never got the bread.   Once we asked our server. Then the lady who came for our dishes assured us she'd bring bread. Then we asked our server again. Then she came back and told us she'd bring us bread.... We finished our food and she never mentioned it again.  I put a note on my receipt and I hope the manager sees it!  I can't imagine that they'd care, but you need more than just good food to keep your customers.  We still tipped the 20% or so because I felt guilty, but I think our waitress deserved 10% or less. I have a hard time giving less than 20%, though.  I guess the solution is to not make it back to this restaurant.   We do not eat out at restaurants too often, but when we do we expect a little service.  ***June 30th Because we're moving, it's been difficult to find the time to cook some nights.  We have ordered to go twice, and that seems like a much better option for us.  Food was great. Both orders were done in a timely manner, not quite done when it was supposed to be, but close.  Don't plan on making it back into the restaurant, but ordering to go is a decent option!"}
{"text":"Great service! The staff is friendly and ready to help their guests! The food was delicious! I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband for a relaxed meal on our anniversary. On a Tuesday night the place was a lot busier than I expected, but we were seated right away.   We were greated by our waitress Mandy who was very nice and always very patient with us even though we were unsure about pretty much everything we wanted to order.   After we placed our drink order she brought us our bread while we decided on an appetizer. We decided on the grilled shrimp and after about 5 minutes it came to our table. The presentation wasn't something to call home about but the shrimp were excellent and the dipping sauce definitely added to the flavor.   My husband got the house salad with blue cheese and he said it was good. He finished it so I guess I'll have to take his word for it.   I think we might have waited 20 minutes total for our food to get out. I got the Outback Special with a baked potato, and my husband got the cheddar bacon burger. We both finished our meals....well he ate half of mine, but either way they were both gone. I thought mine was delicious. He thought mine and his were delicious.   All in all I thought this was an excellent experience. We normally don't go to chain restaurants like this, but we make an exception for this particular location. We will be back and I'm sure we will enjoy it once more."}
{"text":"Love this place... The girl and I come in whenever we are craving certain things because we get the same thing every time. Small order of the cheese fries for an app which are my ABSOLUTE favorite! I don't care what anyone says, Outback has the best ranch dressing and it just makes the cheese fries so good and fattening! Then I get a side salad and she gets the chicken tortilla soup which are both great! For an entree we share the ribeye with broccoli! The steak is so juicy and good and the broccoli is so soft and salty!   Just about love everything we get here and it's like our go to spot for a quick laid back steak dinner!"}
{"text":"I was there with my husband a few weeks ago on a week-end.  Our service was wonderful! Meal was delicious. I wish we would have had room for dessert but we did not. We always ask to be seated in the bar area in hopes there are no small children screaming through out our meal. I must say the waitress we had I believe her name was Melinda...was very helpful with her suggestions."}
{"text":"First walked up to the table and there were French fries on the floor, the seats were covered with food, the table was not wiped off, the waiter Todd came to clean the table off and there was still food stuck to the table. The manager had to come over and clean the table off. That kind of set the mood. The soup came out with toppings when ordered without toppings. The steak was supposed to be well done and it came out rare. There service was so bad by this point that I just sucked it up and ate as much as the steak as I could, to avoid wasting more time. Todd agreed that it was under cooked and said \"well you shouldn't have eaten any before telling me\". The customer service was very poor and everyone seemed very unhappy. They didn't offer to try to help reconcile the problems and haven't tried to reach out to me since then. They don't seem to care about their customers."}
{"text":"It's been forever since I've visited an Outback so I was very excited to try it again!   Is it just me or do the put something so addicting in those loaves of bread! They are always warm when they come out and sooo good! You literally can't just eat one!   For starters we tried the blooming onion much better than I remembered. It was not greasy and heavy, I really enjoyed it! Each piece was crispy and I loved the sauce that they bring with it! It was spicy and so full of flavor...a great match for the onion pieces!  To drink I chose the Georgia peach- \"down under\"  which means they add an extra shot of liquor! Going forward all my drinks here will be going \" down under\" this was a mix of peach flavored slushy mix and liquor! Delicious!   For dinner I ordered the Outback special 6oz with a loaded baked potato and broccoli as the side. The steak was just ok, a little overlooked for my taste. The potato was delicious and I agree with some previous reviews the veggies were a little buttery.  Still it was a great meal, and I'm sure to return!"}
{"text":"Another consistent visit to Outback.  I had a burger this time with was actually pretty good, although a little pink in the center for my tastes, but my husband didn't mind finishing it off for me...I'd get it again and make sure it's cooked a little better.  Our service was good, we didn't have to wait to be seated and we could see the UNC ballgame from our seats...ended up being a great meal!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location. There was not a long wait and we were greeted with smiles. Chelsey was our waitress and she made everything wonderful. She checked with us to fill drinks and bring fresh bread during the meal. She also chatted for a minute which made the meal even more pleasurable. The food was good but not great however the coconut shrimp should have been cooked a bit more. The salads are not worth the money at all. Customer service was a 5 but the food gets a 4. I'm gonna try another choice next time to see if they perform better in the kitchen. Love the vibe at the bar."}
{"text":"Had a great salad for dinner. My wife's steak and potato were good too. We are here once a month, or so, and we usually have a a nice evening out. Service can be a little slow at times but it's usually ok."}
{"text":"I had my first prime rib here last night. Delicious; however very fatty. Tried to salvage my health by holding the butter on my steamed veggies. Service was a bit slow but they were busy. Try to sit by the window where u can watch the volcano fire show at the Mirage. Wife and daughter had salads and chicken, which they said were good. The icecream dessert was great for the price."}
{"text":"My partner and I both ordered our steaks (the Filet Mignon and the Ribeye) medium. His came back cooked rare and mine came back cooked well. Also, the fries were way too salty. However, the cheese broccoli side was delicious. Unfortunately my stomach did not take well to this food and I ran to the restroom in a hurry. Not a fun end to my meal.  But, the service was very good and every staff member we interacted with was very accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 had a good dinner here. 3 of us had the prime rib and the onion blossom as an appetizer. Good service. No complaints from any of us."}
{"text":"Gotta agree with recent reviews.  This location appears to be sliding RAPIDLY downhill.  Went last night w/hubby.  Not terribly busy, but enough tables to keep the waiters/waitresses busy.  I ordered the porterhouse and hubby had sirloin with lobster.  Seemed to take an excessive amount of time after the bloomin' onion.  I always order medium rare and hubby gets medium.  Mine was FULLY cooked, his was pretty much there, also.  Guessing they sat under the heat lamp, tho they weren't hot.  Back they go to the kitchen, while we kept our potatoes, tho after a couple of bites, who wants to fill up on that before the steak comes back?   While we had two managers stop by the table apologizing, never once did they say anything about taking a bit off the bill, etc.  Fine, every restaurant has an off day once in a while, and it would have been acceptable IF the 2nd one didn't come out suffering from overcooking and DRASTIC under seasoning (if any).  When the 2nd manager stopped by, I told him I just wanted my steak taken off the bill, as it was still overcooked and under seasoned, and chewed like leather.  The manager tried to say that it lacked flavoring because I'd chosen wood grilled, but I was quick to inform him I've recently  had a steak to my liking (at their SO MUCH BETTER Niles, Ohio location).      Asked if they could bring me anything else and seemed surprised when I told him no, as we had to go pick up our daughter elsewhere.  Besides, after two tries, why attempt another?  I will say that hubby's 2nd steak was SO much better, and definitely seasoned properly.  Have to add that the table next to us was not pleased with the amount of time they spent waiting either, nor was their food done properly.  Overall a GREAT disappointment, and we will NOT return to this location EVER.  Forgot to mention, the porterhouse was perhaps 1/2\" thick at most, so anything more than a 30 second sear on each side would render it inedible."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and I completely understand that places get busy and there may be long waits. However I was sitting at my table for over an hour to receive my food . The manager Jamie came over after my brother brought attention to long wait. She did apologize and take full responsible for the long wait. Our waiter Austin was inconsistent.(almost seem like he was working alone) overall the wait was ridiculous but the food was delicious"}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is? The food is ridiculously overpriced, unremarkable, and generally lackluster.  The fantastic Blooming Onion is actually overcooked and like eating the fryer residue.  The steaks are not anything special, even with their signature spices, and slightly overcooked according to their scale. When the tip is going to be huge by virtue of the high menu prices, I expect excellent service. When my water glass sits empty, that doesn't cut it.  About the only great thing here is the cheese fries.  Also, I hate the Yelp app, it nags way too much too.  One more thing, the beer selection sucks. Since when is Sam Adams considered a craft beer?"}
{"text":"Dinner here is great , the prices not so much but hey it's the strip. Some servers are not nice at all but the other half , really cool people. Their blooming onion is the best appetizer in the house , gotta try it"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving it one star is because I can't go lower.  I tried this restaurant again to see if it got any better, now I know it hasn't and it will be my last, they lost out call ahead seating after we checked in and the hostess was VERY VERY rude. After waiting 2 hours for a seat, the table was so wobbly we could literally swivel it, the plates we got for the bread were wet and dirty, the manager came over and ask if everything was ok and I proceeded to tell him about the table and he said \" oh, you got a wobbler \" and I said the coffee was horrible and he said \"well I could have told you that this isn't Dunkin' Donuts,\" I said and this is not a steakhouse any manager that would say such a thing like that will never EVER see me as a customer, by the way, we never saw the manager again!  There were 7 of us, any resturant that treats their customers like we were treated doesn't deserve our patronage!  One more thing , food was the worse! They couldn't even serve me hot soup!"}
{"text":"My wife and I get out to this outback every once in a while and we totally love the way that the management & staff treat us from when we step in to the time that we leave. Today we were greeted by Laura who is the manager and she always has a Great smile on her face when entering.  Then our server Aaron could not have been any nicer we he arrived at our table to begin service. Throughout our meal which was a Filet with Lobster which we split cause I cannot eat a lot due to surgery Aaron was taking care of us perfectly and did not overuse his asking us if we were ok. Laura came by to check on us also and chatted for a minute and went about her duties of manager very nicely. We will definitely be back in a couple of weeks for our steak dinner. Thx Laura & Aaron for the Great treatment from entry to leaving it was Super."}
{"text":"Nice place great service and fast....but you better make a reservation lol on fri-sun..."}
{"text":"Ok dinner at the Outback. Onion soup was a bit disappointing (forget the melted cheese dripping over the side of the bowl). I also has the bloomin' sirloin. Steak was good but a few more fries would have been more pleasing. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Outback on Vegas strip!!!!  Steak hits you in the spot after all the walking around all day.  Only thing is the ceiling is really low in this place.  Some people in our group felt Castro phobic in this place.  Try to get a table next to the windows.."}
{"text":"This Outback on Southern and McClintock was outstanding. The service is fantastic from the moment you enter the door. The food was well prepared and came in a timely manner. Our waiter Gerald was very cordial and professional. I will definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed coming here but NEW POLICIES in effect now, no longer can you seat yourself in the bar (we were promptly scolded for doing so), no more call ahead list for seating, and soon NO HAPPY HOUR.  The people behind us were scolded and made to feel uncomfortable, then when they left another couple was talked to, and they got up and left. Our food tasted good but was cooked wrong, a medium rare steak should be just that, not medium.  The waitress was very nice, manager was nice and apologetic, but the hostess was the one chewing out people.  It was not pleasant, it will probably be a long while before we come back.  There are too many other nearby choices where we are welcomed warmly, have happy hour and we can seat ourselves in the bar without fear of being yelled at."}
{"text":"I had the six ounce steak and it was cooked correctly but was kind of stringy.  It came with some very good potato soup.  The bread was good.  I waited in the bar and had a beer.  It wasn't a very long wait.   I think Longhorn has better steaks."}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant fare.  It's easy, no reservations required and inexpensive.  Plus, it's right next door to the hotel we always stay at when in Vegas.  An easy walk to get some outside air to Outback for dinner is always nice.  It's upstairs; a bit confusing to find but if you ask you'll find the stairs just fine.  The food was average; we ordered the coconut shrimp for starters.  That was excellent with the sweet dipping sauce!  We also had a steak - wasn't the best quality meat so it was a bit chewy.  And, the ribs - they were really good!  My complaint is the \"mixed greens\" salad which is pale green romaine only.  Yuck.  I'm sorry, but I like green greens and had to send it back.  If you come here for dinner, you won't be blown away, but you won't be 100% disappointed either."}
{"text":"We   ate here tonight 2/14/17 and we loved the food and our waiter was new but GREAT. He is an asset to this company and I would know because in my twenties, I was a waitress and a good one! I had fun at work and really loved my job. Johnny U made our visit fun and took our AARP card so that we could get our senior citizen discount.. Thank you Johnny for a great time!  Rhonda and David P."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised,  to be honest.   Thinking  back, i believe ive only waten at an outback once in my life..and im pretty sure it was when my age was still a single digit.  Not wanting  to cook....and wanting something  different. ..we remembered  that the outback  was close by.  The hostess was kind, and sat us right away.   I dont remember  our waitress' name....but she was kind, and attentive. Of course,  whats a visit to outback without a blooming onion ? I got the lamb, added the potato soup, and we also had the hearts of mahi mahi.  The blooming onion  was meh. Honestly,  we didnt even have 1/3 of it. I regret  ordering it.  Kind of like a bad onion ring.  The loaded potato  soup was quite good...plenty of flavor, and very creamy.   My lamb came, and was wonderfully cooked. They were decent sized chops and juicy. They did have quite a bit of fat on them....not very appetizing,  i wish they would have trimmed it off. My two year old and I still enjoyed it.   The hearts of mahi mahi was okay. Just okay. It really  tasted like it was missing something,  but the fish was cooked beautifully.   With 2 drinks, an appetizer and a kid's  grilled cheese,  the bill was $80. A little pricey... but the food was decent  enough  for us not to mind.  Hop over to Yogurtland afterwards  for dessert.÷!"}
{"text":"I had a half rack of ribs from this location and I'm sorry to say they were the worst ribs I've ever had. Since when does a half rack consist of 4 bones? They were burnt on the top,very tough and had very little sauce on them. Needless to say I wasn't very happy. Sorry Outback, you failed the rib test."}
{"text":"I normally love Outback & I've NEVER written a review on a place, but this experience wasn't up to par & it was definitely a weird one...   I went to Outback for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend. Twice it was mentioned that it was my birthday by someone in my party & not one time did they do the \"let us offer you birthday dessert!\" thing... Which is totally fine, but they have always offered free birthday dessert any time I've been there with other parties & even if I wouldn't have taken it, it would've been nice to be consistent.  First thing I ordered was a bloomin onion because I was starving & who doesn't love them?!? About an eighth of the way into it, I couldn't chew through whatever I was eating... I pull it out of my mouth & it looked like plastic! I'm not one to overreact so I just alerted the waiter & he asked if we wanted to continue eating it. Continue eating it?!? Whatever. My bf joked that he would try another piece to see if there was more plastic & he had the same type of texture to his piece. The waiter took it back & told us he would make another one & then proceeded to tell us that it wasn't plastic, but just that the skin of the onion wasn't cut off prior to making it. So they made us another one & I don't know if it was because I was already grossed out by the one before, or if they were off their game that night, but it didn't taste right either.  It was such a disappointment considering that's almost my favorite part of the whole place!  So onto entrees...  I ordered a steak & sides & my bf ordered his steak medium rare. We get our food only to realize that the waiter had never asked me how I wanted my steak cooked & just cooked both of them medium rare; I told him that my meat looked like it was bleeding & I couldn't handle it. He was very nice & said he would take it back & put it into the grill for a little bit longer... I agreed that it just needed a tiny but as I wanted mine medium, but not bloody whatsoever. The manager comes back with my steak & is very apologetic & asks if it's up to standards. Just looking at the steak you could tell that the top had this hard layer over it as if it was burnt. I told him it was fine & he assured me he would make me another one, but at that point my bf had gotten his food & I didn't want to wait even longer for mine to get done as we had other birthday plans... So I cut into mine and it was just okay...not anything great as my previous steaks had been. I even had to cut off the charred part because it was like eating a burnt steak. Ugh. The manager was VERY nice, but at that point I just felt like nothing they did that night (food wise) was right & I was regretting even coming there for my birthday dinner. My BF (who is the King of loving his meat medium rare) had to send his back because he had to run to the bathroom to spit out a piece that he couldn't chew through! He got his steak back & it was overcooked as well... My steak was taken care of by the manager but the horrible bloomin onion wasn't & we were offered dessert, (not \"birthday dessert) but declined because I wasn't going to give them the chance to ruin that for me too.  Overall, we will definitely not be back to this location again! The manager was extremely nice & so was the waiter, but the taste in my mouth that I had from the horrible plastic tasting bloomin onion (that I paid for) was enough to make me stick with the Chandler location."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome my husband and I waited about 20 mins for a table but well worth the wait, once we were seated our wonderful waitress Tracy came over promptly and took our drink order and appetizer order and that was promptly brought out, she then asked if we would like our dinner to be held for a few mins to enjoy our appetizer.  Shortly after finishing appetizer our salads arrived and then our entrées, I have never had a steak cooked so correctly and the coconut shrimp was huge and plump and just melted in your mouth.  My husband had the pork chop which he said was equally yummy!  What a wonderful dinner and experience!  A huge high five to our waitress  Tracy, she made the dinner very pleasant and was very prompt and pleasant!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. They over cooked two of the three steaks we ordered. We were reluctant to say anything but our waitress asked so we told her they were overcooked. She offered to send us home with two extra steaks at no charge for the inconvience. Very nice of her to offer she made our experience that much better and I will diffidently go back. Thank you Jordan!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. Very clean place. The fish tacos were superb. Our server was very polite and knowledgeable. We would definitely come Back again. Would highly recommend this place for some great food!"}
{"text":"The thing I love about this place is how the food is always consistently great.  The servers are always very knowledgeable and the management is great.    I highly recommend the ribeye or filet.  Both give you a great bang for your buck.  This restaurant is very family friendly which is important to me as well."}
{"text":"While I'd like to slam this chain steak house, I just can't... Because the food was great! Wifey had a craving for prime rib, and we had been here before for this entree. I had some kind of a hamburger, and it was absolutely perfect, and so was her prime rib. The service was excellent, and overall the price was great. Not a big fan of chains, but I'd go back here. The couple next to us asked a manager over, and apparently, they are big fans of The outback, and they told the Gal that this was the best one they'd ever been to. I believe them! Great waiter and staff as well."}
{"text":"The atmosphere feels like warehouse seating.  Very loud and noisy and wall to wall tables and people.  The food was uneventful and the worse Outback I've ever been to.  We couldn't wait to get our check and get out!  Never again!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Outback. My boyfriend and I have eaten here several times. We just left, with no food in our stomach. We waited over an hour for our food. We waited about 40 minutes for bread and our drinks. I'm very disappointed. This is the second time I've had an issue at this location.   Another server brought our food out, but gave it to the table behind ours. We tried to get her attention but she walked the food around the whole restaurant. Never brought it to our table.  When our original noticed we didn't have food, she went and got the same food and brought it back out... cold.  Unacceptable.  I asked for my bills so I can pay for the drinks, my server brought out to go boxes and the bill with all the food on it.  Really? So you want me to take the cold food home? I'm good.  The manager came over, explained that the table number was keyed in wrong and took care of our drinks.  This restaurant wasn't that busy.   A quick bite to eat before we head out of town to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday turned out to be an epic fail.  Thank you"}
{"text":"We have been patrons of the Henderson location for about seven years. Outback is far and above our favorite restaurant, with us visiting about once a month.  Recently, this restaurant relocated.  I agree with the new location in its ease of access and improved parking. It is understandable that the new location has produced a major bump in business however, there has been a large and negative impact on regular customers.    Our wait times have gone from 20-30 minutes to over 90 minutes, call ahead seating has no value in that there is still no reduction in wait times (average 90 minutes), the new staff display a shocking lack of familiarity with the menu,  and the front end staff (understandably overwhelmed) have become curt and indifferent.  As a result, our dining experience has deteriorated dramatically, and has had an impact on our decision as to whether or not to visit Outback for dinner.    Our most recent visit was 8/01, at 6:00PM, table 7, service check 6, and server Jason.  In summation, Outback is no longer our primary choice for our monthly dining experience, and I cannot foresee us returning until management is aware of, and takes action upon, the negatives that have accompanied the relocation."}

{"text":"It's a bit pricey for a chain restaurant, but the food is really good.  Our servers were top notch and so friendly.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Wow! How can you say......amazing always all the time! We have been coming here for 3 years...... It has been short of Amazing everyone! Come'on!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason they get two stars is the food was good.  We were 1 of two groups sitting at bar and it was disgustingly dirty and we are not germ aphodes.  Couldn't get our bartenders attention to have it wiped. Then witnessed a server leave restroom without washing her hands. Probably last time we visit this filthy restaurant."}
{"text":"CURBSIDE TAKEAWAY REVIEW -   I want to make sure it is clear that this review is related to the curbside takeaway only, and not the restaurant in general.  This only reflects my experience with the curbside team over the last couple of years.  The accuracy of my orders are incorrect more than they are correct.  This is a trend over the last 24 months.  We do not have complicated or modify the menu when ordering, we are talking about items not being included that should be.  I recognize that we aren't saving the world here.  We have gone back to this location for takeaway over and over and over again.  The one job that Outback Curbside Takeaway has is to provide fast and accurate food as advertised.  It is on this expectation that I give a low one-star rating.  Last night was the last straw - 1) the order was ready 35 minutes after the communicated pick up time via the website and follow up email, 2) we were missing one of the salads.  3)  The salad dressing we received was for the salad we did not get - and we did not get the dressing assigned to the salad we did get.  4)  The french fries were soggy / undercooked.  5)  The steak was cold.  6)  The bread did not come with butter/sides.  I've noticed that it is typically the side salad that gets the shaft.  I have returned this location for curbside takeaway maybe 15 times over the last two years.  I've reached the point where I check the bag before I pull away and I no longer call the manager to complain.  I have hoped for the best because in general I really like Outback.  The only time we will be returning to this location is to dine in.  We've given curbside many many many second chances."}
{"text":"So far, not impressed. Almost left to go elsewhere since it took 3 hostesses staring around chatting amongst themselves at least 5 minutes to even acknowledge us. When they finally did, they told us to \"just go back and find one of the waitresses to clean off a table for you\". Really??? Looking around, there were at least 6 empty tables, all of them dirty. At least 2-3 waiters and waitresses walked right past us without even looking up. We were headed for the door when Megan finally stopped to ask if she could help us. She was extremely apologetic  and promised to take care of us herself so we are staying. Hopefully the food is good because we are starving! Will update later....  Phone is dying right now."}
{"text":"The customer service here at the Outback on Stephanie was incredible!  It was my first time here. The coconut shrimp was the best I've ever had, in fact my entire meal was amazing for that matter. My bartender Nick was THEE BEST, he had great suggestions and was always there checking on us at our booth.  The manager Michael was completely hospitable and made sure our dining experience was perfect. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time at outback and it was very delicious. I had the New York strip and sashimi tuna. The tuna was by far the best. Tony the bartender was a great waiter. Come see him if you visit this outback."}
{"text":"Yuck!  I don't ever think I've given this bad of a review!  Not good.  Hopefully this was just a  bad night for them.  Cold potatoes and undone chicken.  I just don't know what to say!  Ewe!  I would not do again."}
{"text":"They have a poor advertising promoting steak and crab legs $12.99. Be prepared to fight for it though. Ate at the Las Vegas Blvd and Warm Springs location but no employee has ever heard of it OR managers they say it's only for participating... I said its false advertising and it was honored. Sadly worst crab legs we ever had. DRY DRY DRY. Eat there all the time! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this specific location since I was 8 years old, so atleast 17 years!! Always have had great food and one of the only ones I've been to that have the Lobster Tails. They are my favorite and I come here almost every year for my birthday! AW"}
{"text":"My reason for giving this outback a 4 star rating is with how busy they are they are very prompt and make sure that the customer is taken care of.  I am highly impressed with my server she got my order right.  usually when I ask for a medium rare burger I get medium well.  The food was hot and beer was cold."}
{"text":"I enjoy sitting eating at the bar at Outback.  I've been their several times and Brady and Jamie the bartenders are always easy and fun to talk to. When you sit at the bar they give you a little tray made for the bar that allows you to reach the food easier then if it were placed on the counter. The service is fast enough and Brady and Jamie are constantly taking care of their customers at the bar as well as the staff that needs drinks for the tables.  The food is very good especially for the price.  I usually get one of the fish items and my husband gets a steak - of course.  I think they need a little help with their presentation though.  My salmon and shrimp tasted yummy and my husband's steak was good though a little tough which surprised him.  His steak plate, however,  looked more empty than full which is not really a good thing."}
{"text":"The curb-side to go is great here.  I ordered the Prime Rib Dip Sandwich and a Salad with Ranch.  Everything was great.  Best bread and butter in the city."}
{"text":"Our first visit to our local Outback. Fantastic as always. Our waiter was friendly and patient. I got the 9 oz. Filet, as usual. My husband got the strip. Both were cooked to a perfect medium. The loaded mashed potatoes are wonderful. I don't know anywhere else that you can get asparagus cooked that well. The broccoli and cheese is delicious too. Almost had room for dessert but, decided to pass. Great ending to a Sunday in Arizona."}
{"text":"I give this location a 5 star rating because the staff is exceptionally awesome. Jennifer waited on us and I can say that she is an asset to this company. I've had a really bad week hearing detrimental news at my work and so I figured to forget my cares I needed to take my wife out on a date and splurge. The attentiveness, level of care for her tables, and her ability to not be offended at honesty was refreshing. I was insulting saying the steak was generally not flavorful and outback was not one of my choice steak houses to eat at for steak. She listened to me and let me voice my opinion without argument and continued to remain extremely sweet. I am very used to being waited on by waiters who are short and never take the time to get to know their tables so no one restaurant until today since my moving to Arizona has made me want to return to dine. Connie at this location is an exceptional hostess as well. I called in to see if they were open since it is a holiday and she went the extra mile to see if I wanted to call ahead for seating. She is also an asset to this location too. As for the food I was really blown away by the flavor, tenderness and freshness. I had the Victoria filet with snow crab. The filet was so tender I did not need a knife and the snow crab was fresher than some of the sea food restaurants that are in town. The snow crab did not have the fishy taste or smell that it does at so many places. Red lobster doesn't even compare in their freshness. I continue to eat here because of this. I am a crab fanatic and only outback and Papadeauxs are the place I will eat seafood in the desert. Do yourself a favor and go see Jennifer you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"I'm astounded by reading the other reviews of this restaurant. I can't remember how the service was, but my steak with crab cakes on top was amazing! It was cooked perfectly, and I ate it all. Just thinking about it now makes me want to go back soon. I'm a pregnant and temporarily reformed carnivore, so that's saying a lot.   I will definitely come back again before I get back on the vegetarian wagon, and I will pay more attention to the service. Anything for that steak!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Outback in a long time as the one where we live is always so busy. So since we were traveling and there was a wait at the Logan Steakhouse (near our hotel), we opted for Outback. The first thing I didn't like was that they sat us in a booth by the bar and the entrance to the kitchen. I didn't say anything because we were way past our dinner hour, so we sat and quickly ordered. The waitress dragged her serving cart as opposed to picking up the tray and carrying the bottom part. This was unpleasant to hear and to sit by. I've been a waitress and part of the job is carrying the meals to the table. If you can't do that, maybe you are in the wrong profession. The second thing that was unpleasant was that we ordered the sirloin steak and it came perfectly cooked but slathered in pepper. It was really hard to eat. The potato was delicious, as was the salad, but the steak, the main attraction, was almost a perfect miss. Not sure what is going on with this restaurant, but it needs to have management take a good look at the wait staff and the chef. Can't say I'll be returning to any Outback in the future."}
{"text":"We are locals and always go see Rob, he goes out of his way when we walk in.  One night close to closing we went in rob was about to leave but, saw us and stayed on shift. The food is always good and Rob makes sure it's brought out to perfection.  We stop in atleast once every Friday or Saturday night.  If you're in for dinner ask for rob you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of Outback when it comes to chains... My heart skips a beat over Alice Springs chicken. That being said, this location was far from the norm. The wait wasn't terrible for a Sunday evening...about 20 minutes. I got the Outback Special and my husband got some chicken sandwich. My salad came out and we didn't have utensils and the server walked away. My husband's fries were cold and limp. My steak had minimal blue cheese crumbles on top. Our waters were empty more often than they should be. No manager checked in with us and even the server failed to stop by while we were eating to see how things are. My husband summed it up best saying, \"I could have been just as satisfied getting a McChicken sandwich and a medium fry at McDonald's.   And as a side note...sitting in the booth is terrible! I get that I'm only 5'1\" but my feet are dangling about a foot off the ground."}
{"text":"I'm judging myself a little bit for giving a 5-star review at a chain restaurant like Outback but the service we had here on Friday night was along the lines of what I'd expect at a fine dining restaurant.  We joked that we hadn't taken a couple drinks of our beverages and she was bringing us a refill already.  Trudi was very attentive.  The kitchen forgot my blue cheese on my steak so she went to go get it and brought back some fried shrimp for our troubles.  She went above and beyond and hopefully she's our server again in the future."}
{"text":"In one word, \"awful\". Staff are way to eager to get you on your way, specially for the type of restaurant. The food, I have no words to express my disappointment. I ordered the coconut shrimps as an appetizer, they were over cooked, inside and out, the coconut batter was burnt. I had as a side, tortilla soup...I wouldn't call that a tortilla soup, it was some sort of mushy stuff with some tortilla chips, sprinkled with cheap cheddar. The main course, the 6 ounce sirloin was caked with salt and forced cooked for the look of it. A good steak requires little condiments and slowly cooked to perfection. The only thing cooked well was my side steamed vegetables. I would consider this restaurant at the same level as a cheap fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"So far all the employees are rude I know there busy but making comments about moving a bar stool trying to talk to the girl cleaning the table no answer giving back the buzzer after we found our own place to sit the hostess acted like she couldn't here us so far it's has not a good experience got our food husbands steak was not cooked right sent back manager made it right I've always had bad experiences at outback."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes then had to get a server to help after ordered waited another 10 min for salad another 20 min for food a total of 45 minutes service is very slow and it's not the first time I've been here. And it's not even busy"}
{"text":"Went here last night and had Zack Masters as our waiter.  He said there are four Zacks that work there so that's why we asked for his last name.  We live in old town Scottsdale and have dined at this one, Tempe and north Scottsdale several times and this one is BY FAR the best one.  All six of our steaks were spot on!  Not one mistake and excellent service."}
{"text":"My friend and i came here on sunday early afternoon. We come about every couple of months and i come religiously for my birthday. The food and service is generally top notch, but the last couple of times it hasn't.   I had a steak and it was rubber, our bloomin onion didn't seem cooked enough.....we never recieved bread with our salad or at the beginning. Our waiter was good and attentive but the food fell short.   We will give it another shot in another month and hopefully i'll be posting a five star, otherwise we'll probably head to the sahara location or maybe hit claim jumper....."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is horrible . The manager failed to give courtesy and tact toward its customers .. he was racist and told me he doesn't like black customers .. I hate that I have to write this review because I am not Caucasian .."}
{"text":"If you go here sit in the bar, Roxanne and Linda are amazing. These two lady's have kept us coming back for several years now.  The steak is great and cooked to the known standards now. Outback used to use their own versions of well, medium etc. The food is somewhat pricey but it's a steakhouse so that is to be expected. The aussie cheese fries are best if you ask for layers cheese.  Restraint is clean and we'll maintained."}
{"text":"They've always been a 3,0 - 3.5 star restaurant , especially when it came to their steaks.  They were always okay, the meat was never seasoned well, and the charbroiler guy usually over-scortched or under-scortched the meat.  I've never thought I'd do this but I'll have to give Outback a 4 star steak rating.  Normally, when I got to their restaurant, I have ribs.  But tonight we wanted steak.  The clientele at this Outback is a mirror of the new North Las Vegas subdivisions.  Lots of different races mingling and having a great time.  Our waitress was a short Filipina woman who's hair went down to her butt.  At first she asked us what we wanted to drink - in Tagalog \"Kumusta po, anong gusto nino para inumin? (Hello sir, what would you like to drink).  She got our drinks in no time, and we had some awesome Sam Adams on tap.  We gave our food rder in English because when I speak Tagalog, it's often sloppy, and I didn't want to end up with a piece of kangaroo meat or even horse tonight.  The waitress laughed and said, \"We have no kangaroo meat\".  Thank God. So, I had the small sirloin, their most popular and smallest cut of meat with baked potato and bread.  My brother got the lobster and steak.  His was $22 and mine was $11..  Beer was $6.  What was surprising was though I got the smallest steak, they were both super thick.  We both like our steaks medium rare, and they were able to get that nice crust on the steaks with a great searing,  One slice of the meat, and juices started to flow out.  Everything was delicious, and our waitress was very efficient with closing out the bill.  It was the best Outback night I've ever had on 10 previous visits to this chain."}
{"text":"It was memorial day weekend and I was craving meat... Go figure! Lol I guess I didn't have enough ribs on Sunday....  Anyhow, I was craving a nice juicy steak but I didn't want to shell out $$$$$ on a steak on the strip somewhere. I wanted a steak that wasn't going to break the bank and Outback came to mind... And it had been years since I've been to one but my vague old memories were of steaks that were decent for a decent price. So here I went! :)  We got seated after waiting for about 15 minutes which was cool since they had actually quoted us a 20 minute wait. We got a cozy 2 person booth by the entrance to the kitchen so occasionally all we could hear was \"corner\" being yelled out by the staff as they were walking around the corner... But it wasn't too bad.  Ambiance decent...4/5  The BF was starving and so we got a sampler. It came with Mac n cheese balls, Aussie fries and bloomin onion petals. The portion size was decent for the price. The mac n cheese was very very cheesy which in my book always equal DELICIOUS! :D~ The Aussie fries had a good account of cheese and bacon bits on it... The bf scarfed it down... And the bloomin onion petals were so crunchy and battered perfectly. All of them could have been really greasy but they weren't. We pretty much cleared the plate. We had to wait a bit for our food but the server came and let us know that the food would be out shortly. Our server was actually really great. She touched our table a few times to refill our drinks and to see how we were doing.  When our food finally came out... My ribeye was way overcooked. I requested medium and the steak came out well-done. Eeeewwwww! I pointed it out and they whisked it away and left me my steamed broccoli and baked sweet potato to eat while they recooked my steak. I was just expecting my steak back but no they brought me a whole new plate! Which in my book was a very nice touch. The manager came by and talked to us twice just to make sure that we were happy. And honestly, I was not all that annoyed that my steak was overcooked since my bf's steak was perfect and he was the one that was starving. Lol They salvaged a below par experience and totally made it a great night by exceeding my expectations. And the steak was cooked to perfection. It was medium leaning towards the med rare side which is how I like it. Ribeye was tender with a good amount of fat running through it and the seasoning on it was perfect. The sweet potato was baked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed to oh dare I say it again... Yup it was steamed to perfection. Still a bright green with a small bite so that it wasn't total mush.  Flavor 5/5  Yes my experience could have been totally ruined but they cared enough to make sure that my ribeye was cooked to my standards.  Will I return... Yup! I will. :) Does it compare to the dry aged ribeye at CarneVino? No it didn't but then again it also didn't break the bank. For the price, Outback is totally worth it. When I'm craving steak... I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Our waitress, Jessica G, and the manager went above and beyond the call of duty!! Thank you very much for making sure everything was to my satisfaction. My dinner was delicious and I will definitely be back. Thanks again and Happy Birthday!! to me..."}
{"text":"I honestly had one of the best dining experiences ever at this Outback location. Our waiter was friendly and personable; he made recommendations for the beers on tap and brought over several samples for me to try. My steak was prepared exactly to my request and every tender morsel was like a little party in my rejoicing mouth. Even the side dish of garlic mashed potatoes was amazing. The complimentary bread is best enjoyed with the honey butter. Don't be shy, slather it on there. I would have had a second meal for dessert if I had any room. I may have cried a little.  Tip: The Bloomin' Onion is to die for. If you go here and don't order one... I will find you."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to take advantage of the new $14.99 4 course meal and was surprised with the extra special customer service we received today. We normally come to this location and we always get great customer service, but today the bartender/waiter went above great customer service... a definite way of reassuring customers to come back. Great Job!!!"}
{"text":"Three of us went to Outback on 12/22/13 for dinner. We were seated right away after being greeted at the door. After being seated, our server Osana came to our table within a minute to take our drink order. Osama was very professional and nice, but if I'm being honest, she didn't seem particularly enthusiastic or engaging at first.  We placed our orders and received our food promptly. I had the 8 ounce filet which was actually delicious and cooked perfectly. It had no grill marks which I thought odd but forgot to ask the server why. My nephew had filet and lobster which was very good and mom had a steak, but can't remember the cut she ordered. Her steak was ordered med-well and came out very well done, and was a really thin cut, literally about 1/2 inch thick at its thickest point.  When Osana returned, she asked if our meals were cooked properly to which I said yes, but mom said hers was over-cooked. Osana offered to return the steak and have a new one prepared for her, which mom declined. Despite the fact that we made no  fuss over it, Osana still let her manager know and the steak was comped. I was a restaurant manager for years and few restaurants do the \"right thing\" when something goes wrong, but this and Osana's apology was perfect. A bad meal or incorrectly cooked steak won't prevent me from being a return customer, but a lack of empathy and action when it does happen will. Outback gets an A+ in this regard on this visit.  The bill was about $75 after that $17 steak was removed, to which I tipped a healthy $20 (over 20% of the original bill), Osana wished us a good evening and we were on our way. Good experience overall and I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"We love Outback, but this was one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. We called ahead for seating, due to us having a 10 month old and wanting to be in and out as quickly as possible before she began to get fussy. We were promptly seated by the hostess at 6:17.  Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. We asked the hostess where our server was and she responded with she would grab them. We watched as 2 other tables were seated and greeted after us. At 6:43 our waitress finally came to our table. The table behind us, who was also in our server's section and seated after us, got up and left. We should've done the same thing right then and there. We proceeded to order our meal, but at this point decided it was not worth waiting any longer than we already had been. We decided to get just an appetizer to go. Very disappointed and won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, fantastic food. Eli was our waiter and he was great! I'm newly 21 and he suggested a wonderful drink for me. I had the ribeye and snow crab which was AMAZING. My hubby had the double moonshine burger which was fabulous. My mom had the prime rib sandwich which she said was kinda dry, but still filling. Since they don't do military discount, we got a free dessert instead. Absolutely wonderful! Definitely suggest going here!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to's for good tasty gluten free food.   Very simple review and to be summed up with the rating.   The service was fantastic!!!!  Our server was awesome.  He was tentative and personable.  My wife and I sat immediately, and as soon as we sat the waiter was there to take our order.  I have been to Outback during peak and off peak times as usual I wait to complete my review until after a few visits.  And Outback delivered.    Both times the food was quick to come out and tasted great.  I will typically order the sirloin or sirloin with shrimp, if I am feeling randy.  hahaha.  But both times they knocked it out the park.  The Sangria is PRETTY DAMN tasty!!!"}
{"text":"We attempted to have dinner at Outback.  Attempted is the operative word.  We went in and were seated immediately.  The restaurant, though slightly busy, was by no means full or overly crowded.  We sat for 15 minutes until a server asked us if we'd been helped.  We still had menus and no water, of course we hadn't been helped. She then proceeded to try and sell us alcoholic beverages and offered to get us water while she looked for the person who should be waiting on us.  The clincher was when we saw another table, seated 10 minutes after us, get helped immediately.  We walked out and as we did the manager asked us how our meal was.  We told her we never got served and were leaving.  She offered to pay for our meal but by that time we both had a bad taste in our mouth and declined.  Dinner across the street at Oishi was terrific."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a fabulous YELP event here tonight. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and appreciated. Josh, Jayden and Mike served each of us with bright smiles and such attention to every need. The appetizer was a 3-point RIb Bloom - a Bloomin' Onion loaded with cheese fries and 4 baby back ribs. There were two entrees. The first was grilled salmon topped with shrimp and mushrooms in a creamy sauce served with Blue Cheese Pecan Chopped salad. The combination was fabulous and not overwhelmed by the sauce. The second entree was steak and ribs with garlic mashed potatoes. There were 3 types of ribs: BBQ, Dry Rub and Honey Sriracha. All 3 were fall- off- the-bone tender. I have to admit the steak was my personal favorite because it was tender, juicy and flavorful.  As appetizers and entrees were being served we were also treated to a new signature cocktail. It was a strawberry rose' concoction that was refreshing and light. Also Outback now features Old Mecklenburg Brewery ales  and we tasted a flight of four different micro brews. Each was distinctive and different. The Double Chocolate Dessert Parfait was a perfect finale for this incredible meal. The manager Brooke Barker certainly deserves major kudos for this very successful event. She circulated throughout the evening lending a hand or answering questions. Such an amazing and awesome evening!  One of the BEST I've ever attended. Thanks, Nikki!"}
{"text":"It's 5:30 on a Sunday and they are out of ribs? How can you be out of ribs this early in the day? Poor planning or bad kitchen staff? My night has just taken a turn for the worse.  Update....5 minuets after posting this they have the ribs! Strange how that worked out. But I'll take it."}
{"text":"Wife and I went to outback on a much needed date away from kids.  We have been here before with and had mixed experiences.  This night was great. from greeting to check. we were seated as soon as we came in. Granted it was early around 5:30p and server was prompt in getting drinks, and bread. Each course came on time not rushed. My steak was cooked to order, medium well, which hs proven to be a difficult feat in the passed at just about every steak house. only problem with steak was it was very tough no juices in the meat at all. if ima pay 19.99 for a \"14oz\" ribeye I expect it to be juicy and tender.  wife ordered ribs..I have to say that the portion size has definitely shrunk. 5 bones is not half a rack of ribs.  sorry outback you failed on quality of food. We were seated and check was paid in about 55 minutes. What happened to the juicy 16 oz ribeyes seems everyone is downsizing portions and quality while boosting prices. I suppose for a perfect steak one has to special order and cook at home."}
{"text":"We were on the Strip, hungry, and it was late, about 11pm. Now I know that's not late for locals, but for those of us from the Bay Area, it's time most people are asleep. But I digress. So we find this place and stumble up the stairs, where they're happily still serving dinner.   After looking at the drink menu, I ordered a Sex on the Beach, and it was perfect. I could taste all the ingredients and yet it was well-blended. Now, this drink wasn't on the menu but I figured any good bartender would be able to make me one.   For dinner, I had the lamb chops, and they were quite flavorful. Cooked well, and didn't need much seasoning. My companion ordered a steak salad, with the meat exactly as he wanted it.   During the meal, our server, who was fantastic, asked if I wanted another drink. Well, of course I did, and she let me know her husband had made my drink, and I told her it was really good, and yes, I would have a second one.   We had a wonderful meal, and I am so glad. Even now, some weeks later, it was one of the best dining experiences we had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Porterhouse is the best!! My son loves the outback special and the little one loves the ribs!"}
{"text":"The food is always good. Cooked well and typical Outback quality as always. What sets this particular Outback apart is the service. I have dinned here several times on different occasions, and the service is always OUTSTANDING. The servers are friendly and well trained."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there last night.  We both had the garlic butter filet medallions with broccoli and mashed potatoes.  I have a new favorite! The steak was extremely tender and the kitchen got the medium rare order spot on. Service was impeccable.  Our server, Chase, was great. she checked on us several times, without \"hovering\" at our table. This was probably the best experience I've had at an Outback.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Steak was pretty good, not great.  Mac n cheese wasn't very good.  I'd say Kraft is better or at least as good.  Shrimp weren't that great and only 4 of them.  Mashed potatoes were good but I can do mashed potatoes, and there was something white and gritty in them, like eggshells.  Broccoli and cheese was watery and didn't get eaten.  Mac n cheese didn't get eaten either.  I'd say pretty good, but definitely not worth the money.  For the money it wasn't very good.  $120 meal (for 3 meals) that should have been about $60.  Next time I will definitely spend a few more dollars and go to Bob Taylor's Ranch House!    Just my $0.02"}
{"text":"Excellent steak dinner.  Great kids menu.  Grandson's loved the kids ribs, macaroni and cheese and kids steak dinner. Went on a Saturday night and while we waited for our table they came around with samples of steak and salmon to try. Very good service and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Went there several months ago, on a Wednesday, was soooo bad. Figured it was an off night so went back last Friday. The wait staff reminded us of a pack of eeyores. The appetizer came, no plates, so we asked for some, we finished them before the plates arrived. 4 steaks ordered, 1 hr wait for them. All steaks different sizes, considerably different, inquired why, was told they change size when left under the lid.... what?!? Not 1 cooked to order requested, 2 extremely dry, 1 nearly raw and the other raw inside burnt outside, 12 French Fries on two plates, an ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes on another. Came home hungry, will never go back, NEVER! 1 star because the online \"Add your name to the list\" actually worked..."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here with my fiancé but always passed on it. Well, I'm happy i didn't today. Celebrated my friday here haha and it was worth my time, money and calories. The service we received from Gavin was everything I could ask for. He was extremely attentive and catered to all our needs. The food was flavorful and I was impressed with their Pork Porterhouse (my new fave). I will definitely stop in more often"}
{"text":"First time coming back here in years. The table was pre-set with a mobile LED screen that the server did not explain the function of. Apparently you use it to order your appetizer and drinks. The server still takes your main entree orders which pretty much makes the handheld LED screen pointless at the end of the day. Your expectations should be set along the same standards as any similar chain restaurant. Food was decent, service was ok. I ordered the Shrimp on the Barbie with a baked potato on the side and both were pretty good. The restaurant is located in the middle of a busy outlet shopping plaza right off Las Vegas BLVD. Not much else to say about this place."}
{"text":"I come to this location weekly and it never disappoints! Ask for Watson as your server... She's the best!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and a male bartender servered us. Brandon? Excellent service and very helpful. Ordered the lambchops and they were cooked a beautiful medium. We also ordered a steak and it was quite gritty but after letting the bartender know he immediately removed it and within a very short time a fresh, new steak had arrived in it's place cooked perfectly. The sweet potato is always excellent and the homemade blie cheese dressing is the best I've ever had. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Tony is a great server and made our meal enjoyable and unique. Will for sure go back to experience  tonys A+ service!!! Food was super good too"}
{"text":"Sad to see some of the negative reviews.  I come here often.  Food is normally pretty good and you can't beat the dine rewards program."}
{"text":"Normally like Outback but this one I won't be coming back to. I got the steak salad and the dressing was go full of sugar that when I scooped it up on my fork it just sat on the fork like pudding. It was so sweet I couldn't eat the salad. The server wasn't much help and the steak was a little dry."}
{"text":"Oh em gee!!! Customer service at its finest! I'm so stupidly picky(I know this) and I'm finniky about blood from my steaks on my plate.. Took them 2 times for my idea of a perfect steak. But they did it with no problem... And they were sincere about getting it perfect! I will definitely recommend to all friends and family when they visit las Vegas! Thank you Jason! I left a very satisfied guest!"}
{"text":"This outback is the worse place i have ever been to. I would rate this place with zero stars but that is not an option. We made a reservation one week in advance for 22 people and they made us come in 30 minutes early. Which we did and we know it was a Saturday at 8pm restaurants are busy but they made us wait two hours. We asked for the manager several times but they never came to apologize or tell us anything bout our table. The reason why they told us we had been waiting was because a large table of 15 was in the area where we could be seat it but they never tried to accommodate us anywhere else. For this reason this has been the worse experience at a restaurant for me."}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and to say the previous visit was more delectable than this visit. The service was adequate; however more attention to the drink situation would have been more appreciated. Food was delivered hot but once delivered the server seemed to have disappeared for about 20 minutes. I will still go again with hopes that my experience would be more to the first time."}
{"text":"Came here with a pretty large party of about 10 people.  Service was pretty good.  It did take a while to get some drink refills but the server was mostly on top of things and even had no issues giving all 10 people separate checks.  The steak I ordered was fabulous.  I forgot what it was called but it had some special sauce on it and that along with the A1 made it just perfect.  Also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and bread they served.  Of course with most steaks, the prices are a little spendy, but actually with some of the specials you can order a pretty good sized meal for around $10-$15 which is what I did.  Good food, clean dining room, good service, not much to complain about.  I would come back here again."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had! Our waiter, Jason, was excellent. Talkative, friendly, attentive, he made sure our drinks were always full. The food was served quickly and was soooo delicious! Our steaks were cooked to perfection. After our dinner came, the manager came to the table to introduce himself and ask how everything was. My son-in-law even ordered a cocktail he didn't like and they took it off the bill and brought him a different one. Everyone was SO attentive, I cannot fault this restaurant anything!"}
{"text":"Completely unimpressive. The past two times we have ordered carry-out from this location the orders have been wrong. This most recent time we ordered carry-out for my moms birthday we were so disappointed in the outcome. We specifically asked for 3 pieces of bread (had 2 adult dinner entrees and a side meal). Then my brother reminded them when picking it up and they assured him they were in there. Our fault for not checking, there was one very small loaf. In addition, one of the entrees had a baked potato as the side, yet there was only one thing of butter. When you dine-in you are offered endless bread so I really don't understand why they consistently skimp with carry-out. Outback would never be my choice for dinner, but my mom likes the food. However after the continuous disappointment I highly doubt we will ever dine at this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Should get 6 stars. Had steaks last night. Both were done perfectly. Meat cuts were outstanding. Marbling was perfect. Shrimp on the Barbie reminded me of some Italian anti pasta but they were ok. Nice salad, warm bread, shrooms and veggies were cooked to perfection. Crispy veggies but not raw. Baked potato soup was good. A little cool but not cold. Topped off with Shiraz which made it a perfect meal. Compliments to the chef. We were at the bar and the service was outstanding. Great job!!   Had steaks twice this trip to LV and the quality of beef seems to have lessened. Tougher and less taste. Service was good. No lettuce or salads. And no Shiraz. An Aussie wine that is served at most outbacks. And no Dos XX beer."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the cleanliness of this restaurant. Junk under the table, table was so grimy, bread plates not clean. Help is marginal. Lazy, absorbed in electronic gadgets. Corporate needs to get on this location."}
{"text":"My wife was not pleased with her filet when it was delivered to the table. A little closer to rare than medium.  The waitress readily returned it to the kitchen and Kim (the manager) brought it out after it was grilled a little longer.  The steak was fine yet Kim brought us a little extra as we were leaving just to let us know that she wanted us to know her concern was genuine.  Thank you Kim. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The second time is never the charm. Everything was good at my first visit to Outback in years, but the kitchen at this next location did things a bit different. The big difference was the green garlic sauce that was slathered on each taco heavy and also appeared on the side as a dipping sauce. This sauce was never on my previous tacos and it was way too heavy handed and had too much garlic. Otherwise, the coconut shrimp appetizer at $10 was decent, but the breading fell off as we were eating the shrimp. The waitress was friendly and the ribs were good as well."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant to begin with, so went to dinner happily the night before Mother's Day. Our nice server (Blaire), misheard my daughter's order, and brought out the wrong item. He apologized profusely and quickly corrected it, with us keeping the wrong order to eat or take home. Our salads did not come out on time, again no biggie, but he grabbed the manager Jen and both did everything they could to correct the order. She offered the five of us free desserts. Impressed at their level of service, despite a VERY busy restaurant. They couldn't have been nicer or made more of an effort to correct their mistakes. Will continue to be my favorite place!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? A side salad and entree takes an hour when we are the only ones here. Then when he tries to bring food out while we are walking up to get a bill I get a stomach ache from the stench of the lobster"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but some things had a stale taste to it. I got an Oreo milkshake & the ice cream/whipped cream they added on top tasted so old & stale. YUCK. My chicken tenders were pretty good but they had a borderline stale taste too. Too bad. I hadn't been there in years, will not go back probably. Customer service is good though, pretty friendly. But food is overpriced & not up to quality standards."}
{"text":"The bf and I went here on a sad day to remember someone special to me. The food just was ok. the bread that they serve is always awesome... I just was not feeling steak that day... So they did give me the deal on soup and salad... the Italian dressing was yucky... the ranch however wasn't bad. they use grape tomatoes which I don't like at all but I dealt with it.  their soups NEED HELP... the french onion soup was way too salty... and just didn't have good flavor. the baked potato soup... was a complete joke! it was watery and didn't have a good flavor at all! The server gave better service to his other customers rather than us. he actually had a conversation with the couple next to us...but was real short and clipped when he was dealing with us.  We also ordered alcoholic beverages... I hardly ever drink! I am a good tipper! But he just didn't deserve his tip. and that's saying something.... Now, I am gonna give this place the benefit of doubt and try it again after they are done with the remodel... but I will NOT sit in that guy's section again... His name was tray something..."}
{"text":"Went here for the blooming onion and it was not a disappointment. The waitress was very nice. We had her order from the tab on the table, we just didn't want to deal with it. I  hadvthe salmon with veg. It was  good but a bit over cooked.  My huband had the sirloin with shrimp. The steak was under cooked from what he ordered but the flavor he said was awesome. The couple behide us had a steak also and it also was under cooked, they complained we did not. They got a refund on there bill. I guess we should of said something.  You pay right at the table using that table on the table and you can add tip on it as well.  The reason for a three is I had to have the table cleaned as it still had food stuck to it. But they did clean the spot when I told them about it. I would go back I would try something else and make sure it is to our liking."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Outback to celebrate my graduation from college. The food was good. I had the petite filet with marinated mushrooms, sweet potato with butter, and salad. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. The reason for the two stars is for when we ordered dessert. When we said we would like to order two of the pizookies, the server told us to order it on the table computer. The reason we go to a restaurant is the food and service, I don't want to use a computer to order my food or to pay my bill. I felt like I was at Walmart. I should have chosen a different restaurant, which I will when my dad flies in for the actual ceremony. Why would a person even leave a 20% tip? The service wasn't that great and we had to order our own dessert. If you want people to come back to your restaurant then provide service. I agree with the one reviewer that says it is basically another Chilis, except the food isn't over salty like those places."}
{"text":"I had the Victorian fillet with salad and sauteed mushrooms. Steak cooked at medium was perfect and mushrooms had great flavor. They were ssuteed in brandy i believe. Salad was ok. Be better if they used green leaf. Steak had a lot of flavor too and very tender. Good service, not busy so we were seated right away. My mother had April'schicken?? She thought it was very good. I'm on a diet so no dessert but i'd really like to try the salted caramel skillet. It looked sooo good."}
{"text":"We eat out several times a week. Outback on N Rainbow on is such a great atmosphere. Tony is one of the reasons we go there. He makes it worth the stop, even if it's just for a drink."}
{"text":"My review is based on the online ordering for pickup.  The  ordering process was super easy, you had options to add comments under everything.  For example if ordering a salad, there are comments for you to ask for extra dressing, special instructions for steaks etc.  The only problem is that they ask for promo codes.  When you have a printed coupon from the site, there is no promo code.  So when going to pick up your order the staffer needs to go back in and adjust the price with the coupon.  This should really be fixed as it would make the process quicker. I have ordered curbside 3x. Curbside is on the side of the building, you simply drive up, they have your name and description of your car, very easy.   No issues all 3x. The same girl attended to customers each time I went, she is super friendly even in pouring rain on a Friday night with 5 cars in line.  My orders were accurate each time.  Steaks and other food tasted the same as ordering in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Drinks and food were great! I ordered the ribs and it came out a little burnt the first time but my waitress had them remade for me and it came out better!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best reminder to me about another bad experience at Outback. The appetizers were great. Always when I order a steak something is wrong. I ordered a filet and it had a tendon that went straight through the middle. They offered to make another and I accepted. Although, it never made it until the entire table was already done. This was my brothers 50th birthday and he chose to come here. He also made a reservation and let them know the occasion. We're never offered any dessert of any kind. Just plain sad. Not the same as it was when it first arrived in Phoenix. Even better, I get home with my steak a get it on a plate and it's completely well done. Thanks for the Med rare that I ordered."}
{"text":"I love Outback. They have the best Cheeseburgers! I know normal people go for steaks but I always get the cheeseburger. They also have a drink called Wild Tea that is to die for! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. A real nice restaurant. I got the philly cheese steak and it was cooked to perfection. Timely refills. I love that you can pay the bill when you're ready from the table top tablet. It's my wife and my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating a good steak. Had the hardest time finding this place since the iphone apps like yelp and mapquest make it hard to find locations in vegas for some reason. Who would think this would be in the 4th floor of a coca cola store? Well I had a pina colada which I found out later didn't have much alcohol at all. Wasn't happy about that. The lighting in the place consists of 100 watt bulbs in these hanging lamps that shine right over your face making your dinner date look like frankenstein / bride of.../...Steak I ordered was just ok. Potato seemed dry /overcooked. If anyone gets a chance of going to the Maui / Kihei location, try that. Outback's should take note."}
{"text":"You don't get more \"Chain\" restaurant than this!   Look at the dismal photo of my $9.99 steak and ice cream \"scoop\" shaped mashed potatoes?  If I didn't know it, I would have thought I was in a cafeteria!  Do you think Outback would seriously use this photo, of what you actually get, in their advertising?  Methinks not!  Update:  My son got a hamburger and it was really good.  The manager also called me and they said they are updating their lunch menu in July and TWO sides will be offered, making the plate more appealing.  He said he would get rid of the \"Ice cream scoop\" shaped mashed potatoes too!  YEAH!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend not going to eat at Outback unless you like cheap food with an expensive price. I went earlier today( had a very nice server), started out with the bread being old and stale ( I guess due to it being 3 o clock nothing was fresh). I ordered the chicken tenders, which I DO NOT recommend, they were frozen Tyson chicken tenders that I fix at my house for $5 a bag!! Also, my friend ordered the sirloin which was decent for it obviously being frozen low quality meat. Only good thing about the mean was the service and the potatoes! Not to mention the mean was $40!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a medium steak and it came out almost well done. It was also over seasoned. They weren't even busy so I don't know how that happened. I just ate it without sending it back.  At least the waiter was super nice and they have an \"A\" health grade rating."}
{"text":"Well we usually go to this Outback, well today was awful. we ordered the potatoe soup, talk about gross , it was thick like gravy had a wierd color and salty as hell. Sent it back got the salad instead, then I ordered the coconut shrimp it looked lik it sat in the fryer for EVER!! Then my husband ordered the hamburger med well, it was cooked like a peice of leather,dry as anything, my husband just said just eat it, so I eat my shrimp, the more I sat there the more I got pissed because the money you spend there is crazy. Well I don't like to send food back because I just don't trust doing that. So the manager I pulled her outside and told her everything, she gave us our meal for free. I won't be visting this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had dinner at 6:30 on a Thursday. Service was great. However, I ordered the flat iron steak and it was very small. The menu gave no size choices for this item. It would be nice to know the size before ordering. This was misleading."}
{"text":"Steak was about average.  Pecan salad tasted chemically and not worth the dollar up charge.  Sweet potato was mushy.  I asked for just butter not the extra stuff.  She brought out butter and said, \"I put the cinnamon in thought you would like it.\"  So it was so so."}
{"text":"I ordered curbside twice and each time two of my items were missing. Granted I should have checked everything before I left but I thought after the first mistake they would have gotten my order correct  I will not be returning to this outback unless I dine in or triple check my items. On another note the waiters are very nice."}
{"text":"I normally like the food here.  Just had the Steakhouse Philly.  The sandwich was mediocre at best.  The cheese was not melted and was cold.  The fries were too salty to eat.  They did bring me a new batch of fries not as salty as the first batch but still salty.  I will never order that meal again."}
{"text":"From the second we sat down I had a bad vibe about our server. Stopped in to have a beer and appetizer w mom, sat in the bar area. Our server was Jonny P. After asking about happy hour, which he had little knowledge of and stated was \"not as good as it use to be\" we ordered two beers. We were sitting right next to the bar and it took 5 minutes to get our beers! When they did arrive, they had already overflowed and the server actually put them on our table wet w no napkin. I grabbed napkins from the bar myself and set our beers on them, the beer immediately soaked through 3 napkins. We ordered the chicken flatbread appetizer. It arrived barely warm and our server quickly walked away. We wanted a side of ranch to accompany our appetizer, there were no servers in sight. Keep in mind we were here at 4pm, there were maybe 2 other tables in the whole bar area. I had to ask the bartender to get someone who could give us some ranch before our food got cold. As far as the flatbread, unappetizing. The manager Abby came over to state that she was sorry it took so long for the ranch etc. very nice manager, but it's obvious the staff here needs some serious education on manners and the proper way to serve food and drinks. After speaking w the manager, we finally had an employee bring us coasters for our wet beers which was a relief as our table was all wet from the beer. We also had another server bring us silverware for our food. Imagine that, beer served w coasters and food served w napkins and silverware. Anyway, I will not waste anymore time on this horrible experience, save yourself the hassle and go to another location."}
{"text":"We tried them for lunch today. I had the prime rib au jus sandwich and it was tough and overcooked. My girlfriend had the ribeye sandwich lunch special and we both had iced tea. $30, outrageous for lunch!!! The prime rib was tough, over cooked, luke warm and came with fries. My girlfriend's sandwich came with a salad but apparently no fries!? When I talked to the manager about the lack of quality he suggested that the prime rib isn't cooked to order as it is sliced \"fresh\" in the morning then reheated on the grill when ordered which makes it tough and overcooked. He asked if I would like something else and I asked for the roast beef dinner instead. It wouldn't be ready for hours. Sounds to me and tastes like they are reheating leftover roast beef from the night before for $11.50!!!!   Bottom line: There are better lunch options available nearby for much less money. Not up to the quality of their dinner items nor there advertisements. Very disappointing, not recommended for lunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here as we were in the shopping center right near there. We started with the blooming onion. You can never go wrong with the onion. It was just as good as I remember. We ordered the $6.00 Margarita and it came with the second shot on the side which was unique. It was nice that it actually included two shots. The mix was a little sweet but overall pretty good. We split a the prime rib and the shrimp on the barbie app. The steak was cooked well temperature wise. It could have used some salt. I got the mashed potatoes and they came out cold. I'm not one to complain about the food so I just ate some of them but there were too many for one person. the broccoli seemed buttery which make it unhealthy. The shrimp were good but the bread that came with it seemed unnecessary as they give the pumpernickel bread. It also seemed expensive as it only came with 10 shrimp. that is a dollar a shrimp and they are not even big. I could have bought a whole bag of frozen shrimp for that price."}
{"text":"Check your order at curbside takeaway.  Have a couple of orders incorrect.  Three stars because they fix it when you comeback with an Bloomin onion."}
{"text":"My bestest and I were wandering around the strip looking for a place to eat and she spotted Outback! I've never been to any Outbacks (even at home, and my ex + Current BFs said they would take me but never did, HAH!! Big failures!!), so my BFF decided to swoop me off my feet and be the first one to take me :). yaaaaaayyy!!!  We walked up the stairs to the host stand, the hostess were great and bubbly! We were seated immediately at around 1:30pm when we arrived to the restaurant. Our server (male dude whose name I forgot) was fantastic!! Outstanding service, he was so happy and attentive. This is what makes a great restaurant right here!! Awesome service!! I love happy people!  What makes it even better is the food!! I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger and had that cooked to Medium Rare juiciness and had my onions grilled also. The cheese was so ooey gooey mooey gooey good. Uggghhh yummssss. Definitely hit the spot! The burger was so big that I couldn't even finish half of my fries!!! This burger was about $9-$10??? So good and filling!  The Bestest ordered the Sirloin Salad? She ordered her steak in rare and that salad hit the spot too! There were still leftovers from her salad because... sometimes salads are just so filling! I think this one was $12-$13 bucks :).  Beautiful View of the Mirage, though blinded by the blinds. Wonderful Meal with Wonderful bestest. Wonderful service by the staff. Great Prices.  Definitely a go-back-to place (for a chain)!! :)"}
{"text":"From the moment Pamela seated us to Clarissa taking our order we felt at home. My salad came out looking divine and our steaks very quickly afterwards. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. The manager Alyssa checked on us twice and was very friendly. The restaurant was very busy but everyone was at ease and just seemed happy to be there. This is the best location for quality and service I've been to in Las Vegas hands down! Thank you Pamela Clarissa and Alyssa!"}
{"text":"About half of my family went into outback today for Mother's Day for an early dinner, all in all it was a good experience. The food came in very quickly, I did not expect it to be done so quickly. It all tasted great and we all enjoyed our meals. The only downside was the service. My family isn't the easiest family to deal with, we are very loud and distracted easily and my nana with scary OCD so we requested to sit somewhere out of the middle of the restaurant (in the back) and the host acted like we wanted her to perform brain surgery on all of this, after huffing and puffing her breath half of us sat down. Our server was stressed out easily he just couldn't handle it and I agree we are a rowdy bunch but just go in the back and cuss about after we leave, we over tipped completely because my cousins and aunt and I are all servers so we understand the struggle am I saying he didn't deserve it most likely not but hey we know what its like."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite place to eat. I love steak & I've eaten steak everywhere and I've always enjoyed Outback steaks the most. More then Ruth Chris or any of the high end places I've experienced. The last couple times we've been here I've noticed some serious change in the quality of the 10oz ribeye they have served me. The steak is now leaner thiner & a lot more like a steak you'd get a place that doesn't specialize in steak. I'm very sad because I truly loved this place but this will probably be the last time we eat here. Back to Longhorn Logan's & now what use to be my 2nd favorite Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Drunkenly walked over here after the blue man group show because I had a gift card. It was a bit hard to find at first,...it could have been my hindered state haha but I got on the coke shaped elevator and went upstairs. I walked in and the hosts weren't too thrilled to be there. I'm A Hostess As well, but I'm Always cheery so they def need to work on that. I walked myself to the bar and was pleasantly greeted by both Chris and chrissy. They were both warm and nice and showed us the menus. I got the chicken tortilla soup and it was really good! My brother got the outback burger and it was cooked just like he liked it. I would go back again"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, and the service was poor. Definitely only 1-2 stars, and I only went with 2 because I didn't have as many problems as some of those I dined with.   I was here with colleagues from work, while we were on a business trip. Since the restaurant was right next to our hotel, we decided this would be reliable and quick. Not the case.   Our appetizer - crab and avocado dip - seemed \"old,\" as if the avocado wasn't fresh and the crab lacked flavor. One of my colleagues, then, had to send her steak back because it wasn't the proper temperature. To top things off, our waitress wasn't very attentive and actually just dropped off the check at the end of our meal, without even asking whether we wanted dessert. (We actually did.) After finally bringing our desserts, she simply dropped the check onto our table, then had the nerve to make us chase her down to run the credit card!   We most likely won't be back in the area for a good while, but when/if we are, we'll definitely venture out to find someplace better than this."}
{"text":"This is a First class place for a great meal.  The Steak  and Lobster dinner is outstanding!  My server, Trina does a great job of checking on me, and the Manager Marci always stops by to make sure everything is perfect!  I Highly Recommend this establishment.  Bob O."}
{"text":"went here tonight with some friends for dinner,  started off with blooming onion, calamari and coconut shrimp.  They were accomadating with the calamari as I don't eat the tenticles, so they separated them out.  We also had soup.  the onion was wicked greasy and the calamari were so small,.I've never seen them that small.  For our entrees we had steak and lobster tail, fish and a burger.  Again, the lobster was so small...lol.  All in all it was meh...service was slow...shrimp appetizer came out after our entrees were served.  our server was nice enough...not a lot of interaction though.  If it weren't for the giftcards I don't think I would come here again.  Too expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Came here the other night and was greatly disappointed... Reminded me of why I do not come here... So I had a gift card so we thought we would give it a shot. It was 9:30 on a Saturday night and we get there and the door is locked... That should have been a sign... Rang the doorbell and someone let us in. We ordered a blooming onion and it was not like I remember. It was a lot smaller than I remember and it lacked much of the flavor I remembered. So I ordered the ribs and chicken and it came with a few very small ribs, and a very small piece of grilled chicken breast and 1 side. So we got an extra side of fries to split because the one side didn't seem like enough. Anyways the ribs were very small but tasty enough. I have had better at a buffet before... The chicken was plain and tasteless. It was cooked correctly but lacked any type of seasoning. The fries we got as extra side were over done and EXTREMELY salty. I understand they like to season them from the kitchen but please leave the extra salt behind. If I wanted that much salt, I would just poor the salt shaker directly on my tongue."}
{"text":"The Arnold Palmer I ordered was horrible and then we were told that the strawberry lemonade no longer had free refills and they got rid of any flavored teas. Then we wanted prime rib and were told it isn't available till 4pm. Then why do you have a prime rib dip on your lunch menu? We ordered our food and the salads had barely any dressing on them. My baked Potatoe soup was good so I am hoping the rest of our meal turns out better then the first impression. It's really bad when I rate a restaurant before I get the entire meal."}
{"text":"My Saturday  first time at an Outback in over 5 years, after a long day of Halloween shopping we finally agreed to give a whirl. Amazingly accurate wait time from the host staff and beverage jar with water for while you are waiting. Our server, Michelle, was one of the best servers I have had. She was super busy but attentive and always went a step above, even with my crazy requests and indecision. The children's meal was great. Salads were fabulous The vinaigrette on the Wedge cut the creamy dressing and blue cheese perfectly. The new crab and avocado appetizer was good but lacking in seasoning. A little salt then perfect! My only disappointment which I did for get about because of the service is the grilled scallops. The menu does not mention they are slathered in sauce and I like mine virgin with light lemon. All in all a great meal, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hair on my food. Send it back comes back cold with hair still on my food. Nope. Done. Oh and they couldn't tell me if the bread contained an allergen or not. Manager finally came over only took off the meal I DIDN'T touch. Called her back over and only took a couple dollars OFF THE WRONG BILL. Waiting for the correct one. Waitress is being a trooper through all of this, extremely polite. Manager is not."}
{"text":"I ordered the No Rules Pasta to go. Twenty minutes to get order but they were busy. Bag placed on the counter and I was home within 10 minutes. Pasta cold and congealed with absolutely no flavor, chicken overcooked, shrimp ok. Also, when I told the hostess that I was going to sit at the bar I didn't get a menu with specials. There were a few things I may have chosen given the option."}
{"text":"7/11/13 My wife and I stopped at the Outback Steakhouse and sat in the bar area.  We shared the avocado crab stack appetizer while enjoying a Fosters and a gin martini.  The crab stack was really tasty with a pinch of lime and a dash of Tabasco.  I had the strip with asparagus and mashed potatoes and my wife had Victoria's mini filet with crab legs, asparagus, and baked potato.  We doubled the crab legs to share.  The steaks came out as ordered, medium rare.  We drank it down with a Coppola red wine.  Then we moved on to coffee and carrot cake.  I loved the carrot cake, but the coffee not so much.  It was a really nice time."}
{"text":"Asked no less than 5 times to turn the AC off, never happened...I guess the manager doesn't care about customer comfort.  Left to have dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to the porterhouse.  Ordered it medium, got a steak that was not trimmed of fat and medium rare.  Ok, i figured I'm starving, I'll just deal with medium rare.   As I worked my way towards the center of the steak, it got progressively rarer until at one point it was raw.   The waitress took the steak to show to the manager.  Manager returned with the same steak recooked, gross.  It's ruined after that.   She did offer to replace the sides but I just wanted it taken off my bill, not a recooked steak.  Now I know why the lighting was so dimm in that place.  They dont want you to notice.  Waitress was great by the way."}
{"text":"Despite the busy late dinner rush around 7-8pm, we were seated within about 20-25 minutes.  Service was great, food came out promptly.  We did wait quite a bit for our bread and butter though.  On a busy night, I highly recommend ordering a cocktail, some sort of appetizer immediately!  Our steaks (Victoria's Filet and Melbourne 32 oz both medium rare) came out very rare and red... mmmm.  Next time maybe I'll go for medium.  Overall, we really loved the mushroom appetizer and the sweet potato fries are amazing!  If you're looking for something  to fill you up on the first night and don't want to spend more than ~$100 per person, I think it's a great option.  I was so happy when we ran into this, because I knew I wanted steak or something substantial.  I thought the wait was reasonable on a weekend on the strip vs. any of the pricier signature restaurants or steakhouses."}
{"text":"Took almost an hour for our food to come out (only 2 adults and 2 children so not a huge order). Waiter was ok until after we got our food then never came around after that. We had to flag down another waiter to get to go boxes and our check. We were there a total of 2 1/2 hours. Never returning to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Same experience here as with other locations. Steak was cooked to order and very tasty. That Caeser salad dressing is just yum. Garlic mashed potatoes were too salty though. Maybe somebody just had a heavy hand today. Waitress knew all about GF menu and the runners confirmed GF dishes without me having to ask."}
{"text":"Overall, we were not happy with our visit. It was my mom, my boyfriend, and I dining tonight, and both my boyfriend and I work at a different Outback in California. Right away we noticed the place was very clean and decorated much nicer than ours, however the menu was much more condensed and more expensive. That's all part of Vegas though so we looked past it. Unfortunately though, my mom's steak was over cooked. The waiter was decent on checking with us but not amazing. They did take the steak back and it came out in an ok time frame. However, the manager, Josh, brought it out and did not introduce himself or apologize. The new steak was fine, and the rest of our food was all good as well. As we work at another location, we get an employee discount which they honored though had some trouble so Josh came to our table again, and we did let him know we were disappointed with his lack of hospitality. We were not looking to have anything comped off of our bill but typically a manager will offer that or a dessert so we let him know it seemed unprofessional. He then offered a cheesecake (though we declined..simply hope he can improve for future patrons.) Overall, the place is alright but a disappointment in customer service."}
{"text":"I gave them one star only because I could not give ZERO stars! After visiting a few times and having had decent meals I was served the WORST meal of my life! It was so awful neither my companion nor I could eat any of it and had to leave. The manager apologized profusely and gave us gift cards, hoping that we would give them another chance in the future but for now the damage had been done and we ended up going to In-and-Out. Outback shouldn't hold their breath 'till they see us again. Just writing this review brings back the nausea! :-("}
{"text":"After returning home on Friday after a long week of work, my fiance and I came to the conclusion that we experiencing a sensation we know well:  We were starving!  The unfortunate reality is that if you decide late in the game on a Friday evening that you want to go out for dinner, it's tough to find a place you can just walk right in and grab a seat.  Thank you Outback for call ahead seating!!  We walked in and past the ten people in the waiting area, and had a table before the bartender could even pour us a beer.  A lot of people poo poo chain restaurants.  Not me.  I figure there's a reason there's so many dotting city and suburbia, and Outback stands out among these strip mall staples.  As restaurants struggle to attract diners through the economic downturn, we the dining public are granted some pretty great deals.  The evening of my latest visit was a deal for four courses (soup, salad, entree, and dessert) chosen from a set list for $15.  I went with the cheese and onion soup (not sure of the name, but not French Onion soup).  It was okay... creamy, cheesy and oniony, but I wouldn't go buying a bowl of it any day soon.  I went ahead and kicked in the extra buck for the upgraded Blue Cheese Pecan Chopped Salad aaaaand... I think I should have stayed with the regular house.  Too much dressing.  So that's pretty much where the less than average grub stopped.  I chose the grilled salmon and was happy I did.  I decided long ago that I will no longer order steak out.  I'm cheap.  And, honestly, I my steaks are way better than any I've had at any restaurant.  The salmon, however, was fantastic.  It was not overcooked (which often happens at chain restaurants) and was seasoned perfectly.  As always Outback does baked potatoes right.  'Nuff said there.  For dessert I opted for the cheese cake.  I wasn't as big as I'd hoped for, but then again I'm a glutton.  It was, on the other hand, delicious.  Not too sweet, very light, and with a raspberry topping.    I won't get too much into my fiance's dinner.  But I will say that service was very prompt, polite and professional.    I said before that I'm cheap.  Really a better explanation is that I love to find value in how I spend my money (I'm pretty sure that means the same thing).  Outback comes through in this department big time.  It's not everywhere you can get a five gallon bucket full of food for $16.  And even fewer where that bucket is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and needed a place where I could get some lobster and shrimp and I was very happy with the service as well as the food by the way they had endless shrimp!  I had been stopped by a train and I still received excellent service and I'm glad I came!  Matt the manager and Mike our hospitable server, made our dinner a memorable experience, thanks!"}
{"text":"This so called Outback Steak Special was anything but. The steak was full of grizzle, was both hard to cut and eat. What a disapointment this was. I honestly have not had this bad a steak in years from a restaurant at this level. I've had better steak than this one at 's in the past, yes it's been many, many years since I've eaten steak at a Denny's but still, don't you think you'd expect more from an Outback restaurant? It never ceases to amaze me when a company trys to compete on price only to throw in an inferior, cheap product thinking their customers are stupid enough to not notice."}
{"text":"We came in tonight. It was busy but we didn't wait long for a table. I ordered my usual coconut shrimp and a wedge salad.  My husband ordered the Victoria filet with a loaded baked potato and ceaser salad.  It was fabulous! Food cooked right and timed great  ! Love this place! Service top notch and a feel of \"teamwork\" emphasized. Everyone was great."}
{"text":"I dont usually dine at chain restaurants but was with other family member that wanted to eat here.  I liked that I could put our name on the list using my smartphone. Luckily it wasnt busy so when we got there we were seated immediately.  Our server was fantastic, his name was Michael, so personable, helpful and genuine, I want him as a server if I were to go back.  The food was good and the bread was fresh."}
{"text":"Very disappointed - ordered an appetizer and it came after our entree.  Didn't get plates for the appetizer.  Sent back a Wallaby Darn drink because of the large chunks of ice, it's supposed to be soothly blended.  The waiter looked at my empty water glass and never offered a refill, left my glass empty.  The restaurant wasn't busy, most tables were empty when we left."}
{"text":"Found a hidden gem on my first visit to Outback in years. They might be known for steaks, but the Aussie chicken tacos stole the show. Three giant tacos stuffed with cabbage/lettuce, pico, cheese, big strips of white chicken and a tasty chipotle aioli. It comes with come crispy aussie fries and it's all for about $10.99. The only hiccup was my bowl of Baked Potato soup I added for $2.99. This version was not thick enough and did not contain enough ingredients, rather just a watery version of the classic. They also have a few $4 cocktails, but those are more fruity than anything else."}
{"text":"Service is very speedy and friendly. We were served by Rikki and she was wonderful.  My first experience here and the sirloin was so good! Juicy and tender. A little undercooked but wasn't bad at all. Fries were hot and fresh. Broccoli was steamed perfectly and tasted great. The environment was calm and not too busy.  Over all a very pleasant experience and I would recommend :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I just recently discovered this Outback just a few blocks from our place. We've been there twice, and both times we have had excellent service. The food is very yummy. Our favorite is the Bloomin' Onion, we'd go there just for that. Both times we've been seated quickly, and received our order promptly. I highly recommend this Outback Steakhouse. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Outback is where you go for steak when a) you want a tasty ranch salad, or b) you want a wallaby darned drink from the bar, or c) you couldn't use the Yelp app to find a better steakhouse (shame on you!).   With that said, I like the ranch at outback. And they refrigerate their salads before serving, so it's also the right amount of cold. Unfortunately for them, this isn't enough to justify the price tag.   The second good thing: the wallaby darned drink with a floater shot of chambord. It's like a grown up version of the fuzzy naval, but better. I'm not even ashamed to order it by name sober. Apparently this isn't a normal menu item anymore (darn), but that didn't stop the bartender from turning on the blender and making me this drink. Yay!  As for the food quality. At $100 per couple, after drinks and a tip, you can find a better steak elsewhere. My personal fave alternative is herbs and rye for similar price point. The last time we went to outback I ordered the filet and lobster tail. The lobster was good, but I'm convinced anything dipped in butter has a place in my heart. The steak was bland & needed steak sauce. It wasn't worth the caloric tradeoff & I as I finished my meal I couldn't help but think we should've gone elsewhere. This is the feeling I get every time I leave outback - but I'll be damned if the ranch and fruity drinks don't make me come back a couple of times a year for this reminder."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many, many times. In the past our experiences have been great. Tonight.....everything was fantastic! Steaks cooked perfect! Seasoned good. Salads and sides were good. Our waiter was awesome, he showed us the perfect amount of attention. Everything came out on time. Everyone was on point tonight. We had something special to celebrate and everything was perfect... Thank you OutBack"}
{"text":"I have never had any issues with this location and have appreciated the quick and friendly service.  On our most recent visit, we decided that we were going to sit at the bar as we were not going to be ordering an entire meal of food.  We were greeted promptly and our drink order was taken in which our beers were delivered within a minute or so.  We decided that we were going to order the Kookabora(sp?) Wings and the Grilled Shrimp.  While we were waiting we were given their loaf of bread.  I have a love hate relationship with this bread, i.e. I love it and it hates my thighs.  I was surprised as we weren't ordering entrees but hey, I'll take it because it's delicious.  Our wings and shrimp came out together and they were hot.  The wings are, without fail, hot enough to cause 2nd degree burns but they are amazing.  I love their wings because they aren't the typical hot wing but are a flavorful wing and have the right amount of spice.  I really enjoyed the shrimp as well, it was cooked well and the texture was perfect.  Overall, it was a good meal and seems to be the trend at this Outback location.  I, as well as my husband, came out a very full and happy camper."}
{"text":"I would give three stars because of one thing:  Time. It took a long time to get seated in a 1/2 empty restaurant and it took a longer time to get our drink order.   Other than that. Food was ok but I just don't prefer these types of chains. I feel like they are too expensive for what you get.   One mistake happened that could have been pretty costly but the manager took care of it without even the slightest protest.  And that's why 4 Stars."}
{"text":"This was one of my worst dining experiences ever and definitely not the Outback service I expected. The food was absolutely disgusting. The steak was hard and dry and very overcooked, the steamed vegetables tasted worse than freezer food, and I am surprised my boyfriend's still alive after the shrimp he was served. To make it worse, our waitress took our orders and then completely ignored us until the bill was ready, when my glass was completely empty and I needed SOMETHING to wash down the abhorrent food.   2 STARS because they managed to keep us alive, despite the poor service and food quality."}
{"text":"Outback has changed the menu - farewell my favorite chicken tacos. Second choice was a pretty simple meal here of a burger with bacon and fries ($10). I liked the soft brioche bun and the non grass fed burger was well cooked and pretty tasty. Not much else to discuss. Good Burger."}
{"text":"Outstanding service from Addy. This was our first time sitting in her section, she went above and beyond to make our dinner pleasant. Will differently ask to sit in her section again. Try it, see yourself."}
{"text":"I love Outback & find here recently, they're all pretty consistent. Last night's visit to the East Blvd. location was no exception.  Food: Bloomin' onion was good, maybe a bit too overcooked, but we ate enough of it to justify the price of it.  My Outback Special steak was cooked a perfect medium well & seasoned nicely; tasted so good!  House salad was delicious & fresh as always; however, I would always prefer a tad bit more salad dressing.  Loaded baked potato was steaming hot (yay!) with just the right amount of toppings.  The complimentary bread was warm & soft; although I can always do without having it.  Service: Seated quickly, it was around 6:30 PM.  Michael, our waiter was efficient & friendly & kept our water glasses filled.  He checked on us just the right amount - not too much & not too little. The manager came around once to make sure everything was OK & came over again at the end to let us know about the customer survey on the receipt (for a free appetizer).  Decor / ambiance: Clean, lighting was nice, not bright.  Prices: Reasonable. The amount of food you get & the price is just right.  Parking: Ok...although you may have to park in the actual shopping center that sits behind it."}
{"text":"I've never been the biggest fan of Outback, so I thought I'd give it another try. The restaurant looked like it had been through a remodel so the ambiance was nice. The server was also nice and was attentive to the table. I ordered their Cobb Salad and a side of Mac and Cheese. The Mac and Cheese was really good I would definitely recommend trying. However, the Cobb Salad was not good. Firstly the presentation was terrible and looked like they used a bag of salad from Fry's and dumped it in the bowl. I honestly could have made the same thing at home. I also didn't realize until I had already left that they forgot to put egg on the salad. Coming from the service industry I know it shouldn't be hard to mess up a salad at a \"steakhouse\", so I'm definitely disappointed.   I would say if you are to eat at Outback DO NOT order a salad, they look and taste like something you can make yourself."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here around 8:00pm. We were seated right away and had a wonderful waiter named Russel. Our booth was near the bar and behind the hostess stand. Food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Came in at 1:25pm.. On a Friday afternoon , there was a handful of people at the bar and only 2 groups of 4 .. I came alone and say next to the 2 groups of four , I got completely ignored for 10 mins and said something to the host about did she let anyone know I was here... She apologized and I said I'd sit at the bar ... I ordered what I wanted and the manager came over and stated that he was sorry I had waited and said my lunch was on the house .. The bartender was extremely prompt With a greeting , getting.a  Drink for me and handing me a menu . Megan is the bartenders name... Since she didn't ignore me .. What it costs for the lunch ( about 30$ all told) will be her tip"}
{"text":"Well I haven't been to a outback steakhouse in like 5yrs..  today's my birthday so I took my wife and little boy and a friend out to eat for my birthday.   We got in fast, but it took forever to get our drinks.  There wasn't many tables in there either. Our server didn't even ask if we wanted appetizer or even try to sell us one..  we ordered 3.  The grilled shrimp, crab cakes and the blooming onion.  All was good but the crab cakes had no flavor. For dinner we got a steak that was more on the rare side than what was asked. Which was medium rare.  But with how slow it was taken for drinks and refills I didn't even want to try and send the food back.  It was just disappointing how slow service was with only a few other tables.  I mean it was only 430pm on a Wednesday. But other than it being slow things were ok I guess..  just a very disappointing birthday dinner that I spent $105 on and didn't even get a birthday dessert."}
{"text":"I have been here several times before and never had a problem with service, until today. We went there for a late Saturday lunch around 230pm. We were greeted by a friendly hostess, the immediately sat. There was not a lot of people in the dining area. I wouldn't have considered them busy at all. We waited 10 minutes and had 3 servers walk right past our table and not even glance at us. This is ridiculous, and we have always had good service there before, I'm just irritated. We left before we could see if it got any better, or worse!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the server was a little aloof.  I think I saw more of the other staff members who brought our food and refilled drinks than of the gentleman that took our order and brought our bills.  Then again they could have been staffed in that matter, so either way, they got the job done efficiently.  I'm not a fan of this particular chain, and having to pay the \"Vegas\" experience premium on the foods just made it a tough pill to swallow.  However, the food was good in quality and it was served fast on what seemed like a packed house.  Their drinks, they're definitely priced competitively ... so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"I mean outback is always you get what you pay for.  It's a chain restaurant  with normal food for its type.  This location I've always gotten reasonably good service or have had management make up for errors quickly."}
{"text":"BLOOMING ONION enough said!!  Love the promotion with NASCAR & Kevin Harvick. I had a burger for the very first time here and it was amazing. I usually get the Outback Special with grilled shrimp."}
{"text":"Steak was great. My waitress was great. But my fries was too salty and burned, while my steamed broccoli was full of dirt. Ever ate broccoli with a side of dirt? Awful, will never come back after this experience, and I've been a longtime fan of the Outback chain. Go to another Outback establishment, not this location."}
{"text":"My sister visited from Florida last night, so our family of 6 went to Outback Steakhouse for dinner. We reserved a table online. We had to wait about 10 minutes when we got there, but that wasn't too bad.   Our waitress, Lindsay, was OUTSTANDING. She knew the menu very well, and even if she wasn't fond of specific foods that we asked her about, she still gave us good descriptions of how each food tasted and was prepared. She was also very personable, which is always a delight at any restaurant. She kept our glasses filled the entire time, and we never had to track her down to ask for anything because she frequently checked up on us.   The food was good, like any other Outback Steakhouse, but it came out much quicker than I expected due to how many people were there. Overall, I was definitely impressed by the speed and friendliness of service."}
{"text":"Ordered special sirloin medium rare to go with lobster and carrot cake. Got home and my steak was purple. Had to cook it. Waste of $40"}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner (keep in mind I'm tracking calories and nutrition) Onion petals - not worth the calories Bleu cheese wedge side salad - always good, but I would rather have just the bleu cheese crumbles and not the fatty, creamy dressing Filet Mignon - medium rare ... Wow! This was worth the whole visit. Tender, flavorful, juicy, I better stop before I go back for another one. Steamed broccoli - what a surprise! Amazing flavor. Garlic mashed potatoes - pretty good, but I've had better. Salted Caramel Cookie Skillet - very tasty. But, then again, what wouldn't be flavorful with salty pretzels, toffee bits, white chocolate baked into a cookie topped with vanilla ice cream and caramel. I stole two bites before my wife devoured it."}
{"text":"Overseas and shrimp and over cooked chicken. It's not what it used to be. Would've saved money and had a better meal at in and out burger."}
{"text":"Sadly in this part of own there are not too many steakhouses and over time even restaurants have been going under.  This Outback's food has been consistently good and the service is always on point."}
{"text":"I am very surprised that this location of Outback Steakhouse has not received 5 stars. The food is excellent for the price, the ambiance is great, and the team of workers really care about customer service and do an excellent job.    While all the bartenders are outstanding, perhaps Gavin is the best. He really takes his job as a personal mission to make every customer happy.  They deserve 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"outback has gone so downhill its pathetic! got the new york strip last week & i would have been better off eating a burger at mcdonalds! thats it!"}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner here..my son ordered the Filet Mignon, and I ordered a Ribeye. They brought out our order..mine was \"not\" a ribeye...waiter apologized..brought me a free soup while they cooked my \"Ribeye\" . I ate my soup while my son had his Filet...After my son had finished his steak they brought my Ribeye out...OMG !!!! it was the best Ribeye I have ever had (managers private reserve..??) my son had a few bites and said it was the best steak he has ever tasted..even over his favorite steak (Filet Mignon).   Wait !!! then the waiter said there was no charge for my steak..OMG !!!  That is how you turn a bad into a welcomed, GOOD !! ..take note businesses.  Outback \"PLEASE\" mess my order up again...You Rock !!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the swanky new look. The ahi tuna was amazing! I ordered the 11 oz sirloin, it was worth every penny. The waiter Timothy was very attentive and filled our drinks before we even asked. My wife enjoyed our dinner as much as I did."}
{"text":"I find this location to be comfortable and the staff to be friendly.   It is a safe bet in a town where finding a decent steak is surprisingly hard."}
{"text":"No greeting. No thank you upon leaving! The restroom was incredibly dirty. Steak was good (only choice meat served) Salad had about a teaspoon of dressing and a request had to be made for more. Chicken fingers were over cooked and bordered on being burned. I've been going to the restaurant more than ten years. It's looking tired and worn. The employees act worn out too!"}
{"text":"Evidently there's a zagat survey list on the best chain restaurant steak.  Which I find preposterous.  Would they have a list judging the best movie about grass growing?  \"In the end, Crabgrass beat out Ragweed just because of the potential allergens.\"  No, because sometimes you can make an entire category of things that suck, and chain restaurants, as a general rule, serve shitty steak. Not that I'm judging.  So if you go to Outback, don't expect anything amazing, despite the fact that zagat said they were tasty.  But outback is worth visiting anyway, because have you ever had their shrimp appetizer served on their brown bread garlic slab-thing?  The bread is better than the shrimp.  It's amazing.  But truly legendary status is only accorded thusly: imagine an appetizer with so many calories that three could share and still crack a thousand calories each?  Enter the cheese fries with bacon and a glob of ranch and you will know what spoonfuls of lard feel like to your arteries.  This particular location has a number of great bartenders and if you go there looking for a pleasant time and decent food, you'll be satisfied.  Chicken breast with BBQ sauce: palatable.  Broccoli with crab-butter sauce?  Tasty.  Rack of lamb? Surprisingly good.  Really there are a ton of options here but one thing you will not get is world-beating steak.  So save it, Zagat."}
{"text":"I met two friends here for dinner on a Friday night, which based on the parking lot, I thought we'd have a problem getting seated. I did get a \"buzzer\" & was told it would be 15-20 minutes; however, we snagged some seats at the bar & ended up grabbing a table in the bar area.   We got helped almost immediately after being seated & ordered the coconut shrimp. That, along with the bread came out in less than 10 minutes. However, the time it took for our salads & entrees was quite a different story. I believe we waited 15 minutes for our salads & about 10-15 more for our entrees of two steaks & one chicken entree. Not once did our waitress apologize for the delay.  The coconut shrimp were delicious. They were huge pieces of shrimp, with plenty of the coconut breading. The salads were fresh. Our meals were cooked to our liking; however, the chicken was very dry. They did take it back & bring my friend another piece of chicken & fresh serving of the vegetables. She was pleased with the second attempt.   This visit wasn't great enough to make me want to come back to this location. I think I'll stick with the Huntersville one."}
{"text":"I'm pretty happy with this Outback, as they're consistenly good.  Yummy in my tummy meal is the outback special, loaded baked potato & the house salad. Oh & the bloomin onion of course. Their sweet tea is good, too.  The steak is a generous portion & cooked perfectly to my choice of medium well.  The wait staff are friendly & attentive & the resturaunt is always clean. The manager is always there when I am, so she stops by to check on me, which I like that aspect."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for my birthday dinner. We decided to order their $14.99 special, while my husband enjoyed a beer and I had one of their Blackberry Martinis (delicious!). We decided on the Baked Potato Soup (cheese, bacon, and onions), House Salad (lettuce, cabbage, cucumbers, cheese, tomatoes, onion, and croutons), their Sirloin Steak, along with a Sweet Potato, and finally Cheesecake with Raspberry Drizzle for dessert. They even put a candle in my cheesecake for my birthday!"}
{"text":"We went here for our Anniversary dinner. At first we went to the location at the Coke Bottle on the strip but holy moly, the price!! Anyway, this location was super close to our movie at Galaxy Cannery so we picked it.  The server and the seating host were really nice. Our server was on the spot. Great service, handled our discount and coupon easy peasy. No hassle at all.  Food was yummy. We were really happy. We would absolutely go there again."}
{"text":"This was a real learning experience, with the economic times being what they are, my wife and I wanted a good meal, and fun atmosphere.  It had been some time since we went to Outback, we found out that you can call ahead and get your name on \"the list\", I knew that they did this for very large groups, but not for couples. Whoops, I was wrong... so call ahead and get your name on the list! We waited 30-45 minutes and finally got seated. Things started looking up until the salad came. They forgot the salad dressing, well, no big deal, we will flag down our waiter, but we didn't see him for some time, but another waitress came by and asked if everything was ok, and we mentioned that we would like salad dressing for our salad. So we drank our water until it was gone then our waiter came with the dressing and was so apologetic, he was sorry he forgot to bring it out, but right behind him was our main meal being served by someone else.  Ok, we had our meal, so we finished our salad, they my wife had the special, and I had the Melbourne Steak plate. This steak tasted like compressed sawdust, and my wife said her food tasted burnt. We were so disappointed that we just wanted to leave, we did complain to the waiter, and he said the manager would be over to talk to us. That never happened. I don't know if we will ever return to THAT Outback again."}
{"text":"Had ribeye steak and as usual great taste. Was upset because they took the 10oz ribeye away   So we ordered the 14oz and split it. Surprise that the service was a little slow but all in all, I highly recommend Outback's"}
{"text":"They always have amazingly cold beer in ice cold mugs! I wasn't impressed with the cut of meat I got as there was a lot of gristle. I'm still a fan and will definitely come back. Good service and quality food."}
{"text":"Party of 6 people.  We met at the bar at 5:45 and got drinks while we waited for our table and 6:00 reservation.  We ordered at 6:10 and the soups and salad didn't make it to the table until 6:45.  2 soups came without spoons, 1 salad without dressing.  \"I'll be right back\" became the joke of our table because it was always took at least 5-10 minutes for anything.  Let's look at the soup and watch it get cold while I wait for you to return with a spoon. The entrees came at 7:15....over one hour after we ordered.  The steaks were covered in a spicy and salty seasoning that was totally unreasonable.  It was almost comical after a while.  We had to ask for the check, again \"I'll be right back.\"  We didn't leave until almost 8:00!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was over cooked except the coconut shrimp which was very good. Server was covered with tattoos which prevented me from enjoying my lunch."}
{"text":"I hate that I'm giving 3 stars. I've been a fan Outback for years when I lived in CA. I haven't had it in years and decided to have dinner with my family last night. I ordered the Alice Springs Chicken, the honey mustard sauce was missing, the bacon was not the thick cut like how I remembered. I also think the chicken may have been a little under cooked because later that evening my stomach was a bit upset - or who knows. Outback - oh how you've changed, but I'll give you another shot in the future.  Big shot out to our waiter Nicholas for just being himself - super friendly, tentative and just going above and beyond in customer service. On top of his tip, we hooked him up with 4 WM Golf Tournament tickets. Hope he has a great time at the event. He definitely deserves it. I think he the best part of our experience at this location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner last night to use a gift card that was gifted to him. We were seated within 10-15 minutes, which was earlier than our estimated wait time. Great service. Our server was very friendly and checked on our table frequently.   My steak was pretty dry which is why I couldn't give this review a higher star rating; could've been a bad day in the kitchen. My boyfriend ordered a ribeye cooked medium, which was a little on the raw side, however he still enjoyed it. Lastly, drinks are pretty strong, so you're getting your money's worth for the alcohol."}
{"text":"We have been to this location 3 times since it opened.  Food has been very good for a chain restaurant.  Excellent servers each time."}
{"text":"After giving this place a year to get their act together we decided to go back with some good friends for a birthday dinner. The server asked if there was a special occasion and we told her it was our friends B-day.  Now comes the 40 min. wait for the food. Endless shrimp??? If you don't mind the 20 min wait between orders...LOL. All the shrimp were overdone. The Wife had a choking issue with some of the little rocks of breading going down the wrong pipe. A few scary minutes and she finally coughed it up. Manager came over to see if she was OK. When the wife explained the issue the manager apologized and asked if she would like some more..????? When the wife asked for some Coconut shrimp instead we were told there would be an up-charge.....OK, whatever, 15+ min. later 4 overcooked Coconut shrimp come out, wife had one. 2 hrs later we called it a night as our friend was waiting ANOTHER 20 MINS FOR HIS 'ENDLESS' SHRIMP to arrive.......Once again Outback proved to us why we won't be back. P.S. the 2 burgers we ordered were good. This comes up in the wife's logon. I'm her husband Gregg. So, nothing for the Wife's issue & nothing for our friends b-day. Except for an upgrade charge for more overdone shrimp."}
{"text":"Not bad or good, the  food was ok. Ribs was overcooked,  the waiters we had wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Had dinner there for Mothers Day. The Manager stopped by also to check on service. This is our favorite location of all... We are never disappointed when we eat here had excellent service seated in the bar as well"}
{"text":"Great everything for 4pm on a friday in and out in an hour. Only issue... didnt receive a receipt for 78.00 order for the three of us, the drink was very bad.... i have NOT had a good drink here in the last 3 visits.., AND I cant get my reward credit because we paid cash  That makes me mad in a way but server, she was great!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I dined at any Outback Steakhouse. Our experience this evening was superb! Our waiter, Cloid, was terrific. I ordered Prime Rib and my wife ordered some coconut shrimp and a salad. Everything was prepared well, tasted great, the service was stellar and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Outback! I always get the Alice Springs Chicken & am never disappointed. My husband always gets a steak & it's always cooked to perfection, as it was today! The service today was superior as usual; our server was Cody & he was fabulous! He listened to our specific instructions & ensured everything was exactly per our request! We will definitely come back!! Thank you Outback for another awesome dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Not a great lunch today.  Ordered 6 oz top sirloin medium rare and it came out well done.  The manager was outstanding, offering a replacement and comping the meal, but by then not that hungry.  Will have to try again another time."}
{"text":"went there last night with friends for my birthday.  There were 12 of us.  We had a great time at the bar with the server.  She was very friendly.   Even though we had reservations for 6pm, we had to wait awhile to get seated.  We really didn't mind as we were all visiting in the bar area. The place was extremely cold temperature wise.  We mentioned it to our waiter, he sent the manager over and she did adjust temperature but since it is on a cycle, it would take 45 minutes to show improvement.  Luckily some people in the group had jackets/shawls in the car and shared.  It took quite a while to improve.  That was our biggest complaint. It is always hard to serve a big group and I thought the young man did a good job. I enjoyed my food - I had the shrimp.  Some had issues with the spices on the steak.  They had asked for 'go lightly on the spices' but it didn't happen. They did offer a free ice cream dish for my birthday though I chose the carrot cake; it was good."}
{"text":"This Outback is really good.  The food is consistent the staff is great and they always seem to deliver a great experience.  Go say hi to Nick behind the bar or chit chat with Aubrey one of the managers there.  They have happy hour all day and the food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night at 5pm, servers just arriving plenty of empty tables, but had to wait 15 minutes.  Server brought out appetizer, but we had no silverware since sitting down,  He explained they were wrapping the silverware now and he would bring it back which he never did  we just grabbed it off table next to us.  Crab cake appetizer was so small, but it was good.  Potato soup was not creamy enough and just lacked something probably just made and didn't have time to thicken.  Prime rib was not good.  Very hard to cut and stringy.  I have had better at Harris Teeter takeout in Ballantyne and it was 1/3 of Outback's price.  Overall, my family won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Hungry for steak? Outback fit the bill. We were actually trying to eat at First Watch, but when we pulled up to the parking lot of First Watch and were overwhelmed by the Sunday brunch crowd, we skipped over next door to the Outback.   We debated on whether it was opened because eons ago, Outback did not serve lunch. We entered and there wasn't a large crowd. We were ushered to a booth immediately. I shared an 8oz Outback Sirloin with my daughter with a Caesar Salad and loaded bake potato with sour cream on the side. My husband got the 10 oz Ribeye.  While we waited, I checked in with Yelp and noticed they had a Dine Rewards. 3 qualifying visits gives you a 4th visit for 50% off up to $20 (Outback, Fleming'ss, Carraba's). We also munched on their delicious loaves and butter.  Marguerite, our server went above and beyond in hospitality. She gave us 2 full servings of Caesar Salad even though we were sharing. My husband was thrilled with his House Salad where they cut their grape tomatoes. We also enjoyed the pepper mill at table.  When our steaks arrived, the baked potato was halved beautifully on two plates beautifully dressed. The sirloin was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. The ribeye was also medium rare and was nicely marbled. Our server asked cheekily, \"Now, would you like sauce to destroy the steak?\" I requested for a side of Cabernet sauce and grated horseradish. My husband asked for Heinz 57 sauce. There was no room for dessert. Our bill came out to under $40 before tip. Great value for money! I only wish that I had room for a Blooming Onion."}
{"text":"Great value for money! Because of the large portions, our family tends to split meals at Outback Steakhouse. This was our daughter's choice for her birthday celebration. We were seated quickly on a Sunday night. We were waiting for another member of the party, so we started with the Bloomin' Onion. It is huge. It comes with a zesty sauce. We asked for another sauce to accommodate the amount of dipping we do. The dark honey bread with whipped butter is on the house. My daughter and I split a 11oz sirlion with loaded baked potato and Caesar Salad. We added the garlic butter. Hubby and son shared the full rack of ribs with loaded baked potato and house salad with ranch. My eldest daughter chose the chicken with smothered cheddar and bacon with fries. Even though we split meals, we could hardly finish our meals. The food was delicious as usual. The next time, we won't get the garlic butter because it didn't really enhance the steak which was well-seasoned and cooked to medium-rare perfection. The only downside to this experience was after the entrees arrived, the wait staff was slow to notice that we were ready for the check. Happy Birthday, Dot!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and the service SUCKED!!! We felt rushed from the beginning. the waitress seemed like she didn't really have time to even pronounce her sentences completely. We kept needing her to repeat herself. The food was very good, but they kept putting the hot plates right in front of my 9 month old. It is okay to be busy but everyone deserves a nice day/night out."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. Blooming onion was overcooked to the point of tasting burnt. The quesadilla was dripping grease.  On a positive note. It was not crowded by any stretch so our conversations were easily heard."}
{"text":"So glad that they are bringing back some of the things that made Outback great! Their steaks are back to the original way of preparing them and better than ever. If you like lobster tails, you simply cannot beat their steak and lobster for $14.99!  It is, at least at this location, a Maine lobster tail!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good steakhouse. I ordered a sirloin, well-done. Had baked potato side, but nothing else offered with it. My plate appeared a little empty and my steak looked like a kid's size steak; also, it could have been a little more cooked as I ordered it well-done. My boyfriend had a larger cut of meat and he regretted ordering it medium rare because it tasted under-cooked to him. He had a side of mashed potatoes and a salad which he liked. Bread to start our meal was good, though we could have used a bit more butter for it (they seem to be stingy about sauces and butter here).   We also ordered two appetizers. Crab-stuffed mushrooms which were pretty good, but a very small extra container of 'wild mushroom' sauce cost $3 - that seemed a little silly to us both. We're guests at their restaurant, so why not try to make us happy? The other appetizer was the onion sticks. Basically, glorified onion rings, and the onions were rather mushy.... the batter makes that appetizer - would never order it again, though.  Drinks were not brought out right away, so we had to sit there thirsty (it's 100 degrees outside today here in Vegas). Timely refills on drinks.  Desserts and special drinks looked nice, but we passed on them. The salt and pepper grinders are nice. Steakhouse 'feel' with much dark-wood paneling throughout the restaurant. Service fair to good. OK price, probably a good deal less expensive than expected, about $10 to $15 less. My boyfriend and I would return here sometime. Recommended."}
{"text":"Rock bottom quality of food. I don't eat at outback frequently enough to say if it's the chain or this location.  Wife always craves 1 dish (shrimp and fettuccine) she left it and said it was the worst she'd ever had.  My burger was not so great either... bun was soggy, meat didn't taste good and had a wierd texture, old lettuce...  Service was good, no negatives about the staff.  I would recommend either going to another outback or just going somewhere else."}
{"text":"During the last years we decided not to return to this chain due to the bad experiences. Nevertheless, it can be very expensive to eat always at the Strip so we went to the new Outback near Macy's.  Lovely interior, not too cold inside. Our waiter was awesome : very polite and giving enough attention.  Food came quickly and was warm enough. The new tuna was very good. My husband got the wooded grilled ribeye (njammie !) and our son the spareribs with barbecue sauce. As desert we ordered a Kahlua coffee (just piccobello !) and a cheesecake. We ware happy customers this time. Keep up this level of serving meals..."}
{"text":"In my opinion Outback has improved quite a bit over the last year. I used to call them UpSellBack because no matter what you ordered you were barraged with upsell questions. The last several times I've been here they haven't done that once. Bravo!   I love the steaks. I've really never had a bad steak at this location. I've heard others say they don't cook it how you want it.. Send it back! I would. I order mine Medium Well, and I don't mind it on the Well Done side. I get it how I like it.   Yummy baked potatoes! Crisp, chilled salads with tomatoes, onions, carrots AND cucumbers, really nice salad. I love their Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing. And as long as you have a couple of friends to split it with make sure you order a Bloomin' Onion. Chocolate Thunder From Down Under is an amazing dessert! IF you have the room.   I usually get really good service at Outback. Sometimes it's even superb. On one of my last visits another couple thought it was okay to bring their ever-screaming 2 year old, on a Friday night, at 7 p.m. (Really???) but for the most part the place is quiet and calm.   Sometimes there is a wait, even with a reservation. This is a very busy Outback. I recommend it. Good food, good service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wanted a great steak and have had good luck with other Outbacks. This one was an exception. It was 80 degrees inside, the steaks came out and one of the parties in our group ordered a filet and it came out a sirloin that was formed to look like a filet. Then they offered to speed a new order through and so she ordered a ribeye and it came out and couldn't hardly cut it as it appeared to be mis cut. Not sure how these places stay in business but we won't go back.   Felt bad for the waitress as she was wonderful but when your kitchen or owner of the franchise doesn't back you with great ac and quality cuts, move on to somebody that appreciates you.   Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Bread was stale.  Medium rare steak came out well done.   2nd steak came out barely rare.   Couldn't eat 1/2 of it.   Wait staff was very nice and comped the steak.  They said the cook was new and just learning how to cook..   I appreciated the gesture but really wanted a nice steak, not a free mess.    Send the cook packing or do everyone a favor and close the restaurant! How hard is it to cook a steak properly? Embarrassing for Outback..."}
{"text":"Two hour wait on a Saturday was to be expected. What gets my one star is that when I finally received my medium cooked steak it was WELL DONE beef jerky and the management who thought it was helpful to respond with \"it's Saturday night long waits are to be expected\". Well my complaint wasn't with the wait, it was with the crappy food served but thank you for the excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"We came here with some friends and were promptly seated and had drinks served. We got our appetizer, the Aussie fries, to share, and they were great--well seasoned and covered with cheese, served with a ranch-style dipping sauce and topped with bacon bits. We had some mixed drinks and beers as well as sodas; a prime rib, sirloin, rib eye, and a New York steak. Everyone ate up, no complaints there. We had a loaded baked potato soup, baked potato, dinner salad, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and seasonal mixed veggies. Everything was ok but the mixed veggies looked barely cooked and were very hard. We brought this up to the server and they brought us out a new side order which were much less toothsome. They were good on checking in on us, taking away plates, bringing in refills, and attended to our only issue. We got to enjoy good company without having to complain about sending something back or having to wait forever for it to be replaced. The sevice was super quick, very friendly and attentive here. I appreciated that the manager came out to ask us about our issue with  the veggies, and if everything else was ok (of course it was!--but the level of service shows they care, and that's what matters.) Everything I had tried was delicious and I surely cleaned my plate--we all had no room for dessert, no matter how appealing their brownies and sundaes looked, sadly. Great food and service at this location, thanks Outback!"}
{"text":"Wir gehen in jedem Urlaub in ein Outback Essen. Wir sind eine ziemlich gleichbleibende Qualität von der Kette gewohnt und wurden auch nie enttäuscht. Das Problem liegt in der Zubereitung, wir haben alle Medium Rare bestellt und Well Done erhalten. Geschmacklich Top - Zubereitung Flop! Sorry aber das Lokal sieht uns nie wieder!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday lunch.  Contrary to some negative reviews had no problems with either service or wait time.  Could be the time we visited around 2 pm but still the place was half filled.  Did not try any of the steaks, went with the lunch combo.  Very pleased with what we got: bloomin burger, chicken tacos, onion soup, house salad.  Burger was perfectly cooked, chicken had a nice grilled flavor to it.  Amy, our server, was professional and efficient."}
{"text":"During our vacation we decided to have dinner here since it's family friendly. Our waitress, Cassy, was amazing!  The food was just as expected, delicious! My son had chicken nuggets and fries, my husband had a huge steak with backed potato, I had the New York, butterfly cut, very well done,  shrimp, salad and mac n cheese , and OMG,  everything came perfectly cooked and fast considering how busy they were! ! We are definitely going again!"}
{"text":"What a disaster! Went in for lunch at 11:30am Monday. Ordered the food about 11:40 and my wife's salad came out in about 5 minutes. I ordered the Aussie fish tacos. 40 minutes later still no tacos....... I sat there and watched my wife eat her salad while I waited for tacos. The salad was her lunch so she was going to be done well before my food ever showed up. Finally saw the server again and asked about the tacos. \"They are coming right up!\" Asked why it took so long and the server said they were waiting for my wife to finish her salad first. WTF? Again, the salad was her lunch so how was that supposed to work? 10 more minutes go by. Wife is picking at her salad trying to wait for my food to come out. Finally, the tacos have arrived. It's now 12:30 and I'm starving and pissed off. They were so over cooked and dried out I could not eat them. It was fish jerky. They must have been in the oven the whole time. Asked to talk to the manager. Another 10 minutes go by.....manager never shows but finally at least somebody comes over and asks whats wrong. Where do we start?..... She was nice enough to comp the whole thing but it's now been well over an hour and the place was not even slightly busy. Bad service, unprofessional staff and bad food. Could not get any worse. Somebody needs to fix some big issues with this location."}
{"text":"We went to outback last night for an early dinner. Around 5pm. Normally we have an issue with a long wait but this time they were able to seat us right away.  Our waitress immediately came over and we ordered the blooming onion for an appetizer. Which as always was great. It's definitely worth ordering and it was served fresh and hot.  For our entrees, we both ordered their wings off of the appetizer menu because we both love those! This is where the service started to lack. We waited and waited and waited for these wings which you would think would be even quicker than a regular entree at a steakhouse. We watched the tables next to us get their food and still, no wings.  Finally, someone from the kitchen brought our food and then our waitress made an appearance and said \"oh great they finally came!\" But during the time we were waiting she never came back because she was afraid to show up without them.  When we did finally get them they were hot and tasted great. But the wait was disappointing.  Outback has always had good food but bad service."}
{"text":"I just want to give a shout out to manager, Trevor and server Cody for a great dining experience.  We had a small problem from another location and decided to try their location.  When they heard this news, they went out of their way to \"make it right.\"  We were treated like royalty.  All restaurant employees could learn superior customer service from these two great guys.  Thanks for making my husband's birthday a memorable experience.  I should mention that the lobster tails were cooked to perfection and the grilled asparagus were delicious."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location for 10 plus years. The service is amazing, and Managment is top notch. We've had surprise birthday dinner event here and Managment was very helpful. If I need a great meal and excellent service, I always come here. Thanks Outback!"}
{"text":"I know this is a chain but the dinner I had here on 7/24/16 was ACE! (That's Aussie for Excellent!) There was no wait at 5:30pm when we arrived, so we were seated right away. Our server Philip was a gem. He immediately brought us waters and hot bread shortly after we sat down. I love the bread here, it's soft and delicious and comes hot to the table with delicious butter. While we looked at the menu, I ordered the famous Bloomin' Onion for an appetizer. For my dinner I chose the 6oz filet mignon with lobster, a Caesar salad and a loaded baked potato. He chose the 20oz porterhouse steak, a cup of the cheddar potato soup, and a loaded baked potato.  It wasn't long before the onion arrived, complete with their signature horseradish sauce. Philip even brought us an extra cup of sauce without me having to ask. The onion was cooked perfectly. The breading on the outside was crispy and full of spice, and the onion was soft and delicate on the inside. We ate the whole thing. Our soup and salad arrived next. The Caesar salad was well dressed with some of the best croutons I have ever eaten. Ironically there was a sign on the wall saying the croutons are made by hand everyday. You can taste the love in these croutons, they were soo good. By the time our entrees arrived, I was just about stuffed. Bread, onion, salad! That alone could have been a meal in itself. But I stuffed my face with steak and lobster and it was delicious. The filet was cooked perfectly medium as requested, and was soft like butter. I didn't even need steak sauce! The lobster was succulent and sweet and melted in my mouth. My only gripe is I wish there were more of it.   Philip checked on us often and was personable and friendly. I really enjoyed being served by him. It was $68 for both of our meals and it was worth every penny. I will be back and will request to be seated in Philip's section. G'day mate!"}
{"text":"I got a bone in Ribeye, my favorite cut. It was cooked perfectly. My server was Justin and he was excellent. It was really busy but I didn't feel rushed."}
{"text":"We decided to have lunch at this Outback location after a long morning of shopping, what a mistake!  There was hardly anyone in the dining area, maybe 10 tables in the whole restaurant.  We ordered three burgers, a grilled cheese, and a quesadilla.  It was 40 minutes before our food ever came out, absolutely ridiculous!  There is no reason that it should ever take that long to get food to the table.  Our waitress was hardly seen throughout the entire visit, except when she brought over a tray with salads for another table and picked up our dirty dishes and put them on the tray with the salads.  Gross!  The staff needs to be trained properly, and obviously there is some kitchen issues.  The manager came out and apologized and said she would discount our lunch.  We had three tickets and only one was discounted.  We didn't even bother mentioning it because we were so ready to get out of there!  We will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Not really a great experience..  Arrived at about 6pm and was told the wait would be 15-20 minutes.  Ended up being 40 minutes to get a seat.  Normally I wouldn't wait for a place like this, but we had gift cards to use.  We finally got seated in the bar area.. after which there was a bit of confusion on who our server was as 2 people stopped by.. and I think they told each other that they were going to be the one for our table because then nobody really came back and we had to flag one of them down to start drink orders.    Drinks took a few minutes.. and then we waited another 10-15 minutes for someone to come back to actually take the dinner order.. again we had to flag someone down.  Had to ask for bread at this point.. getting hungry(er).. Salads didn't take too long to get out, but it took another 20 minutes after those were long gone to get the main course out.    So the food... I got the ribs and chicken with fries.  The ribs were tough.. I had a real hard time even cutting thru them with a knife.  The chicken was dry and the fries were soggy and luke warm at best.  Plus the food just LOOKED like boring/bland when it got to the table.  Everyone else at the table got some sort of steak.. those seemed serviceable, but nothing spectacular.. but again.. bland looking.    So the problems with the service.. I think they were just understaffed and I can't blame the waitstaff that was there as it looked like they were doing their very best... I know that's a tough job, especially when understaffed.  The food.. was just not good.  In this 2+ hour experience, I would not recommend much... Although I was not drinking, the people I was with said the drinks were good.. strong.. So I guess that's a positive."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one the best restaurants that I've been to since moving to Vegas. I was diagnosed with extreme food allergies,  and every time I go here the staff remembers! I don't make a big deal, I explain about my allergies,  and since day one (1), they've been beyond great, the manager even had the kitchen staff scrub down the grill, so I wouldn't be exposed to anything,  and when I was told that, it brought tears to my eyes at the kindness that I was shown. My favorite server Susie is just wonderful,  she knows my order, and if I change it a little,  she doesn't get bothered, and she's just as sweet as can be. I highly recommend this place, because not only the food, but staff make the whole experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"Best service ever!   We got seated the moment we came in, and everyone we interacted with was very attentive. Our server was Cindy, and she was great (and honest, in a good way) about her recommendations.   Food was good too! This was our first time at an Outback Steakhouse and we were expecting somewhat mediocre food, but we were proved wrong. Food came out quickly and was cooked perfectly to the temperatures we wanted - meaning chefs actually know what they're doing back there :) portion sizes were good too, not too small but enough to finish in one sitting if you've got the right appetite.   Would definitely recommend - good food, great service (on a busy Saturday night too!)"}
{"text":"See my review for Red Lobster in Tucson, last updated today, to see the contrast between how Outback Steakhouse and Red Lobster handles complaints.. I'm still waiting for the Outback manager to get back to me."}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant, I have an appreciation for what they do here.  My steaks have always been cooked perfectly, the coconut shrimp is delicious (I prefer is sans the sauce since it covers up the crisp and sweet flavor of the coconut too much for me), the servings are plentiful, and for the most part every time I've been here the service has been from decent to great.  Outback is clean, friendly, ample parking, and consistent food which is what I expect at a chain restaurant.  The wait tends to be a bit longer on the weekends, especially for dinner, but they are good at getting things moving."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service, this location is the best! We went last night for my mom's birthday and SHAWN was our server. He is honestly one of the best servers I have ever had at a restaurant. Request him if possible, highly recommended! He was extremely friendly, efficient and helpful. Thank you Outback and Shawn for making our experience great!!"}
{"text":"Offered a table by the busy entrance/exit for the kitchen, ni. Next offered the lounge???? Hell to the no! I didn't come here for Aussie beer, but for lobster! Once again, we are NOT \"guys!\":When I asked about what type of vegetables,  the reply was mixed with broccoli,  snow peas, and squash. So why did my husband receive  all broccoli?  Again, we are not guys! And why did you ask about my coupons before you get the correct veggies? Yew!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and was not very crowded on a Saturday night. This outback location doesn't have the 6oz sirloins. The smallest steak you can get is 9 oz, so make sure you can eat all of it!  As expected this location had higher prices than regular Outback locations. We had a booth, however a couple of tables had views of the Strip."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Outback in several years. I would have given it three stars then. Today's visit has us thinking we will be back again pretty soon. Great drink selection that surprised us both for diversity and execution. We tried several appetizers including the crab stuffed mushrooms, coconut shrimp and a small blooming onion. They were all very tasty thanks to the unique sauces they were served with. Since I am a prime rib fanatic, I had to give that a try.  I ordered the 8 ounce portion with the all-you-can-eat shrimp side. Everything was served hot just like I like it. The vegetables were crisp & fresh. The garlic herb shrimp and fried shrimp tasted amazing, especially with the volcano sauce. My girl had the filet mignon and lobster for her entrée. The steak was the only downside of the meal... Although she ordered it medium well, which makes it hard to have a good flavor in my opinion. If you haven't been to Outback in a while, give it another shot. I hope you find it worth the trip as I did."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the wonderful service for our waiter, I would have given them 1 star. We used to go to this Outback regularly, but gave up after the lower quality food became the norm (just after the renovation of the decor). Sunday we unfortunately decided to see if perhaps they had improved and were shocked to discover that it had only gotten worse. I've gotten better cuts of meat on sale at the local grocer. Truly, they should be embarrassed to consider themselves a steak house, the food more closely resembled that of a public school cafeteria. I almost forgot to mention the sour smell that kept wafting passed our table. Very sad to see a once good, dependable quality restaurant turn into a dive. I don't know why the corporate executives so drastically changed the \"working\" model. \"If it aint broke...\" TIP: about 3 miles further West, on route 100 S is a Longhorn."}
{"text":"Worst Outback location ever!!!! We visited a little after 4:30 on a weekday.  The hostess did not seem particularly friendly and it would have been nice to be greeted properly.  The place was not busy at all.  I would estimate that they only had 5 tables occupied..at the most.    We were promptly seated, however, no one came to our table.  After almost 10 minutes, we decided to leave and go to Cheesecake Factory where we were properly greeted and served right away.  I will never visit this location again. If you want great, attentive service, then go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's one thing to have a good meal but it's another to see staff in action when there's a mistake made.  Very impressed with this location and manager. Thank you for taking care of me today."}
{"text":"Great place, superb service, the waiter was amazing and very attentive. The food came out very fast and well cooked. The place was very busy but that didn't seem a problem for them to handle it we were sat in a reasonable amount of time. The manager was so pleasant and even came by to check on everything, he was extremely nice and welcoming. We were very happy with this Outback! Don't forget to use your dining rewards and get extra coupons so worth the 50% off!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered parmesan herb chicken  a side salad with ranch dressing and no onions. I got salad and with french dressing and onions. We did not received any second bread or any refills for our drinks. The server's name was Lizabeth. So i ate dry chicken and nothing else since we received no bread and my side (the salad was with french). Stopped at the gas station and bought something to drink to swollen the dry chicken down. Not going there anymore!!!"}
{"text":"As I work in a restaurant and study hospitality at UNLV, I have never been one to complain on Yelp. However, I believe that this dining experience deserved to be shared.  We were there celebrating my mother's promotion at work. Everything was good, the server was friendly. However, my mom's steak came out rare rather than medium. No biggie. We send it back, they say that it will be fixed. About five minutes later, the same half-eaten, cut up steak comes back. They had recooked her eaten steak. When we made it clear that this was unacceptable, we were told by both the server and the owner of the restaurant that it was their restaurant's standard to recook steaks that had already been served on the SAME grill that their other customer's steaks are being cooked on.  This is where I became concerned. Being ServSafe Certified and a SNHD Food Safety Manager, I told the owner \"You might want to speak with your managers about that practice. It's against health code to take someone's eaten food back, cook it next to other customer's food, and then reserve it.\" This is a cross-contamination DISASTER. After I told the owner that, he replied \"Oh, it's completely compliant with health code.\"  So here, for you, is the SNHD section of health code that prohibits this process.  \"3-306.14 Returned FOOD and RE-SERVICE of FOOD  After being served or sold, and in the possession of a CONSUMER, FOOD that is unused or returned by the CONSUMER may not be offered as FOOD for human consumption, except a container of FOOD that is NON-POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS may be transferred from one CONSUMER to another if:  (A) The FOOD is dispensed so that it is protected from CONTAMINATION, and the container including but not limited to a narrow-neck bottle containing ketchup, steak sauce, or wine is closed between uses.  (B) The FOOD including but not limited to crackers, salt, or pepper, is in an unopened original package and is maintained in sound condition.\"  Also, we were given the full bill at the end - re-served steak and all. The owner saw that and quickly said \"let me go take that steak off for you.\" We just left cash to get the hell out of dodge. It is not that the employees or managers were malevolent - they are just uneducated when it comes to health code. That can be a dangerous combination in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch at this Outback Steakhouse. The wait was a little long considering it wasn't 4:00 yet and the restaurant was empty. The server was nice enough. The steak was very nicely cooked - I ordered medium and it was perfect. I found the seasoning on the steak to be a little bland. The house salad was small and overloaded with dressing. The bread was delicious: warm and fresh. The biggest disappointment was the garlic mashed potatoes, they were very dry and over cooked. When I mentioned it to the waiter, he suggested that I add the leftover butter from the bread to the mashed potatoes. To my mind, over cooked and dry potatoes can not be improved by adding butter. Overall the visit was disappointing!"}
{"text":"Listen up crocodile Dundee I know funny so next time I ask your waiter for a \"Jeff Goldblumin' Onion\" and yell \"YOUR CHEFS WERE SO PREOCCUPIED WITH WHETHER THEY COULD THAT THEY DIDNT STOP TO THINK THAT THEY SHOULD\" maybe slide Daddy a free hors d'ouevre or whatever, geez.  Tell Alan at the bar i appreciated him turning up the TV volume when \"The Nanny\" was on before I was asked to leave."}
{"text":"The restaurant could have easily been 4 or 5 stars... however, the AC was broken.  It was hot!!! The waiters did all they could to ensure our experience was as good as it could be. The food was fast, establishment(restrooms) were clean... but nothing could distract us from dealing with the heat. Hopefully, they have this fixed soon. On the plus side, of you sir widow side of the mirage, you can't catch the volcano show!"}
{"text":"Visited today 5/9/18. For thier $9.99 steak  special. Suppose to be 5oz piece of meat. I should of taken a picture of it and posted it. I've seen White Castle burgers bigger than this piece of meat. If you weigh more than 100lbs this will not satisfy you! Skip this special!                                                    Sincerely ED"}
{"text":"Favorite casual dining restaurant, period. Food quality is always excellent and if a problem does arise the manager is always walking around gathering feedback from customers on their dining experience.   The main go to dish is the bone in ribeye with a iceberg salad after the cheese fries appetizer. Does not get much better than this for a chain restaurant.    The menu selection has increased a lot over the years, but I prefer to stay with the classics."}
{"text":"Outback is still the gold standard for chain restaurants.  Been awhile since visiting this location.  The newer decor was very warm and inviting.  Not much for the combo add-ons, just like to 9oz fillet with a standard baked potato.  My son enjoyed the half rack of ribs and our waitress was wonderful. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"We arrived at 4:15 and were seated after a few minutes of disorganization at the hostess stand. Taken to a table inches away from 4 empty booths. Inches. I asked if we could have a booth. \"Wait a second\". Comes back and asks if we mind waiting awhile for a booth. I asked why. Because we don't have a server there yet. Inches. 4 minutes later the booths are 100% full. One of them served by our SAME server!!  4 minutes. My husband ordered a double cheeseburger. Medium \"we can only make those well done\". ??  Found out why. I ordered a regular cheeseburger. It came without cheese. But it a single was thicker than the little flattened well done prices of jerky put together that he got. After about 6 minutes, the server asked how we were. I pointed out the lack of cheese on my so-named entree. She brought me a slice warmed from the grill (actually a nice touch but weird).  All in all a disappointing visit. Yes maybe our expectations of burgers from a steak restaurant were high, but it's about more than the meal. Hit or miss at this location. The head hostess I'll call her, probably front of house manager, comes across * itchy and bothered every time we've come here."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to this Outback for several years due to a lackluster past visit. The decor is newer and very attractive featuring contemporary wood and lighting. The service was better this visit but still not on par with the prices.  We both tried the Victoria Cut Filet (not mignon) and ordered the 6oz wood grilled to medium. When the waitress brought them out, we did one of those \"are you thinking what I'm thinking\" Vulcan mind melds as we internally measured the vastly different thicknesses & cuts presented on our plates. Mine was approximately 3/4\" thick and well done and the other was over an inch thick and medium rare. Very visually inconsistent.  We also ordered some grilled shrimp (from the barbie, mate) that were very, very dry - longing for a splash of citrus or other moisture. The ala carte shrooms were quite delish in a beef burgundy type broth with nicely rendered onions although it really reminded us both of french onion soup! It took us a while to figure that one out.   The price was fairly reasonable at $64 including two drinks. This is an \"occasional\" option on the revolving steak craving circuit but certainly not at the top."}
{"text":"If you like long waits and poor service this is the spot.  Overcrowded and the staff is over matched."}
{"text":"We came here for the valentines four course meal and this location didn't offer it, sad!! So, then we ordered the bloomin pedals for an appetizer. What came out was some pedals and a pile of crumbs. When our server came by I brought it to her attention and she totally agreed. They brought us out a whole bloomin onion and comped the appetizer. That was so nice of them. We also ordered the sirloin, well done and the sirloin did come out well done. We also ordered the macaroni and cheese and potatoes and were really happy with the sides. With the mishap of the appetizer, we still had a pleasant experience and enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my folks. Great lunch menu and prices. The endless soup and salad is delicious. The waiter, Adam, was very friendly and has an infectious unique laugh. Make him laugh and you'll find out! Also, bathrooms were very clean, other staff members were friendly, and prompt with bringing out food/drinks."}
{"text":"Two years ago I gave this location four stars.  Didn't rate my visit last year thinking it was an \"off\" night.  After yesterday's lunch, I'm certain I won't be back.  There simply isn't any reason - it's just \"so-so\" and completely unremarkable."}
{"text":"We haven't been to an OutBack in a very long time but decided to have a date night with the husband last night and it's close to our house and used to be very good. We were very dissapointed with the new sizes of the menu items. We ordered a blooming onion to start and the full rack of ribs to split. The onion had the same wonderful flavor but was undercooked and overcooked at the same time. It was very small as well. Nearly half the size we remember for the same price of not more. The ribs came and we were again very dissapointed with its size. In fact I had to ask our inattentive server if this was in fact the full rack we had ordered. It came with a side of fries which were nice and hot but a little undercooked as well. And instead of a bottle of ketchup for the table we were given a very small side to both share. Once again I had to ask our server, who was very interested in other tables and not ours, for an extra side. We ordered the trio of desserts to go and had to wait an extra 20 min for the dessert and the bill to arrive. The desserts were average at best but still tasty. We walked out with a $40 bill and probably won't be back. So sad to see the decline in portion sizes and attentiveness of the servers there."}
{"text":"I've been to so many Outback Steakhouse location, by far this location is the best! They have excellent customer service and food is always hot and fresh. I would recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Ordered medium ribeye steak, got rare and really bloody.    I like the quality from Outback better a few years back."}
{"text":"Of all the chain restaurants, (Applebys,Longhorn,Rubys,TGIF) Outback probably has the best steaks. Mom had the ribeye with coconut shrimp, both were cooked perfectly. My wife had the ahi tuna salad( lunch size) which was more than enough for her to eat. I had the $7.99 lunch combo special that included a good size bowl of the onion soup and the chicken tacos. The soup was tasty, good spiceing and loaded with cheese and the two tacos were loaded with chicken. The only complaint would be that they don't have any type of sauce to put on the tacos. Se kind of salsa would have been perfect."}
{"text":"Surprised to see Onion Petals on the menu. Just like the Bloomin Onion but half the portion for half the price - perfect for someone like me eating alone on a business trip. Unfortunately the petals were burnt. Kept it simple and had a salad as well and that was very good. Nice friendly service. Located at the Hampton Inn."}
{"text":"I placed an order online for curb side pick up service.  When I got home we found some items missing...  For a company that has a pretty detailed online ordering system, this was such a let down.  To top it off, this wasn't the first time I have run into missing items or the wrong order.  I'm a firm believer of giving a second chance, but come on guys... Let's at least try to match the good service you receive inside the restaurant.  Not a good experience mate!"}
{"text":"Okay let's talk about good and friendly service. My steak was not cooked well so I didn't say anything until the waiter mentioned that my steak was undercooked. The manager came apologized and brought me a new plate of natural rib eye and a new baked potato."}
{"text":"Had an excellent waitress. Wish I could remember her name! Unlimited shrimp is delicious. 5 Stars for customer service, food quality, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Ok ok ok, we come here a lot! The biggest problem I have is the rules are always changing. If it's a holiday you cannot do call ahead sitting. Been told this several times in the past. Tonight I arrive for Mother's Day and the first thing they ask me is if I called ahead. UGH! So hour and a half wait it is. The hostess was terrific! So pleasant, helpful and informative during our wait. Fast forward through dinner. I really disliked my usual meal of coconut shrimp. Turns out the wonderful hostess was the manager. She took my meal off the bill and couldn't apologize enough. Everyone else had a great time, enjoyed their meals and seemed happy. Carnations at the door. Well done Outback well done."}
{"text":"Very busy on Saturday night. Come early to get a table or end up waiting. Service is very courteous and hospitable, but slow. Seemed to take a long time to get our bloomin' onion.  Which sat under the heat lamp too long, not very crispy and extra dark brown....almost too cooked. Then, dinner came about 15 minutes later. We both had the same dinner, same accompaniments, everything the same. When it came, the steaks were under cooked and lobster over cooked. But, the baked potato was great!"}
{"text":"Had this server named Jack or Jake or could have been Jerk as far as i know. The guy comes over to take our order and is looking at everywhere and everyone but us as we tell him our order. The he says that he is going to \"Make it happen\"! How freakin lame. After we finish our meal he proceeds to slap empty plates together not paying attention to all the juices that are splattering everywhere. No class and no training on how to treat customers. The place looked like an upscale Ryans. Feeding time at the farm!."}
{"text":"My husband decided to treat me to dinner.  I have never gotten such a poor slice of prime rib before.  More than half was unable to be eaten.  His steak was under cooked and the bourbon bacon sauce tasted off. Missing  sides.  I guess if you get to go they don't care.  After all you can't complain.  Never again will I go here."}
{"text":"We're currently here.  The service has been horrible the last few times we've eaten dinner at this location.  So far there has been a long wait for a waiter/waitress to come around for drink orders.  After receiving our appetizer 10 minutes ago, we're still waiting for silverware to be able to eat it.  We've been told that they are currently rolling the silverware in napkins and we will have silverware soon.  Still waiting!  The food is great but the service at this location couldn't be worse."}
{"text":"Came here with my mother for a bite, Alexis, our waitress from Denver was phenomenal! The service she provided was second to none and made sure I never had an empty glass of lemonade :) when we got our food, my 8oz steak looked more like a 6oz steak, so I said my steak looked a bit smaller than 8oz, Terrance then brought out a second steak which was 6oz and the steaks were identical, so he just have me the 2nd 6oz steak at no extra charge. The food was cooked to perfection and I don't know of a time when I've had better service than tonight. Thank you Outback steakhouse for hiring such amazing staff like Alexis and Terrance. I love coming here and will continue to be a loyal Outback steakhouse customer at this location."}
{"text":"Great service for a large group! Manager called in extra help for our large group and had fast service!"}
{"text":"Wonderful family night out! The bacon bourbon salmon was very delicious and I'm not a salmon lover. Great service,  our waitress was very attentive. The food was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Had dinner with our cousins at the OutBack Restaurant in Robinson. The food and service were excellent.  The Manager even stopped by our table to say hello !  Thankyou for enjoyable time !  Will definitely make a return visit in the future !"}
{"text":"Bloomin onions can't go wrong grilled steaks always amazing grilled Redwood asparagus and cold beer that's a good night."}
{"text":"We came here on 7/29 around 6:30. This was my worst visit to any outback steakhouse. I'm giving it 1 star due to the quality of food.   We started out with the aussie frys, can't really go wrong with cheese frys... unless you leave them in the window too long and the cheese gets hard. Like ours did.  I ordered the 3 course meal. I ordered it with cheese potato soup, steak special and 1 side (broccoli), and carrot cake. The soup tasted like a canned soup with added bacon bits. The big problem was the main corse. It was a piece of meat, very tough, raw and cold in the center (I ordered medium rare), and flavorless. I had to salt it myself. The carrot cake was very dense and too sweet for my taste.  My fiancé ordered the filet and lobster meal, with mashed potato, and house salad. The salad was about the only thing that was good tonight. Her filet, to my surprise was the SAME piece of meat as I got with my steak special, like really? How is it that we pay over 26$ for the same piece of meat that came in the terrible special. The potatoes were very dry.  The service was actually very good, our waitress corrie tried her best to keep up happy. I will NOT be coming back here, the food here was very bad, not prepaired well."}
{"text":"Placed an order online.   Arrived when it told me to be there.  When I arrived they let us know they were just now \"putting it in\".  Had to wait 20 minutes.  No compensation was offered whatsoever for this inconvenience.   When I arrived home I realized they charged me 3 times.  I called and the manager was rude and denied any such thing.   I called my bank and they said there was 2 charge reversals from Outback.   I figured out it was from me trying to place the order with diff zip codes two times prior.  I was denied, but why is it holding my money \"processing\".  The ribeye melt was dry.  However, the kids loved their food.  Due to the inconvenience, bad service and sub-par quality I  won't be going back."}
{"text":"Has fallen off drastically over the past 1 and half or so...  Given them countless chances and its just not worth going anymore.  Longhorn it is"}
{"text":"No, I'm not one of those people who slathers their steak in A1 or orders it anything but medium rare...yet I'm writing a rave review on the steak at Outback. Why this contradiction, you ask? Well, for $12 I get a tender 6oz sirloin (quite possibly my favorite cut of steak), a loaded baked potato, and a side salad to pretend to myself that I want to have something healthy accompany my steak. Everyone's always trivializing the quality of steak these type of restaurants serve, but I see barely any difference if cooked correctly compared to a $50 steak.   Everything is always cooked just right, and the service is exceptional every time, especially from Jenny at the bar.   Save your fancy steak houses for special occassions and treat yourself to a good meal at Outback more often. ;)"}
{"text":"Wondering how they can get steak so perfect! Excellent salmon and a perfect baked potato. Even their sweet iced tea was great according to my husband. Excellent service. Only the fries were droopy."}
{"text":"I typically tend to stay away from chain restaurants as often as possible.  I do have to say though, that I have been to several Outback restaurants thoughout the years and honestly I will say, I have never had a bad meal at any of them.  The quality of the steaks are pretty good, and it was cooked to a proper rare, so I can't complain about that.  It has a pretty extensive menu, if steak is not your thing, and I would have no problem going back to an Outback Steakhouse in the future."}
{"text":"I love Outback Steakhouse!!!! The staff here is ALWAYS very kind and work hard. I have been coming here since they have been here, so for quite a while, and I truthfully have never had s bad experience. The food is awesome and very reasonably priced. Some Monday's, they even have \"blooming Monday\" where you can get s FREE blooming onion appetizer (make sure to call ahead and ask though). Steaks are very flavorful, mashed potatoes are out of this world, and I highly recommend the grilled shrimp caeser salad as well. HOMEMADE CROUTONS- you can't beat em!!   Great food, great prices, and very friendly staff!! An all time favorite!"}
{"text":"I really like this Outback location.  I've been to this particular location twice now and I love everything from the steaks to the service.  Here's why/how this particular Outback is better than your typical chain restaurant...  Food - The food is still awesome.  I don't know that I've ever had anything that I didn't particularly like at an Outback.  Had the Bloomin' Onion and its cousin the  Bloom Petals.  I know, I know, that thing is one of the most unhealthiest items you can get at a chain restaurant, but I'll be damned if you're gonna tell me it ain't better than awesome!  The \"Bloom Sauce\" it's served with or ranch provide the perfect compliment.  I've also had the \"Alice Springs Chicken Quesadilla\" - also better than you might expect.  Its comes served with honey mustard, but once again, you can never go wrong by asking for ranch right?  As far as the steaks are concerned, my go to is the Center Cut sirloin with loaded mash potatoes and asparagus as my sides.  All the sides are awesome really.  The only side I didn't particular care for, is the mac-n-cheese - just not like what grandma makes.  Service - The service has been nothing short of spectacular.  I've been there when they were super busy right before the holidays, I've been there for lunch on a random weekday, and the service was exceptional both times.    Ambiance - I really like the open layout of this Outback.  You can see clearly from one corner to the other without any interference.  Although I've never experienced it, they also look to have a nice outdoor patio area as well.  But what I really like is the nice big bar area and the three huge flat screens facing you.  The bar layout is simply perfect to me.  Yes, parking can be worse than horrible, especially during the weekends and holidays, but that's the case with Concord Mills as a whole.  Be prepared to spend extra time getting in and out of here.  Otherwise, there's nothing not to like about this Concord Mills Outback Steakhouse location!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The prime rib here is fantastic. It almost melts in your mouth, although 12 oz. is a little bit too much for my craving. Foster on tap is pretty good. If you haven't had any Aussie beer, you should try it. Complimentary bread here is on a comparable scale with Cheesecake Factory. The waiter is also very nice."}
{"text":"Foods perfect waitress was outstanding cant say Ive ever had a bad visit to Outback Steak House"}
{"text":"i ordered a prime rib sandwich and almost chocked to death. the entire thing was a pile of fat. ill post pics. unbelievable. michael brady the manager of the place should be terminated, as he is obviously not doing his job. the lady manager on the floor handled things right but not mike..."}
{"text":"Slow service, cold food, and no manager to be found....  Not a good experience.  This place is usually ALOT better!"}
{"text":"Wow. Madison... Caitlyn... These two made our dinner way better with their kindness & service first attitude.   The food was typical of an Outback & of course we had to order that blooming onion. We enjoyed everything!   Margarita pitcher was very tasty & highly recommended. It is a very nice value;~D))"}
{"text":"Idk why I always had a sour spot in my heart for Outback.  My parents started coming here a lot, mostly during lunch and would rave about how good it was and I joined them a few times and would have to agree.  The place is nice looking inside and the food is pretty well priced and tasty and they have their calories listed which is awesome.  To be fair, I've never gotten a steak or lobster or anything \"fancy\" here because I don't see it as that kind of restaurant.  I see it as a place where I can get a good sandwich or burger or some tacos and enjoy a nice lunch out.  I could even see myself coming and sitting at the bar and having a few drinks because it looks so inviting, as sad as that sounds.  This place has taught me to not knock it until I have tried it."}
{"text":"They have a new item on the appetizer list called crab cakes. If you order them make sure they aren't cold but hot entering your palate! I've had them and not heated to satisfaction! Sent back & not getting them again unless they come properly cooked!"}
{"text":"Went Outback today, 6-5-16. Bad experience. Started with blooming onion. It came out burnt...and tons of oil on it. Sent it back. Mashed Potatoes were cold. Ordered Broccoli & Cheese.   Got two small stalks of Broccoli that were very stringy. Couldn't swallow it and had to spit it out. Food was expensive and only mediocre in quality. We will not return to the Outback Steakhouse again. Too many other food places of higher quality in Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviews of outback, back in the day was such a fan of this place, never a big fan of there steaks but everything else was good and the prices were so so. Now is totally different, alice springs chicken is almost 20.00 wtf have u seen the size of the chicken and the potato latley you can fit them both in you hand. I just done see playing close to 50.00 and still leaving hungrey, sorry guys you lost your way somewhere"}
{"text":"Although our food has been uniformly good, our waitresses have been relentless about clearing our table.  One asked if we were done with the appetizer when it was only half nibbled on, and when one person at the table indicated that she was done, the waitress grabbed the platter and was gone.    Similarly, we were asked various versions of the following question each time we've visited:  \"Are you done with this, or do you want a doggie bag?\"  For the slow learners out there, there wasn't an option for responding that you are still eating it, and when asked of a child it results in removal of the (partially eaten) entree from the table.  This within 10 or 15 minutes of getting our food, regardless of the celebration or whether a good conversation was underway.  So my take on this location, having visited it 3 times, is that their priority is to serve you, give you a moment to eat it, and then start pushing you out the door - even when not that busy.  If that's your thing, this is your place.  On the other hand, if you enjoy taking a moment to enjoy your meal, then consider going elsewhere..."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. From the minute we walked in, no one really acknowledged us. Our drinks took forever to get to the table and all the food was less than acceptable. No one checked on us and when we asked for the manager even she didn't really do anything to make the situation better! Half assed apology and no sincerity. The waiter had the nerve to return to our table and (mind you they still made us pay for our drinks) make a smart ass remark. Horrible place, NO WE WILL NOT RETURN. Horrible service. Horrible. Deserves zero stars but I'm forced to leave one."}
{"text":"I have tried so incredibly hard to give this Outback location a chance. My husband and I really like this restaurant chain and this is the closest location to our house, so we've been here dozens upon dozens of times.  But every single visit without fail, there's a problem. I even went so far as to email the General Manager a few visits ago, who graciously sent me a $40 gift card so we could try again. Unfortunately, yet again it was a big flop. The steak is always so rare that it has to be sent back- cold, red, bloody and rubbery. It's literally inedible, and I really don't mind having a steak on the \"rare\" side. I hate being \"THAT\" person who sends everything back, but when I order my steak medium, I expect it to be pink throughout with some red, not freezing cold and straight from the cow. You'd think that when the server comes to take your plates and the food goes uneaten, they would realize something needs to be fixed, but they don't seem to care. The service is seriously lacking. The wait staff is doing something wrong when every single time we visit, we have to track down someone to take our orders 20-30 minutes after being seated. Our food comes before salads, and by the end of our meal we've had no drink refills and have to remind the server for the 10th time that we never got any bread. We have been to numerous other Outback locations across the Valley and have never experienced this level of incompetence and basic lack of service industry knowledge. We will continue to visit the Chandler and San Tan locations, but my patience for this particular Outback is absolutely gone."}
{"text":"When we arrived, it was around 2ish and quite busy.  However, it took us 25 min for us to even get our drinks.  We only got one refill on our beverages the entire time we were there.  My prime rib was completely dehydrated and cold.  Most of our food was lukewarm at best.  The excuse given was that they were busy.  I am sorry, I have worked in the restaurant business and the whole goal is to have a busy restaurant.  If every time you are busy, you can't handle it, then someone is in the wrong profession."}
{"text":"Half stars   I really wanted to give this five stars  And gosh dang if Sean didn't do all he could  To try and push into the fifth But unfortunately we may need to spell him  With an H from here on Poor guy just could quite mix a martini   But whom ever was on the grill Deserves a raise an one of those  Employee of the month photos  Cause they took an 18oz sirloin  And made'rrr my beach  That's right I said it Snot easy to cook a piece of meat that size  But they grilled'rrr to perfection  Just pink in the middle    Ps: no idea how you can cook a perfect steak but send out cold shrimp with the Caesar, or have a dressing that bland...but any bidness that can cook a big boy steak that well deserves at least four of the five"}
{"text":"get back in there   I have always been  A fan of casual  Family dining   Stopped in for a steak Instead, ordered a grilled caesar (big fan of the single serving bread loaf)  Now I'm not a drinker  But the bartender  Did show me the new love potion menu  And it seems the Outback  Has been up to some very good ideas  Key the Lime   Was good eats however, and this is a strange one  Overly engaging service *   *let me qualify that..i was enjoying a drink with a fellow patron but instead of just serving the drinks and allowing us to get busy talking..the bartender tried to takeover the conversation..no good, he probably could have gotten another order out of me, had he simply let us do us    ps-i will definitely be back for two"}
{"text":"Our waitress although I forget her name was really sweet and our door was hot and fast! Usually a small to no wait, except for those busy nights! Steak is obviously outstanding and my persona favorite is of course, their bread! so delish! Pumpernickel with the whipped butter is truly mouth watering! Prices are relatively cheap and for desert their milkshakes are really good!! Only $2.99 as well so that's a bonus!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restraunts in the area. Laura is a fantastic server and Jennifer was also very nice. Will definitely return for the service and the food."}
{"text":"Went to the new location after the hour wait which was done online.  The service was mediocre and the food was subpar.. We won't be back anytime soon.   WIsh they would have kept the old one open up on Sunset. I know it's the same owner and staff but I think they're overwhelmed at this new location.  Staff seems overworked and the food is not what it should be.  Also seems like they've shrunk the portions on everything. This will survive based on the location but it is fitting right in with the other chains that closed in this center prior. Not sure why these chains can't figure out you still have to try and provide a good experience regardless of the name out front."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is so so. Prime rib was out by the time we got to the restaurant. Our server seemed over worked."}
{"text":"Ask for bread as soon as you are seated! This wasn't my best experience at Outback Steakhouse. We got right in and seated. There was no wait on a Thursday at 5:45pm.  First thing I noticed was that they changed their drink menu and no longer have South Wales Sangria. This was my favorite, so I was hugely disappointed. The server took our order and I ordered a rosé and the 4 course meal. This included soup, salad, entree and dessert.  We never got bread, which disappointed the kids. Bread normally holds them over until they get their food.  The server came by after we ate our entree and told us to pay on the ziosk. I told him I was paying cash, but he never came by with a paper bill. After about 5 or 10 minutes of just sitting there, I had to stop the server and ask for our cheesecakes. He said he had forgotten. And brought them to us in a to go box. At that time I still had not gotten a bill, so based on the ziosk, I just left the cash on the table."}
{"text":"This is really sad. Outback is one of our favorite restaurants and we have been going for the cheese fries for over 20 years. Our waiter Corey took our drink orders, food order, then was non existent. Our cheese fries came, we had asked for them layered so we could get extra cheese and bacon, and there was maybe a small hand full of cheese on both orders. My daughter and I just ate ours because we were hungry. It was a MAJOR disappointment. Once our imaginary waiter, as my daughter said, finally showed back up my husband asked if he could get his cheese fries re done bc we had requested extra cheese and bacon. The waiter literally too his plate and put cheese on the already cold fries and melted the cheese over them. I mean, I ran a restaurant for 8 years....fries are cheap people! Then the waiter did not check on us to make sure everything was good so we just paid on the Ziosk and left. Like I said....all around MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!"}
{"text":"Chris our waiter was awesome...he was super attentive. The food was delicious as well. We got steak and Mac and cheese. Everything was great."}
{"text":"I ordered a ribeye 12 is steak, didn't have the kris cross marks. It seemed like it was cooked it a flat pan vs grilled. Didn't like it would only come back if it's a must have for steak. Will wait for other steakhouse to open"}
{"text":"My fiance had a gift card to Outback, so we decided to use it for a date night! I don't usually gravitate towards chains, but we gave this a shot! It just so happened that we went on \"No Worries Wednesday\" AND arrived before 7 PM, just in time for Happy Hour! On No Worries Wednesdays, they have a variety of 3-course menu items for $12.99, $16.99, and $19.99. I ordered the house salad (I LOVE their ranch!), a 6oz Outback Sirloin w/ a loaded baked potato and a mason jar of strawberry shortcake for dessert! ALL of this food was only $12.99!! The steak was super juicy, tender, and spiced to perfection. My fiance got their firecracker salmon and all of the same sides that I got, for $16.99. It was topped with mango salsa that he said was delicious!   On top of the great food, I HAVE to comment on our service. Katie was one of the best servers that I have had in months. She described everything perfectly, was super passionate about her job, and even brought us extra ranch just because we said that we loved their ranch (we didn't even ask for it!). She timed our food perfectly and made the experience a great one. In addition, the manager stopped by our table to ensure that everything was going well. It was such a nice touch! I overheard other servers and they seemed just as great! Major props to the managing team here for training their employees to be world class!   All in all, I would definitely come back. It was a super easy date night and the food was delicious, with an unbeatable price. The restaurant was also packed on a Wednesday night so you know that they are doing something right! Thank you Outback!!"}
{"text":"It's decent food and not too expensive, but service here is not great, and have been really slow last couple times."}
{"text":"Ohana family dinner night. My brother guys was like mixed it up so came here to Outback Steakhouse. I have never been to this location before but think of Outback as decent steak chain restaurant at affordable price. On this night decided wanted to mix it up also instead of going for steak had the Grill Mahi with vegetables.I had my doubts cause really go steakhouse eat steak. I was pleasantly surprise with the whole dish. The Mahi was grilled perfect nice char grill marks, cooked through, moist, and even without sauce had great taste. The vegetables was all cooked nice al dente from the zucchini, carrots, and broccoli.   We ordered couple appetizers to share the calamari and the spinach artichoke dish. The calamari dish would say was ok. I felt like the calamari was little too crispy or overdone. The spinach artichoke dip would say was fabulous. The chips was nice light, crispy, and add nice scoop of spinach dip was delicious. The bread that comes with the meal. One thing always look forward to whenever come to Outback. Love it!!! I also ordered side caesar salad. I felt was ok nothing really special about it and felt like the salad could have used more dressing. But then again I like my salad with nice amount.  The service was great! She was very attentive the whole night on our drinks, friendly, and could not ask for better service.   The decor thought was pretty modern for long standing chain restaurant. Or maybe they just changed the whole philosophy or what not. All  I remember the last time been to a Outback been that long years. It had this cheesy over the top Australia look but from the moment you walk in very modern. I like the look more then the old look makes U feel like eating not so much at whole wide chain type of restaurant. Current style nice steak house."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife and another couple for my buddies birthday.  The service was good and the steak was cooked perfectly.  Overall not a bad meal but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"$9.99 Outback special!!! 6oz steak, mash potatoe, bread and salad....great stuff...."}
{"text":"First time at Outback and it was pretty good. We went at 930 pm on a Saturday night and was seated quick. Actually very fast for a party of six. Server was very friendly and fast. We ordered two steak dinners, grilled chicken sandwich and four kids meals. Food was good. The kids portions were pretty big. Every one left full and happy. Will definitely come and visit again. Plus they give a 10% military discount... Thank you Outback!"}
{"text":"I hate to give a 2 star review but this place was not the best. I have went there several times with friends of mine and the service nearly every time we went was poor. It really made me upset to wait forever for our food when the place is not too busy, very slow to get food. I usually get pasta with shrimp and scallops and I enjoy it but the portion of pasta is too small also so I usually have to purchase a side of it. Small portion size and our food always taking 45 minutes to get to us is not acceptable so I will spend my money elsewhere. Outback is overrated IMO, go to The Keg which is just a little bit more money but not much, food is much better along with the restaurant which is modern looking. If you go on a date The Keg would be the place to take her, classier and romantic."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Crab-stuffed Shrimp appetizer was good. Bread to munch on while you wait for your food to come was good. 10oz. Fosters on tap was good. 10oz. Grilled Ribeye with sweet potato and veggies was good. My GF's Shrimp Caesar Salad was reportedly good.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Service! Service! Service! Businesses please realize how much we as patrons enjoy and appreciate great service! Our waitress, Christy/Chrissy was absolutely amazing! First of all we were in Vegas and could have gone ANYWHERE for dinner but after walking the strip for hours, we descended upon Outback and I am so happy that we did! This lady was on it!! Omg! GIVE HER A RAISE! Or simply tell her thank you! The food was great! Service=MAGNIFICENT! Ps. To top it off the restroom (ladies) was clean and smelled fresh! Win! Win!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite steakhouse. And Bob Taylor Ranch House. I went here for early Presidents' Day dinner. We sat in a corner. We got bread. I got Dr Pepper and water. I went with everyone. I went with Amy, Larry, Mike, Larisa, and the kids. I got the steak and loaded baked potato. I was the best steak in town!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed coming here. Service is always quick and waiters are always so welcoming.   I ordered their Tilapia with mushroom and lumps of crab meat topping, my choice of side was mashed potatoes. I Washed my meal down with there Watermelon Rita.   Hubby ordered their Blooming Onion Burger with side of mac n cheese for extra $2.00 charge.   I love this location and can tell you that you won't regret dining here."}
{"text":"Always good service and great food. We always sit in the bar so we never wait for a table. We have been here a few times and we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great food, good service.   My husband and I went to this Outback Steakhouse on Ridge Road in Parma for Valentines Day. We arrived at 4pm. The parking lot was full, however we were seated right away, no wait!  The atmosphere is nice: comfy booths and several big-screen TVs all around. We were there at 4pm so the TVs mostly had ESPN, ESPNnews, etc  Our server was Mike and he was pretty good. Drinks and our appetizer came promptly, however it took a little long for our bread and entrees to arrive.    We shared the grilled shrimp appetizer. Two skewers, each with 4 grilled medium shrimp. They are seasoned nicely. The dish comes with a toasted bread that's similar to Texas toast. It was a nice appetizer and cost around $10  The complimentary bread is a small, fresh, hot loaf and comes with a small cup of whipped butter. It's served on a carving board and it's a good way to start the meal.   We each ordered the steak + lobster tail that we've seen advertised on TV lately. We ordered the largest size of each (sirloin + filet mignon)  The lobster tail was small, but tasty. Our sides (mixed vegetables) were quite nice, too.   Our dinner for 2 came to a total of $80, which included 2 entrees, 1 appetizer and 2 drinks. A little pricey, but it was Valentines Day.   I would come here again but only for special occasions (or if I win the lotto)  Thanks for a nice Valentines Day, Outback!"}
{"text":"Waitress great. Ordered medium, got well. That was a bummer . Shrimp was just OK. Not a great outback experience. Steak needed steak sauce. But so would a shoe."}
{"text":"The chef at this Outback never lets us down. They know how to cook a medium steak here!  It is perfect every time!  It melts in your mouth.  Just don't count on getting a second loaf of bread anytime soon."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and unfortunately I don't have great things to say about this place.   I ordered the Barrier Trio which came with coconut shrimp, ahi tuna steak, and a crab avocado stack. I can't really say much about the taste of these items because there was a hair in my food so I had them bring me something else. I understand that these kinds of things happen so the two star review isn't because of the hair in the food but is because of what happened afterwards or what didn't happen afterwards. I ordered the fish tacos and a French Onion soup in place of my last meal.  The fish tacos were dry. And the French onion soup came with a slice of provolone baked on top. Neither were appetizing but it could be because the hair incident earlier turned me off from eating in altogether.   The Blooming Onion tasted a bit bland and the sauce it came with tasted like watered down ranch.   The only saving grace about this place is that the people were extremely nice. Our waiter went above and beyond to accommodate. Two managers came and apologized for the incident, but get this, nothing was comped, not even the soup or the appetizer.   I'm not looking for a handout, but usually in cases like these, when extra has been spent, the management team steps up and will comp an appetizer or present a coupon for next time. That didn't happen here."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner on 5/23/18. Got seated took 10 minutes for someone to come and take a drink order, another 20 minutes for drinks to arrive. Forgot to bring the kid drinks only brought drinks for adults. Kept bringing water out when we ordered sprite. Came back 30 minutes later to take food order. All food came out cold. Worst experience ever...they weren't even that busy. No one came to apologize for anything. Won't be going back EVER. I had to give it at least one star to post but they deserve none."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years. I always remember the bread though. Omg. So good. We had a few.  Service was pretty good. We arrived and there was a confusion about if someone called in and left thier name and considering there was a 45 min wait, we didnt want to wait. The hostess was very nice. She was accommodating and had us seated fairly quickly. Our server was pleasant and friendly.  As for the food. It was adequate. Nothing over the top special but it wasn't disappointing.   I'd go back for the bread"}
{"text":"Typically we stay away from chains, but we had a giftcard left over from something, so we decided to use it. The appetizer choice came down to the Bloomin' Onion and cheese fries. Go with the cheese fries (I assume, because the former was not that great). I got a hamburger and my wife got a steak. The meal was inexpensive, which I appreciate, but just ok. My wife said nothing about her steak, which I take to mean, it wasn't anything to brag about. The highlight was the service. I think his name was Adam. He knocked it out of the park."}
{"text":"We ate here Monday and we're very surprised,service and food were excellent . We had a minor issue with the bone in ribeye and this was quickly corrected and the kitchen manager came out to see if it was perfect this time and it was. We will definitely return. Nice job everyone."}
{"text":"Great service with good food. Not overpriced like anything on the strip.  Can't go wrong with outback."}
{"text":"We give our highest recommendations for Jim, owner and Shelley, Hostess/BAR regarding their Professionalism and Great customer care services. The Outback Restaurant @ Paradise valley 4715 E.

Highly recommended by Minister MOSES and all the beautiful people, YESS YOU ALL!"}
{"text":"Oh my god deliciousness! Mouth watering steak and a blooming onion I just can't deny. That's their signature item that keeps me coming back, nom nom nom.   Doesn't help that every time this certain nascar driver comes in under 15th or something place they send us an email for a free blooming onion. Lucky us! Keep winning!, they sent out coupons all the time, and the specials.   3 course meal for $12, I will take it. Soup or salad, steak with one side and ending the meal with two different types of cheesecakes. Perfect. But then again I always go for the combos which range in price. I get the ribeye for 26, it's always perfectly cooked with the tender meat and tasty fat. I upgrade my one side to asparagus and keep the other, a Caesar salad. You can really taste those anchovies. Fresh, crunchy and you can tell they bake their own croutons.   Price is perfect, especially if you do a special or have a coupon. I've tried a variety of the dishes... Ribs. Shrimp Alfredo. Alice springs. All are winners and I can't stop myself from the free brown bread they give out, just ask for extra butter.  Customer service is always great at this location, which is conveniently located two blocks from our house, yay! Rock on outback."}
{"text":"Good service but the restaurant is quite cramped and not comfortable seating.   Ordered filet cooked well but did not have the char on the outside.   Some good value through the menu but more like a fast food than sit down  restaurant quality."}
{"text":"I've been an Outback fan most my life. I convinced my husband for us to go last night because it's been a while and I used to love it there. I was sad to see the Steakhouse is basically another Applebees or Chilis now. Took several minutes for our waiter to request our drinks. Enough time that we reviewed the full menu and made decisions before we were asked about our drinks. When he did get our drinks and our appetizer order he apparently felt it was appropriate to stand over and reach across our table to use the kiosk to put the app order in for us. I was shocked. If all I can see when I look forward is my waiter and not my husband at a steakhouse for a few minutes, that's not very waiter classy. He proceeded to do this again when we wanted drink refills. Visual is the kiosk was up on the wall. So instead of him asking for one of us to grab it for him his whole body was over the table to push the buttons.   The drinks - well he was trying to multitask his 3 tables and just placed ours down together on the wood and moved onto place other tables drinks down. Instead of grabbing a tray to put all drinks on and taking just a few seconds to place one down at a time on a coaster.  He asked if we wanted bread after we already got our appetizer, thought that was weird timing. I thought bread use to be the norm as soon as drinks came out? Anyway we were asked but told they were In the oven still... When they did finally come out, he tried multi tasking again. He placed our plate of bread down so fast that the loaf flew off the plate and onto the table. But he was in such a hurry he didn't even take the time to notice. So we had to pick the bread off the table to put it onto the plate.  Food comes out and I received a baked potato instead of mashed potatoes. That was replaced in probably less than a minute.   My other side of macaroni and cheese was heated unevenly. I tried 3 bites and each bite had very cold spots. They offered to replaced it but I declined.  The Mignot is a thin slice longer slice instead of a smaller thicker juicy slice like they advertise and like Mignot should be. The waiter said it was so they could save time. In my opinion steak shouldn't be rushed, and it's more expensive. If your a steakhouse just take the time to prepare it right. The steak came out with very little pink even tho I ordered medium and expected more pink, my fault maybe I should have said medium rare... I'm sure this was because it was such a thin slice that it cooked so fast. After questioning it the staff very politely did offer to replace it but honestly I didn't want to wait 20-30 min as by then my husband would be done already, so I just ate what I had. It was alright.  Plates, dirty plates from the appetizer and bread were stacked in a neat pile that was easy to grab since before dinner arrived, were not picked up til after our food was all gone. Kinda my pet peeve, no one wants to stare at dirty dishes when they're trying to eat - let alone eat a steak and lobster meal. If it's a neat pile, takes a couple of seconds to get that out of the customers way to free up clutter. Again another point of we are at a steakhouse right?  Besides that the waiter was friendly, just didn't have proper steakhouse waiter skills or standard waiter manners that I feel should have been simple no brainers. I felt like he was a waiter for chilis or applebees - not for a steakhouse. The steaks tasted ok, lobster was great.   The experience made us feel like this might be the last time we go to Outback though. Honestly 1-2 of these things would have been fine but way too many small things just led to being over it last night"}
{"text":"My favorite \"fast food\" place on the strip.   If you want a really good steak without all the pomp and circumstance, this particular outback is the place.   Not sure why but they have a chopped walnut blue cheese salad that other outbacks don't have on the menu and their filet is especially good, much better than your common outback. I wonder if they get their meat from the same place that the casino's get theirs...   I usually stop in at least once for an 11 oz rare filet, chopped walnut blue cheese salad and a side of fresh green beans when I am in town and not interested in paying the outrageous prices at the casinos. ;-)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight here at the outback. My wife and daughter are celiac so eating out is difficult and frustrating at times. As a treat for the end of the school year we decided to go out and enjoy a steak. When my daughter's salad was delivered we found a crouton in the side of ranch. Not a big deal typically but for my daughter and wife a major health concern. We did not make a big deal at all about it and simply asked if we could get another side of ranch. We were pleasantly surprised at how gracious and concerned they were and how anxious they were at making it right. They went WAY above and beyond anything they needed to gain our trust. I can't overstate how great they were and how gracious their manager was. Amazing. We will definitely be back. We did not make any demand or complaint but they worked hard to win us over. Thank you so much outback on Stephanie. Great food and great management."}
{"text":"I have a family of nine-7 adults and 2 kids-and we were advised we were not allowed to dine because our party was larger than 8. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Worked hard today so I treated myself to dinner.  VERY DISAPPOINTED  1 - had to ask for silverware; the lady in the next booth did also.  Sloppy 2 - I had a third of my salad eaten when the entree came out.  I sent it back, 3 - My bill was $32.54; I paid with a $50 - and was expecting $17.46 in change; I got $17.00.  It was damn presumptuous to keep the change.  I don't write reviews normally, but this sloppiness deserves comment."}
{"text":"The service warranted 4 stars, but the food somewhere between two and one. My steak and baked potato were barely warm when I got them, bordering on cold. Obviously they sat, rather than being delivered to our table like they should have been.  This is a problem, but the drinks were good and our server was a sweet girl so we didn't say anything. Probably won't be back though. I like my food served hot and not left sitting."}
{"text":"Welcomed by pleasant hostesses when entering Outback and promptly seated at a table. Received excellent service from our server. The food was delicious. We ordered the filet and lobster and a ribeye with snow crab. Overall it was a great value for the price. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered  dinner using the curbside to go Yesterday 11-10-15.  Upon arriving home and sitting down with the family to eat our food was raw looks like they put our steaks on the grill for a min on both side and gave it to us.  This was at 3:00pm the place was not even busy.  Had to fire up my grill to finish cooking the steaks.  Normally they are pretty good but dropped the ball today."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this restaurant from some of my friends, so I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did!! It was amazing! We were seated almost immediately and the waiter was fantastic. He brought us bread that had just been taken out of the oven and took our order. The steak was cooked to perfection and was tasted amazing. I will definitely go back when I'm in Vegas and would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Well its was a bad night for outback wife order came out wrong and they screwed up the next plate as well I have had better steak in my back yard wife got meal free but I will not return thanks outback for all the salt"}
{"text":"My family loves Outback. What keeps bringing us back is the well-priced quality food in a no frills atmosphere. Why frequent this chain? Because some days you just want to chow down on a giant fried onion flower and a nice sirloin steak. And pay less than $15 for it.  Steak entrees come with one side and a soup or salad. Recently tried the blue cheese wedge salad and it was amazing! If you're looking for a small portion, go with the 6 oz Outback sirloin ($9.99).  Happy hour deals: $3.95 for many appetizers, including the famed Bloomin' Onion, and $2 draft beers."}
{"text":"I thought we were on one of those hidden camera shows. We ordered drinks, got those, then we ordered our app, Still no bread. Our app comes, no extra plates. Order food, got a 4 course special (soup, salad, main & dessert), others ordered soup. We waited, still no bread. All of our  entire orders come at the same time, salad (with no dressing), soups, and main course, and we finally got our bread. Terrible, we wont be back."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was good as well. I only wish they were open a bit later than 10:00."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and rushed, one steak was raw,  the other cold, and the place was packed with screaming kids.  Would be better if you didn't get a headache from all the screaming going on."}
{"text":"Outback has always been one of my favorite restaurants. Of course get the bloomin onion to start off with. Their salads are always fresh and very good. I also love the bread and butter they bring out. I normally get the Outback special which is their signature sirloin. They now have three sizes 6,9 or 12oz. and almost always cooked to perfection. Get a side order of beer sauteed mushrooms to go with it. I sometimes get grilled shrimp and or lobster tail which are both very good as well. My only complaint is their prices are getting ridiculous. $3 for soda and steak prices keep getting higher. The last time me and my wife went it was upwards of $80 for the two of us including tip. Go to restaurant.com and sign up. Every 3 visits you get $20 off which helps."}
{"text":"Three stars only because we have always loved the food here... The service was pretty awful. We called ahead so we were seated pretty quickly, even though we were a relatively big party. Off to a positive start.  Our waiter was honestly the biggest problem. He was nice enough but so, so slow with drinks and bread, slow to take our order, etc. Our meal took a loooooooooong time to get to us and I'm sure that's because of the kitchens, but regardless it's frustrating to have to wait as long as we did for our food.   Food was pretty good. My steak was well cooked and just how I wanted it. The bread was warm when it was finally delivered. Normal stuff, just lousy service."}
{"text":"I have tried this location again and again as a reprieve and still the dinner services haven't been up to the \"standard\" that I feel Outback Steakhouse tries to impress upon people. I have dined at the Gastonia location on many occasions and on most of those occasions the food hasn't been cooked to order and when returned to the kitchen to be redone has come back wrong again.  However, I would like to write about my latest dining experience tonight. I ordered for myself and my family the Outback Special with steamed vegetables, Filet and Grilled Shrimp, Kid Burger and one Chicken finger. My order came with the Caesar salad which had light dressing on it and the waiter didn't come by in time for me to have the salad fixed. My steak wasn't cooked to order and had a negligible amount of flavor to it, also the steak was slightly warm and very tough to cut. My son's burger was very dry and lukewarm and his fries were cool so he didn't eat his entire meal.  When Jaime the waiter came by I informed him about my steak and he notified Heather the Service Manager, she came over and asked if there was anything else she could do for me or if I would like a replacement but I didn't feel like waiting for a replacement and also I've gotten tired of the food being returned constantly and not knowing what to expect when the food arrives again. So, I told her no and she removed my entree from the bill.  I would like to think that my experiences are atypical and other diners are having a more enjoyable experience but I don't feel that is the case with this location. I have been to the Outback Steakhouse in Huntersville on several occasions and not once had an issue with the food or the service but Gastonia is closer to me.   So in closing I wanted to share with you one diner's experience from many that used to frequent this establishment. But no more, I'm done because this location is as bad as it gets. Save your time and money and go to the Longhorn in Gastonia if you're in this area and looking for great customer service and steaks cooked to order."}
{"text":"I'm actually sitting in outback as I type this and it's  horrible horrible service. Our waitress seems oblivious that we're even here.. Half of the food we ordered \"she forgot to put in\" so we ended up getting our appetizers the same time as our food.. My meal was incomplete due to her not ringing items up.. My steak was dry and my boyfriend ordered a bacon Bourbon sauce on his which saved his meat from drying out.. I had to ask for bread and drink refills.. And we had been seated for over 45 minutes before any food touched our table including bread.. Needless to say I haven't been to outback in years and I don't think I will EVER return..."}
{"text":"I don't know why  Outback gets so many mediocre reviews it is not nearly as expensive as Ruth Chris, Morton's, The Keg or any of the other high and prime rib or steak houses.  How people can compare them to each other is unreasonable.  Once again for the price. Outback has always had great steaks, great service for a decent price.  I had there prime rib with vegetables and an add on of grilled shrimp and everything was great.   For the people who like the Outback grilled shrimp this location still has the remoulade sauce that is awesome sauce they use on the shrimp that the other locations have discontinued to offer on their menu."}
{"text":"I don't know why soo many low ratings for Outback.  I guess too many steak snobs! Its not Mortons but at 1/5th the price its just great.   Great service for a chain restaurant, great for family get togethers or a upscale after work meeting.  Service is always great."}
{"text":"So I was upcharged for my sides unknowingly. Not a biggie, but I noticed when I went to pay. So I wasn't bothered, but I felt like it was bad business practice so I requested to speak with who I later found out was Billy. He's such a humble and assertive guy. He knew and addressed the issue directly and without making me feel any type of wrong for my assertion. For this being my first time at this location as well as my first time having Outback in roughly 10+ years. I can appreciate being treated as though my views, concerns, and/or opinion matters. Way to go King William (Billy) and all is totally forgiven young Taylor. I'll be back to sit and eat next time."}
{"text":"Normally, I wouldn't review a chain restaurant but the service warranted me to write a review.  This review is more for the service rather than their food.  OK, first thing first, when we got sat down, our server took our drink order. She got our drink and brought our complimentary bread and we placed our order.  It took 15 minutes to get our Blossomin' Onion.  As if that wasn't enough, it took another 20 for our main dishes to get to the table.  I guess the server saw us getting annoyed and gave us a weird excuse that their computer went down.  That is such a bunch of bull because the people that got seated AFTER us got their orders no problem.  I would rather her to have told the truth rather than making a BS excuse that didn't make any lick of sense.  So we got our food after over 30 minutes has passed and I do have to say, their food is prepared well and tasted good.  We ate our dishes with gusto.  When we finally got our check,after waiting for what seemed like forever after we finished our food (10 mins of waiting) and another 5 mins to get the change.  We spent more time waiting than eating.  Now I usually give at least 20% for gratuity, but for this instance, we gave about 12% so she would know the service was blah.  At that point, I was over the service."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill in the last year. I cannot say I know why either. They used to be very good. They are not open for lunch which is a bummer in my mind. We like to go out to a big meal at lunch at times reather than dinner. Because, then you have time to let it digest.  Anyway, this place is very busy. But, it seems so corprate. The food is getting like Red Lobster where everything tastes the same. I think they really try, but it is just not there. They really want to push alcohol on you, and starters. I know they have to  but, it just seems that they are forced. Steaks were just OK not fantastic! The Potaoes were rock hard. I mean the baked potatoes so hard,even when we took them home and re cooked they were hard. Very strange. Bathrooms are clean, our server seemed very over whelmed as if she could not handle it all. It is not horrible, just not wonderful. They keep putting out coupns and they are good ones as well. I just do not want to go there when there are so many good other places. Sorry, it is off my list of good places to go now days."}
{"text":"So dinner was filet & lobster, asparagus, mushrooms, wedge salad and sweet potato with fresh brewed coffee.  Outback has remarkable servers, delicious food and unbelievable customer service.  No worries mate - best steak in south Charlotte"}
{"text":"Outback is outback but I can say we had a great time. Our waiter Josh was stellar. He had our drinks topped off constantly and never left us hanging. All the food was great. No waits or anything. Steaks in vegas get crazy so it was nice to score this outback."}
{"text":"Worst visit to this Restarunt I have ever had.  Today was not our first visit but I believe its our last.  Not because of the food because we never even got water after 20 minutes and one visit back to the hostess to request a server.  Here's the story.  Five of us, all over 30, arranged to meet here for a meal and friendly conversation.  The wife and I arrived first and were shown to a booth.  I explained to the hostess that we wanted a table and there were several empty in the area.  The hostess left us standing in the middle of the Restarunt while she talked to at least three other employees.  We just stood there until I talked to one of the several servers walking by us.  She said I needed to go back and speak with the hostess so I did and was told they would be right with us, not.  I went back to were the wife was and we were seated at a table near where we were standing.  That took about 10 minutes total.  The rest of our party arrived within 3 or 4 minutes of us being seated.  We talked and waited for approximately 10 minutes with no contact from any of the servers walking by us.  I decided to once again go to the hostess and request a server.  I went back to the table and we waited another 10 minutes without any sign of a server.  That is when we got up and left.  But I felt the manager should know about this so I asked the hostess to let the manager know I wanted to talk to them.  I waited and asked three employees to have the manager speak with me.  I don't want to say it was 10 minutes but it was longer than five a manager appeared.  She was cordial but didn't seem to concerned.  Her solution was for us to go back and she would get us a server.  I did tell here that the rest of my party had left for another restaurant already so that was not an option.  This was one of those times where the I'm sorry didn't seem all that sincere.    End of this story but you really need to see the review for the Restarunt across the street where we did receive excellent food, service and treated as a customer should be."}
{"text":"The ribeye steak was excellent and the broccoli  was good and the baked potatoe was good and the Chesse fries with bacon was excellent I will be retuning agin."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my kids.   My 10 year old got salmon when she started eating it she said it was squishy.   I looked over to see a raw peice if salmon.   I told my server she apologized and took it back.   When the manager brought it back out I realized it was the same peice of fish which was smashed up in little pieces just microwaved.   I was very disappointed.  They could have at least got a new peice of fish cooked for her.   She then went home with am upset stomach.   We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Typical Outback. This location gets an extra star over others for their attentive service and handling of special orders and/or mistakes. Professional management."}
{"text":"Took an hour for our steak, waitress finally served our steak but never returned to check on us."}
{"text":"Had lunch today here, we decided on the 15.99 specials we have seen advertised. We went to Outback maybe 15 years ago once in Colorado and never went again. We did not like it at all. Since Texas Roadhouse next door is not open for lunch we decided to give Outback another try. The soup and salad was good but the sweet potato was over cooked. My steak was over cooked, dry and chewy, had some grizzle in it, hubbies was okay, I do not like spice and whatever was on the meat was spicy hot. So that may be why we never went again after the first time. The bread served was soft and tasty, the tiny bit of butter served with it was not near enough. The cheesecake for dessert was okay but nothing special, I did not think a drizzle of Hershey syrup made it a chocolate cheesecake. All in all it was okay but nothing to make me want to return anytime soon. The waiter was very nice and food brought right out, no complaints there."}
{"text":"First of all, this is the BEST outback that I've been in. We had a pretty big group with 2 kids and ALL our steaks were cooked perfectly.  There was a mix up with the kids' orders and the server was very apologetic and even took that meal off the bill. At the end of the meal he even served free ice cream to apologize again for the mix up.   Great food and great service."}
{"text":"I wish there were another Outback location closer to me! Food (at the chain, in general) is always good, but this particular location is terribly unreliable. Service is really hit or miss, and the food is as well. Sometimes everything is wonderful, sometimes not. On our most recent visit, we had horrible service (seriously - how can a person be SO miserable!?!) we waited forever to receive our Bloomin' Onion (which was so overcooked that it tasted bitter and burnt) then less than 30 seconds later, our salads were brought out by a server other than ours, literally followed out by our meals by yet another server. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have had several bad meals in the past but decided to give it one more chance. The service was top notch. My server was extremely efficient not overly personable but good. The food was ok. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Service was average but friendly. Had to ask for my salad after my husband had already his soup for a while, got one of the kids meals side dish wrong, and my steak was way over cooked. They offered to bring a new steak, but our waitress was so busy by the time I told her I wasn't hungry any more. They took care of the order and were very great about it. We've been coming here for years, but usually only when someone gives us as gift card. I'd say the service is always about average, as well as the food. Maybe because it's located on LVB. We've been to the one in Henderson on Stephanie and it's better."}
{"text":"This isn't a review of Outback in general but rather this location (because Outback just happens to be one of my favorite restaurants, don't judge me).  I walked in and it was a typical outback. Despite it being very busy we were seated with no wait which was nice. Our service was a little slow and the waitress seemed a little scattered, but that is to be expected when the restaurant is swamped and it didn't bother me. We did ask for more bloomin' onion dipping sauce that was forgotten, and I also ordered a shrimp skewer with my entree that was forgotten as well. It was taken off the check though so nothing to really fuss about.  All in all, the food was delicious as always, the service was just a little hectic due to the busy atmosphere which is understandable,"}
{"text":"I don't usually stop at a place that only has 3.5 stars but had a gift certificate. I give a four star not because and was bad, but because I reserve 5 stars for someplace that amazes me. This was a good solid visit with the service that I would hope to receive at a steakhouse.  I had the prime rib and my wife had the ribeye. Both were cooked properly and had good flavor. Our sides, broccoli, sweet potato, and a bowl of potato soup were enjoyable with the overall best part of the meal actually being the soup.  The house red wine would be acceptable to most people who would like a glass to pair with steak, but not so complexed or heavy that it distracts from the meal.  I would eat here again with no complaints or hesitation. A good solid experience."}
{"text":"Horrible drink.  Ordered the moonshine huckleberry hooch but the bartender put in so much juice u couldn't taste anything else.  She wanted to charge me 2.00 more to add alcohol."}
{"text":"OMG!! If you are looking for a good steak and baby back ribs you should definitely try The Outback Steakhouse it is reasonably Price & Mum, Mum Good."}
{"text":"Okay so I ordered the Chicken on the Barbie with a salad and steamed vegetables...all of which was fantastic!  However, the whole visit was ruined by the horrific customer service I received.  When I walked in the hostess was very polite and seated me quickly.  When I got to my table I waited for FIVE MINUTES and no one ever even walked by me, took a drink order, ANYTHING.    So I politely went back up to the hostess and said that no one had ever come over to my table.  She apologized ( it's not her fault the waiter wasn't doing his job) and I just said I would eat at a bar table and went to seat myself.    So while I'm waiting for someone to come and take my drink order at the new table after another 3-5 minutes goes by (keep in mind no one has yet to come over to my new table either)  I finally see the server at my previous table go over and pick up the menu off of it.  Nice. Only took 10 minutes for him to acknowledge he had a table.  I bet he is just RAKING in the tips.  So while I'm continuing to sit at wait at my new table, I'm almost to the point of walking out, but I'm absolutely starving and have already been up and on the road for over 12 hours at this point.  I see someone who appears to be the bartender standing with another employee.  I finally go up to the bar and politely ask if anyone is taking care of my table tonight.  He comes around the bar and informs me that he is.  I would have said that he was possibly covering for someone else, but when another table arrived later he greeted them within 30 seconds and took excellent care of their table all night.  My service was great for the rest of the night.  I got kind of annoyed when about halfway through my meal the asst manager came up to me. (Keep in mind I was dining alone) and wanted to make sure everything was well and apologized for earlier.  It was VERY evident that he considered himself a very attractive guy and seemed to think that by offering a smile and a smoldering look at me that it was going to make me forget about my horrible experience.  To be honest, the whole encounter, made me want to vomit.  I guess I should also mention that the actual restaurant manager came up to me later to check on me and walked up to a completely empty drink right as my overly on the ball server (dripping with sarcasm) cam out of the kitchen with a fresh drink in hand.   So the food was great.  Service was awful, unfortunately the awful service is all I will remember from my visit."}
{"text":"I have not been here in awhile and mean like years but I decided to come here and give 1 more try and all I can say whooooooo doggy they have re did everything and I mean everything it was a pleasant experience and the food is so. F N BOMB LMAO. That was why I never came back but I will be coming back for sure and the steak was on point and I mean really good I ask for med rare it was amazing"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a buy one get one free entree where your free entree had to be under $10. I thought that would be pretty limiting but it turns out there are a few entrees under $10 (sandwiches, burgers, small steaks)     We started with the chicken quesadilla appetizer minus mushrooms (gross). It was a good amount of food but nothing spectacular and that may have been because the mushrooms are the spectacular part of the dish. Oh well.   I got a wood grilled small steak with fries and a salad while my boyfriend got the Steak Diablo.  My steak was good, his came with a spicy sauce that he could take or leave. I don't foresee that being ordered for a second time.   Our waiter was very nice and our food came out very timely.  We didn't have to open the door on the way in or on the way out, I'm a fan of that."}
{"text":"Had a great experience for my husband's birthday. John K. was our waiter and he very courteous and pleasant. He took time to actually talk to us instead of rushing to the next table. My husband's steak was a little cooked and he mentioned it to John but said it was fine. The manager Dan came right over and offered to remake a whole new one. He ordered the 35oz steak! My husband declined but Dan was very nice and took money off the bill and even bought him dessert. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Maybe I had a little bit to much wine. But the steak I had was awesome. I do have to say that when i come here that is pretty much what I get and I am never disappointed with the ribeye. Although this time it was extra delicious.   Also the bread they put is very good. It is even better when you ask for the honey butter."}
{"text":"Sad, just sad! Sweetie had never been, so we went for their special \"All you can eat shrimp w/sirloin.\" BAD DECISION! Started with the Blooming Onion, how the hell could they screw up one of their signature items???? Burnt outside, and raw and doughy on the inside...WTF??? Asked for medium rare steaks, they were so under cooked, they looked purple and they were ICE COLD! Fries..cold, limp greasy. Shrimp, YUCK!!! You could tell they weren't fresh, the scampi style shrimp were as small as salad shrimp and came with about 4- 5.....Buffalo and fried shrimp were the same small size, yet hidden in massive amounts of breading. NEVER AGAIN!  2 stars is for our waiter Gregory, he was awesome! Too bad the food sucked ASS!  $80.00 we'll never see again......."}
{"text":"Visited on Father's Day around 5:30 (40 minute wait). We hung around and enjoyed their Crispy Chicken Sandwich (messy, but so worth it). Little one had the grilled cheese and fries (meh) and we ordered a couple of side Caesar salads. Service was attentive (even considering how slammed they were), manager was around and visible (even brought out food samples while we waited outside!).   Only reason for the missing star is we ordered a calamari app which was seriously over-salted (might have just been a kitchen error, but it made it inedible). Server took it away without any issues, manager followed up and offered a replacement app, but by this time, we were ready for dinner. We definitely appreciated the attentive service and manager follow-up and totally understood that this was just an oversight.   We will definitely be returning to this location, if only for that perfectly crispy chicken sandwich (dipped in buffalo sauce, served with a refreshing aioli....mmmm...) and that never-disappointing Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Not sure when they started drowning the food in butter but they certainly didn't always do that.  I use to be able to taste the grilled flavor but they've clearly changed their process or the butter chef was working this particular day.  I only get the taste for a steak every once in a while and this experience will probably keep me away a little longer the next I get a steak urge......"}
{"text":"Meh...  Nothing much has changed.  The server was attentive and prompt. This is where the compliment stops.  There's no difference in taste or flavour between NY versus Ribeye and there should be.  After which, we ordered their Carrot Cake for dessert.  The cake was so dense and heavy, it truly was heavier than the main course."}
{"text":"Really amazing service, Sam was our server and she was awesome. Food came out so quickly and tasted great and we were seated quickly too. Will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Oh man! I used to really like this place. It seems like each time we come for dinner it gets less and less good. Tonight I ordered a regular burger with Swiss cheese.... Medium rare.... And side salad... From our extremely unenthusiastic waiter. I also ordered a good old Blue Moon beer. My burger arrived with a dry bun and no cheese. I alerted our unenthusiastic waiter and he took it back to the kitchen and added Mayo and my Swiss cheese. I took a bite and it was practically raw. Then my beer came out... with no orange. No waiter around so my husband went to the bar and the bartender gave me a shot of orange juice... hmmm... good enough..\"My burger is a lost cause,\" I told my unenthusiastic waiter when we saw him next. He asked if I wanted it remade and I told him we were ready to go.I had already shared my husband's yummy fried shrimp while I waited. He took my burger away... With one bite eaten  out of it. The manager came over and \"generously\" offered to not charge us for my one bite of burger (& the side salad I ate). Moral of the story... Share the shrimp IF you go there. Sadly, we will probably not be back."}
{"text":"normally, I hate chain restaurants. This Outback is the exception. I order their kid's meals to-go for lunch pretty often and Andrew is the best thing that could have happened to this Outback! And Angelina :)  One time, I was waiting for my to-go order to come while making calls for work when I realized almost an entire hour had gone by. I called just to get an update, not to complain or anything (thankfully I wasn't in a hurry).  The manager apologized and I guess something happened in the kitchen? I don't remember but when he came out with my food he didn't charge me and told me that he was going to take care of me the next visit. I was shocked!!! He did not need to do that but it was definitely something that set this chain above the rest."}
{"text":"We just ate here and while the food was very good, what I want to specifically comment on is the outstanding customer service experience we had. We asked the waiter about fish (allergens) and he talked to the manager to make sure everything was safe for my grandfather to eat. When she realized he couldn't have the BBQ sauce for the ribs, she made sure to get something he could eat (dry rub). They were so friendly, helpful and accommodating. If I lived in the area I would go here more often."}
{"text":"Food is not very good here. I got the 6 oz Sirloin my husband got the 12 oz it was like shoe leather and we ordered medium well. The pineapple margarita was gross. The tropical drink was good. The blossom was over cooked. Gross. Chili's is way better."}
{"text":"Ordered from door dash (don't even get me started on them). Ordered loaded baked potato as the side. Got no sour cream and half a portion cup of hard shredded cheese. Steak was ordered medium rare to account for the delivery hoping to get it medium and was beyond well done. Mac and cheese was dry as can be. Will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Meh. It's a chain restaurant which has become ordinary over the years. Blooming onion was a bit greasy, took 15 minutes to get silverware, portions and plates have seemingly shrunk. Not too bad in a pinch but definitely doesn't have that wow factor that it use to. You would do better at Texas roadhouse."}
{"text":"Good food. Love the bad and the wait staff is always excellent. Plan on having many more family gatherings here!"}
{"text":"Went to outback today (father's day). Of course the place was crowded...but why didn't the staff know this? Table was dirty. Bread tasted like the wooden board it was on. Ordered 2 kids grilled cheese, cheese burger and chicken Philly, 49 minute wait. Had to watch people seated after us being served ribs baked potato and steak and drinks being topped off... also waiter was soft spoken and babbling...very unattentive to our table... kids were starving so we left...hungry.   Also, items and promotions online are not offered at this location. Reason was \"we're sort of a different type of restaurant\" whatever that means.   Will never be back...ever"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since the day it opened and the food is ALWAYS consistently great. The servers are well trained and always attentive, the atmosphere is always clean and tidy. (I have even seen employees off to the side SCRUBBING the silverware to make sure it is all spotless before they place it on the table.)  As of lately, we have been using their curbside to-go service and it's always spot on. We send the order through their website online and it's usually ready in about 20 minutes or so (depending on the day). All I have to do is pull up my car, and they bring everything to me (major OMGAWWW AWESOME factor for me ^.^)  As for the call ahead seating, seriously folks?!? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out.   You have two options: 1) Call Outback before you leave the house, tell them you have #_ folks coming to eat and you will be there in __ minutes. They put your name on the wait list. This is just a way of getting your name on the list a little earlier. or 2) You arrive at Outback with #_ folks and say \"Hi, we're here to get our grub on\" and they put your name on the wait list and you get to sit there and wait as the folks who arrived after you (but called in their party onto the list, ahead of their arrival) get seated before you.  Again, not rocket science. And even if for some reason something happens to your call ahead seating spot and it gets lost, don't be a jerk about it. Just call in one of their awesome managers and calm the DERP down."}
{"text":"We haven't been to this outback in 2 years because of the bad service we received at the time. The service this time was spot on. Our server Preston was great and he never allowed a drinks to run dry. Our food was HOT and the steaks were cooked to perfection. With this experience, we will gladly return in hopes of having such superb service."}
{"text":"Thank heaven Outback changed its steak seasoning!  The steaks were very tasty.  Service was excellent.  Lots of staff to made our dining experience pleasurable.  This Outback Steakhouse put our Madison, WI location to shame."}
{"text":"I thought this was a decent lunch location, but slightly pricey.   I stopped in for lunch recently with my girlfriend and we both ordered a set of street tacos and drinks. I opted for the steak tacos and lemonade, with a side of their potato soup. Obviously they gave us bread, which always rocks.   I didn't hate the food or the service. The server was nice, but pretty slow for an afternoon that wasn't very busy. The steak in my tacos seemed a little overcooked, but still pretty good. To be honest, I thought the lunch menu was decent. Nothing to write home about though.   Would I come back? Eh, maybe.   It really depends on what else is in the area. I wasn't particularly blown away by anything there."}
{"text":"Visited with my mother (who rarely goes out to eat) for my birthday dinner. We were greeted by an older gentleman at the door who appeared to be a manager of some sort. Nice entrance coming in plus they definitely upgraded and remodeled since the last time I visited. We were seated by another women and our server Jessie came out to get us some drinks and bread. Ordered the special with the steak and garlic mashed potatoes. Not only was it perfect, but the chef also brought it out to us. (Other guests were having this happen as well, it may be a new thing they are doing). My mom had the fish sampler, she was RAVING about how great it was along with the shrimp. She just loved it. The lighting inside is a bit more cozy and the atmosphere was calm and inviting overall. Our server was prompt and kind and she was great. The management clearly has changed at this location, the last time I was there all the people working there were in their mid-20s and the hostess was maybe 18-19. The management and staff were noticeably older and more mature, even the server next to our table in training was a bit more calm and in his mid-30s. This is an attempt by the ownership/management to appear to a different crowd in my opinion. I found it refreshing to be honest. If I was young and hip, maybe Buffalo Wild Wings would be better, but for dinner this was nice to me. Staff was great, food was excellent, I would totally recommend this Outback location to anyone. My mother, who is not easily impressed, absolutely LOVED the food and staff. She already has planned for us to go again someday, which she NEVER does normally. That spoke volumes to me. I look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Had the rib and filet combo. Filet was done just right and was delicious. Ribs had wonderful  sauce but overall were in the thin side. Not a lot of meat compared to say Famous Dave's. Salads and bread were excellent and our server was wonderful. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for several days and you get tired of the high priced meals; but not wanting fast food, so Outback was the perfect spot. You know what to expect, good food and reasonable prices.  This hit all those marks but what had me write a review and give the place five stars was our server, Shawn.   We are a 55 plus couple, not old but have dined at many a restaurant in our time and must say, Shawn was one of the most polite, attentive, knowledgeable waiters that we have ever come across. Outback, you better hang onto this young man or one of the high end restaurants in town will snatch him up!  Thank you Shawn for your service and thank you to your mom/parents for raising such a man."}
{"text":"We visited on NYE and what a PLEASANT experience it was for us! We had put our name in online, got seated within 10 minutes of arriving which was 20 minutes before our saved time.  The hostess was joyful and handling the holiday pressure really well. The server was attentive but not in our faces too much, actually suggested one of my favorite wines, and was quick when it came time to pay the bill.  The food was cooked to perfection (we both tried the portabello filet with garlic mashed and steamed veggies.) The only food item that could have been done better was the asparagus; it was a bit tough. We carried a slice of raspberry cheesecake home with us for later and enjoyed that, too!  Throughout the visit, the manager was checking on her employees and complimenting them on their attention to the needs of the restaurant, which I think was a great morale booster! I'm so happy to say our last meal of 2014 was a wonderful experience on so many levels!"}
{"text":"Outback is a great place to eat. This particular outback was especially great. It took about 2 minutes to sit us down. I'd rather focus on the service of the waiter. Anthony, was one of the best servers I have came across in awhile. His service was above & beyond! Not once did we have to ask for a refill, he was on top of it. He would occasionally check on us but not to the point where we felt forgotten nor bothered. Excellent service from him !"}
{"text":"Slow service....employees talking to each other about personal things within earshot of us.....overcooked blooming onion....overcooked hamburger....dry chicken....best of all....the woman at the table next to us found a hair on her plate."}
{"text":"I've been here lots of times and todays experience was the best! Ordered the bone in ribeye a little fatty but.... Its a ribeye.... It was delicious! I ordered two drinks cant remember the name sooo obviously it did the job! Our servers name was Jeff and he was awesome! I also work in a restaurant and i can say he definitely nailed all his steps! Thx outback!"}
{"text":"Best Outback In vegas.  The staff is always friendly and they always go above and beyond to make sure the customers are happy.  They also have an amazing happy hour until 7pm and you can't beat that."}
{"text":"The husband and myself went to outback for Valentines Day, no reservations, and a very long wait.  To be expected, right?  Ended up grabbing a table at the bar, they quickly cleaned it off, and we were helped right away.  We had one of the best servers, by far, that we've ever experienced.  He was on it with the drinks, lots of personality, funny, and professional.  Food was delish, of course, but the only slight negative was the cheesecake.  It tasted cheesy and not very sweet.  The service was so good though we didn't complain.  Otherwise 5 stars to sure!!"}
{"text":"As an Outback fan, I have to say my visit to the Pineville location off Pineville-Matthews road in Charlotte was the worst visit in 16 years of visiting Outback.  I went Saturday night September 26th 2015 at 6:30 pm. I sat at the bar and the negativity and rudeness of the bar staff was appalling. My date walked in and slipped and fell on the greasy and slick floor. The entire bar area floor was slick and greasy. I was sliding all over the floor while walking. Due to the bartenders rudeness, I decided to grab a bar table as I anticipated bad service at the bar.  The guy waiter was not much nicer. He was rude and had no interest in serving us. I did order and once the girl brought my steak, she literally dropped it on the table and kept walking. Typically they ask if you need anything else but the girl seemed agitated when I asked her for A1 steak sauce.   The waiter finally brought it and did not check back one single time while eating. He did not refill our drinks nor did he ask or care how we enjoyed our meal.  I have been going to this outback for 2 years. I have seen a major decline in the service and management of this location. The manager seemed over her head, the staff all seemed miserable, and the cloud of negativity surrounding the staff is embarrassing for the outback company. I will never visit this location again and will also write outback personally."}
{"text":"We had a incident at our meal tonight and the management went out of their way to make the situation right. They turned a problem into an opportunity to exceed expectations. It made the overall experience better than we would have had without an issue. I will remember this the next time I am in the mood for steak!"}
{"text":"We have always loved the steaks at Outback.   So my husband planned a birthday dinner for me  with five of our friends.  What a disaster.   First we were shown to our table which wasn't set up, missing  chairs.  Waiter came took orders, served us bread, 2 loaves and three plates for seven people.  Then when the steaks were brought out, not everyone received their dinner.  And if they were lucky enough to get dinner, the meals all had missing items, vegetables etc.  My husbands prime rib looked like a hockey puck, ordered med well.  Our last friend finally received his order after the manager stopped by the table.  This was after all others  were mostly finished.  Manager did take 15 percent of our bill.  But will not go back to this Outback.  Horrible food and service."}
{"text":"Ok, so I get that Outback doesn't deserve a proper restaurant critics 5 star.  Sometimes however, you never realize how good a thing is you have until you've lost it.    Rewind about a about 8 months ago when all of my friends were living right on the doorstep of the Outback right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale.  If I had a nickel for all the of  $13.99 steak and potatoes or $2 wells I could feed a small village in a poor country for the rest of their lives.    So I guess to comment on my particular experience here, it was one of my last days in Scottsdale and sinking my teeth into their 10oz Filet cooked medium rare was like getting smacked in the face with a flashback of all the great times I had at the Old Town location, coupled with the mayhem in Old town after.  Price - ***** Quailty - *** Experience - **** Memories - Priceless.  Thanks Outback!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was amazing. I got the sirloin, which was cooked to the correct temperature, with the new garlic butter on top and it tasted incredible! We also got the salted caramel cookie dessert which was probably the best dessert we've ever had! Our server was prompt and friendly. Prices are on the higher side but totally worth it. We will return."}
{"text":"I was so happy that they took reservations on Valentine's Day. I was worried that the service would be lacking today, because they were extremely busy, but our server Dawn was AWESOME!! She was super nice and very patient with a question we had. There was a slight issue with my wife's steak not being cooked properly, but the manager was right there and had it fixed quickly. We both had a ribeye and they were delicious! The best steak I've had in a long time!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Okay, so we tried this one twice, and wont try it again. We arrived just before the dinner rush, only to be put at the table closest to the door, therefore the folks waiting for a table in the small lobby, were spilling over into the dinning area, and hovering at our table.  it was very uncomfortable.  The crab legs were rubbery, we had 4 different servers, asking us every 5 minutes how everything was.  We were using a gift card, so to make a long story short, would not have even gone back if not for the gift card.  Loud, dirty, substandard food, why would we ever want to dine here again ?  2 stars is being generous."}
{"text":"Usually they get big ups from me. However they have discontinued the string beans. Who does that?  Very disappointing to me as it was my second favorite item on the menu besides the steak."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of Outback. Consistant quality/Service.  But this experience at this location was especially poor. My buddy and I arrived at 7:00 pm and promptly ordered two Prime Rib dinners. But the Front of House manager came to our table an d told us they they were out of Prime Rib, and offered us Ribeyes, but we would have to pay the higher price. First, how does an established restaurant run out of Prime Rib so early in the evening? And when the wait staff hasn't been informed to inform the customer, who wouldn't eat the difference in price since it was the restaurants fault for not properly planning?  I would never recommend this Outback to anyone. Poorly managed.  Our server was even appalled that they were out so early."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!  First off this restaurant and its bathrooms are dirty.  Ordered a burger well done and it was all kinds of pink inside and very salty.  The hostess had the personality of a rock.  There are plenty of good clean eateries in the area; do yourself and your health a favor and pass on this one!!"}
{"text":"Went to outback last week and was not happy at all. Spent almost 100 dollars on 2 porterhouse steaks first one came out gray no seasoning no searing extremely fatty. Second one was just okay. I think the quality of the meat has gone down. Service from our waitress was amazing. But we weren't even offered dessert or anything but a half assed sorry. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a chain restaurant on the Strip.  Extremely busy but the service was acceptable.  My salmon was as good as other locations - it just cost $4.00 more than ABQ a week ago,  still it offered dinner without slot machines."}
{"text":"Trina is the best!! She always makes our visits enjoyable. Nothing like walking in and having her know how we operate. She makes me the best strawberry infused champagne. I love it. You know ur in a good spot when the other customers get excited to have her wait on them. After 10 yrs plus she knows how to make your visit complete. Marcy is a great proprietor. She takes care of everyone and wants to make sure they are enjoying the meal. Anytime we have had a problem with the cook on the steak, under cooked bakers or wrong orders,  everyone is quick to correct. Keep up the good work ladies!! We love our time at ur establishment. Thank you!! Finally a corporate place that feels like home."}
{"text":"This is been one of the worst experiences ever in a restaurant. Do not try to use your E-gift card from your mobile device. You need to print it off before going to the restaurant. No instructions on the email. But when you get ready to pay and use it on your mobile device you cannot use it.  Call customer service no less then five times. (called daughter and she was going to print it off and bring it to us )The link always said that it was a disabled and to call customer service. After over an hour. Gave up and left Full payment. never could use our gift card."}
{"text":"As a former employee of OSI in Central Florida, I was very disappointed in this visit to Outback Steakhouse, Pineville. The service was very slow and not attentive, and my steak came out two temperatures overdone. When I said something to the server who ran the food to the table, she said, do you want us to cook a new one? When I said no, I figured a manager would be sent to the table, as we would have done back in my day. No one ever revisited the table until their FOH manager did her standard rounds from table-to-table and I opened up about it. It was at this time that she recognized I had not eaten any of it and offered to take it off the bill. While she was at the computer completing the void of my dinner from the bill, I noticed our server approach the manager and do a couple of sideways glances with a mild scorn on her face in our direction. I will always be an OSI customer, but I may not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on at this location. Over the past 3-4 years the food quality and service has deteriorated. Not near as crowded as it once was. I usually order the sirloin and wedge salad. They do tend to cook steaks on the rare side, keep that in mind when you order. I usually order medium rare, but medium is a better temp at this kitchen."}
{"text":"I use to love going to Outback and it has been awhile since I've been there. I ordered the grilled salmon which was good but the side salad was all Iceberg Lettuce. My dinner cost $16. My mother ordered a Steak Salad and it had all Iceberg Lettuce. The steak salad cost around $15. It is ridiculous that they charge so much for these entrees and use Iceberg Lettuce which basically is just water. This is the last time I will go to Outback."}
{"text":"Nice staff, good food."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. I especially loved their salads. They put the drsg on the bottom and was so fresh. The steak is okay but they changed their seasonings. It doesn't have as much flavor any more. It is okay but not as special as it used to be"}
{"text":"I enjoy the outback chain and I'm aware that one bad experience may be just bad luck, however my experience was not great, therefore my review is 1, unless I somehow end up here again and that experience is drastically better.  After waiting several minutes for a table to be clean, even though several others were already clean we were finally seated.  My wife and I sat there for several more minutes as waitresses walked passed us.  Eventually the waitress came.  I felt bad because the waitress had to train someone and wait her regular tables, perhaps a bit much and probably effected things.  Not necessarily the waitresses fault, probably management.    We got our bread before our drinks and instead of butter were served sour cream, which my wife found out after putting a mouth full of bread in her mouth (happy it was her and not me lol).    The food was cooked fine, no complaints on the fillet or the prime rib.  I ordered the all you can eat shrimp as well.  Easily the tiniest baby shrimp I have seen with a whopping 2 sauce choice.  Note:  obviously this a problem with the entire chain and not this direct location.    Waiting on the shrimp was really long.  Idk if it was a tactic so that I didn't down as much, but it was really long.  I have done all you can eat shrimp at red lobster with much better results.  The waitress stated that the food took long because the chef had a lot of orders.  It was a Monday at 8pm,  no more than 10 people in the entire place, maybe they were short staffed.    Regardless of being short staffed, the waitress training someone and the quality of the shrimp I am basing this review on my overall experience.  I feel for whatever issues the staff may have had, but at the end of the day my experience was less then enjoyable, therefore my review reflects that."}
{"text":"Horrible. Hair in our food. Nothing was hot. Slow service. Burger was like a hockey puck. Steak was undercooked and mostly fat. For what they charge I would expect way better. Gross."}
{"text":"A very well run Outback. We ate here three nights during our four night stay in Phoenix. Great job!"}
{"text":"A friend took me to dinner for my birthday at this location this week.  The food was great.  I rarely eat ribs, but think they have some of the best here.  The meat falls of the bone.  The sauce is just about right, tangy but not to strong.  A plus to the bartender as well, he knows how to mix a good ginger ale.  I want to recommend Rachel,our server, to anyone who goes to this location.  Here is a young woman who really knows how to do her job.  The service she provides is acceptable in every way so I can't complain.  She also did something very special that proves she really listens to her customers when she does her job.  My friend I went to dinner with is 91 with Alzheimer's.  With this illness, this could be our last time she gets to celebrate my birthday with me so it really was important to me that things went well.  She let Rachael know that for my birthday she wanted a cake served with a candle.  I tried to explain to my friend, Norma, that they didn't do that at this restaurant which I know disappointed her but what could I say.  After finishing a full rack of ribs,  I could use the excuse that I was to full to have a desert so could get around the cake and candle situation.  At this point Rachael asked me if I was ready for my birthday desert and expressed that she thought I'd really enjoy it and she gave Norma a big smile so I said fine.  I couldn't believe it when she came out with a scoop of ice cream with a candle in it.  This delighted Norma and touched my heart as Norma sang Happy Birthday\" to me.  This is service ask for Rachael!  She get's five stars!  There is only one thing I could suggest that would improve my experience at Outback.  I think the bring out the entree a bit sooner than I would like after the salad is served.  A little more time in between would be nice."}
{"text":"Very unhappy . It was my first time going to outback  I'd thought it be nice to take my father to dinner for his birthday. I called ahead to place a semi reservation ,party of ten! We all got there at time given come to find out we didn't get seated till 30 almost 40 mins after. Yes the place was busy but yet they were able to seat other walk ins right away (I'm taking about party of 5/6 ppl). So what was the point of calling ahead! Next thing we get seated our server took awhile to come and take our drink order  yes we were hungry after waiting so long. To top it off it took about another 30-40 min to get our food. It was very upsetting, come to find out the plates didn't look so appetizing and nor did our steaks get cooked the way we asked. We chose not to complain because we don't like to be one of those type of \"personality \". We are for sure not coming back ,at least not to that location. Yes they were busy or understaffed but for a place like that they should know better. We could of gone to Apple -b's or T.G.I. Friday's I'm sure it would of been a whole lot better and cheaper."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the incredible hospitality I received here!!! Absolutely fantastic! First stop coming to Phoenix and the kind and sweet waitress was awesome ! Everyone on their team has the best customer service. Made me feel like I was a part of their family !"}
{"text":"Don't go here if you have a large party...they will not accommodate you & you will be asked to accommodate yourself by moving tables on ur own & pushing them together. If you don't, they will seat someone at the table they want you to move. & If you complain, you will be chewed out my Sidney the manager, & she'll ask you & all your guests to leave."}
{"text":"Baboy wanted to come here. He says it's his fave spot! And I had never been here before.  We had their famous bread and butter. French Onion Soup and Salad. He ordered some kind of steak and I got the prime rib and scallops! I ordered the prime rib medium rare - our server had to check to make sure they could still do that temp since it was late in the evening- they could! It came out perfectly cooked and delicious! I am obsessed with scallops as well and they were fantastic!  Hunnie Bunnie had grilled cheese accompanied by some GIANT broccoli! Great side instead of french fries.  Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Worst food and service. The 6 oz filet was flat and tasteless, presentation was terrible, blue cheese came out 10 minutes after the streak and was Terrible. Loaded baked potato came unloaded and we will never be back here. Plates we're not bussed and sodas we're not refilled.  Worst food and service , if you want steak do not come here, go someplace else."}
{"text":"We went to this location with my parents and were not disappointed. We recently had a not so awesome steak experience at Black Barts steakhouse in Flagstaff and this Outback steakhouse made me love steak again. Our server who happened to be the owners son was wonderful as well. Will def go back again!"}
{"text":"Food is good here but the staff could be a little more attentive and if they are going to allow servers to belt out songs and hoot and holler in the kitchen...   They should install doors."}
{"text":"Sarah L. Was a great server.  Grass fed burger was on point.  We will definitely come back, and hopefully we get the same server."}
{"text":"I love Outback, the steaks are great and a lot less pricey then the hotel steakhouses.  The wait staff, hostesses and management are awesome."}
{"text":"Me and my sister went here for the first time and we both ordered the steak and shrimp plate which was excellent we also ordered the flat bread appetizer which was outstanding and the service was outstanding we will be back to this location"}
{"text":"This is our second visit to this restaurant and both times have been sub par. This time, however, was much worse. Our server was very inattentive and even sat down with the table across from us to chat while our drinks were empty. Our food was brought out cold. The steamed broccoli had cold shredded cheese just thrown on top. The one thing our server did correct was volunteered to fix the food without us having to ask. A manager brought our food out and said she would be back to check on us. That didn't happen. We were also told the kitchen was out of baked potatoes (which we ordered) but yet baked potatoes were available for other tables. It took an extended amount of time to get an empty to go cup (which was forgotten the first time) and the check. Disappointed yet again. Probably won't be back for a third visit."}
{"text":"Haven't had the whole Bloomin Onion experience for a while, and it was a good way to start the gluttonous Gilbert Arizona restaurant fest.  Typical timeline: after fighting for a spot in an overfilled parking lot, push through the huge crowd standing (hardly enough seats) in the hot lobby to hear that it will take 30-40 minutes to be seated, then try to stay awake while sitting among people staring at the wall and kids running around.  Finally get seated and given cavernous Diet Cokes (standard) and bread (I forgot about their dark pumpernickle) and the inevitable deep fried onion, plus a few other things.  Taking so long to get the actual meal, the appetizers inevitably take up too much stomach space....finally the main meal, getting a second wind and scarfing it down with the 4th Diet Coke refill and toward the end feeling a strange distention in the abdomen that you try to ignore.  Got fish but yet still feel like I ate something covered in oil.  SInce it was 3 hours, passed on any giant desserts this time.   How do people do this more than every year?"}
{"text":"Oooooh, let's all point and laugh at Stefanie for reviewing a chain. Har Har! Yeah, I went to a chain and now I'm reviewing a chain. Suck it.  Why did I go to the Outback? Because I was with my in-laws. That should be enough explanation. I'll throw in a little something else though: eating anything besides fried bar food is highly exotic to them. There was almost no other choice. I was secretly pouting inside the entire time. Life is too short to eat at chains.   It wasn't entirely terrible. My food was at least edible. The steak was cooked a little bit longer than I would have liked but still, I ate it. The \"shrimp on the barbie\" was pretty blah. I do enjoy their bread. No bloomin' onion on that visit though. I wanted to be productive the next day.   Service wasn't too bad. I have a few gripes in that department though: I hate having to ask for a water refill or any kind of refill really. My water sat empty for quite awhile and I was getting parched. Server boy also forgot my son's drink altogether - but he brought it out and apologized profusely.   A few good things about the Outback though: they have a real, live gluten-free menu. Which, you know, is mostly the same stuff they already serve but it's seperate and offers handy dandy tips on what to avoid -- like certain sauces and dressings. Kinda nice, right?  Also, on children -- they have a kids menu and the server offered to bring my child's food out ASAP. That was really sweet of him because my kid's head was getting close to spinning around Linda Blair style. Props for that, mates.   That said, I could survive quite nicely without ever having to set foot into that rugged \"Australian\" joint again."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Henderson a  year ago I've been to this location about once a month.  I always sit at the bar.  I have to say that Shane is an outstanding bartender. He always acknowledges folks that sit, to let them know he'll be with them momentarily.  His pleasant attitude helps to make a nice relaxed atmosphere, which is what we're looking for, right?  My compliments to him."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today... I do not remember my servers name, but she was amazing. I did call to find out and the hostess believes her name to be Betty. I hope this reaches her.  I was not feeling well and was unable to eat my food. It had nothing to do with the food just how bad I felt. She was so sweet and accomadating. She made sure to send me home with everything boxed up and even got me soup. I appreciate it. It's not often you find such kind people these days. And she made my day better just by being so sweet. Thank you (Betty)"}
{"text":"Petite Fillet Mignon was delicious as was a taste of the lobster.  6 oz fillet was perfect."}
{"text":"Just don't do it.   I'm giving Outback 2 stars because the service was great. Our server was enthusiastic and friendly, answered any questions we had.  But the food? The prices? I don't understand how anyone can eat here wit these prices.  Luckily, we only ate there because my mom had gotten a $50 gift certificate, but I regret having ingested the food at all, free as it was.  For an appetizer, we got the famous Blooming Onion. It was SO salty. I've never had anything like it. The sauce is good, but my God, the next day I felt hungover from having eaten this mash of fried onions, breading, and salt.  I ordered the fried shrimp and fries.  The shrimp and fries were just like anything you can get at any diner or even Dairy Queen for around $6, except Outback Steakhouse shrimp and fries cost around $16.00.  The fries were very clearly frozen fries. The shrimp probably was too (it was't that good), so how on Earth can they justify charging more than 5 or 6 bucks? Madness.  My parents both order hamburgers (medium rare) with frozen fries.  Just like the shrimp and fries, their burgers were exorbitantly overpriced. Except, the quality was way worst than what you would find at your average diner. The patty was relatively small, way overcooked, and flavorless. I'm not sure if the buns were stale, or Outback just uses really low-quality bread for their buns.   My wife fared better than the rest of us. She just ordered some asparagus and a baked potato. Surprisingly, they didn't screw up the baked potato (although the skin was insanely salty, as expected).   So yeah, the food is bad, and way overpriced. Just don't do it.  There are so many great restaurants in the area that serve quality food at half the price. Don't give Outback your hard earned money for sub par food.   You deserve better."}
{"text":"Amazing service! We were a big party and I was dreading coming out as a big party and everything was amazing. Food was awesome and the service was just as good! Would recommend everyone I know to come out and experience it for themselves."}
{"text":"Waitress was wonderful. Food was good. Love their Dine reward program. Only concern is near the bar area it smelled like dirty mop water . As if  it was never changed."}
{"text":"Jason Bryd is the owner here and should be very proud. Food is always top notch. Love the ahi tuna. This is the only restaurant I enjoy going to... and only this location. My husband and I always sit at the bar because we love being taken care of by Adam the bartender. Adam is easy going and pays attention to details. Love Love Love the food and service here!!"}
{"text":"We travel a little over 20 miles to get to this Outback.  We love it!  The food is always great.  More than the great food, is the great service.  Everyone from the greeters and hostesses, to the wait staff and managers--we just love em all.  They are friendly, fun and inject some hilarious personality into every visit.  We seriously eat there at least once or twice a week!  Yes, there are no great places in the Copa. After working all day, who wants to cook? Not us.  We've had everything on the steak menu, the Tilapia w crab, Alice Springs Chicken-- we were even talked into getting the wedge salad w blue cheese.  Have ordered that ever since.  There are lots of places in that area for steak.  If you want great steak AND great service, and don't want to break the bank, give this Outback a visit.  And try the wedge salad."}
{"text":"Food was good, waiter wasn't personable or friendly. Asked if I wanted a refill when I still had food on my plate, one glass minimum I guess on dr peppers?"}
{"text":"The spicy shrimp was really good but blooming onion was ok. Fresh bread was so good. Staff will get 5 stars."}
{"text":"We went to the Happy Hour at Outback tonight and really enjoyed our meal and the very attentive service of it's wait staff.   The food was good, not great mind you but good. Hey, this isn't Morton's but it's a friendly staff wants your repeat business. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The bartender was extremely nice, I think her name is Lindsey. They were on a huge wait and everything was chaotic but she couldn't have been any better - very nice, great service and sweet. Thank you - not used to such nice service from bartenders with a full bar that's swamped."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here. I had a great experience. My server was attentive and the manager checked in to see if everything was okay. The food was very good. I prefer this restaurant over another steakhouse next door because it's a little more refined. No screaming happy birthday, ringing bells or breaking out in line dancing, if you know what I mean. Sometimes a quiet restaurant is nice so you can enjoy the company you're with. No more waiting around for the server to bring you your check as they have implemented a digital option with a tablet right at your table. Enjoyed and will dine here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Poor customer service..just walked out waited 20 minutes was told they were setting up our table but people kept walking in and got sat as we waited finally left for rustlers roost can fail there with service"}
{"text":"Jeff is the nicest and funniest server I have ever had at an outback steak house. He is super friendly and easy to talk to. I am gluten free and he quickly brought me a menu and some fresh fruit in substitute of bread. I will definitely be returning to this outback every time I visit vegas and only asking for Jeff."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a gift card and decided to use it up.  We had a wait so we sat at the bar for a drink.  We both like Moscow mules so we saw a drink with vodka, strawberries, lime, and their homemade ginger beer.  I would never order that again.  No ginger taste at all.  It tasted like lime and vodka.  We were seated and were served quickly.  The waitress was super nice and checked back often.  I ordered a steak and my wife salmon.  Both we good.  The steamed vegetables were barely steamed and more raw than cooked.  Overall an ok meal nothing great."}
{"text":"Awesome service at the bar. Really friendly bar staff. Fast service. Food was good, not great, but I'd go back."}
{"text":"Just wanna give a shout out to the waiter Dan for being an awesome employee! Nice guy!!! He earned his $20 tip"}
{"text":"I've always loved the outback and this one is my favorite location I always do curbside never go inside and our order has been wrong a couple times well over a year ago but they gave us a GC for there error and the next meal was on us. We go there often enough to be regulars."}
{"text":"1/16/2016 7:30pm  Having worked in the service industry in one fashion or another in the past twenty-eight years, I have become accustomed to tipping at least something no matter what. I can count on one hand how many times I have been disappointed to the point of not tipping. My wife on the other hand rarely tips more than more than five percent. Our visit Saturday night resulted in an hour and forty-two minute waste of time with the waiter receiving no tip on a fifty dollar and ten cent bill.   Being Saturday night, I realize that we would have to wait a short time due to how busy the restaurant was at the time. A thirty minute wait time was actually forty-two minutes, we were finally seated and handed menus. Almost ten minutes later, we had our waiter arrive, he did not introduce himself, and proceeded to ask what we would like to drink. Sensing that we probably would not be seeing our waiter anytime soon, we ordered our food with our drinks. We received our drinks, bread and salads but had to ask for silverware to eat our salads. Add in asking for refills on our drinks and bread while we waited for our entrees.   Not happy.   Finally got our entrees, my wife's hamburger was super greasy to the point that the bun and the toppings were falling out and her fries needed salt. As for my porterhouse steak and baked potato, the filet side of the steak was so tender but the strip steak part of it was as tough as shoe leather. The waiter did not even ask if I would like some type of steak sauce.   After one hour and forty-two minutes, I used a gift card that we had received at Christmas and paid the balance without leaving a tip for the first time in a handful of years. Probably will never go back unless we receive a gift card again. Will make sure to tell our family to get us a gift card to the Texas Roadhouse next time."}
{"text":"Sorry to say I felt like some others. You cannot go wrong with OUTBACK. But it did go wrong TWICE at this location. First time was Halloween ( my birthday). The filet ordered medium rare was RARE and bloody.. Sent it back politely. Waiter was not happy. And it was tough!   Last night with a friend for her birthday. I ordered the NY Strip medium she the rib eye medium well, another friend the Prime rib. All were more then chewy. They were tough. Even the Bloomin' Onion was over spiced. Marguerites were way way too strong and I am no whimp. Being I was treating my friend for her birthday I did not want to complain and neither did she. But when I asked her she said yep! Her steak and mine dry and very very chewy. What happened to Outback quality? It used to be consistently tender juicy steaks. Won't be going back at those prices. Our waiter was great. But don't have anything good to say about  the meats or the luke warm mashed potatoes.  Perhaps a different location would be better but for $66... For two... ( third friend paid her own way.) the Birthday dinner was very very disappointing. I brought home half the steak to cut up into tiny pieces for my dog! Good service. Disappointing food. !!!"}
{"text":"Our server Gloria was awesome. She was fast paced and knew exactly when our drinks were getting low. Very outgoing and funny!! We loved her."}
{"text":"Weak. The wife and I had some late dinner there on Saturday night, July 2, 2016. She had coconut shrimp and a Caesar salad. I ordered the large prime rib and a baked potato. Fully one half of my steak was completely fat or gristle...in other words not edible. We told the waitress and out comes the manager who listens to my complaint. Then he says, \"Ya, that was the last piece of prime rib left in the kitchen. How about if I deduct $5 from the bill ?\" Now, I have eaten steak in a lot of restaurants and that steak probably should never have even made it out to any table. What should have happened is the server should have come out and said that they were out of the prime, and I could have selected another cut of meat. And any respectable Steakhouse would have taken my steak completely off the bill, and not offered a measly $5 off the bill. Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"This will not be a happy ending for me. My husband had to send his steak back. I had to send my pork dish back it was very under cooked. I Did provide pictures of all the dishes We had. I'm doing this review as We wait on our cheese cake. Ugh the soup and chopped salad was great even the bread was good. But the last dish they are just falling on they face.  I came to eat! So the manger telling me my food is done but I don't want to eat it is such a dumb statement. She made me so angry I didn't even respond to that remark. I guess she thinks I'm at the mall yeah that's it...I came to buy shoes because noone in they right mind would come to a steakhouse and wonna eat.  It's like little mama look here as hungry as I am you not going to get my plate back because I'm as hungry as a hostage. You have the dish back ONLY because I don't wish to die eating from eating under cooked pork.  Oh as always I provided pictures u can see I spit out bits of under cooked meat...  No I don't think I will return. She was more into telling me how the dish is cooked how its so called slow cooked. Look I'm gonna tell it how it is...Its not my job to care how it cooked its my job to order, eat,  pay, and yelp...she made me so mad I took the picture just to show you all I spit the food out. This is the only picture Ive taken of its kind. To prove a point. Even a 3 year old knows that if someone spits out food its NOT good. Pffff! But they get 3 stars for the soup salad and bread."}
{"text":"This Outback is like every other Outback I have been to. They are always clean, food, drink and service is always excellent. However, until corporate America starts giving America what they advertise then they can live  with a less than perfect score. Case and point. The Unlimited Shrimp, should be renamed Unlimited Shrimp Shrimp. All the pictures they use are not what they serve. Smaller shrimp than shown in their advertising. They tried to make the fried and buffalo shrimp bigger by adding a thick breading. Yuk, I will go back for sure,but I will nto order their Unlimited specials anymore."}
{"text":"I like coming here. In fact I am considering it for my birthday. So far in recent years I have only gotten salads - which are good, but not nearly as great as a few other places I have gone to. For one, they aren't too flavorful with numerous accessories - and they lack a variety of dressings. Next time I will splurge and maybe get a hamburger - which I think will be much better!  The appetizers are delicious and the food is quality. It takes a while, but because it's so popular there! The customer service is so friendly and kind - maybe a too outgoing for my liking, but it's always great to have good service willing to make your experience perfect.   Of course it is a bit pricey, however, for special occasions I think this restaurant is a solid choice.  I might update or do a recent review if I go here soon again."}
{"text":"We have been to two Outbacks in the last ten years.  It's wasn't because the food was bad; it was just that the experience wasn't anything special.    We tried the Happy Hour once up at Mayo Boulevard location and left underwhelmed. Recently however we received two gift cards and decided to give them another try.    Outback has always reminded me of a slightly more upscale Sizzler, mainly because prices are so low.  Last night the three of us started off with Spinach Artichoke Dip for $7.99, Blooming Onions for $7.29 and the Coconut Shrimp for $7.99.  All these were pretty good, though the star was the Coconut Shrimp.  It was served with an orange marmalade/stone mustard sauce which was interesting, but we had to ask for some cocktail sauce in the end. The Blooming Onions on the other hand are still way too greasy for me and clearly they need to rethink this offering.  For our meal, we tried to order the Pork Chops.  But strangely, they had run out (?) this, so we had to substituted for the 1/2 order of Baby Back Ribs ($13.49). They were very good and had a nice smoky taste.    We also ordered the Filet with Shrimp for $15.99.  We ordered it medium rare and it came out with a pink center and very tender. But as Yelp'er Jody K pointed out in her review -- the shrimp were tiny and way too salty, with some sort of Cajun/blacken seasoning just dropped on top.  Our last dinner item was actually their Short Ribs Nacho appetizer for $6.99.  It had a nice taste and must be considered an incredible value.  So our tab came to $74.60, including a diet soft drink, a nice Château St Michelle Riesling, and one of their special Black Sangria. This also included a discount of 50% off one entree that we found on-line as we waited for our drinks to arrive. LOL"}
{"text":"Great place for family and great menu w good prices....friendly and courteous staff..."}
{"text":"The Blooming Onion is very good. I have urges when driving by one to stop for just the blooming onion with the its great sauce. Not interested in eating their steaks -- no real reason."}
{"text":"I work near this Outback and was just introduced to their curbside takeout. On nights I work late and have to pick up dinner this is a snap! PLUS with their 6oz sirloin with two sides for $9.95 who could go wrong?  The steaks are always really good and tender and well seasoned. I usually get a baked potato and salad with fat free tomato dressing and dont feel guilty about anything! My man likes a ceasar with fries, and you can get garlic mashed, sweet potato's or steamed veggies too.   Outback is now on our takeout rotation for being cheap, easy and most importantly- a good meal!"}
{"text":"Not worth it.  Got the full rack ribs and my wife the 1/2 they look exactly the same.  Why come here when there's some many more choices. Never again"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and it was terrible. Although the server was very friendly, they clearly do not know how to cook their steaks. Two of my family members and I all ordered medium rare steaks one came out medium well, one medium, and mine was completely rare. The manager did not care at all about customer satisfaction and was very sarcastic about the whole situation. He refused to doscount the meal and when asked to cook the rare steak a little more he brought out a well done steak. When I asked what rare and medium rare was to him he told me their the same color just rare is cold and medium rare is warm. I have worked in the restaurant business all my life and this way by far the worst manager I have ever seen. He obviously does not care about his customers at all."}
{"text":"I ordered the Filet Mignon dinner. The salad arrived with ranch dressing on it, the croutons were soggy and tasted awful. The sweet potato was loaded with butter to a point it didn't taste like a potato but taste like butter. The filet mignon was tolerable but the outside was coated with lots of spices which made it hard to taste the steak.   While ordering the waiter told me \"you can have a salad as a side\" instead of offering me choices which the menu indicated it came with a choice of 2 sides, which I didn't choose he just said \"sweet potato and salad\" and moved onto my husband to order.  I am not one to complain but this meal was really disappointing and I left still hungry. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I try to avoid chains when I travel 200 + days a year.  However I was tired and it was next door to my hotel the Hampton Inn.  Ate at the bar and had the wedge, 9 oz Sirloin with asparagus.  Perfect food and super perfect salad.  Maybe I should reconsider my chain ideas - but this one was excellent tonite."}
{"text":"Had the steak and unlimited shrimp. The crispy shrimp was very  delicious.  The breading was seasoned perfectly and shrimp itself was good. Tried the garlic butter scampi shrimp and  didn't care for it was to garlicky for my taste but don't take me wrong the shrimp was good. Server , Sandra W was very nice and quick with the shrimp reorders."}
{"text":"I often come to Outback with my coworkers because the service is usually pretty fast.  We get the blooming onion (which is a must) and I order the prime rib sandwich with the sweet potato. The sweet potato is always delicious but I will try a different meat in the future because the meat is sliced thicker than expected and I feel its difficult to eat. The salad never fells me though."}
{"text":"Unlimited shrimp was YUM. But chef was getting mad that we were eating SO MUCH SHRIMP so they started giving us less shrimp per new plate."}
{"text":"We loved the new design that Outback Steakhouse has with this particular location. This is a larger Outback Restaurant, and it's amazing that they found space for it in the Concord Mills parking lot. We are glad they did though. It's a nice lunch or dinner option.  The staff at this location are friendly, but very busy, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. The food is delicious, and we liked the televisions in the bar area.   Just keep in mind that this location is in the Concord Mills Mall parking lot near Books-a-Million, and parking is difficult to find right outside the restaurant during busier times like weekends. It's a great place though."}
{"text":"Veronica R our server was fantastic! You can tell she loves what she does! What a great asset to the restaurant, so personable and knowledgeable about  the menu Items. The food was very good. Steaks cooked to perfection and we were even able to order a dish no longer on the menu that we love (Mums Chopped Steak). If we lived here we would be regulars.  Make this a place on you dinner list for sure!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing, to say the least. After doing call ahead seating at 7:30 on a Saturday night, we were not seated for nearly half an hour even though the left dining room was completely empty.   The food quality was fine, with the exception of the celery that accompanied our appetizer of wings. The celery was old and wilted and at least two pieces were soft and brown.  Service was slow, but our server was a nice enough guy. He didn't seem too familiar with the menu, though, so he might have been newer.  Regardless, when my mother's steak salad came out with the wrong temperature of steak on it, we sent it back. We then proceeded to wait for a very long time for a new, medium rare, piece of meat. Her salad was nearly 3/4 eaten by the time the new steak arrived.  When we spoke to the manager (whom we later found out is the proprietor of this location), she merely made excuses for being seated so late and continued to argue with my mother about this matter. At least she did agree that sitting among a table full of dirty appetizer/salad/soup dishes for the duration of our meal was unacceptable.   Nowhere during this conversation did she ask how she could make the situation right or really attempt to apologize for our poor experience. I had enough of the excuse-making and reminded her that we came to the restaurant at prime time on a weekend night, when staff should have been at full capacity and ready for the dinner rush. I also told her that we wouldn't be back. She didn't have much to say after that. But she did come back ten minutes later with adjustments made to our checks and two ten dollar gift cards for my parents. We still won't be back.  This was our final chance for this location. We had an even worse experience when I took my husband here for his birthday in March.  Full disclosure: I worked at this Outback probably 13 years ago. My Saturday nights were far busier, with at least 3 deep at the bar, and with far fewer table visits made by management. The food was always top quality and made fresh daily, and we servers took a lot of pride in making our customers happy. If a customer did have a bad experience, we went above and beyond to make it right. It seems like Outback has become just another mediocre restaurant among a sea of mediocre chains. If you're still looking for the old \"No Rules, Just Right\" philosophy, keep looking. You'll certainly not find it at the North Hills Outback."}
{"text":"The free bread they bring you is just o.k. but at least it's something. The famous onion app. is fun to share. I love the salads and steaks are pretty good too as long as you know you will get what you pay for. Outback special is tasty but it doesn't compare to the filet or even the rib-eye. My only real complaint is this all you can eat shrimp deal they have going. The shrimp are terrible. They are clearly frozen and the breading on the fried shrimp constitutes about 50% of the shrimp's mass. The buffalo shrimp are just the fried shrimp with buffalo sauce poured on top. Really Outback? This is below your usual standards. If you need to charge more to have real shrimp than do so. Other than that, a good experience."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. We went on January first for dinner, the place was not full, the meat was not so good, they did not have any Malbec, unbelievable. Then I asked the lady not to put any slat of dressings in my food because I have a medical condition, well the potatoes had lots of salt , we were so tired did not say anything, but we will not return. The person making cocktails did not know or they use the worst possible , we asked for a Martini because they did not have any Malbec to go with our meat, horrible martini the worst we ever had."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We called ahead, were told it would be 15 minutes but didn't get seated until 45 minutes after we arrived.  The staff was very disorganized and our food took a long time to come out."}
{"text":"This was my first time at outback, and I was pretty impressed. I had a 12oz outback signature sirloin and it was very good, cooked a perfect medium rare and nicely seasoned. The garlic mashed potatoes and Cesar salad were delicious as well. The service was just OK, the staff was friendly but took a long time to come by for drinks and stuff. Overall, it was very tasty, if a bit pricey."}
{"text":"An old classic that I have been visiting since it was built.  I just found out, they do have a gluten free menu... but have a regular one with you so you can actually see prices.    Why do they make gluten free menus that don't have prices on them? I'm sorry, but no, I will not pay ANYTHING for a gluten free meal.  If your steak is $20, then yes, I'm likely to get a salad or chicken.   Sorry. Went off on a tangent there... this is not the only chain that does this and it aggravates me.  Steaks are awesome... they never change.  I always just get the 10oz New York Strip medium rare... and got it with the mixed veggies, which incidentally, goes great in the juice left behind from your steak, since us celiacs cannot have the veggie seasoning.  Service has never been a problem here.  I had a margarita which was super duper sweet.  Hardly tasted the tequila... and it wasn't strong at all."}
{"text":"Food was good except our salmon was burnt manager fixed the problem and took it off the bill and bought us dessert. Good service."}
{"text":"Being a long time fan of Outback, I decided to try it for lunch.  Not such a great idea, as it turns out.  They offer unlimited soup and salad, for $7.99 and a few selected other items that can be paired with soup or salad. Bottom line, you are nickel and dimmed to death.  If you want a Wedge Salad (as opposed to a House or Caeser Salad), it costs $1.00 more; if you want French Onion Soup (as opposed to Baked Potato Soup), it will cost you a $1.00 more; if you want cheese on your burger, it will cost you a $1.00 more.  These extra charges were annoying and seemed unnecessary.     The Caeser Salad had way too much dressing, the Baked Potato Soup was way too salty and the Outback burger was way too dry (maybe I should have paid the extra buck and got cheese!).   I will stick to dinner at Outback, from now on."}
{"text":"The Short:  The McDonalds equivalent of steakhouses continues its steady decline into obscurity with its dedication to inept customer service and poor food quality.   The Pros: - Affordable - Nice ambience - Functioning bathrooms?   The Cons: - Orders continually brought out wrong - Have been incorrectly billed twice then treated like an annoyance for bringing it up - Food consistently comes out cold - Have had entire meals forgotten in take-out twice  - Condiments and dipping sauces come out in such small portions you'd think there's a serious shortage of honey-mustard sauce    The Big Picture: What is up with customer service in Phoenix? We're better than this as a city. Heck, we're better than this as a species. Put some pride in your work!"}
{"text":"I know that some chain restaurants can be hit and miss, but this specific Outback always treats us right.   The Victoria fillet with horseradish is always my favorite, and it always is just the right amount.  And I can't say enough about the hot, fresh, brown bread - in fact, that's what usually makes me want to come in.  Our server was friendly and professional, and we got the Chocolate Thunder for dessert, and YUM! Keven isn't a huge chocolate fan, and I thought he was gonna start fighting me over the desert (not really, he's a super generous sweetie!)"}
{"text":"Hubby was craving steak so we decided to check this out since it was on the strip & it was much more reasonably priced than other steak restaurants on the strip.  Service was friendly & quick from the hostess, to our server, to random employees thanking us or saying bye as we left.  Food was good & portions was HUGE ... I couldn't finish my food but tried so hard since it tasted so good.   To start we tried Aussie fries ... basically fries topped with melted shredded cheese & it comes with a side of ranch sauce. It was sooo good with the ranch. For entrees we ordered a prime ribeye med well & a med rare centre cut sirloin. I added a lobster & mushroom sauce to the sirloin which was a bit salty & contained some lobster shells. The steaks however were cooked to perfection... in future I'd get the steak without the topping to enjoy the steak flavor more. Each steak came with 2 sides (no need to pay extra for side like all other steak restaurants on the strip)... we got mashed potatoes & caesar salad. Both great.  Very filling but satisfying meal with a great price point. Bonus is that they're open till 1am!"}
{"text":"got there early to try and beat the Friday rush. We were seated immediately and the server came right over to take our order. We ordered the Blooming Onion, as we usually do when  we are at Outback. It came almost right away, but my daughter asked for ranch, and that took almost 5 minutes to get. The waitress was very accommodating but ssloooooow. Now I know everyone comes here for the steak, but I always get the coconut shrimp. Simply the best!!"}
{"text":"Worst steak I have ever had in my entire life! The sauce was good. My gf or I didn't even finish half of what we ordered.   They get 1 star because the service was good  They get 1 star because if I didn't have a hair in my macaroni I would have eaten it."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Of course, the wedge salad is all that and a bag of chips.  It's a great restaurant and the service I believe is above average.  If they had excellent service, I would have given 5-stars."}
{"text":"Good lunch combination for lunch they have a 7.99 deal up to 9.99 deal which you can chose from a soup or salad then a meal. Decided to get the house salad with balsamic vinaigrette and a hamburger. The burger was cooked perfectly a little bit more medium rare then medium. Also keep in mind no side comes with burger. Decided to get a sweet potato on side which was just ok. Cool lunch deal"}
{"text":"Their food is always good. However every time I order food online and get the blooming petals I always select no bloom sauce and put just ranch and they always give me bloom sauce and no ranch. Isn't it their job to check the food before sending it out? This has happened to me the past 4 times I've ordered to go."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want to eat a steak, bake potato, mushrooms while enjoying a scotch and water without having to pay a lot. This place works for that. Sat in bar, bartender friendly nice woman. Nothing fancy, no loud music just what I wanted. Ryan the server was very friendly and checked on me as did the bartender."}
{"text":"Steak was under cooked, staff was slow, and to top it off, we hear the manager arguing loudly with the elderly couple across from us about how they didn't know what medium was. So what you're telling me is we ordered two steaks cooked the same way and we're complaining about the wrong one? The one we think is good is actually over cooked?...."}
{"text":"After our experience last night, I doubt I will return to this place - even with the $20 gift card we received.   The food was questionable.  The atmosphere was almost funeral home quiet on a Saturday night at 9pm.  The service was barely mediocre.  I rarely complain if things aren't a big issue but we had the manager at our table TWICE.   First, I will say that they sat my 3some promptly.  But I had to ask to have them remove a chair so we could slide mom's walker under the table so it wasn't in the way.   We ordered the Outback Sampler platter for appetizers.  2 drinks later, it arrived.  I wish I took pics.  It was anorexic in size.  About 1 cup of blooming onion bits, 1 c. of smothered fries, and 6 mac and cheese bites.  I will say the mac and cheese bites were amazing!  While we were sitting there conversing and enjoying our drinks, we watched two tables right next to us have the manager called for various reasons which we didn't really pay attention to.  We learned that they were training new servers.  I believe ours was a 3rd newbie.  Because when I asked my server if mom's lemonade was \"bottomless\", she didn't understand.  I asked if we could get a refill and she said, \"I hope this one is better\" when she brought it out.  My boyfriend ordered the prime rib medium rare.  1/3 of it was nothing but GRISTLE. (again, wish I snapped a pic of the bit he cut around to prove it.) For a steak place, we were a little appalled.   We asked the waitress to talk to the manager about it.  When she came back after removing the dish, she said she forgot and had already disposed of the pile of gristly - she still hadn't mentioned it to the manager much less showed him the pile of nasty.  The BF said the steak was done well other than it was a bad cut when the manager did arrive at the table.  We have ordered prime rib at a lot of places in the area and never had that much gristle in a steak.  My steak salad had a lot of orange tipped salad pieces.  Like they had been cut with a metal knife and left too long.  Not extremely appealing.  Mom's shrimp was excellent.   We ordered deserts and it took almost a full half hour, during which, we never saw our waitress.  We finally asked one of the other newbies if she could check on our desserts.  We were told twice they were working on them after that.  Once the waitress even refilled mom's drink but didn't acknowledge my empty glass until the she brought mom's new drink. Dessert was the best part of the meal.  Salted caramel cheesecake for the BF.  I got the Trio.  Nom.  Mom got the apple pie.  After they were delivered, the manager came over the 2nd time and proffered us the gift card for the long wait -- that there had been an issue in processing our order.  When we left at 10:15pm, no one was around at the door or near our table.  We just walked out after a not so great experience.  We have no plans to return."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this Outback several times a week for years. It is always a good experience. Everyone is prompt, friendly and the food is great. I've been to enough Outbacks to know that they are not all the same. This is the best one I've ever been to.   My son and I went to the Palm last week and had a $50 steak & lobster meal and the next day we had a similar meal at the Outback for $15. The steak was almost as good and the lobster tail was actually better!   There is a delicious chop steak that is not on the menu, but available if you ask. It comes with mushrooms and a wine sauce and mashed potatoes. I prefer it plain with a baked potato.  I'd highly recommend this Outback to anyone wanting a good meal at a very fair price!"}
{"text":"Very strange dining experience. The waitress was friendly but many items we ordered were incorrect. My husbands steak came out over cooked - they politely remade it and it was still overdone but not as much so we said nothing. We came home with lots of leftovers since she delivered food we didn't orders then later brought out the correct items. Quality and flavor was good."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love this place.  This is a great choice if you are watching your carbs and/or portions.  I can get a great 6oz steak with two sides for $9.99.  The portion and the price are perfect.  Add a $3 glass of house wine and its even better.  I think the steak is best if you ask them to leave off all of the seasoning and have it wood fired.  I also like their skinny margarita, which is super yummy!  The only drawback is that if you get there too late there is always a long wait.  Also they are not open for lunch, or I'd probably eat there more often."}
{"text":"I ordered the 9 oz sirloin which I have ordered many times in the past however has time when I got it it was so ridiculously spicy I could not eat it, I also ordered mac and cheese and it also is really spicy who makes mac and cheese hot? Any way I sent my steak back and by the time I got it the rest of my party was done eating, and this time there was no season not even salt on it I mean come on.  I didn't eat it and I also didn't get a discount or a free desert nothing for having to sit and watch others eat while my steak, which btw is absolutely not mentioned on the menu that the steak or Mac and cheese was spicy. The salad was great so there is that. We had to ask several times for more bread and refills on drinks. Just all around not great and definitely not satisfied."}
{"text":"Consistent food and service here. If you do experience a problem, though, Geoff the proprietor is spot-on for resolving issues and making his customers happy."}
{"text":"A little expensive for the quality/quantity, but good overall. Me and my GF both had steak, mine with lobster and it was cooked perfectly, but not really seasoned enough. The wait staff was EXCELLENT. My glass was never empty and I was checked on like 10 times. This would be a 5 star review if the $4 bloom petals didnt seem like the burnt scraps they fished out of the fryer or the steaks had some kind of garnesh besides just meat and potatoe on a plate... presentatiom is everything guys, get with the program."}
{"text":"Why doesn't the Outback have some good yeast Rolls instead of the brown bread, also the shrimp on the Barbie seems high priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Got 2 Lobster tails last night and they were stringy and almost undercooked as I told them not to overcook them like before. The Sahara Location is much better so I need to quit giving this one a try. Almost made me feel sick."}
{"text":"Okay.. so my boyfriend and I went to Vegas. This was our first trip out of town together in the year we'd been dating. I learned on this trip that while he's adventurous in deciding just a day before to take a trip to Vegas, he's not the same when it comes to dining out. He could eat at Denny's every time you ask him where he wants to go. I wasn't surprised that he picked an Outback Steakhouse for lunch (chain places being his \"thing\"). We hadn't meant to end up here, but we did.   We were seated quickly and a tall young man with blond hair was our server. At first, we thought he was friendly and really good at customer service. He struck up a conversation with us and asked us lots of questions we thought were just him making small talk (\"Where are you guys from?\" \"What made you come to Vegas?\" \"What do you plan to do today?\" \"Where are you staying?\" etc). There wound up being a problem with my meal. On their menu, I didn't notice that the pasta I ordered came with green onions (I haaate onions--probably the grossest thing I can think of eating, honestly).   Being that I'm a vegetarian, there wasn't much else I could choose from (aside from the calorie murder I could act out by eating their cheese fries, without  bacon). I know there's \"Steakhouse\" in the name, so why'd I come here? I'm still wondering about that.   The manager took the $16 pasta away and replaced it with an onion free one. Then, when the bill came, we noticed we were only charged $2.95 for the dish. That was really good customer service on her part.  Now, here's where they lose two more stars (one for the food situation).. we went to the Bodies Exhibit at the Luxor hours later. We'd told the waiter about this earlier at lunch. Well, I noticed someone following us through the exhibit until we got to a part where they'd sectioned off brains. As I was leaning in to get a closer look I noticed the guy staring at me. My boyfriend pointed out it was the waiter from earlier that day. It was just  very strange and gave me the creeps. We'd given him the name of our hotel, told him where we were from, etc. And there he was. Just creepy."}
{"text":"I decided to run a blog as we wait for our food.  Here we go:  Ordered drinks.  Twenty mins later they arrived ... without lemons.  Asked for them. Server said she'd get some.  Waited another twenty.  Finally went to the bar to find lemons myself.  Bread arrived 15 mins later.  Asked for refill of drink.  Took a full 10 mins.  No refills for the rest of the night.  Nearly 1hr later, our food arrived.   - without silverware.  Steak overdone.  WAY overdone.  But, shrimp was REALLY good.  :-)  We were told that the kitchen was running behind.   I guess drinks and lemons come from the kitchen at this location.  Manager was nice, that's why I'm increasing the stars.  Hopefully, people will read this review, however."}
{"text":"This steak house sucks. They sat me and my family at the waiting area for 30 minutes and they had seats open but no waiter. So lazy, dumb way to run a Business. The servers were jerks, I just walked over to bricks pizza just finished it was so good!"}
{"text":"I love chicken on the barbie and alice springs chicken. Service is fast enough and staff are friendly. I like how it's also kid-friendly. I love the bread they serve while waiting for your order. I never tire eating here. I love it!"}
{"text":"I've eaten in almost every Outback in metro area and this location is by far the nicest. There interior is just nicer, more upscale than even the North Scottsdale location. I will admit their bar area and seating next to it is a bit confusing. I sat next to the bar thinking it was part of the bar and didn't get noticed by a server for close to 15 minutes. When I was getting close to just leaving and going elsewhere, a nice server came over to help me.  My food was good, but the service ended up being even better. The manager (a woman whose name escapes me) came over several times to check on me. I think she could see I'd had a bad day.  I really appreciated her kindness.  I'll be back. I have to - their balsamic glaze is ADDICTIVE. Sometimes I will just crave the taste of it out of the blue and then be forced to go there to satisfy it!"}
{"text":"Alas, I was unable to join my wonderful hubby on his business trip so he had to dine alone. We are not familiar with with the area (being from the Left Coast) so I turned to my tried and true Yelper friends.   This restaurant is not far from the Pittsburgh Int'l Airport and easy to find so I directed him to Outback as it has not disappointed in the past.  DH ordered the Shrimp/Scallops/Mahi Medley, with steamed brown rice and veggies on the side..   DH loved the Medley, stating it was excellent.  (He's an honest man so I have to believe what he said.)  Everything was served separately on the plate (thank goodness, since DH and Monk have much in common). The fishy items were all grilled with tasty remoulade on the side. All were fresh and cooked perfectly.    [Hang on; my mouth is watering as I type this.]   There was a good variety of veggies (carrots, brocolli, snow peas and more), also cooked perfectly.  The steamed rice was very good, too.  The little bread loaves were excellent as usual.  He even ate two, they were so good.  His server was friendly and attentive, which he appreciated.  The decor is very nice and the restaurant and the mens room were all clean.  (I'll take his word on that last one, too.)  It was much better than he expected with it being next door to a Super Kmart. Plenty of parking and not too crowded for a Monday night.  He was seated right away.  He says he looks forward to eating there again.   I'm just glad he's happy since it was my idea for him to eat there!  (c:  [Be glad I'm writing this review; DH said he would have written, \"I ate, I burped, I left.  Gotta love this guy!  I'm blessed!]"}
{"text":"The manager saved the day here for us, so we decided to give them 3 stars.  If it wasn't for him, it would've been lower.  We arrived at this restaurant at 5pm on a Friday evening, and the restaurant was more than half empty.  We were told there would be a 10 minute wait because all of the wait staff for the night had not arrived yet.  No problem there.  30 minutes later, we were still waiting and they were seating people that had come in after us.  I approached the podium, and asked why we hadn't been seated, and it turns out the host never entered us or our pager number into the system.  The manager was embarrassed that this had happened, he sat us right away and got us a complimentary appetizer.    The waitress was very nice and started out good. We ordered our meal, and she refilled waters. She ran out of water in her pitcher and my daughter's didn't get filled.  She didn't come back with a full one until much later.  Our soup arrived late, and our meals came right in top of it.  My son's fries didn't arrive until after he was done with his entree, and was delivered by the manager.  The food was fantastic, though.   It's clear that this location has some issues, but I'm glad that the manager is doing his best to stay on top of things."}
{"text":"over priced and not in the same league as texas roadhouse .  Don't plan on going here any time soon again."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is always very friendly here so that is worth 2 stars alone.  I always order the blooming onion, but with ranch because the sauce is so gross.  I ordered a filet on my previous trip and it was so tough I ended up taking it home to my dog (which he thanks you for OUTBACK!!)  So I tried a different kind of steak this time and it wasn't too bad, but again, I only had a few bites.  I will continue to come here (only when friends insist) because of the bread!  A few cocktails, onion bloom, and the bread.  I don't want to waste my money on entrees anymore.  But its not terrible...my dog loves it ;)"}
{"text":"Recently they changed the interior, making it more trendy.  With this change came a change in plate size (much smaller) and a decrease in portion size and quality.  They are reaching the point where quality and portion size aren't worth the money.  Stick with the Outback Special, the only good value that remains."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the bleu cheese vinaigrette dressing there. Can't find it in stores anywhere. So periodically I will go there for a salad. 2 times ago, a girl took my to-go order, average service, and when I got home the \"extra\" dressing I asked for consisted of 2 small cups that were barely half full. Super disappointed being that was the whole reason I went. However, the last visit a guy was working and I told him about my previous experience, not only was he super friendly, he made sure I had what I asked for.  And then some. I got bread, he brought it out to my car, and I even had some dressing leftover. I pulled out with a huge smile and definitely felt it was worthy of a good review."}
{"text":"OK but nothing to write home about. Beer was cold (if overpriced) and food (appetizers & dinner food) was acceptable if overcooked. The food is definitely overpriced. We may go back sometime in the next year - maybe."}
{"text":"Family dinner at 6:30pm with a party of 6, 15 minute wait and seated quickly. We started with a few drinks; water, perfect margaritas and a glass of moscato.   For an appetizer we got the blooming onion with ranch and the spicy dipping sauce it comes with 4/5. Some wheat bread loaves with butter were delivered and quickly devoured.  We ordered our entree's and began chatting. Before we knew it they brought out the salads and shortly after the our meals which included a 6oz filet and 5oz lobster tail 5/5, 12oz New York strip 5/5, 12 breaded shrimp with fries 4/5, garlic filet medallions with garlic mash potatoes 5/5, chicken on the barbie with steamed veggies 5/5 and an appetizer platter with Aussie cheese fries topped with bacon, mac and cheese bites and deep fried mushrooms 4/5.   Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals and to top it off they brought out a birthday sundae and sang to my mum and her friend (2 birthday ladies). Laura B was a good server and was attentive to our needs 5/5.   When the check came I inquired about military discount which they said is seasonal and not given all of the time. However, they do give 10% to AARP members, thanks mum ;-)"}
{"text":"No stars! Nasty! Ordered a burger medium well it came out rare. I cut it in half, and took a bite. It was sent back. When returned to me, it was well done glued back together my original burger with more cheese melted over all pieces. What!"}
{"text":"Salty steak and greasy chicken for far too much money?  Limp salads with gross 'custom' dressings?  No thanks!  I'm not a big fan of the Outback, as you can see.  I don't like the way the server crouches down to take your order and I'm not a big fan of rolling my potatoes in giant rocks of salt.  Someone with a definite sugar deficiency creates their salad dressings, and one of their chicken alternatives (the Alice Springs Chicken, I believe) comes coated not only in bacon and cheese, but far too much of it and I think with a side of extra grease.  I would just be wary of any restaurant that charges you $20 for a steak AND shows football."}
{"text":"In the realm of steak restaurants, Outback has its place somewhere in the middle.  With that in mind, I give it four stars purely on a value basis.  Proportional to the cost of the meal, it's pretty good.  You will never mistake it for one of the many great steak houses in town, but at about 1/2 - 1/3 the price, you should be satisfied with what you got.  Its positioning across from the Galaxy Luxury+ Theatre has surely boosted business (true for all eateries around there), so make sure to give yourself a couple of hours lead time if you're planning on seeing an evening movie.  In terms of value oriented steak restaurants Outback is just a notch under Billy Bob's."}
{"text":"I noticed a number of negative reviews from other people but came to Outback anyway. My husband and I were both happy with our meals. I opted for the 6 oz sirloin with coconut shrimp. I order my steak rare. This was prepared medium rare, but I would expect that from similar caliber restaurants (I wouldn't mark down the rating for that). If you are a stickler about your steak temperature, you might want to start with a degree under. The happy hour drinks are a good price ($5) and a reasonable variety. The menu lists then as 4-6 pm every day and they did honor this on Saturday. My husband had the Alice chicken with coconut shrimp. He thought it was very tasty. There were comments about the pepper glaze. My steak did have a pepper topping. It was not overpowering or overdone. If you are not sure about pepper, ask them to reduce the amount. Overall, we had good service, a good meal for a good price and the food we received matched what we ordered."}
{"text":"Very good service. Friendly, timely, and attentive. My steak was prepared perfectly and had lots of flavor. The asparagus was prepared the way I requested and seasoned to my request. My salad was very fresh.  No chocolate thunder from down under, but I'm sure it would have been delicious also.  Great job to the team."}
{"text":"We got a gift card to this place and decided to see what it was all about.  Right off the bat, the waiter got our drinks wrong. It really was not a huge deal, but the fact that he was not writing anything down just made me hesitant of him. Surprisingly, he got the appetizer and food order right. Ok fine.  The flavors and seasoning were ok, but the food was not really hot, just sort of warm. Meh. The French fries we sort of soggy, like high school or cafeteria fries or something.  Parking was easy. The temperature inside was comfortable. The place was clean and well lit. The staff was friendly.  The only reason they even get their 2 stars is because they were playing the NHL All Star game right in front of me. AWESOME.  The food really though was the determining factor. For the prices they charge you really would expect better quality. I really am not interested in returning."}
{"text":"I love Outback! With that being said I am not sure why I don't come here more often. I've participated of a Yelp Event when Outback was releasing their new menu items and got a 20$ gift card, so I decided to go back to spend it. I ordered a 3 sampler plate for appetizer with Mac n cheese fried balls, loaded French fries with cheese and bacon and blooming onions petals. I can assure you that if you order this appetizer you will not regret! Everything was so delicious that I can't even pick a favorite. For me entree I ordered a steak salad, the salad was delicious and my steak cooked to perfect!  The restaurant was kind of busy but not crowded. The appetizer came fast, however the entree took a little longer. However, the staff did a great job and kept us informed about everything was going on with the food. I highly recommend this place not only because of the great food but because of the great service."}
{"text":"Always a great time when we come get dinner.  My wife and I split a steak, sit talk and enjoy some dessert !!  Totally always worth the wait here !!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the busiest Outback in the world!  I wandered into this place around 11:30pm Sunday night craving some cheese fries. The super friendly waiter laughed at me, and explained that their cheese fries just won an award as the unhealthiest food in America.   That did not deter me. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Great price and food is always good.   I am a fan of the new wood grill style. Chop salad is my fav."}
{"text":"Stay away.  But if you must come then Order maybe 2 days ahead of time and when you come in you may only have to wait for the food you ordered ahead of time an hr. It will come cold and gross. Management does not care as you can twl that is why staff doesn't care   Can't wait to remove myself and never return to this place they actually call a restaurant.  Hey we actually think we are on the new candid camera. Ok update asked for blue cheese still waiting the manager laughed about it saying it was on the shelf in the kitchen. Asked for more water they brought us 1 glass to share     Eeek"}
{"text":"Went in for a late night meal.  Atmosphere is nice.  Food was not so great. Ordered the 10oz ribeye...nothing special on it.  It was like eating a salt lick  Way overspiced and although it was juicy it was just too much.  They are supposed to be known for steaks, but this one was not good."}
{"text":"Outback is always a great choice when you have a large family that you want to take out to dinner. The food is consistently good. It's not great, but it's good. My kids used to love the mac and cheese but I think they've changed the recipe and it's not as good as it used to be. It's bland and lacks really any flavor. There are still lots of great choices and good appetizers. The service is generally pretty good. They're always willing to fix anything that's wrong as long as you can find somebody who isn't too busy to help you. And the servers are generally attentive, well mannered, and upbeat. If you go after 6 p.m. you're probably going to have to wait as its always busy. Overall it's a place that we go over and over again and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I love the bloomin' onion but without that I'm not sure I would ever choose to go to outback. The service is good the food is average. The cuts of the steak are weird (we couldn't differentiate between a filet and a sirloin except for the price we were charged). Not a bad place to go but there are better places for around the same price if not cheaper."}
{"text":"Good solid dinner.  The seasoning on the steak is awesome and I love the salted baked potatoes."}
{"text":"I have been to this Outback several times.  It's not very good.  It's simple:  they WAY overcook my steaks.  Over and over.  It's funny, because this is the place that has PHOTOGRAPHS of steaks, showing what \"medium rare\" and \"medium\" will really look like!  And when I say \"medium\" to the server, he/she will say back \"now that's a warm, pink center,\" just to confirm.  \"Yes,\" I say.  ...Then it comes out well done, brown, tough, dry, and without a trace of pinkness.  So the salads are good, the little loaves of bread are good, the occasional \"bloomin onion\" is nice.  But this is a steak place, and you've GOT to get the steaks right."}
{"text":"It's okay.  I assume you know the menu and the layout, so I will skip that.  Service here is very good.  It's a very standard Outback.  Here's the problem:  They consistently OVERCOOK their steaks.  They have a \"Temp Guide\" in their menu with photos of cross-sections of beef, showing how cooked each level is.  How can they miss it?  But they consistently overcook by about 1.5 steps.  Yes, my Medium (slight red center, mostly pink, see their own photo) comes out medium well.  This is a steakhouse, so this is a failure."}
{"text":"Wife and I had not been to an Outback in a while but we were given a gift card and had a discount coupon so thought we would give it another chance. First, the positives were the host sat us quickly, the waitress, Jessica, was excellent, very friendly and attentive, the bread was very good, the salad was good, and the baked potato was also good. Obviously Outback is advertised as a steakhouse, but unfortunately this is where they fall short. My wife ordered the ribeye and it was very thin, no fat to speak of and over cooked so dry, literally no juice or flavor. I ordered the sirloin and shrimp and my steak also was tough like leather, overlooked obviously, and tasteless. We both had to dump on A1 sauce to make eatable. The shrimp really did not have a nice flavor and they were cold. Went to share with wife and she gave them back to me. Not a good sign. If you label yourself a steakhouse you damn sure should make sure you know how to cook steaks. They are a good place for drinks, the onion, a burger or ribs, but please do not order the steaks. Again, Jessica was wonderful so our compliments to her."}
{"text":"Well I never had a bad eating experience at any outback restaurant, including this one. Me and my friend had the steak and it was cooked spot on. Got here late in the day but it was still busy. The waitress was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Can't rate the food since we didn't get to eat. Walked in, gave them the total # in our party which was 11 people, and the hostess looked at me like I was crazy. Didn't smile, just stared at me like she was irritated.. Then she repeats me & I say yes, 11. Then she says, \"well it'll be about an hour wait.. I already have a party of 18 waiting plus a party of 15 waiting that's already here.\" WTF?!?? I asked my husband what he wanted to do and he said lets just go. As we were walking out another worker came up and asked her about it & she repeated the same thing again (mind you, there was nobody in the waiting area besides us) and we walked out. She never smiled once, didn't greet us, nothing. So I tell my daughter I was going to Yelp this because of how the hostess was.. Low and behold, I see that they close at 10pm which, according to Yelp was 56 minutes away. That's more than likely why she didn't even want to seat us or bother with us, because they were closing at 10pm. But can I at least get a smile, a, hi how are you guys, some thing before you show us off.. I can't rate the food, the rest of that staff, but your hostess that we interacted with... Needs some customer service classes... Too bad I didn't get her name."}
{"text":"was on this side of town and called in to grab some famous brown bread and grab a nice juicy outback special steak.   Shawn D made our experience excellent he made us feel at home and was speedy with everything, I was impressed to hear him roll everything off the menu without a pause to think. Well recommended."}
{"text":"Had the prime rib and blooming onion. Everything was great. The service was awesome and the restaurant was very nice.  The only thing I can say is the next morning my stomach was not feeling so good. My wife had the same problem. It might have been the blooming onion because we're not used to eating that much onion. I still like it there though and I'll proly just steer away from the onion"}
{"text":"First, let me say that I do love Outback and think that it's one of the best places in Surprise to enjoy a good steak but....  I guess that even the good places can have a bad day; a very bad day especially if you get stuck with the worse waiter in restaurant history.  Yesterday, April 19th was a bad day for Outback.  Our party of 7 called ahead for seating (I have Outback listed in my contacts because I go there pretty often) and were seated in a reasonable amount of time and then we sat and sat and sat till finally our waiter finally showed up.  We ordered appetizers and drinks and after another LONG wait, our drinks and snacks arrived and then, he disappeared again!   Honestly, he seemed confused & not familiar with the menu (he took the menu from my wife to see if what she was ordering was actually on the menu).  Eventually he did come back, spilled some water on the table and took our order - as I said, he didn't seem to be the least bit familiar with the menu and later, my suspicions were confirmed when my cold overcooked tough steak showed up - it wasn't the cut that I ordered.  I mean, how hard is it to order a Filet Mignon?   Anyway, after we ordered and eventually finished the appetizers and drinks we keep waiting and waiting and waiting for our food or at least maybe a refill of our drinks but that wasn't going to happen.  Some in our party got their dinner salads they ordered, some didn't but we couldn't ask about the undelivered food because again, there was NO followup service and when he disappeared, he really disappeared!  After another long wait, a really long wait with empty drink glasses all around, our food was delivered - cold.  Really, I guess the long wait was because someone forgot to bring the food to the table because it was obvious that the plates were just left sitting somewhere, God knows where.  Again, no followup service to see if anyone needed steak sauce or condiments which would have been nice to have had some horseradish and A-1.  Still no dinner salad for one person in our party and one didn't even get their order till we were able to grab the attention of a busboy to see if he could possibly find our disappearing waiter.  Poor Olivia (our guest of honor) finally got her food after most of us were about 1/2 way though with our cold steaks when her food arrived and John (Olivia's dad) finally asked about his dinner salad which finally came at the end of his meal. I guess it was a desert salad?   Another long wait (we have now been at Outback for about 1 1/2 hours by now) and our waiter comes to start clearing dishes and to ask if our food was OK and would I like another beer!  Really? Now you ask?!!? From the time our food was delivered till the time he is taking dishes away, this is the first time he has asked about our food and if everything was OK.  Nothing like a meal with nothing to drink - no beer, not even water!  Another long wait - and now it's time for our checks to come - wait, wait, wait.  At this point I just want out of there and to go home.  Please bring me my check!  At last the check comes and my bill is $38 bucks.  I give him my credit card and when the receipt comes it's now $51 - WTF! He tells me that he made a mistake on my bill and had to add the additional charge - but didn't tell me what the mistake was so I don't know why all a sudden I was paying an additional $13.  I just sign the damn thing because by now, all I want to do is to get out of there and go home!  OK, here comes the finishing touch to this disastrous evening.  Ready for this?  As he is handing me the credit card receipt for me to sign (with the additional $13 added) he asked, \"would anyone care for desert\"?  Really?  The tab has been paid, the table cleared and our party is preparing to say our goodbyes to each other and he wanted to take our desert orders.  Did he forget that we had already paid our bill?    I did call the manager when I got home (Susan Thompson) and she asked that I come back so she can make this awful experience right.  I'll do a followup review when that happens."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Service fantastic, clean, comfortable, easy parking.  I ordered a well done blossom burger which was absolutely tasteless. It looked appealing on the plate but that's about it. Fries were ok, iced tea mediocre.   Wish I could have rated higher as I was expecting more. Maybe the ribs are what one should order."}
{"text":"Another restaurant that I can't figure out why people flock to it.  The food is downright bad.  My husband loves steak and gets sick if this restaurant is mentioned.  The sweet potatoe must have been cooked and then frozen and then thawed... it was so runny and icky.  How do you mess up a sweet potatoe?"}
{"text":"My business colleague and myself wanted a quick dinner as we were both beat from a long day.   Strike 1: my cocktail glass was broken on the rim. Luckily I avoided a cut lip Strike 2: Our appetizer was delivered with our meal Strike 3: They got my order wrong  Bartender was nice enough but we should have received, at a minimum, a Comp on the App. Usually I would have spoken up but sometimes it just ain't worth it."}
{"text":"*WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED*  Service: If I could rate in the negatives I would! Trust me it was terrible! First off as soon as you walk in to Outback the hostesses don't even great you at all! I had to introduce my self and tell them I needed a table for three people.  Then after we order our drinks my fiancé asks for some sugar for his iced tea, never got any at all. When it came down to the food I requested if they could add bacon on my burger, once it came out no bacon (also we requested a few other things and we obviously didn't get them the first time)... So I told the waiter it didn't and explained to him it wasn't here at all and that since I already took a few bite out of my food I didn't want to get the bacon anymore then. I didn't even get to finish my sentence till he stormed off and did other things. I mean really? Come on dude! My fiancé ordered the mushroom sauce steak, once it came out it was a plain steak with no sauce at all! It wasn't even the way he wanted it. The nice manager came around and apologized which was great and offered a free dessert!(didn't get dessert because I wanted to leave so fast) I did explain how rude the server was and that I didn't appreciate him to walk off while I was still talking to him. When the bill came the server charged me for the bacon which I made him correct(I know it's just a dollar but I'm not gonna pay for something I didn't get) also on the bill they didn't even give a small discount for the service at all which most places do! So this is one unhappy customer that will not be coming back to this location for sure and will not be tipping this waiter!   Food:  Plain in simple it sucked and was dry! My burger patty was dry I drenched it in ranch and it still barely helped! Yuck!"}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment ZERO STARS, I would without any hesitation. We have visited this location numerous times and each time are greeted with problem after problem. This time, however, I vow that I will never come back because of the litany of issues we were presented with. When the waitress took our drink order, she asked myself and my fiancee to show our IDs; my dad, jokingly, said \"oh, do you need to see mine too?\" to which this harlot replied \"I mean, does it have your number on it?\" My mother was sitting RIGHT THERE. In another situation, I may have brushed it off as not-so-tasteful humor, however, as the night went on she continued to give my mother short replies when she was not ignoring her altogether. There were a number of errors regarding our meals - for as much as the waitress seemed to like my dad, she completely FORGOT to bring his food. Additionally, my fiancee's food was ice cold and my mom's was lackluster. I barely ate mine because of the already astounding level of frustration that was building. While my fiancee had to send his plate back (putting it in the hands of a surly gentleman, who I later found out is the OWNER), my father's arrived and his too was cold - I don't mean lukewarm, I mean like it came straight out of the fridge. To top it all off, when my father spoke to the owner, this man actually WALKED AWAY. Out of frustration, my father left the table and sat outside while we got boxes for our meals. Enter rude owner who stated, \"I know you guys don't have time, so the meal is on me tonight.\" TOTALLY MISSED THE MARK. As he walked away, I was sure to loudly state we were not short on time, but sick of this atrocious service. My mother again called for the owner to inform him of the severity of the events of the night. This man had the nerve to laugh in my mother's face and did not apologize until she told him he had not previously done so. After all of this, you would think he would be extremely kind and apologetic - nope! I have never met someone so arrogant and blatantly RUDE. I will never go back to this Outback Steakhouse AGAIN. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"I waited and waited, other people went b4 me....staff and others kept bumping into me....manager didn't care I was treated badly, talked to with profanity. ..manager fianaally came and said I hear there has been profanity,  didn't care it was said to me....I waited and waited to be taken care of ..NO one cared I was bumped into  and stepped on and talked badly to....I left crying...."}
{"text":"Let's face it, all Outback's are very good...but this one is amazing!  Friendly staff goes the extra yard.  I'll drive past other franchise stores to get to this one!"}
{"text":"I had an ok experience at this location. It took my girlfriend and I a long time to get seated while we watched dirty tables just sit there not being taken care of. I must say, the meal was very subpar and I hope the kitchen staff was just having a bad day. Our steaks were not very enjoyable, we really only enjoyed our sides. My girlfriend ordered a drink and this had a moldy slice of pineapple in there, we told our sever and she quickly addressed it. A manager came over and quickly apologized. She did take both drinks off our bill and gave us new ones on the house. Our sever was awesome, I wish we remembered her name but she made our experience at least ok. She was very attentive and took great care of us.  It could have just been a bad day for them, it happens, that's life sometimes."}
{"text":"I'm glad this chain was out in the west coast once I moved from Kentucky to here. I started becoming a regular here because I became friends with one of their bartenders who has a big following that goes in there.   The restaurant location is clean, the staff is friendly and I do enjoy all the bartenders that work behind the counter.  I guess the only issue I can see is how they do not have video poker or any form of gambling at the bar counter but that is alright.   Most people like the steaks and bloomin' onion but I personally love their chopped salad. Even though I don't prefer bluecheese, the bluecheese dressing in this salad has a very amazing and addicting taste to it!"}
{"text":"service wasn't that great & food wasn't either. we were not impressed at all. It's also not very clean. All of our bread plates were dirty so we asked for new ones...those were dirty too! took a very long time yet there were a lot of employees standing around, including the manager!"}
{"text":"Hey, it's a steakhouse what can go wrong? I loved my ribeye it was cooked to perfection, as I requested medium rare. That wedge salad that I had gave me life though, it was delicious! The one thing that could use some work though is there sweetie, which is what I requested but it wasn't sweet at all so I had to send it back and ended up just getting a soda."}
{"text":"The only reasons I did not give this restaurant 5 stars is because 1) they only delivered 1 of the small loaf of bread for 6 people, there is not enough sauce for the bloomin onion for 6 people, and they really skimped on the ceasar salad dressing on all 5 of our salads.  None of us barely had any dressing on our salad.  Now, aside from that, what I was pleased with was the fact that I called well in advance of our arrival, requested that we be put on the call ahead seating list, and explained to us that we have a special needs child who can't wait for 45 min. - 1+ hours. The person who answerd the phone said that they would make sure that they wrote that in the notes, so that we would be seated asap.  When we arrived and checked in, they told us we were next.  Thankfully we only had to wait for apx. 20 min. - which was doable with the help of my son's ipad, and music from my husband's phone."}
{"text":"A chain is a chain is a chain. The calamari was dry and brittle. The prime rib sandwich-blah. Coconut shrimp-ok. The fish tacos-very good.   A cocktail costs as much as an entree.  Service-decent (only 3 tables full).  Ron was nice.  First time ever at an Outback. Had a gift card."}
{"text":"I came to visit from California with my family . We got seated next to these African American girls that were mad because they're food wasn't cooked right so they were giving the waiter and manager a hard time . After the manager started serving us and we thought she was upset over the incident that had occurred . After a while she was being very blah to us . The food was great but she shouldn't take it out on other people . If this isn't what you can deal with you shouldn't work in the food industry ."}
{"text":"If you have never been to an Outback Stake House you are in for a treat....or maybe not.  I have visited Outbacks all over the county and there are a few thing a that are consistent .  The salads are good, the awesome blossom is good, the coconut shrimp are good, but the stakes are hit or miss.  On thing you can always be sure of is the Prime Rib.  It is always good...if they have any left.  Often I eat towards the end of the night and they will be out of Prime Rib.  This particular Outback was clean, fast, and our server was great.  They had Prime Rib and it was as good as always."}
{"text":"Love the food at chandler location never had a bad meal. Great service always.. we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Blooming onion was hard as a rock this time. Sent it back and the next one was only slightly better. Seems they can't hit the right temp on a steak to save their life. 6oz steak seared to hell on the out side and bright pink in the middle medum well? It was a nice small piece of rubber. Lobster tail was cold as was the butter. This is the third time the food here has been just so so. They need to slow down and do it right. This isn't fast food it's a sit down place that should be relaxing and enjoyable and it's nether."}
{"text":"The prices may have gone up but this is the best place for a steak in town. The service was great and the food was even better."}
{"text":"Very bad. We got the Valentine special (2 dinners $40).  The bread plates on the table were very dirty, They had something very gritty on them and also had grease spots on them.  The server replaced them with plates that still were dirty but seemed a bit cleaner than the original ones we had.  The Bloomin' Onion was too salty and was extremely greasy.  The side Caesar Salads had a funny taste to them -- hard to explain, sort of bitter and chemical taste to them. They did not taste good.  The fully loaded mashed potatoes were horrible and inedible -- too salty.  The mac & cheese was too salty.  We were up-charged for the sides too.  We were up-charged a $1.99 more for the mac and cheese and $1.00 for the inedible mashed potatoes.  The menu for the Valentine's special did not say anything about these up-charges and neither did the server. So, were were surprised by the up-charges. The meal was also supposed to include cheesecake for desert. However, when desert time came, we were told that there was none available because the kitchen did not thaw out enough cheesecake and they were out.  We were really looking forward to cheesecake.  We were served Carrot Cake instead. The steaks were good - the seasoning on them was a bit salty but they were still tasty and good.  However, we felt rushed.  While eating our main course (the steak) , our server asked us twice about what desert. we wanted  Anyway after ordering desert, it was brought to us in take-out bags.We never asked for the desert \"to-go:. I mean talk about being rushed. Overall the whole dining experience was bad.  We won't be returning to Outback at least not the Parma OH location."}
{"text":"So being that it was mothers day busy got it. However when the table beside you sat down about half hour after you got there food first was a problem for sure. The appitizers took forever but got them finally. Then got the food cold dead cold. Then my salmon came with a person hair in it so thanks I was disgusted. They said we shall re do them 2 hours down and really not hungry mow. Then waiting on drinks at least half hour to hour to get the refills. Then we realize the steaks were minus the garlic butter sauce, and then my salmon had a tiny piece of bacon on it.. ughh. Then to top it off we get the adjusted bill it was still 91 dollars for what 2 hour wait and bad food. You call that adjusted um seriously. So I would strongly suggest think twice if your hungry. That makes both times we have been here for the terrible food and pay that.. so don't worry I don't plan on ever coming back. So thanks we see what they now. Thanks for ruining my mother's day meal one day I get to go our and pick a place and this what I got. This mom was very sad now headed to burger King cause I am hungry."}
{"text":"Mothers Day I took the wife and kids to this Outback. The waitress was great (Julia). The service was great and the food was also. They brought my steak out and believed it was well done so they said nibble on the steak while we make you a new one at medium well. I have ate at many places but this was the first time a place have ever said that instead of trying to hopefully sell it to you, and you wouldn't notice or you would have to grab the waitress and let her know. I want to give kudos to Julia, manager Terrence and General Manager Jon for noticing when something isn't right ,acting on it, and addressing the issue and making it right."}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes for a server to come and take our drink order. Several staff member walked by but none for us. Hopefully our server wasn't injured in some weird kitchen dingo lobster fight that caused an emergency exit leaving our table with out service in the frenzy, otherwise just bad service. Either way we left. Tones of places with room before seven in this area."}
{"text":"Haven't been to an Outback since Texas Roadhouse opened in my old hometown...10 years ago. No Texas Roadhouse here in Vegas so we went to Outback. Never had a steakhouse steak that did not offer a blue cheese/ shallot sauce. But they did try to accommodate my request by dumping plain blue cheese on my steak. Very over powering. I had to scrape off the excess cheese.  'loaded' mashed potatoes were bland. Lacked flavor and salt. I was asked if i wanted an extra shot of tequila for my margarita for an additional dollar. I declined. Man, I was sorry I did. There appeared to be no tequila in my drink. My husband tasted it ( he does not like tequila) and said it tasted like plain lime juice. I told server and she said 'Oh, I am practicing.' I just was speechless and asked for a  real margarita. But by then I had almost finished my meal and decided it wasn't worth the wait. Very disappointed. Won't do back. Poor value for the money we sent. Plus side was  server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Gotta hand it to Outback for their consistency in that I can always count on terrible service.  Every time I come, I order the same salad, usually from to-go because it's on my way home from work.  Nine times out of ten, the salad is wrong.  The only thing I customize is asking that they hold the tomatoes.  I have gotten the wrong ingredients, lack of ingredients, the wrong salad, someone else's meal or disgusting old leaves that looked like they'd been outside in our recentish heat wave for a few hours. Yes, it is my fault because I kept returning, but I guess I try to believe places can change.  And I love the dressing on this salad and cannot duplicate it to save my life.  Outback gets an extra star from me for that dressing.  When they remember to put it in the bag, it's truly amazing.  We all know what hope springs eternal though."}
{"text":"Food is always great (only had to send it back once for not being cooked enough).. Service is fast and friendly. This is our fav location and they will continue to get our business"}
{"text":"I usually go to the outback on 56th and and bell which my bf and I love.  This particular location won't be getting our business again unfortunately.  The service was extremely slow. We waited 20+ minutes for drinks and an appetizer and then another 20 minutes for our food.  My bf got steak and I got chicken. He asked for medium, and it came out so rare that I could practically hear it still mooing. They took it back for him and brought out another which was cooked properly but by then he wasn't hungry anymore.  My chicken had the absolute worst taste like it was old expired chicken that they cooked. I took 2 bites and couldn't eat anymore. I didn't send it back because I didn't want to be \"that couple\" who keeps sending food back.   I gave this location 2 stars because our waitress was very nice and also because they comped our appetizer for having a bad experience. Based on how slow it was and how bad the food was, I would have only given it 1 star (which I HATE doing)   Hopefully no one else has the same experience as us!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on business. Ordered the crab avocado appetizer, clam chowder soup, and 12 oz outback special. Dale was our waiter. Very attentive and took care of me very well. Only slip up was a my clam chowder soup inadvertently came out with meal. Minor mistake that could happen to anyone. Immediately they made it right. Manager Layne immediately came by and apologized and made things right. All the food was fantastic. I highly recommend this location and especially Dale who treated us with exceptional care.   Great job. Hats off to Dale for his exceptional service, and to manager Layne."}
{"text":"Probably the best Outback experience I've ever had. I signed up for the \"call ahead\" seating, online. There was about a 15-20 min wait with that considered but we arrived around 8pm and there were still several families outside waiting for tables. I'll take a 15-20 min wait on a weekend, that's honestly, nothing.  Once we were seating our server, Ben, greeted us in a very timely manner. He was attentive, polite, and amiable. A great server experience and he earned a great tip. The best part about his hospitality is that this didn't seem like a job. Ben genuinely looked interested and showed real passion for his service. That's hard to find these days.  The food was on point. I had a Caesar Salad, grilled chicken with a baked sweet potato and of course, the amazing bread. My boyfriend enjoyed a 6oz filet with a sweet potato and cheese broccoli. We were both incredibly pleased. He ordered the filet rare expecting it to be cooked a bit longer and it was definitely a lovely medium rare to rare. No blood but it was seconds past that point. He also made a note about the cheese broccoli. I'm not big on most cheeses but he was very happy with his selection. My chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy. The BBQ sauce had a bit of a spicy aftertaste to it but I tend to be sensitive to even the slightest spice. Normal palates would probably hardly notice.  Ben brought our check and mentioned a survey and free bloomin' onion coupon for completing the survey in house. Not a bad deal, really. I filled out the survey and the manager came over to thank us for choosing to dine with them and shared the coupon for completing the survey. A nice personal touch."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most consistent restaurants in the west valley regarding the quality of the food and service.  I have tried the ribs at Texas Roadhouse, Mimis, Dillons and Outback.  Although they are good at all of the above, they fall off the bone at Outback and are noticeably better than the other restaurants.  Have noticed all of their meals are consistent in quality."}
{"text":"I came last night out with my family and had the worse experience. It wasn't even my server. It was a server who walked past my son and hushed him. That was the rudest thing I've ever seen a waitress do. Everyone was being loud, my son was just talking to his cousins and she had the nerve to hush him."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we've been to Outback, but especially this location. We have never, ever been to an Outback where we didn't have a food issue (cold, under/over cooked steaks, etc) but tonight we decided to give it another try and they absolutely nailed it. Steak was cooked to a perfect mw, garlic mashed potatoes were hot, carrots were not over or under cooked. Dessert was yummy, we got the white chocolate salted caramel cookie skillet.  Only thing preventing 5 stars is that the server was a little slow to bring refills, boxes, and to run the credit card; although she was very nice."}
{"text":"Very lovely attentive courteous staff. Food was good. A little over priced, but it wasn't bad. The bread was all right, but I'm not one to favor wheat bread. The waitress called it wheat bread, but I think it was pumpernickel bread. The steak was a bit tough to cut, but not too tough to chew. Maybe a little tough, but very tasty. I liked the lobster and I think that was the best part.The desert was excellent that I died and went to heaven. I think I will come back when I can save up again to eat here. I would love to try their potato soup next."}
{"text":"While I am not a huge fan of their food, I will drink almost anything, which is good because this Outback has some killer drink specials.  My wife and I went here for dinner a few weeks ago on a Saturday night.  The place was pretty busy but we were seated promptly.  They have glasses of decent wine for like 2 bucks ($20 bottles) and martinis for like $3.  The alcohol wasn't premium grade but wasn't plastic bottle stuff either so it was a pretty good deal.  I had a steak which was ok I guess and a wedge salad.  The wedge was excellent but they put some sort of sweet stuff in with the dressing I think.  Next time I would definitely order it without the sweet because then it would be an awesome salad.  To start we shared a shrimp on the barbie which was actually pretty good.  I'm really not the hugest fan of this place, I will return because it is kinda close to my house, has ok food, and great drink specials."}
{"text":"The outback is a place you can always come and eat and know you will get a solid meal. It isn't five star dining however you aren't paying for that.  I have however noted that the salad has gotten smaller sneaky as has the bloomin onion...Hey we are all cutting back folks but the price hasn't :( I like the deal they give you on their house wine for $2 you can't go wrong. A solid steak that is about the same as one at home just costs more. If you are in a hurry and want a salad and potato etc before a movie or something this is a great deal...Not somewhere I would come to impress somebody however :) The waitstaff however is generally very good..."}
{"text":"About 25 years ago there was an Outback in the Mayfield hts. area and it was fantastic. You could order a Flo's Filet and add for $1.00 an oz. The meat was cut to order and was always excellent.  This is the first time I have been to the chain in about 2 decades and things have changed. The steak was 'good', not great and certainly not memorable. The service was good and the restaurant was clean. I suppose in short the steak went from really competing with stuffier more expensive establishments to a meat quality on par with what you would expect from a large every-day chain.  If you are looking for an average steak in a comfortable atmosphere with average pricing ($20.00 for a good size steak) then stop in, it's good but for sure has lost that, WOW I need to come back and SOON factor."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for my 21st birthday. We sat at the bar and had great service. Our bartenders were Cocoa and Brandon, both amazing. Cocoa recommended an excellent martini (on the house) and Brandon made sure I got my free sundae. They definitely made me feel special. We shared an onion blossum, much better than the last time I had it. I also had a small caesar salad and baked potato soup, both great. My boyfriend had a side garden salad and sweet potato which he said were \"okay\", but he loved his steak. Much, much better experience than the last time I was here, I'll likely come back."}
{"text":"Never again!! We always come to this location with a party of 10+ and call ahead so we can make sure the have us on the list but on this day they would not accept us to call which is fine seeing as it is Father's Day. I asked how long would a walk in wait be since I was 5 minutes away and the girl said 90 minutes. I get there and the girl at the front door was rude and had me talk to the manager who had no idea about what I was talking. Mind you the first girl said she would talk to the manager herself. Manager said it would be a 3hr wait time. I wouldn't have minded that if the first girl would have told me that but instead she lied about the wait time and lost a few customers"}
{"text":"Always consistently great food! Love sitting in the bar area for the open seating and TV's"}
{"text":"Outback is... Outback. I went only because of my free Blooming onion and that alone puts one star up on the board, who doesn't love a freebie? My wings were super salty though, so that takes down a star, but the margarita was really good and at a great price, putting the star back. The extra star is for service. Outback Mayo, has a kind, corteous staff. From the welcoming host at the door, the bartender, and My waitress, who was really nice as well. I was really not even gonna write a review but I happen to have left my leftovers on the table & I was expecting she'd just throw them away right away, but she waited for me and was nice to bring them back out. So i appreciated that."}
{"text":"Came here today with my husband. We are very happy with our food and their service. Great place!"}
{"text":"Service started out slow. We waited for about 10 minutes on someone to come over after being seated. Finally a server came and apologized for our wait. Took our drinks and got the actual server in our sections attention.      The manager apologized and took care of our appetizer. Very professional. I love Outback when their game is on point.       This Outback had mixed reviews here but after my visit here I would say it's a go here. Happy with my food. The prime rib was on point cooked to perfection and tender.      Other than the slow start to the service. This Outback is worth it to me. Probably won't ever comeback to this one due to here on business but I hope they are successful."}
{"text":"Let's see..tonight I came to this location and ordered curbside! The person who did the take out tonight was extremely rude, he asked me my name I gave it to him. Apparently they put your order out by your first name..well if the order online asks me what make and model car I will be in, I'm not sure why this was so difficult for him to figure out.   Secondly, I pay for my food and he tells me he needs to see the coupon I used to order with, then he rudely commented that his supervisor would likely need to check out the coupon. I have no problems with that.   I will never return to this location I'll go back to the one on Cactus like I had been and give them my money. What a way to ruin a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Here in Las Vegas on vacation and the casinos are serving some pretty shady food at Ny Ny so we went across the street to Outback Steakhouse and we had the best dinner meal in the 4 days we spent here. Chicken breast was perfect wifes shrimp was perfect and our server was on top of it."}
{"text":"Terrible food! Everything that came to our table seemed like it sat under a heat lamp for too long. Improperly cooked steaks and the server got more more than one of our orders wrong AND she even wrote it down. The server was nice and tried to fix any mistakes but the food was so terrible that we definitely will not be going back to this location again."}
{"text":"Horrible food and very expensive!! Use to eat all the time! Won't again!!! Could not even cook a hamburger well done!! Was rare!"}
{"text":"I don't even know that I can do a fair review - but my review is based on my preference of food that doesn't tear through my digestive tract like a SCUD missile.  I avoid Outback like the plague because whatever they put on their meat assures me that I am going to have a miserable night.  However, with a surprise visit (if surprise means they drove 8 hours, so you feel obligated to drop everything you are doing and put on pants and a bra to meet them for a crappy dinner, then surprise it is) from family, I fell on the grenade and ate at Outback.  Said family called at 4:00 pm and said they were 45 minutes away and headed towards a hotel in Matthews and wanted to meet for dinner.  Well, shit.  I live about 10 minutes from Matthews, but aside from visiting my parents and the occasional trip to Sycamore Commons to shop or Cracker Barrel with the folks, I don't frequent Independence Blvd and have no idea where to go eat.  In particular when put on the spot.  In the interest of a short drive for them and a restaurant that they would recognize the name of, I suggested (wearily) Outback.  I called at 4:30 to inquire about call ahead seating and was assured that when I arrived at 6:30, my name would go to the top of the list.  Wrong.  I arrived ahead of the fam at 6:30.  They got there a few minutes after me.  I was given the buzzer and because it was a Saturday night at the Outback, it was packed.  The seating area was jammed, as was the doorway because the sheeple are too stupid to move out of the only way to get in and out of the building.  I waited outside with the smokers, that was fun.  I waited for 45 minutes.  At a place that I had called ahead to.  That I don't like.  Attitudes from the hostesses and those waiting were in full force.    After our defective buzzer didn't go off (of course), one of the hostesses came outside to call my name one last time before they gave the table away.  (f$&#!)  FINALLY we were seated.  Everyone was starving.  The family member I was with is all about discounts, coupons, etc. and I was already prepared to overtip the waitress to compensate.    Bread was brought, it was meh.  We ordered a bloomin' onion, that was fried and swimming in grease, so it was good (we were all starving).  I ordered a salad with some steak on it to hopefully avoid distress (that didn't work).  The salad was fine, the meat was tough, but cooked correctly (it was exactly what I was expecting).  One family member got the filet well-done and then promptly coated it in ranch (she makes me cry on the inside when she does that) and the other family member got... hell, I don't even know, I just wanted to get out of there.  The entire meal got a solid meh from everyone.  Portions were pitiful, meat looked like it was from the day old counter, etc... it was Outbackish.  Service was excellent though - she kept on top of drink refills and stopped to check on us several times.  Bless her heart.    Then began the waitress, one manager, second manager rounds at our table because no one was aware of the new iphone app that Outback had a $10 coupon on.  The first manager visited a few times and then never came back after saying he was going to get the big manager.  The second manager just took the $10 off, which is what I would have done.  I am not spending all night going around and around about $10.  (the family member became increasingly hostile as she had to re-explain the app three times and I really wanted to just give her $20 and leave).  I have never had to argue with someone before about taking $10 off - and I am sorry your corporate office doesn't fill you in on their promotions - it isn't the responsibility of the diner to explain, no matter how argumentative they are.  The whole experience was exactly why I don't like Outback - an eternal wait while herded like cattle and bad, overpriced food (for a few dollars more, I can eat at my favorite steak place and won't spend the night in a cold sweat gripping a bottle of Pepto).  Kudos to our waitress, she hung in there and kept a good attitude, but I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. We came here for my birthday and both my mother and got a cold meal, twice! When we asked to see the manager the first time he didn't show up for about 20 minutes and when he finally showed up it was obvious he didn't care. After that our waiter avoided us for the rest of the night and we didn't get anymore service at all, except when the bill was dropped off. I used to love this place but now I don't think I'll ever be back"}
{"text":"The service wasn't horrible but it wasn't great, the lack of pre-bussing on every single table around me was cringe worthy. Everyone was stacking their dishes trying to make room for their new dish since most people were ordering the new 4 course meal. Really confused on why none of the dirty plates were removed from the table, that's a huge turn off when dining out. On the plus side the food was amazing and recovered some stars for this experience. The service really needs work!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend last Saturday.  The waitress was prompt and friendly.  My friend recommended I try their filet foccacia sandwich so I got one with a side salad.  It was fantastic.  He says when he's not in the mood for a full steak at Outback he gets the filet foccacia and I can see why.  We also got the seared Ahi tuna appetizer.  That was also fantastic, especially with the wasabi sauce Outback makes.  The next day before my flight out I was craving the same sandwich so I swung by Outback just a couple hours before my flight.  I went in the bar area this time and ordered the same thing.  I casually mentioned to the waitress that I had to head straight to the airport after eating there, but didn't think anything of it.  They brought my sandwich and salad out in record time!  And I didn't even ask them to hurry it, they just went ahead and did so.  And as previously, the waitress was super friendly.  Despite this location being south of the Strip, it gets super busy, particularly at night... but there are good reasons; great food, and great service.  It's worth the wait.  (I had previously come here at night, saw the long wait, and opted to walk down and try the Dickey's BBQ place... that was a mistake.  I wish I would've just stayed at Outback.)"}
{"text":"First the coco shrimp are delicious! The house salad with blue cheese is the freshest and tastiest I have had in years! The garlic mashed potatoes were unmatched   The best part of the meal was the medium rare Victorias filet. The best steak I have tasted. the vegetables were also fantastic! This place is very good and is very consistent. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Just returned from Outback as we were given some gift cards.  Our kids each got the Outback Special 6oz sirloin and it was the worst cut of meat I have seen.  Each of them struggled to cut the meat.  I even tried and it was terrible.  I mentioned something to the waitress and her comment was \"that is how all the Outback Special Sirloins are\".....we'll continue to go to Texas Roadhouse where the steak is edible."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!  Only word to describe it TERRIBLE!! Called in to order curbside take away. Phone rang and rang and rang..... Finally someone ansewered. When I said I wanted to order take out he said he would transfer me over phone then again rang and rang and rang.... same man ansewered I again said I wanted to order take out again he said he would transfer me over again phone rang and rang and rang and rang some more! Phone was finally picked up and quickly slammed back down and disconnected.  Once again I called back and a girl ansewered who was very polite and I gave my order they told me 35 mins. I left my house 30 minutes later to go pick up. I live LESS THAN 5 MINUTES away.  I got there and was the only one waiting for curb side but they did look pretty busy. But my order was not ready and I waited more than 10 minutes before they brought it out.  I went directly home and after waiting for my order you would think when I got it it would be hot... NOPE NOT AT ALL!!  COLD prime rib cold onion soup cold hamburger! Ordered medium rare prime rib got well done yet COLD prime rib the 16 ounce!! And out of the 16 ounces I would say 5 ounces were fat 6-7 ounces were inedible dry shoe leather type meat product and 4-5 ounces of center well done dry meat that was unable to be chewed or swallowed without a drink of my ice tea so more than half of my $23.00 prime rib is resting in peace in the trash which is more than I can say for my nauseated stomach! Would have tried to help it out with the aujus but they gave me an EMPTY CONTAINER! My fathers burger was also terrible and of course he accusingly questioned ME! Why was I gone so long! French onion soup also cold! Salads were surprisingly on the slightly WARM side. At this point I was so aggravated and tired I just said forget it! It was late and I didn't want to aggravate myself more by hashing it out with some incompetent employee like the first guy who ansewered the phone. I will never go here again. I should have just made my own dinner it would have been easier it would have been cheaper it would have tasted MUCH BETTER it would have been hot. And it would have been cooked correctly! If I was the owner of this steak house I would be embarrassed to say so! Goodbye out back! I'm going BACK IN!"}
{"text":"Compared to my hotel, this was a steal. Just down the street from MGM Grand. $38.00 for a dinner buffet at the MGM, I don't think so.  Also, right next door is a Denny's that is a much better deal than the MGM.   Both of these are a ten minute walk from the MGM"}
{"text":"We went back to the Outback tonight even prior to last year's poor experience (see below).  This time it was like night and day!  The service was outstanding thanks to our wonderful waitress, Yvonne (Yo).  She was super!  Our dinners were both topnotch - we couldn't have been happier.  We will be back much sooner than it took us to go back this time.  Thank you to Yvonne and the cook for making it a great evening.  See you soon.  7/30/2016 ~ I gave 3 stars The Outback Steakhouse has been a place we have liked to go to for special orations or when we see that they have a special meal on TV.  Today we went to try their crab stuffed lobster meal -- what a disappointment!  The service was good but the food and the price did NOT meet the mark.  It will be a long time before we go back there."}
{"text":"I have not been to Outback in many many many years.  This experience reminded me of why.  The service was okay, ambiance is good.  The blooming onion was my favorite part of the meal.  As I remembered and expected.  The ribeye steak was not that great.  Likely the worst cut of meat I have had all year.  The mac & cheese side was just okay."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here for dinner on a Thursday early night. We got a table really quick, but had to wait for an over extended period of time for our waiter to show up to take our drink orders (20 min). We got our drinks again in an over extended period of time (10 min). We finally got our waiter back to take our orders, my daughter ordered the Salmon, and I ordered the steak ( medium rare and added a side of shrimp for $6.00).  The food took a bit longer than expected, but within a reasonable amount of time. Once we received our food, the disappointment hit! My steak was well done, not med rare, and the $6.00 side of shrimp were VERY TINY....  it was all just mediocre, in general but so NOT worth spending $50 on two drinks (1 alcoholic and 1 soda) for mediocre food and crappy service! Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a nice steak, cooked right, juicy, done just the way you ordered it.   Outback to the rescue!  We went on a random Wednesday and apparently they have a 3-course meal deal on Wednesdays.    First your selection of soup and salad (I could swear on the menu it says soup OR salad  but our server insisted it was both)   We had a caesar salad and a tortilla soup.  The soup had a nice kick to it.   Other appetizers we tried were the crab stuffed mushrooms (4 pieces- not bad) and the short rib nachos (didn't finish it)  For the main entree, a nice juicy steak.  Seasoned well, cooked medium (just enough pink).  Nothing could be found wrong with this piece of meat.. Mmmm..   We opted for a chocolate cheesecake for dessert.  The other option was blueberry.    Server was pretty attentive.  All-in-all a good experience."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting for a baby shower and staying at the Courtyard Marriot just down the street. Too tired to go out and sit down for food we decided to order curbside from Outback. After going on their mobile website (which had no prices listed so that was annoying) we ordered a 6oz steak with side salad and fries and a cobb salad with sauteed mushrooms and macaroni sides. We were quoted 25 minutes. We got there after 30 minutes and then waited another 5 minutes before anyone came out to help us. They had messed up our order on the receipt so after that was straightened out we waited another 10 minutes for our food to come out. My salad and two sides cost me $30 whereas my friend's steak cost less than $15. Since the waitress hadn't brought out our itemized receipt with our bills I asked for one. When I saw that indeed, my salad and sides cost me $30 I was extremely confused and annoyed but too tired to care at that point. Tired and hungry we went back to the hotel to eat. When I pulled out my salad it was actually smaller than the side salad given to my friend and only had shredded cheese and a little bit of bacon bits on it. How is that considered an entree sized cobb salad? I was SO annoyed I'd just paid $30 for a tiny excuse of a cobb salad. What little there was to eat also tasted so bland. What a waste. It's been years since I've been to an Outback but after this experience I doubt I'll ever go back to any Outback ever again. Also noticably lacking from our bag of food was a single utensil or napkin. I guess they expect us to eat with our fingers?   I should've learned my lesson from Lethal Weapon: \"They F YOU at the drive-thru, okay? They F YOU at the drive-thru! They know you're gonna be miles away before you find out you got effed! They know you're not gonna turn around and go back, they don't care. So who gets effed? Ol' Leo Getz! Okay, sure! I don't give a F\""}
{"text":"My friends decided on Outback for dinner tonight, and what a great choice it was!! Our waiter Lorena suggested I get the shrimp on the Barbie & I'm so glad I did! I also got 2 cups of their tortilla soup because it's that good! Overall our waiter gave us excellent customer service and food was excellent."}
{"text":"Sitting in the first booth near the entry way and two guys stood over my head talking and clapping while waiting for their seat.  We told or server and she got the manager.  He told us that he had to accommodate all his guests.  I won't come back"}
{"text":"Andie who is serving our take out is AMAZING! Such beyond amazing service. We liked this place just fine before, now we LOVE!  I am repeatedly blown away by great impeccable service when it's seems a missing art."}
{"text":"Saturday night at around 10:30 pm and the compadre decides he wants some steak for his birthday. We're gambling there at Harrah's and the pit boss tells my comadre that there's an Outback \"next door and upstairs\", so we get the birthday boy some steak. So you'd think that because it's on the strip, that the quality of service would either go down, or there'd be none at all, but this was not the case. Sean was our server, and he was really good. Sean didn't let any of our drinks get even close to being half full (or is it half empty? : ) ) and was on top of all our needs.  My compadre asked for the bloomin' onion extra crispy and that's what he got. Ten seconds more and it would have been burnt. My ribeye was medium rare, just like I wanted it, and there was nothing to complain about this evening, becaue all the proteins were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere, perfect for expensive but affordable dated w/ bae, or a nice dinner with the family. I ate here around 6pm, so the other reviews I read about cold bread and hard butter and non stretchy cheese is fake, around this time at least. Also, this place is very filling. It is easy to get full here, but everything taste good.  The staff constantly asks if you need anything, so they offer great customer service. If you want, there's a machine on the table that allows you play 30 different games for $2, and even order on the device itself! But warning, the cheesecake is super big. A lot bigger than how it looks. Also, the chocolate doesn't taste the best...I didn't eat much since the chocolate ruined the taste.  It was also quite big the texture was a bit rough. Also, I don't have much of an appetite so I ate too much and feel a bit sick, but that's my own fault."}
{"text":"Service...not very attentive. Food...just okay.  On a beautiful Saturday evening the patio didn't appear to be open as we waited about 30 minutes for a table. Twenty minutes after we ordered, our salads arrived with about 3 pieces of cheese and a drop of dressing.  We didn't see our server to ask for more dressing, so we just ate it. The bread they offered us after ordering our meal came after the salad and seconds before our main course. The very tiny plates made the portions feel small (not bigger like you would think), like you are paying $20 a plate for nothing.  We were given 1 half filled ramekin of ketchup to share between 2 people (and this was only after requesting it after I meal came...btw, we ordered french fries...).  My husband made a comment about how he remembers Outback being so much better.  I've only ate here a handful of times. After this last experience, I don't know if I will eat here again.  Just not for me.  I would rather drop $70 for two adults and a teenager somewhere else."}
{"text":"Turn on the air conditioner.  It's always hot and uncomfortable.  Manager won't do anything about it  It's Arizona please pay attention!"}
{"text":"I was super impressed by this location especially the host Aaron. He went out of his way to make our anniversary special, and was very personable.  Oh and the food was amazing too. We had baby back ribs and steak mmmm *drools*"}
{"text":"Sorry Outback, we'venot been here in 10 to 12 years for a reason. Thought we would give you another try given the long absence. Unfortunately, we still can't take a shine to your restaurant. We came in for lunch on a recent Saturday afternoon and were seated promptly but in the far back of the restaurant tucked away in a dark corner despite the restaurant being almost entirely empty. Not terrible and nothing to make a fuss over. Our waiter was pleasant enough but did not get our order correct and not all items were brought out and we had to ask for them a couple of times.   It was a slow afternoon so perhaps he just forgot, which he admitted.   Whatever. One of them was a side of fries he forgot to put in. When we asked about them after our entrees had already come, he went off and came back sometime later with a few french fries on a plate which appeared to be cobbled together from other plates to try to do what he could. They were so few fries I did not feel like paying for them. But we did.  The steak tacos were very salty. The chicken tacos were good though. For a soft drink, a five dollar Tito's lemonade, two lunch specials and a side of fries, our tab was $35.  Not terrible at all. But given the meh food quality and challenges with service, we are likely to continue taking our dining dollars elsewhere given the many other choices in town."}
{"text":"The WORST wings I've ever eaten!!  I cancelled my main course order because the wings made me ill.  I was still charged for the wings, and the chickencrap manager didn't have the guts to come out and talk!  They did send a lettuce salad \"on the house\" after I was told the wings would be taken off the bill.  Of course, the wings were not taken off thebill, but the server was nice and I didn't want to create a scene.  I paid, but will not go back to Outback in Chandler, Az!!  Oh, by the way, I spent an hour on the Hershey Highway when I got home!  Unless I get at least an acknowlegement from the manager, I will not go back, and will continue the email campaign against this Outback in Chandler, AZ (located next to the Chandler Mall)!!    If you go, stay away from those poop inducing wings!!"}
{"text":"What a phenomenal experience I had here. Seriously this was awesome. The attentiveness from Stephanie our waitress to the manager Steven, nothing but great things.   I took my mom here for a special night because she was in town and really wanted to just have a quiet time and we were in the area and I wanted steak, so did she. We went in, were seated right away by a nice gentleman in front and said grab this while you can because they were getting busy. So I appreciate that so I didn't have to wait as I was waiting on my mom to meet me.   We sat down Stephanie was our server and she was super friendly. We got our drinks right away and they were full the entire time.   We got the sweet chili calamari for starters and holy smokes this was amazing. I am told the breading is a special mix and it was top notch. Huge portion. Got Caesar salad sides and the warm wheat bread with butter was awesome.    For the main course, we ordered the Flo's Filet and my mom got Salmon with her steak. The portion size for hers was massive for the value was perfect. So my steak was medium and when Steven came to check on us he saw my steak wasn't finished and I had it up and he explained that it was \"framing\" on the steak which means it's cooked perfectly on both sides. 34 years of life and never knew it was called that. I'm learning.   Again, overall great service, attentive, our steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I will be back for sure. Get the calamari it's money."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food salmon and prime rib....worth the trip. Thx again....made my father's day complete.... THANKS AGGIE YOU'RE AWESOME"}
{"text":"FOLLOW UP REVIEW.  We gave this location another shot after being comp'd a meal.  Things were better than before.  This time we were seated in the dining area, and it was quite busy.  Our server seemed overworked but he did meet our needs.  We did receive fries this time, and after asking, we also received bread.  The burger was cooked perfectly to order (medium), and tasted good.  They used to restrict servers to 2-3 tables at a time, but this guy had half the dining area.  Thus, everything took a bit longer.  3 stars, A-OK, and thank you Outback for addressing my earlier experience and taking care of it."}
{"text":"What is it?: The Outback Steakhouse is a chain resturaunt that can be found throughout the nation. They are known for their steaks and appetizers such as the \"Bloomin' Onion.\" Each and every time I have come here I have recieved terrific service from courageous waiters and waitresses. Upon entering, the first thing I noticed were my eyes adjusting to the dim lighting. This could be a down-side for humans. Usually there's no wait, but if there is a wait, it is never too long. The establishmemt is mostly comprised of booths, but has several tables as well.  The Menu: The menu consists of hamburgers, steaks, and something that will most likely please you.  The cheese fries are a wonderful appetizer. It's a large plate of seasoned french fries topped with several melted cheeses and bacon bits. This apetizer is not for weight watchers and can easily appetize 4 people. If you want an appetizer, I suggest you pounce on this one. They serve Coca Cola products and O'Douls as well!  For dinner, I ordered my usual: a hamburger (nothing on it) with bacon. Each and every time the hamburger is professionally cooked to your liking. I have never had any problem with the cooking of my hamburger. It comes with a side of seasoned fries. Beware, however, these burgers are quite large! If you like hamburgers and are really hungry, Outback Steakhouse is your asylum from McDonalds or Wendy's.  Overall, the Outback Steakhouse gets a 4 out of 5 star rating for their superior quality food and excellent service but don't get the last star because of their dim lighting."}
{"text":"Just left curbside.  I ordered the Crab Cakes which was suppose to come with a creamy (mind you), crispy Dijonnaise Slaw paired with Dijonnaise sauce on the side.  Mine was plain, the slaw was basically some chopped salad with not a drop of this so called Dijonnaise sauce, nor did I get any on the side.  To make things worst, the Crab Cakes were so under seasoned - the sauce would have come in handy here.  Not happy as I spent $60 in total and the end result was sub par food.  The curb side team should do a better job in making sure all items are packed in the bag that a customer is paying for.  It's not like McDonalds where you can quickly scan your bag and notice the fries are missing.  You have to open each container in the parking lot - who got time for that!!!"}
{"text":"Outback is another one of my faves and has reasonable prices and an awesome menu. A must have in the appetizer section is the well-known blooming onion which is a deep-fried whole onion with each petal breaded ready to dip in their horse-radish sauce and their coconut shrimp were huge and again fried to perfection.  They are known for their value and their steaks which are perfectly done which makes for a wonderful meal. Again a place that never lets me down when it comes to fantastic food and service."}
{"text":"Outback is probably my favorite chain restaurant and my SO and I eat at one whenever we can.  Last time I was in Concord for work, this location was still under construction... boy was I excited when I arrived in town last week to find out it was open!  I got on \"the list\" at Outback.com and was told our table would be ready at 7:45.  We arrived around 7:40 and the place was packed, which is to be expected at any respectable dining choice within a stone's throw of a mall the week before Christmas!  I checked in with the girl at the door and she gave me one of those buzzer things.  We waited about 25 minutes before I asked the hostess how much longer we could expect to wait. I wasn't in any hurry, just genuinely curious since it seemed my online \"spot\" in the \"line\" meant nada.  She said they were just waiting for some parties to leave so they could seat those of us still waiting.  Noticing some empty seats at the bar, I told her that was ok and to go ahead and take us off the list.  Service at the bar was great, the two bartenders that waited on us were attentive and extremely nice.  All of our food all arrived SUPER fast, which blew me away considering how busy they were!  The food is always good, so no complaints there.  The decor in this location is really neat, and rather updated compared to the long-standing Outbacks I frequent here at home.  I'm glad to have this place so close to where I stay when I'm in town for work and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just as good / bad as all others depending on your experience.  Personally I think for the price this is a great deal.  This time I tried the Steak & Lobster, I had the lobster grill what a pleasant surprise. The bartender was very nice, and overall this is my second time hear and I think it is a good store overall."}
{"text":"I definitely should have looked this Outback up on Yelp before I went in, it would have saved me some trouble and disappointment. After seeing all of the low reviews and no response from the management, it is obvious they don't care about making things right.  So... my experience was right on par with many of the others, food lacking flavor, absent if not rude staff, and a feeling of regret for stopping."}
{"text":"We got seated right away. Took 15 mins to place drink orders then waiter disappeared for 20 mins before taking our food order. I almost walked out it was such bad service. Took 25 mins for food to come and my order was WRONG! We asked for BBQ sauce three times from three different waiters and it never came. Rediculous! The service was unbelievably bad. I left a $0 tip!"}
{"text":"Great service . Waiter \"mike\" went well beyond . Asked every detail of each item and had it exactly The way we wanted. Food came out in a timely manner and was delicious. We come here once a month kids and family love it. Can't go wrong for the price."}
{"text":"Should  have known better  than  to  have  throw back steak. Tough chewy. Crab cakes reminded me of potato  pancakes."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was pretty bad....our son ordered ribs and they were the worst ribs he has ever had....not impressed.  Probably won't be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"2 stars for good service although the hostess skipped us even though we did the \"call ahead\"  The food at outback is mediocre at best. I never order steak there bc it doesn't measure up to Flemings, Mastros etc. Mahi mahi is dry.  Cesar salad w chicken ( precooked slices) was bland.  Cheese fries w ranch are great when yr drunk."}
{"text":"I love coming to outback I have to drive out to north Scottsdale since they close the one near my home. It was worth the drive never disappointed and they're delicious food. Great service by David our waiter."}
{"text":"Came really late last night with my little brothers basketball team at about 10 oclock. Me and my friends were kinda bummed cause we were supposed to go to the rio buffet but ended up here.. But when we got there the service was amazing. Got us seated with about 40 of us really quickly. Was able to split the bill according to each players jersey number.  Also what really got me and my table particulary out of our bumm mood was the waitress I believe whose name was Shawndra. She just lightened the mood, got our food out quicker, and was able to play along with our jokes. Pretty much all good vibes from her and really deserved a big tip. Anyhow we stayed about 2 hours after closing time and they still kept the good attitude and everyone had a great time."}
{"text":"Service was good. Price was not bad. No wait time. I had a ribeye steak. It was cook correctly and Mac and cheese too much bread crumbs. Mango ice tea taste great"}
{"text":"GREAT service!!!! Great food! Did have to wait a bit, not for too long though and it was made up to us with a discount which we did not ask for or expect. Thought that was very thoughtful of them! Thanks again! We will definitely be dining here again and also recommending to others!!"}
{"text":"Well we came here on a busy Veterans day with a 90 year old Veteran it is also his birthday. You get a free blooming onion and Jeff threw an overcooked one at us before he brought our beverages. The sauce is spicy and we needed something to drink. Waited  finally came back with drinks. Then as our WW11 Vet was ordering he commented that \"If you don't want to pay extra not to order extra! 2 of our party ordered chopped salads and only one came. Rosy brought our meals and kindly asked if we needed anything else, she was very nice. Jeff is either in training or not waiter material. because when people tell you they are celebrating an occasion your job is to have a personality enough, to at least acknowledge the celebration and help the guests to enjoy it, not become annoyed.  The prime rib was excellent. Giving a lower score because service is as important as the food."}
{"text":"Super fresh bread,  the fish tacos were overloaded! Not a bad thing! Solid drink  and a cold beer.  A nice easy casual dinner. Sat in the bar area,  waitress with a really nice attitude (Kathryn) good job."}
{"text":"Came in last night for FREE Blooming Onions. We went straight to the bar area and ordered our onion, mushrooms and two side salads.   First off the Blooming Onion is always looks fantastic but that sauce is horrible. I get that some people like horseradish but to me it's a taste that I can never get out of my mouth. I don't know who you folks are that like horseradish, but I just can't trust you.   The mushrooms were awesome as always! We even took half of the order home and warmed them up in the oven for a snack.  However, the salads were kind of pathetic and not worth $3.99 each. I loved the croutons though. But, the salad was very small with cheap iceburg lettuce.   Service was top notch. We never went without a refill and he checked back after everything he brought us."}
{"text":"Outback is one of those places that we go when we don't want to be adventurous. No matter which Outback Steakhouse you visit, you know what you are going to get. Will it knock your socks off? Nah. Is it Michelin Star worthy? Nope. Will they bring you that yummy bread? You betcha. My suggestions... Ask for honey butter with the bread and order the coconut shrimp.  Pro tip: Make sure you use call-ahead/online system to save yourself some wait time Bonus pro tip: Open seating in the bar area!"}
{"text":"The food is usually decent to above average but nothing remarkable. Outback will never be your best meal. Just as their name implies, I would get the steak and prevent the imminent disappointment of an alternative mediocre dish. Kudos to their bread and cheesy fries though, they're not bad at all.  Most items on the menu seem a tad overpriced and the service is usually slow. They're so packed on a Friday or Saturday night that you can forget about having less than a 45 minute wait, which is astounding considering how mediocre this Outback is.   Most dishes are filled with an overabundance of cheese and butter, and I always have a mild stomach ache a couple hours after I eat there whether it's chicken, a burger, or pasta. Kinda the same effect I feel after eating at Mickey D's. But at least I can give Mcdonald's some leniency because I didn't pay $15 to eat there.  You could do worse, but there are so many more worthwhile options if you're willing to drive ten minutes off of Independence Blvd."}
{"text":"Chain restaurants are generally not my favorite.  Although,  after a night out with my family at this Tempe location...pleasantly surprised!  The interior decor has been modernized.  Dark wood and art work add to the atmosphere.  Host friendly, server efficient and the food very good!  We ordered the porterhouse,  sirloin and small ribeye. All medium,  and cooked to tender,  juicy perfection.  Again,  pleasantly surprised,  and I think you will be too!"}
{"text":"Great music, good service (our server was very accomodating/attentive-always checking on us), reasonable pricing ($26 for a New York steak), and delicious food (my steak wasn't the best I've ever had BUT definitely yummy and hit the spot after a long day at the pool).  I would definitely come back next year."}
{"text":"We have experience a bunch of really shity bartenders in Vegas this week. Then we came to Outback Steakhouse. I wasn't expecting much but Mrs Derek Carr made us the best drinks we've had in awhile. She recommended the steak and it was cooked perfectly melt-in-your-mouth New York strip and the cobb salad was awesome as well. We like the drinks so much we ordered even a couple of doubles to go because some of the other bartenders in this town suck ass!"}
{"text":"So I've been to the Outback (all over, not just this one) and I have to say that the typical experience we've had at Outback (which is usually in the 4-star range) is not what we've experienced here.    We've been to this Outback probably 4 times in the past 2 years.  Unfortunately, our experiences have been consistently sub-par, and it appears that we are not alone in noticing this (often no wait on friday or Saturday night).  For whatever reason, at this particular Outback te service is consistently slow and poor, even when the resturant is only half full.  Incorrect orders probably 20% of the time, forgetting to come back and check on how food was, forgetting to hit refills on drinks, forgetting that an appetizer was ordered... it just goes on and on.  Very frustrating.  On the plus side, I'd say that the food is usually on par with what you'd expect form Outback.  Steaks were usually good and cooked correctly, sides were acceptable, however seafood add-ons' were kind of meh.  I was on the fence between 2 and 3 stars, but after considering where the bar is around here, there are just too many other good options for a steakhouse to say this was a middle of the road performance, esepcially with mutiple experiences contributing to this review.  Disappinting considerng that Outback has always been one of our family's and my parents' favorites, but this location just has not cut it for us.  Hopefully they'll make the changes required to return to the quality we'd expect from the Outback."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Outback in the country. Wait staff can't get order right- misses appetizer blooming onion then provides a bogus gift card that manager catches when apologizing for the worst looking over cooked filet ever. Side items don't come with meals. Replacement steak totally well done rather than medium well. Bus staff literally drags trays of dirty dishes on tray stands thru the restaurant.  Save your money go anywhere else."}
{"text":"IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, EAT DEEP FRIED ONION & DRINK BEER  Yes, I'm reviewing Outback Steakhouse in all its Outbacky Chain-a-licious goodness.  It was 120 freakin' degrees AT NIGHT this weekend in Vegas, and  I was about to lose consciousness when my survival instincts kicked in and told me to find the nearest air conditioned place serving ice-cold beer and a deep friend onion.    Enter Outback Steakhouse.  Most Outbacks are 3-star kinda places, but this one was exceptional.  The server was fun and friendly despite my party showing up 20 minutes before closing time, my chicken sandwich was char-grilled to juicy perfection, and best of all they now offer REAL Australian beers like Tooheys New and my favorite, Boags."}
{"text":"I was really bummed I couldn't make the Yelp event here last week, so between seeing all the pictures and having friends that have told me how good this location is compared to the old one, I had to see it for myself!  I'm going to make a small assumption and say that most people who go out for dinner are expecting good food and service, but probably aren't thinking \"I hope this is the best service experience ever!\" Well I'm really trying to think of a time that my expectations were so blown away and I'm truly coming up short. I've eaten at a lot of Outback restaurants and there are definitely good ones and bad ones. This isn't just a good one, it's a jewel!  Dad's Birthday! Arrived at 6:30 on a very busy Sunday night. Judging by the parking lot, it's looking pretty slammed. This Outback, however, was well designed with the heavy traffic location in mind. To my surprise, they had a table for my party of five as soon as we arrived. Our waitress Megan got to our table with warm bread before we even got our coats off and our drink orders arrived in about a minute.  Let's start with appetizers, which were very noteworthy, even for such long-established Outback usuals: Bloomin' Onion and Coconut Shrimp. The Bloomin' Onion, I'm going to be honest, I was against getting this because it's been so greasy at every Outback I've ever ordered it at! But the table voted against me and I'm glad they did, it was perfect. Terrific breading that was crispy and well seasoned, minimal oil. I wasn't even aware it was supposed to be this way, I just assumed it should be greasy this whole time. Coconut shrimp was fried in the same fashion and I must say that I'll probably get this next time as well.  Food was coming out at a great pace, a couple of minutes after we finished apps, our entrees were making their way to the table. My ribeye was a near perfect medium rare. Girlfriend's parmesan chicken, delicious. My Dad couldn't quit praising the lobster tail served with his steak and he just got back from a vacation in Maine where great lobster is around every corner!  As good as the food was, our dinner experience was brought to the next level because of the unprecedented service. Our waitress Megan, I don't know where to begin. Not a single cup went dry, one of my big pet peeves when we go out for dinner! Every request was accommodated and all our questions were answered. She checked in our table so often you would have thought we were the only party in the restaurant! I can't say enough good things about Megan, she's a true professional. If anyone is looking for a fundamental definition of perfect service, just drop by this location and ask to sit in her section, I know I'll be doing so from now on!  I got a chance to meet the restaurant's Managing Partner Lindsey as well. I can tell that she takes a lot of pride in service excellence and her staff reflects this so well. This location is brand new so if you're wondering why the aggregate review score is so low, just know that Lindsey and her staff has turned things around with a new restaurant, new staff, and a new attitude. I'll be a regular here for sure.  At the end of the night, I was sitting at my table and trying to come up with some nit-pick negative to improve on, and came up empty. Highest acclaim to Megan, Lindsey, and all the staff at Outback who made my Dad's birthday such a memorable night!"}
{"text":"Excellent bartender and service at bar this evening.  He was busy, but very relaxed and continued his contact with his customers."}
{"text":"the service wasn't to good. they didn't bring us any silverware. they didn't bring us the bread out. when the meal came out they didn't ask if we needed any sauce or checked to see if we had any silverwares. i ordered the filet n lobster, i asked for the steak to be medium but it came out burnt. the fries were soggy. the lobster was super salty. i'm so so disappointed in outback"}
{"text":"Recently Outback's portions have decreased, even their plate sizes.  Their salad w/ ranch is good.  Tonight was the 2nd time I've had to send a steak back.  It was spoiled.    Service was great, food not so much.  We are done with Outback."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular Outback twice in the past week due to Scottish family in town who are OBSESSED with this place  They're Scottish, who knows....  Well, at first I was skeptical.  But I thought the food was suprisingly tasty!  The second time, I'M IN LOVE!  I LOVE OUTBACK  Sweet chain steakhouse, how I love thee.  I swear their stupid horseradish crusted filet was just as good as the damned Flemings/RuthsChris/Mortons filets.  I was impressed.  Damn good green beans too.  I love."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner Tuesday. Our server new but he did a great job.  We started out with the mushrooms off the bar menu which are always amazing, my bf ordered steak and lobster. Being from Maine he's very picky and unfortunately this lobster didn't meet his standards. Oddly enough he blamed the majority of the problem on the butter. He wouldn't order the lobster again but he would definitely order the filet, it was cooked perfectly.   I wasn't super hungry so I only ordered a baked potato and some mixed veggies. I appreciate they don't drown the veggies in butter."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is under new management but we just went here for my sons birthday because he loves their cheese fries and our experience this time was much worse than before. Our cheese fries were undercooked so they took them back and gave us a new order and then our steaks came out and were dry, old looking, and had zero flavor. We asked if we could have them seasoned a bit more and the manager came out without asking any questions and gave us a blank check saying he comped the whole meal but didn't even offer to remake anything, nothing! He was annoyed and wanted us out! I hate complaining at restaurants, especially on a special occasion, but nobody wants raw fries or dry old steak so what were we to do? I have never had anyone just negate the whole issue and not even ask if we wanted anything else. Sure it was nice of him to comp the meal, but really?! We had 4 little kids who were starving and he just wanted us out! Btw, we were one of 2 families in the whole restaurant so they were not busy at all! Just a bad experience and a very rude manager! Oh and the manager also made an excuse and said, \"oh yeah that might have happened bc we have a new chef in training!\" What?! So I guess it's ok then, right!"}
{"text":"Just left one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant.   We were seated pretty quickly but waited almost 15 minutes before I had to tell the hostess that no one had come to our table. Manager comes over and apologized and offer us a free appetizer for our issue.  Blooming onion was  horrible and burnt, but hey it was free so we didn't say anything.  We waited another 33 minutes before the food came out and it was cold, not Lukewarm cold.  I myself never complain as I believe how you treat wait staff is a good indication of what kind of person you are.   I said something to the waitress and she apologized and told us we didn't owe any money.   We left without eating and all four plates on the table untouched.   Worst experience ever !"}
{"text":"I give my experience at Outback two stars just because the server was nice and efficient.  I give my experience zero stars because of the food.  I ate here because I had an Outback gift card. I waited for 30+ minutes for a table for two. (Why are there so many people wanting to eat at Outback?!)  We ate the crab/avocado stack appetizer and two entrees. The only redeeming quality of the appetizer was the looks. A food stacker was used to create the layers of crab and avocado. But the dip itself lacked flavor, and it was served with bland tortilla chips. So there was really nothing interesting at all.  My husband's entree was pretty average. I actually found myself picking out the sauteed mushrooms in my tilapia/crab meat entree since the mushrooms tasted very old and/or canned. Ick, ick.   I'm so glad I had an Outback gift card to use to pay for my meal instead of paying out-of-pocket for dinner. No way was my meal at Outback worth the cost.  I won't eat here again. And if I receive an Outback gift card again, I plan to re-gift it!    On a side note: the carpeting here is gross. It looks worn and dirty in main walkway areas. No wonder Outback keeps its lights dim -- I can't imagine what the carpet looks like with the lights turned on! :-O"}
{"text":"Yum!! Great food. Great service (Alice was fantastic!) The all you can eat shrimp was soo good. The garlic butter shrimp is what I recommend.  We will be back"}
{"text":"The service was great. And that's what made this place worth the 3 stars.  It took 45 minutes for food at lunchtime.  The lighting was extremely dark.  The food wasn't even that great, however those who ate the blooming onion said it was good."}
{"text":"Went there the other night, the waitress literally handed all three of us filthy, greesy plates. We were all stunned. The Arnold Palmers were terrible, weak. I know its a steakhouse, but Ahi tuna is on the menu, so I order it. Absolutely no taste at all. About as weak as the Arnold Palmer. Mac and cheese, WEAK. My daughter plate looked disgusting, she had mashed potatoes and taliapia with crab, I think she left half of it on the plate. My husbands steak didnt look bad. I will not go back here. Too many excellent restaurant to spend my money and my experience on."}
{"text":"I'm writing this to recognize one of your outstanding employees. His name is Noah Hopkins. My friend and I visit this location almost weekly and make an effort to visit whenever Noah is working. Noah remembers us, knows our favorite servers, and always makes sure to stop by our table and check up on us. This means a lot to me. Noah goes above and beyond by helping his fellow employees and greeting every customer with a smile. I stopped Noah tonight to ask him some questions, he's mentioned he's going to school to be a chemical engineer, wow that's impressive! He works at this location Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays while going to school full-time. Something I understand fully as I do the same. Noah is such a hard worker and I am sure he is a valued member of your team at the Champaign Outback, there's a lot of competition near by, but Noah keeps me going back to Outback. I'm not sure how to best have Noah recognized for his outstanding customer service, but I would really like for this to be acknowledged! Noah is a great kid and I hope you all recognize this and at only 18 he's one of the hardest workers I've ever met. Please be sure to share this with whomever is in charge of giving Noah praise! He's great and so is the manager Matt, he also takes time to make sure all is well! Thanks for being my regular dinner outing Outback and thanks for having great team members like Noah represent your brand! Keep it up Noah, you're going far!!!"}
{"text":"Their service is great and the wait staff is very polite. The food has been very good the last few times I have been there. I will say thumbs up on Outback for sure - they seem consistent in many ways."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience, for starters we sit down the waitress comes to get our drink order, now mind you there is just two of us, we order our drinks five minutes later she comes back and only remembers one of the drinks, ok that's fine she told me she was pregnant and that she can't remember things. So we order our meal, I ordered chicken on the Barbie she brings me the Alice chicken, she tells me that the kitchen made it wrong so I checked the tabletop menu and she put the order in wrong. My husband has his food I told him just to start eating, he waiting for about 5 minutes I told him just to eat, so it doesn't get cold. He finished his food and I still have not received mine, I told the waitress just cancel my order he is done eating. So the manager comes over and says here is the chicken I know you told her you didn't want it, but I am not going to charge you for it.  Oh really wow why would you charge me if I didn't even get to eat. Our meal was ruined and you are willing to not charge me for chicken that I couldn't even enjoy. Horrible customer service. When you expect us, to pay that price point for a meal, it shouldn't be a TOTAL FAIL on your part. This is not how you retain customers, when you mess things up. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying the service was 5 star. The food is 4 star. We had a great lunch. Adam at the bar was our server, he gave excellent service, very friendly and sufficient. Never had to ask for any refills, he was on it. I will definitely go back, due to the great service Adam gave us. Thank you."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the call ahead seating that doesn't put you in the queue until you check in at the door. Called at 11am for 1:30 seating. When arrived told the wait would be 40 minutes because several large parties were waiting ahead of us. A table large enough to seat our party set empty for almost 30 minutes. We were ultimately set at that table and the manager told me when we were seated that he still had 4 minutes on the time they told us when we checked in at the door. As if that was supposed to appease me. NOT! The prime rib advertised on the \"Mums Day\" special was not available until after 3pm. No napkins or silverware after finally getting seated."}
{"text":"The service is great here . The beer is ice cold. I'm a vegetarian and this place is my favorite to come to because the salad here is clean and crisp"}
{"text":"After visiting twice and having my steak cooked wrong, twice, at a steakhouse, we are all done. Staff are inattentive and lack knowledge on how to wait tables. Many staff are here to hang out with friends, or at least that is the appearance. Btw, butter melts when the potato isnt cold. They got the bloomin' onion down, but thats about it."}
{"text":"Really nice bar for an Outback, as usual food is the standard delicious Outback fare"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I went in to reserve a table and they made me wait when there were tables open. The food was average but a better option compared to TGIF for dinner. I ordered the steak and had the unlimited shrimp."}
{"text":"My children love coming  for dinner here. Always great food and tasty desserts! I love their coconut shrimp - ymmy :-)"}
{"text":"Touted as the busiest Outback in the world.   I'm an Outback regular, but if this were my local OB, I certainly wouldn't be.   This OB has a very limited menu compared to other OB's, and the prices are greatly inflated. Our waitress ran around a LOT without actually getting anything done. She reminded me of someone who has certain substance habits & addictions.   Had to send food back to have it cooked properly, and when it came back, it was STILL raw. It was obvious to me that the grill was way too hot, as my steak was burned on the outside, but remained very raw inside.  Not a proper medium rare! I would NOT eat here again, and dissuaded several people I met from eating there. Some already had eaten there, and agreed with my assessment.   The \"Busiest Outback in the World\" is too busy for its own good. I will NOT be back to this Outback."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with my husband and son, food was not impressive. However, Our waitress was nice. My son had the shrimp and only ate a few bites as he said it was way too salty. My husband had steak and shrimp and said his shrimp were also was very salty. I had the prime rib and had to request a different cut of meat as it was way undercooked and had a poor flavor it basically wasn't cooked at all. The waitress was nice and brought out another steak but by the time it was brought out I had lost my interest and asked for a to go box. The blooming onion we ordered was also very greasy and too salty. What really topped it off was one of the managers, a male manager, coming over to make sure I was happy with the new steak, then as he was walking away saying \"let me know if there's anything else I can get you for free\". He said it in a very sarcastic manner. I was thinking did he really just say that? For free? Um I didn't touch the prime rib that was brought to me mooing on my plate and was brought another steak that I was charged for , so what was he even talking about. Our bill was over 100 for three people to not be happy with their food and on top of that , to leave with stomach aches due to the excessive grease and salt. We could have had much higher quality food for this price."}
{"text":"(March 10, 2017) 2nd time here...wanted to give it another shot because the first time was just \"mediocre\".   We decided on a late dinner (9pm) due to a late night at work.  We grabbed a seat at the bar (although there were many tables available) .  Here is where the low score BEGINS... There were 2 people behind the bar and it literally took 15+ minutes to even greet us, give us a menu, or even ask for our  drink order...mind you both ladies were available but not observant or cared. Finally one took our drink order then it literally took 25 minutes before they came back to get our food order. One of the 2 \"waitresses\" (there was really only one the blonde one... I hate to identify her by her hair BUT thats all we knew because no one introduced themself OR WORE A NAME TAG) that acknowledged us. **The brunette was more worried about talking to/flirting with a table of  3 men that was not even her \"table\" (AND comping their drinks while we were waiting for ours)!  The meal was good (I had the ribs and my hubby had a bone in ribeye) but once our food was delivered neither came back to us. They were more consumed with  CLEANING BEHIND THE BAR and chatting then they were WITH their customers. There was another couple next to us discussing the same issues. Although the food was ok we most likely will NOT be returning. When I go out to dinner and spend a pretty generpus amount...I expect my waitstaff to \"acknowledge\" me. Often the experience is what sticks in your mind more than the fiod itself and this experience (2nd time) was  horrible!!!!  I feel the management is to blame for this, as well. The waitstaff was totally clueless of what is expected in the \"service\" field.  Unfortunately  (for them) Ihave put in many years in this field and what we have received the past 2 times is UNACCEPTABLE and \"sub-par\" but my 2 waitresses wouldn't know of our dissatisfaction because they never paid any attention to us or our needs from the moment we walked in!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this Outback, we never have problems here with our food or the waiter staff. They are very attentive and make sure your well taken care of.   Their drinks could be a little stronger, BUT, it is a food chain so they are good for what you pay for. I recommend going during happy hour."}
{"text":"I use to like the steaks at this restaurant but today I went and I was very disappointed the rib eye steak I  had. It did  not have any  flavor it was very bland I kept putting salt to make it taste better but still it had a weird taste. The service was great our waitress was very nice and fast in bringing what we needed  I just did not like the steak."}
{"text":"We got a gift card for our anniversary and went here recently.  It was our first time ever going. The sayff was great  and the food was even better. I would definitely go here again and also recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Took a group of seven for dinner this past Sunday evening. All the steaks were flavorless and the 'All you can eat shrimp' was awful. Even the Bloomin Onion has gotten so small that two people can finish it easily. I've eaten here several times before and never really gotten a great meal, just okay. I think that I'm done trying."}
{"text":"Basically a good steakhouse overall. Just moved down here from the Chicago area and used to love the outback in calumet city, Il. But this one is a lil different. The food was good but the steak was kind of small. Did it shrink on the grill or what? I got a sirloin 6 oz. Didn't think 6 oz was that little. Wow. Anyway, the service from Tori H. was great. I just took off stars for the size of the steak."}
{"text":"Outback has completely changed over the past 2 years. The portions are smaller and the prices are higher. We used to order curbside all the time- but now we go across the street to Famous Dave's. The only reason I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because there wasn't anything wrong with the way the food tasted and the girl at the curbside was very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Always great service, great food and great drinks.  I love the atmosphere and ambiance and I highly recommend this to anyone who likes steak and drinks.    It's well priced and well cooked."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it but I had a good meal at the Outback last night.  It's a good thing we arrived early, around 5:30 on a Friday evening. By the time we left the place was at capacity with at least a 45 minute wait. I had a cup of potato soup - NY Strip Steak - naked potato and a Guinness. My wife had a Caesar salad- steamed lobster tails and broccoli. I've had  had the soup before, I thought it tasted very good but could have been hotter. My steak was served at the temp I ordered and very tender.  My wife seemed to enjoy her meal but let's not confuse this with a fine seafood restaurant.  The star rating is based on a chain steak restaurant. I've eaten at some of the best Steak houses in NYC so let's not confuse the rating. I always base the stars on the type of establishment - not against all other restaurants. The service was ok,not bad, but not great. I think the server was hit with all his tables at the same time. The Guinness was 5 star."}
{"text":"God consistent service at this location. It's clean and they run some pretty good drink and bar specials. We came twice during the week and never had to wait and the staff is always attentive."}
{"text":"So dissatisfied with my waiter and the manager Doug. My boyfriend and I stopped in the restaurant yesterday afternoon for an early dinner. I chose Outback Steak house because I was craving pasta real bad . My boyfriend also wanted pasta but with shrimp. He ordered the Queensland pasta with chicken and shrimp. I ordered the loaded potato soup to start with because I was extremely hungry. The pasta I ordered was no longer offered on the menu it comes with chicken and seasonal vegetables. When my soup came out it was really salty. Both pastas were also extremely spicy and not good at all. My boyfriend specifically told our waiter ahead of time that he needed his pasta pretty plain with no seasoning even the chicken and shrimp because he's on a special diet and diagnosed with diverticulitis. He couldn't even see his shrimp because of all the Cajun seasoning that was all over it . He was damn near choking and he had to stop eating it due to concern that his blood pressure would spike. I couldn't take any more bites of mind either it made my nose run and I was coughing. I usually can take a little heat or spice but this was just awful. We asked our waitress to take the food back we were soo disappointed and asked to speak to the manager. The manager came to our table and told us the biggest excuse that didn't make sense, He advised us that corporate told the cooks to add more seasoning because customers were complaining about not having enough seasoning on their food. WTH? Dumb excuse did he think we were stupid what an insult to our intelligence. That's not the icing on the cake he told us to try Bells Bar B Q on the east side of Las Vegas . He kept telling us over and over to try them they have Amazing bar b q and tell them Dougie Fresh sent you - I can't make this up he was the spokesperson for Bells Bar b Q but the manager for Outback . Why would you recommend a competitor smh - We ended up after all the madness only being offered a credit for the two pastas but I was charged for my soup . Bad part is they had unlimited soup and salad for $6.99 that wasn't even mentioned or offered by our waitress . My boyfriends phone has an app that notifies him at any restaurant what specials are offered . She dropped the ball also. We ended up leaving and going to the nearest Smiths Grocery Store to get my boyfriend some fresh salmon and shrimp . I ended up getting fresh rotini pasta from the deli. Very dissatisfied with our meals and don't ever go back to Outback something's definitely Off . The food isn't good anymore . Corporate needs to investigate what's going on in their kitchens and get better managers ."}
{"text":"I've been to this Outback more times than I can count. It is one our regular choices when we crave steak and don't feel like firing up the grill ourselves. I am giving it a solid 3 because its nothing phenomenal yet at the same time it is good. However, this might be due to the fact that every time my boyfriend and I go we are already very hungry. I'm not a big fan of any of their appetizers but they are not bad. I like both the French onion soup and the baked potato soup. Particularly cause I am not good at making soup at home. I like beef a lot. Specifically I like prime rib. They always get it perfectly medium rare. And my bf tells me his sirloin is always good. The service waivers between very fast and sorta slow. Somedays I order a margarita and it is the first thing the server brings, other days it shows up a quarterway through my entree.  I have never had a bad experience here (other than a wet booth seat). My biggest complaints would be the lighting is so dim and there are too many children. However, I really can't fault them for that since it is a family-oriented chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered the Austin 4. Steak was cooked perfecrly, potato soup was amazing, and the cheesecake was great. The salad was meh... but you can't ask for everything in a to-go order to be perfect."}
{"text":"Poor service and dirty....not your typical Outback.  Someone cleaned off a table and pushed all food and straw paper right on to floor....never cleaned it and sat someone there.  Food is ok, yet not the best one we've been to.  Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Well dang. I have always liked their food but a few serious things went wrong today and sadly I probably will not be back. The waitress that served me today continually interrupts your conversation to blurt out \"How is everything?\" What happened to the day they would clear dishes (she walked away without taking the dirty dishes with her) and make their presence known but not interrupt people while they are deep in discussion? Topic for next staff meeting: don't interrupt customers conversations while they are dining. Approach quietly, wait to be recognized, then speak. Or slowly cruise around so if anyone needs something you are available, but don't just barge into someone's conversation \"IS IT GOOD?\" ugh :(  Lastly, there was a hair in my salad. It was at the very bottom and it was odd because my friend and I were just talking about how the salad dressing was at the bottom .. like someone put the salad dressing in first then put everything on top of it. Low and behold, I am looking into my dish and there is a crazy looking hair.  Ugh. Pic attached.  I let the server know. She apologized and took it away. I was in shock so I just sat quietly, you know you start to look around like is there hair in my other food? Or drink? LOL  Then a manager comes up, saying his name is Doug. He apologized and let me know my meal charge has been removed from the tab. He says we can get any dessert we want, no charge. We said it was okay and he said if we needed anything else to let him know. We talked briefly about hair nets and Doug said everyone there wears them in the kitchen including beard nets, but our server had long hair that was not in a net so it kind of confused me.  We paid the bill and left. We didn't take him up on a free dessert. They removed the charge for my lunch off the bill, but we still paid for my guests lunch and both of our non-alcoholic beverages.  I don't see myself going back there."}
{"text":"The steaks here are as good or better than the high priced steakhouses.  The sides don't quite live up, but those steaks are to die for.  The service is quick and friendly.  The drinks are generous.  Yes, it is a chain and it looks like a chain, but if close your eyes and pretend that you're eating someplace where the steaks cost 3 times as much you won't know the difference.  Or is that cheating?  Anyway, for everyday eats, this is my favorite."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our staple \"go to\" restaurants  for just a good all round, nothing fancy meal.  We went last week after some time hoping for the same good basic dinner and boy did we get a shock!!  We were absolutely and completely disappointed wit the quality of the food.  Not sure what they have done to their menu as far as quality control but my husband ordered the prime rib which was tough and stringy and I had the rib eye, both usually very tender and tasty but not this time.  I had also ordered a caesar salad to be served with my steak and it was brought out first which always irritates me as it is simply lack of attention to detail.  Get back to where you used to be Outback - we won't be going back any time soon"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service this evening. I've come to realize that the food quality is much better and accurate on a slower night. Dawn was great. Food came out right and delicious."}
{"text":"This is a typical cookie-cutter chain restaurant with even-keeled offerings, that serve a straightforward purpose. Sometimes you just want a consistent and predictable meal with no adventure. Well, no surprises here (good or bad): they serve a good steak and a cold beer. Service is always cheerful and prompt."}
{"text":"Outback Steakhouse is alright.  They have good salads.  That's about all I can say.  Their prices are decent if you just want the basic steak meal.  Overall, Meh.  I've experienced better."}
{"text":"This may be a franchise restaurant but they never fail to impress.    Well cooked steaks and absolutely amazing service at this location.  Thanks for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"It's a chain, what more should I say. I haven't been to an Outback in 10 years - not an exaggeration. I used to eat at this place in college and would always get sick. I had some worries attempting it again - however no sickness occurred, thank goodness. I got the pork chop which came with veggies and I swapped the mashed p's for a loaded baked p. That was a good choice.  The pork chop came with a tangy dipping sauce which was pretty tasty but the chop itself had too much salt and pepper on it, a bit overpowering.  The veggies were yummy, not soggy or over seasoned.  The loaded baked potato was cooked to perfection and had plenty of toppings (butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon bits, chives).  Our server seemed to be overwhelmed that night (it was Valentine's Day, they were super busy).  She took our drink orders and left right away ... didn't even wait to ask if we wanted to order.  As we paid our bill we heard a server next to us explain the specials to his table; some of them sounded really good - we didn't get that info! What gives?  Expect a long wait at prime dinner times, it is a tourist town with over priced restaurants on the strip - I'm sure the chain places near by make bank on people trying to save $$."}
{"text":"I love outback very good food with even better service from our beloved Las Vegas Locals staff!"}
{"text":"Great Way to Spend the 4th.  Been awhile since I've been to Outback and they have revamped the menu a bit.  Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.  My wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.  Only negative was the bread they served. It was a very dark bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.  My Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.  Service was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.  Atmosphere --- What can I say?  Typical Outback.  If you're in the Carolina Place Mall Area, this is a nice spot for Dinner and now Lunch"}
{"text":"Oh damn...that lamb was outstanding!!! The bone in ribeye was fantastic! Service was great! The mixed drinks were up to par, once I switched to beer, it was perfect!"}
{"text":"While our server was good, the kitchen service was not.  Call ahead service worked well for us.  Hostess was friendly.  But, we had several things go wrong with our order, we did not get things requested (condiments/bread/etc), and the food was mediocre.  It appears that those that bring food to the table, do JUST that.  They run food from the kitchen to the tables while they are not the table's server.  When we didn't get the things we had requested, we would have to flag down our server and she would have to try to get what we needed only to be told that the items had already been delivered to our table, when it had NOT.   It was a confusing mess! Prime rib was good.  Ribs were good.  FF were WARM and potato soup was watered down.  We were disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today. Tony was amazing and polite! And he also took the time to help me with my phone.....I'll be back next Sunday...."}
{"text":"Cutest waitor ever, \"Jonathan d\" says my receipt. He was so nice and was great. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went to this establishment again. Not sure why their ratings are so low. I'm always satisfied when I go. Lashaneeka was our server. She was friendly and attentive. Can never go wrong with the Porterhouse. Devoured it!! Cooked to perfection with an excellent taste. Certainly will go back."}
{"text":"Me and my family have many weekend dinners here. Never disappointed! The service is excellent. The management is excellent! We almost always get the coconut shrimp app is always devoured. All the steaks we order are tender and juicy. I've only had to return one steak that was overcooked and they brought another that was miraculous. The house salad is so good, better than most restaurant house salads and so is the dressing. Bravo Outback! We can't wait to come again! I would like to try your hamburgers sometimes but are always out tempted by the savory steaks."}
{"text":"Outback is one of my favorite places for a steak and they did not disappoint. Everything fresh and cooked perfect ,  love the spice and combined with broccoli , onions and mushrooms , one of my favorite meals."}
{"text":"Great family lunch day spent at Outback. Sarah was so nice and had great service.  Her smile was contagious."}
{"text":"Love the tilapia with lump crabmeat and it has less then 600 calories. I've never had bad service at this location staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Sooooooo went to eat here with my wife (not my first choice personally) but have to say that I ordered a burger and was very impressed. Wasn't expecting it to be anything but your normal hamburger but i was very amazed with it. Super juicy and great flavor. If I go back it won't be a steak that I order!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at an Outback Steakhouse and wow am I pleasantly impressed! The place was packed on Valentine's night. Great service, clean, fun and enjoyable atmosphere, and convenient location. Not only was there a good variety to choose from on the menu but the quality was excellent. Not pricey either! Definitely coming back! Be sure to try the Blumin Onion..OMG :-)"}
{"text":"Big Letdown from the Yelp Event I went to here.  Several weeks ago, I went to a Yelp Event here and was totally blown away with the new menu items and the phenomenal service. I gave the even an excellent rating because it was and well deserved and came back today to check out the restaurant under normal operations.  Sad to say, it did not meet expectation.  Service was slow, particular at the end when we were trying to check out. Service was also not accurate serving my wife a baked potato when she ordered potato soup and the quality of my Crispy Chicken Sandwich was just not there.  To expand, we drove down from Cornelius today for and early lunch. Got there about 11:30 and were promptly seated. No problems so far.  Our server presented herself and we ordered out beverages and my wife ordered a cocktail to go with her lunch.  When our drinks were served, we ordered out lunch.  I upgraded to a Premium Blue Cheese Wedge Salad and for my entree, I ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich.  My wife ordered the small Alice Springs Filet with Asparagus and Potato Soup.  Potato Soup came out as Baked Potato and had to be corrected.  My Wedge was good but quite frankly, I'm used to the Salad Course being served prior to the main course, not with.  The Crispy Chicken Sandwich was a bit too much crispy as the photo will show.  A bit of breading makes for a Crispy Chicken but when the depth of the Breading is twice the thickness of the Chicken, it's a bit much.  The Chicken Breast as such did not have a great resilient texture and left much to be desired.  Finally when it came time to settle the bill, I gave the server my Credit Card and she was gone for over 10 minutes. At this time, the restaurant, still had not gotten busy so no reason to explain the delay.  I had hopes for this place after the great initial experience but now I don't know.  Time will tell"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! If i could guve negative stars i would. This us the 3rd time (shame on us) we have gone there and received such bad service. Took 20 mins to get out drinks, almost and hour for food to be delivered.. cold!! We sent it back and left. Never going back again and will make sure as many people know not to go there."}
{"text":"Tonight i ordered their Wednesday Special deal and picked it up at their very convenient carryout pickup.  They bring it right to your car! A very nice, fresh house salad with ranch, fresh mini loaf of bread, french fries, steak and dessert.  All for $16.99. I was VERY pleasantly surprised with the steak.  I ordered the 9oz sirloin.  If i didn't know better i would have thought it was a filet mignon.  It was a very thick, round cut.  Cooked exactly as ordered - medium rare.  Perfect. Very tender, juicy and flavorful. Are you guys sure you didn't give me a filet by mistake? Delicious!  Outback - thank you for offering such a nice meal at a very affordable price. My food was packed with care and the drive up pickup is great!"}
{"text":"Meh! Too much salt on foods. Cleanliness is poor. I used the bathroom to clean up and I felt worse after washing up. Everything was greasy. Ugh!!! Nice employees. You can't really expect much from an average place. Sorry."}
{"text":"Extremely busy at the time I was there so took a seat in the bar area. It took a while to get my food which was understandable but the wait staff were attentive and kept drinks full. The New York strip was excellent along with all the rest of the food. Outback never disappoints and the French Onion soup is awesome!!"}
{"text":"This review is not so much directed at this Outback on Sahara in Las Vegas as it is to the chain itself.  The service was prompt and very good.  Our servers were courteous and helpful.  The modest review is because it just does not seem that one beer, two potato's, two relatively small steaks (modest quality and a bit over seasoned for my taste) and two small dinner salads should cost just under $70.00.  We used to own several small business where food was served and it put me off no end to have customers criticize our prices.  So I'm on thin ice here.  If I could have sold items for less and made a decent living I would have done so.  I'm sure if Outback could sell for less and turn a profit for shareholders they would.  That said, I'm going to have to vote with my feet and wallet in the future and give a pass to the Outback in favor of other alternatives when on the road traveling.  Sorry Outback.... as they said on  Seinfeld...\"it's not you it's me.\""}
{"text":"One of the newer additions to Concord Mills but a welcome addition.  Last Saturday my wife and I drove over to Outback for a nice quite lunch. Had been a rough morning and we just needed to get away to a quite place and have a good meal we did not have to cook.  I chose this Outback because my wife loves the chain and we had never tried this location. It's one of three restaurants that have been built in the parking lot of Concord Mills within the last 8 months with the other two being Bonefish and Chilpotle.  Maybe building a restaurant in the Concord Mills parking lot was not such a good idea because parking becomes a premium and none of the three restaurants were packed at least during lunch.  Walked in an were promptly seated, menu's presented and orders taken. Excellent Service.  Finally a chance to relax after a hectic morning so my wife ordered a Wallaby  Darn which is their version of a Peach Bellini. which she enjoyed.  My wife ordered her favorite which was a Victoria's Filet Mignon with Aspargus as a side. I ordered The Bloomin' Burger which is Burger with Cheese Sauce, Peppers and Blooming Onion Petals.  Both were excellent although a bit more spicy that expected. Found this interesting because even the Filet was spicy which is not what we normally find.  It's a new restaurant so everything is still clean and fresh.  Being a chain, not all are created equal but if you can find a parking spot, this one is worth the stop."}
{"text":"Good for Lunch after Church.  Gone for Lunch a couple of times here but first time going after Church.  Had a few minutes to kill since they don't open till 11 am but as soon as the doors opened, we were immediately seated.  Wait Staff was a bit slow at the start but not unusual just after opening but quickly improved.  I ordered the Steak and Lobster Tail with Baked Potato which my wife had her Alice Springs Chicken.  Both were good although the rub they use on the steak could be toned down a bit.  Nice fax Aussie atmosphere but still a fun place."}
{"text":"Take away went above and beyond last night (Valentines Day!) We ordered food right at the height of rush hour so when we pulled into a parking spot, there were so many people waiting by the door that no one came out to the car. After 20 mins we decided to call and the mgr came out to speak to us. It seems our order was lost online. She took our order, got us some sodas for waiting and even threw in some extra shrimp. About 30 mins went by and the waitress came out and said she found our order but since it was cold, they were going to give us two orders and charge for the one. Totally not necessary but greatly appreciated! Circle of stars!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy as always, yet Lainisha the waitress was the slowest waitress I've had in a very long time. She has a great personality, but she lacks in her ability to hustle."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. We are regulars and we love it. Prime rib is the best. Waiter was terrific.  Always a pleasure having dinner with the family. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"The Prime Rib is out of this world ordered the 16 ounce medium rare, tender as could be. Megan took great care of us drinks were perfect. Extremely satisfied and you will be too. What a pleasure outstanding food great atmosphere friendly wait staff  we will be regulars at this location for sure. Thank you thank you"}
{"text":"I'm impressed by this Outback. We had great food and great service tonight. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin (perfectly cooked) with a sweet potato, broccoli, and a side of sautéed mushrooms and onions. I'd gladly come back."}
{"text":"I was a regular at Outback Steakhouse Metro Center while in Phoenix for a few months and it was easy to see why with such fantastic service and good food.  The atmosphere of this particular Outback is very friendly with the staff always polite, friendly, helpful and happy.  Shelly, Tiffanny and co behind the bar are great and chose to eat all my meals there with some friendly banter.  Will always return when in AZ"}
{"text":"Monday at 530.   Waited 20 minutes for a server that never came.   After watching several people get waited on and no-one acknowledge us, we took our money else where.   Hostess was nice enough to tell us manager name was John but didn't get him for us or provide us with a server.   Too many places to eat.  No excuse to spend on advertising and not deliver service..  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"}
{"text":"Ha.  Just saw my review from 8 months ago. Good hasn't gotten any better. I'm done with this place    And went back today and it still bad"}
{"text":"consisently good food and drinks"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant. My boyfriend loves their food and their customer service and I wasn't disappointed. I highly recommend the Filet Mignon  and lobster, also the veggies were perfectly cooked. Our server was great.  Also, that Friday night I forgot my reading and Oakley sunglasses (a gift from my boyfriend). I called Saturday morning asking for them with no luck but they kept my phone number and the next day Dominique The manager called me with the great news they found it. I can't tell how happy was! My boyfriend and I will try other parts of the menu next week, can't wait!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! However the staff was less then stellar.  In my opinion everyone I saw had a \"I have better places to be\" attitude. No one smiled and at least faked happy, instead giving off the impression they just got chewed out. Our waitress was polite but very unpersonable and didn't care until she heard my dad mention the tip counter going down."}
{"text":"Quick service and super yummy food. The server took good care of us. Especially knowing it was horribly hot outside. He kept our water glasses full. The food came quick and it was wonderful. Only thing I'd suggest them to figure out is the waiting area. It's way to small and not designed to accommodate people. They should re think that whole set up by the elevators."}
{"text":"This outback location is a hit and miss for me. Don't get me wrong, they have excellent staff, but what concerns me is the staff in the kitchen. Every time I have gone here, there is always one thing that is terribly off with something on my plate. For example, last night, I ordered a outback special with fries and a baked potato. Without a single doubt, they always end up giving me doc or seven little, brown, soggy fries. Sometimes it's the main food dish being terribly cold, or under cooked. These are my only complaints. I'll still go back in hopes for a better outcome."}
{"text":"I honesty just come to Outback Steakhouse for their complementary bread! Who doesn't love the bread!?   Usually coming here the service is on the slower side, but on my last visit we came close to closing time so they decided to pick up their speed. So I suggest to come at around that time. There was special going on for steak and lobster for $14.99. You had me at \"$14.99\".  It was a good portion of a steak, 6 oz sirloin. I'm really not a heavy eater so that fit me just fine. I got the sweet potato as my side. OH MY GOODNESS, that was so delicious. It comes out warm, With honey butter & brown sugar on top. Those 3 together-- I can eat it all day!"}
{"text":"Ms. Cynthia is the absolute best server ever. She's very attentive. She knew what we needed without us asking for it. I will return."}
{"text":"I have to say I don't like the steak with unlimited shrimp thing. The steak is bad because of the beef they choose rather than the way they cook. I admit that the waiter here is very nice but I think the most important factor for a good restaurant is the taste of food. I will not come again."}
{"text":"I had a steak dinner for under $10 and it was really good.  And they give you as much free bread as you want."}
{"text":"Come here for date night often. Some of the staff are very friendly some not so friendly. Usually able to get right in at the bar area if there is a long wait in the main dining. You can also check in ahead online if you want to sit in the dining room. Petals are perfect if you can't eat a full blooming onion. Prime rib is tender. Ribeye sometimes is too fatty and grisly, but the Ribeye bone-in is very good. Bacon salmon is good, but definitely does not look like the picture in the menu. All is all it's what you expect from Outback. Good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worst food possibly ever. Ribs were so tough a fork could not go in them. Medium rare steak was more well done. Very tough. Blooming onion was practically desiccated. Martini was good and so was bread. Wait staff and managers were very nice and comped most of meal."}
{"text":"So we went this Saturday night and called ahead for a table for 5. We got in at a reasonable amount of time and was sat down at our table fairly quickly. The restaurant was pretty busy for a Saturday late evening. The wait for ordering and receiving our meals were SO long.  The kids were getting so antsy, hungry and fidgety that we almost left. When the waitress brought our food I asked for boxes right away so we could shorten our wait again. My children's fries where way over cooked, no salsa was available for my quesadilla and the onion bloom was over cooked. Not impressed at all for $70. 3 stars because the waitress was nice and understanding with my children."}
{"text":"I must say we had the best service from our waiter, Joseph.  He had an awesome sense of humor and checked on us without being overly pushy.  He had great suggestions about everything.  Drinks were prompt, followed by the bread and dinner.  It was all cooked perfectly.  I know you can get Outback practically anywhere, but ther service was stellar!!"}
{"text":"Sorry Outback you really disappointed me at this location. Outback is generally  my go to place when I'm out and about. First problem, I arrive at 11:45. I want the Outback Special 6 oz sirloin. They don't Offer 6 oz only a 20 oz. for $19.99. Really? I can't ear that much meat! So I settle For a prime rib sandwich. Second Problem, it took 30 minutes! The sandwich was served on an under baked roll. It cost $12.99, I should have opted for a Mc Rib! Third problem,  where is the beer? Terrible Selection. The server was nice, but not very good. I think I will call your main office to say how terrible this location is."}
{"text":"I don't know, but I remember Outback being better.  This place feels smaller than your usual Outback, which ended up on us waiting 25 minutes for a table on a Friday night.  It seems to me that Outback has began raising their prices, yet there really isn't anything unique on the menu.  Service was super slow the night we went because one of the cooks had called in sick.  Still, management did nothing to comp the clientele.  I may give Outback a second chance, but with Longhorn and Texas Roadhouse close by, I no longer feel I'm getting my best bang for my buck at Outback."}
{"text":"Have been there at least a dozen times and except for the line, the experience is always great.  Start with the blooming onion than if you are really hungry try the seared tuna.  The presentation and taste is amazing.  This trip I had the 12 oz strip and a baked sweet potato.  Lots of butter.  Giving it a 4/5 because the wait is usually quite long but the call ahead seating idea works if you remember.    Understand they are building a new location up the street near Ikea but it is not done yet."}
{"text":"Been here two or three times over the last year.  Each time has been solid.  Food and Service always on spot.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Outback Steakhouse for years and I loved the Butter churned dipping sauce they served with the crab legs & the Amazing churned hot fudge but I ate there tonight and they served me melted butter like oil and acted like it was normal like I was crazy for thinking it used to be different.  They can at least admit they ruined it to save money.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"I am posting this before I get my food because I was very disappointed by the actions of the hostess. Yes I came in 55 minutes before close asking for a table for one, you would've thought that I asked for a table for 100! She then proceeded to pull a server to the side and held a 3 minute discussion, not sure what it was about but I found that to be very unprofessional. I informed her that I would place an order to go since it seemed to a problem to seat one person in a modestly filled restaurant. It could be that I am tired but I did not appreciate that as my first impression of this establishment"}
{"text":"I'm going to give a description of the events that occurred at today's visit..   My mother and I walked In around 1pm we were instantly greeted by the hostess.. She seated us and gave us menus.. Her name is Jessica she was very professional and beautiful   Our server wasn't around so my mother went to wash her hands.. When she came back I went.(just to give you an estimate of how much time elapsed before we met our initial server) the host walked by and seated another group of older Caucasian women (we are African American and I hate to bring up race because I like to believe that it isn't a factor in everyday situations) the server Nicole greeted the older ladies first and and took their drink order. Then stopped at our table my mom ordered \"two ice teas with white sugar only.\" Those are her exact words because that's what she orders at every restaurant. So when she brought the drinks out she was serving 3 tables at once. She delivered our drinks second along with a side of the house pumpernickel bread.. She brought a tray of sweet and low  and equal and one tray with 4 white sugars in it with sweet and low and equal also in it. I went to ask for more white sugar and she walked away fast. Also the bread she served us was very hard. Imagine taking a bite out of a hockey puck. When she came back to take our orders (about 7 minutes later) I instantly felt rushed by her. My mom asked for more white sugar and then proceeded to order her steak and unlimited shrimp meal. I wanted the Cobb salad with grilled chicken. She asked me what kind of dressing I would like and I told her I didn't know then I asked what kind do you have. She said well what kind do I normally eat because they offer 14 different kinds and I told her I don't typically eat dressing could she list them. She seemed annoyed at this point and listed about 5 dressings at lightning speed. I asked if she had Italian dressing and she said \"no we have a honey mustard vinaigrette\"my mom asked if I had anything lighter like a raspberry vinaigrette she again said \"honey mustard vinaigrette\".. Instead of finishing listing the dressings she said \" well do you just want a Cesar\" I replied no I am pregnant I'm not supposed to have that. She says \"well my friends were pregnant and they ate sushi and their kids came out fine\" my mouth dropped to the floor.. I said that's ok I'll just have a steak like my moms. We never mentioned anything about sushi. It felt like she was pressuring me to hurry up and make a decision. Her vibe and attitude was terrible towards us. She left to put in our order and came back 3 minutes later with a cup of white sugar and slammed it on the table then walked away. We watched how she spoke amongst other guests and it was definitely different. She was slower and more friendly with them. (Again I don't like to think it was because we were black but there were no other African Americans in the restaurant to compare our service to.)   One of the managers came by her name was Krystal she asked was anything wrong and how she could fix the problem. My mom and I told her the situations that occurred and we mentioned that maybe Nicole is just having an off day. We are all women and I am in the service industry I totally understand when you're having a bad day. Maybe black people that come in the restaurant don't tip or maybe she is on her period my mom goes on trying to give her the benefit of the doubt before she throws her under the bus.. The manager sincerely apologized about her behavior and attitude towards us. She offered to give us a new server and new bread she also ensured that our food would come out fresh hot and clean..   She sent us a new server her name was Yulie. She was kind she came over with a smile and a nice conversation. She regularly checked on us and took very good care of us. She is the reason I even gave this place two stars. If we had her as our initial server we probably would have rated with 5 stars. She was efficient and accurate. She also made small jokes with my mom. She turned our experience around..  However Nicole never stopped by to apologize to us. She laughed and joked with all surrounding tables, which was fine with us, however, she would never learn from her actions because she was never held accountable for her behavior. All of her tables were surrounding ours and she wouldn't even look at us.. Overall she made our experience terrible. Nicole acted as if it was tough to serve black people. I was awed by the lack of respect shown to us as consumers.   Because of Nicole, we will never return. And we will pass our experience along to the black community that they are not welcomed at that establishment.     As we were leaving the hostess Alex opened the door for us and told us to have a wonderful day.."}
{"text":"The prime rib was OUTSTANDING!  The most tender I have had in awhile!  The asparagus was very favorable but the bigger thicker stocks.  The thiner stocks are better.  The French onion soup had kinda of a tomato flavor so not so good.  Very clean with ice cold beer.  So even with the couple of other things the prime rib just made it a 5 .  Do Not like the dumb kiosk at the table to pay!!!"}
{"text":"We just finished an amazing dinner at the Outback. I'm surprised at the 3 star rating of this restaurant when we just waited 50 minutes to be seated on a busy Friday night. I never want to eat at the restaurant that is not busy. Besides a great meal we had a fantastic server named Coady. He offered great advise on the menu, served us in a very prompt fashion and check back with us frequently.Thank you for a relaxing end to the week. Janet Thebarge"}
{"text":"My husband had a bone-in ribeye and I had the garlic medallions. The garlic sauce they put on those is delicious! Our server was very friendly and accommodating. Even though my husband miscommunication what he wanted as a topping (totally his fault), the server still brought us what he meant to order. The proprietor even stopped by to say hi and changed the lighting and music for us. Super yummy lunch, clean location, and friendly happy staff."}
{"text":"Just came in to eat with my family. The server completely got my order wrong after articulating myself completely. The order was wrong 3 times, first of all he didn't hear my order and brought me something else. I ordered the filet and I was brought the outback special which is a sirloin with a lobster tail. If he heard me \"wrong\" then he would of brought me a lobster tail which he did not. After cutting into my \"supposed to be\" medium well steak, it was medium rare. The manager brought it back out, I could hardly cut into what I thought was my \"filet\", tried to eat it and it was so tough I could barely chew it. I told my server, Greg, that I didn't think it was right and he then told me that he \"heard me wrong\" and that I ordered the \"outback special\". Which again, couldn't of even been due to the fact that I wasn't brought out a lobster tail. After trying to explain this situation to the manger on duty she looked at me like I was a hassle. After almost an hour, she brought me out a filet, without my side that I ordered. By that time I was so fed up with these issues I just told her I didn't want it. She pushed back and said, \"I just cooked you a new filet, and now you don't want it?\" I said yes, that's right. I explained to her that I don't understand how this could of been misunderstood too many times, and that I have been coming to outback for 12 years and never had an issue up until tonight. Neither my server or the manager was wearing a name tag either which is unprofessional from everyone else. I will never be back to this location and if I would of gotten her name, I would be calling the GM tomorrow. I am a food and beverage manager and this was the absolute worst experience I could of ever had in a food establishment."}
{"text":"Ordered curbside for pickup.  Person who delivered was friendly.  Took 30 mins to get there.  30 back. Got home and shrimp was missing.  Called to let manager know. Offered free appetizer.  I didn't get shrimp. Had to ask for a refund for something I did not get.  Botched that.  Love the chain though."}
{"text":"The secret to getting good service here is to talk to the waitstaff using a Crocodile Dundee accent.  They love it!"}
{"text":"I couldn't even eat my food it was really nasty. And all my  friends were in the same position. Not worth the money for crappy food, never going back."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE IN ARIZONA!!!! I've been through plenty throughout the valley but never have I received such treatment from an employee \"just trying to do his job\". So my friends and I went to get some drinks and food, and I being the more entauxicated in the group already primarily wanted some food with maybe a beer while my buddies, who were all sober prior to coming there, ordered themselves some beers with some food as well. Into our meal, after everything's been brought out and we're all enjoying ourselves, the waiter later comes over saying \"we've think you've had enough\" when I hadn't even had 1/4 of my beer and just takes it from me and says I need to find an uber home. At this time , friend who drove us there and had only a partial beer said he would be driving but the waitor \"didn't feel comfortable\" with that and that if we leaved \" he would call the police on us.\" So my friend who was driving, after paying, decides to leave and just stating walking before any police issues arise. My other sober friend and I, who are a little mm ore calm about things wait to make sure there's no issues with evading through police and we explain the situation to them and they completely understand and just let us go as long as we had a ride coming(which we did) and that was our friend from earlier who was waiting around the corner for us. So to make a long story short, FUCK YOU OUTBACK!! TEXAS ROADHOUSE IS WWWAAAAAAAAAYYYY BETTER in food AND service!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight for a small celebration.  We had registered with the seat-ahead feature, but got hungry and went a tad early.  We had been informed on line that there was no room before 6:30, but we walked in at 6 and the place was more than half empty. That said, service was great; the server knew a lot about the steaks and how they should be cooked.  She did, however, make comment about the fact that one of the party ordered loaded baked potato soup and also a baked potato with their entree.  Is it really her business? Steaks were good, cooked properly.  I had ordered blue cheese crumbles on mine, however, and what I got was a thick paste of blue cheese slathered on the top of the filet.  I had to scrape it off because I found it offensive.  The rest of the food - salad, soup, sides - were very good. Will I go back?  No, I think I'll find a not-so-assembly-line type steakhouse next time."}
{"text":"This outback is good! The service was a little slow and the loaded mashed potato's were cold. Other than that everything thing else was good!"}
{"text":"Mark, the bartender, took wonderful care of my boyfriend and I when we came in! He was extremely prompt and even offered up samples of different drinks he felt we'd like. I would absolutely came back, because their food was good, but specifically because he was so wonderful!"}
{"text":"Went on 11-15-13 and Waitress didnt seem to wait on us, never refilled our drinks, or the kids drinks. She wasnt freindly at all. But the Manager really came through when my streak wasnt what I expected. We liked the burgers and kids meals, but my steak was way undercooked. I may go back, but it will be a while."}
{"text":"Annoyed that this location has been steadily going downhill as far as food quality.  Steamed veggies are crunchy, you pay for a large appetizer and get smaller than a small portion, and the bread was stale?  Come on.  This is after almost a decade where the prices have steadily increased by 60-70%.  Alice springs chicken cost $10 or $11 at one time.  The appetizer piece is probably the biggest to-go deal breaker.  When people have a choice between regular and small, you have to have a threshold of how much goes in what and not just random quantities in a to-go box.  The one they used was even smaller than the usual tins they use.  As someone that has really supported the Outback corporation, it seems that will no longer happen.  Unfortunately, the proverbial straw has come.  One more thing... from a to-go perspective, the service is always good so the issues are ALWAYS kitchen oriented."}
{"text":"The best customer service I have ever experienced. I ordered the filet and lobster and the server asked if I wanted my lobster steamed or grilled. I said steamed but it came out grilled, I'm not really picky though so I didnt say anything. Ill eat it either way. However, the manager Abby came over a while later with a steamed lobster tail and said she noticed the other one came out grilled even though I didnt say anything to the server. I got the steamed tail on the house after already eating my grilled one. I was blown away.  This is the first time I've ever reviewed something, but it was necessary. I made a yelp just to say how happy I was with the service."}
{"text":"Why does this Outback get 5 stars? Simply, because after over 15 visits, the food has been consistently good, while overall restaurant service performance has improved time and again. Of course, you sometimes catch them on an off-night, but on those rare instances for us, the manager personally came out to make things right.   My favorite entrees include:  -8oz Outback Special (sirloin) cooked medium rare. I love their loaded sweet potato, so I order that along with a side salad with honey mustard dressing.   -12oz Pork Porterhouse - always juicy without any of that \"I'm eating pork\" flavor. I really like this one, and often order it when I'm not feeling red meat.   Honorable mentions include the steak medallions, which are coated with a sweet glaze, and served with skewered grilled veggies. My mother-in-law favors the salmon and will choose between that or the Outback Special.   The Bloomin' Onion is their appetizer staple, and rightfully so. It's a battered and deep fried onion able to satisfy 3-4 people. The (not so) spicy signature sauce is really good with it too.   We've never utilized it, but you can take advantage of their online ordering and curbside pickup. It looks really simple to do and we often see people using the convenient curbside parking spots.   At the end of the day, Outback is your affordable steakhouse. You can order steak, chicken, and seafood, all for prices that aren't going to break the bank. It's a nice atmosphere with friendly staff and prompt service. So, if you're in the mood for all of the above, then 'let's put another shrimp on the barbie'!"}
{"text":"Bad staff  Bad food.  One of the worst in the chain.  I'll never be back.  No customer service."}
{"text":"I was back in forth on whether or not I wanted to write a review for Outback Steakhouse because it is just a family dining chain.  My wife, daughter and I went the other day.  We usually eat here every once and while.  It is close to the house and my wife likes the coconut shrimp.  I usually just order the sirloin steak special they have.  The reason I gave this particular Outback 4 stars is because they are very consistent.  Like I mentioned this place isn't special and it's not Morton's but the cooks get it right most of the time.  I can't remember leaving here and saying man they never cook my steak how I want it.  So, kudos to the cooks for knowing how to cook a piece of meat all while be employed at a steakhouse where that's what you cook 90% of the time.  I also want to add that most of time the wait staff is generally friendly.  Let me also add that this particular Outback gets pretty busy because it's in a tourist area by the outlet mall.  The one service I really enjoy that any restaurant offers is the ability to put your name on the list as you are getting ready to drive over the place.  This is something they let you do and I highly recommend it unless you really like sitting on those awesome padded benches!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this out back. My girlfriend and I usually go to the one on Craig rd. And we normally get the lobster tail and Victoria's filet mignon and don't have any problems with it. The chef at this location some how was able to make both our rare steaks rather dry. Don't ask me how, but it looked as if it was cooked to order, but as we were eating it, there was no juiciness to it. And even my side of mashed potatoes was rather dry, not creamy like our usual Outback. Will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Not a very good location.  My steak wasn't up to par with the other Outbacks I have been to."}
{"text":"I really don't like giving chain restaurants 5 stars but, this Outback has never left me disappointed, hungry, or disturbed.  Outback is our 'go-to' when we want to eat well in our PJs.  Its unpretentiousness, inexpensiveness, and tastiness are what keep us coming back for more salads and filet mignon.    Just a little note, the Queensland Salad comes with chicken salad on top of the salad.  You are able to substitute this with their wonderfully seasoned grilled chicken breast.  Not only are the salads fresh and delicious alone but the dressings...oh the dressings... All of their salad dressings are made fresh everyday!  My favorites being the 1000 Island and Ranch (for dipping the Aussie Fries into).  The steaks are comparable to some of the Strip's top steakhouse restaurants, for a fraction of the price.  PERIOD.  Never had any room left over for dessert, so that's a strike for me.    Service is good to great at this location."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to an amazing steak...this did not happen tonight. The steak was undercooked and when we brought it to the waitresses attention she did not seem to care. My wife ordered a burger and sweet potato, it came out on the same plate and the butter melted over the entire plate, in turn making the bun so soggy it fell apart. Our server was sweet but seemed to have several tables. We started off with the blooming onion and it came out burnt, the server that delivered it said, oh this is a little burnt, do you want me to fix it? Your food is almost ready."}
{"text":"Have been here two times now. It's probably my most favorite chain restaurants as it's consistent. Service is excellent, food is pretty good, and the prices are reasonable. I had the classic mojito, which had a lot of Bacardi in it (not complaining) to start and had the shrimp/salmon combination plate - another winner. If you're around the airport and you need to eat somewhere, why not here.  Good for: lunch, dinner, groups, dining solo"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING ALERT!!!  First night in Vegas.  ONE drink + dinner.  I woke up at 1am and threw up all night.  When I called the manager and asked for a refund for my $21 dollar dinner he referred me to his insurance company.  Don't go here.  It's not worth your time, or your health."}
{"text":"We visited on a Thursday night and got seated quickly.  Our server was great ver friendly and helpful!  Good was good and timely.  Decor was kind of modern.  Overall and good restaurant."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to an Outback in quite a while and tonight I wonder why I stayed away as long as I did.  Laura L. took great care of us as we enjoyed ribeye and filets with smashed and loaded baked potatoes, along with cheese covered broccoli.  Thank you Laura and the team at Outback for giving us a taste of WONDERFUL so very close to home.  We will DEFINITELY be back again! Regards, Casey and Kellie Jones"}
{"text":"Really this location is a hit or miss. I've had many 5 star experiences but many more 2-3-4 star experiences. I love outback and usually enjoy the food, it's like a go to fast food dinner. The wait gets super long at this location on a daily basis so use call ahead seating or they have a new way called click through seating. It's really easy to use and saves you tons of wait time. Also  the booths along the bar and bar seating is first come first serve so heap up those tables/ seats and eat!"}
{"text":"so so, really below average and pricey (but you're in the strip) I don't recommend in fact"}
{"text":"Updating my terrible review from 5 days ago. The owner of the new Stephanie location personally called me to discuss my bad experience 5 days ago. With the location just opening & it being a busy Friday night it shows he cares taking the time out. I will return to check it out once more."}
{"text":"service was terrible as they acted like they just wanted to be done with work. Won't go back"}
{"text":"The wait was much longer than they indicated. And the service and timing of food delivery was absolutely horrible. The food itself was average to below average based onfeedback from others at my table. My baked potato was good but my steak was cold and chewy by the time I got it all though it was cooked correctly medium.  The other steak at our table was supposed to be medium well but was closer to medium rare and also cold.  Drink refills took forever. On the plus side they did comp two items of food due to The poor service."}
{"text":"I wanted to pass on my utmost gratitude for the outstanding hospitality that was shown to my family by their Staff.  Our experience began from the moment we walked in to exiting! Our food sever was off the chart. How he kept up his sense of humor, enthusiasm and energy levels is beyond my belief. He helped us with our dining choices and was so knowledgeable about every thing on your menu. Checking on us to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. Our soft drinks were never empty, he kept them topped off,which is very rare in restaurants these days.Seems you have to always ask for refills in other places.I sincerely appreciate your outstanding work and customer service. I did take notice that the manager (Jason) was very visible and talked to every table, making sure that all customers were getting the service and quality of food they deserve. Jason is doing an outstanding job running this establishment. He has an OUTSTANDING  staff!  Great Management.! What an awesome experience! Food was WONDERFUL!    I cannot wait for the Outback to open on Stephanie Street in Henderson, which is closer to my home and I heard will be open for lunch.. (yea) Instead of frequenting your place once a month it looks like it will be once or twice a week! Thank You Again Service was stupendous!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Outback Steakhouse and we had a really great experience. The food was great and cook exactly as ordered. What made our experience so good was our server Rebecca and her sister. She was fantastic, they both were, Great job girls!!!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else, I LOVE THE BLOOMING ONION!!!  That said, this is a pretty good location.  Good food, friendly but slow service whenever I go, but I usually go during the dinner rush so that may be why.  I also usually seem to have some issue with the accuracy of my order so I took off a little for that...  All in all it's a good hearty dinner for a decent price.  Also just a fun atmosphere.  :)"}
{"text":"Visited for dinner last night, and was immediately reminded why I had avoided this place for several years. We arrived early, and found the room nearly empty. Waitress was friendly and prompt, but the kitchen was very slow. Apps took far too long, and dinner was worse. When the food arrived, there was disappointment all around. Our party, of three, had a shrimp dish, chicken, and prime rib. The shrimp was tough and hard to chew. The chicken was dry and tasteless, and the beef was stringy and difficult to get the fork into. In fairness, the manager removed the shrimp from the bill, but dinner was awful. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Today Outback has lost my confidence in preparing a meal worthy of my hard earned money. You were my \"go to\" place when I was hungry and didn't want to try something new. Today was a repeat of what I witnessed a few weeks ago. The kitchen is in distress. Food in not top notch. Apparently ribs come in two temperature. Burned or cold. We were served both. The service was great. Can't blame the server for the fail of the kitchen. To recap I had good service and bad food."}
{"text":"I ordered a Filet and Lobster meal.  The lobster was ok, but they don't clarify the butter, which I'm my mind makes a huge difference.  According to The waitress, \"That's what we serve.\"   The piece of meat I got didn't taste like a Filet, though they said it was.  I took some for my dog.  Service was very slow even though there were only a few customers in the entire restaurant.  The new decor was nice, but that's the good thing I have to say about the place.  PS - the drink I ordered was hideous and tasted like salt and pepper.  I don't like to leave negative notes about a place, but this one needed it."}
{"text":"(6/25/16)  My wife  wanted a steak for dinner  this  evening, never  mind  that  it's only  1600. So racking  my brain  for suitable  locations  I remembered  Outback on Hwy 51. There was a lot  of  parking  and we were seated  quickly  in the bar area. She had a sweet tea and I chose  lemonade. Bring reading glasses! The print on  the  menu  is  tiny and the lights are dim.   So in looking  at  the  menu I decided  to  order a loaded blooming  onion. It has cheese  fries added to it. It's supposed  to  be  the best of both but seemed average at best. The blooming  onion  is generally  a  tasty appetizer  that two people  can never fully finish. I think that the onion was smaller  to accommodate  the  cheese  fries. So taste-wise  it was greasy and under seasoned  though there were dipping  sauces available.  My wife ordered a 12oz  sirloin medium and I ordered the jumbo crab cake stuffed lobster tail. I am hoping for redemption. I probably  had a better  chance  of  winning  the  powerball. The crab was perfectly  seasoned  and the lobster  had been drizzled  with some sort of garlic  butter salt. Drizzled  is how it was supposed  to  be  done but drenched  was how it arrived at the table. I love lobster but not when it tastes like a salt lick for deer. What a shame! I had two managers visit our table. The first one asked how everything was. I could've said yellow for all she cared. The second one wanted to know how the lobster was and I told her that it was very salty. I told her that the cook probably put too much garlic salt in the butter sauce. I then told her that most of the people that ordered this dish wouldn't notice. I stopped before telling her that my palate was a bit more refined. The waiter told me that the lobster tails were 7oz but they sure looked like 4oz ones to me. I guess we'll wait another two years before seeing if the food has improved."}
{"text":"Ordered takeaway from here while staying at the hotel. First of all, when I called for curbside ordering, no one answered! And then the answering service basically told me to hang up and call again. I tried this three times, with no answer from anyone. Finally, instead of picking the curbside option, I chose to talk to an \"Outbacker.\" Finally I got someone on the phone. I asked to order food and was put on hold for about 5 minutes and then was able to order something. For take out, it wasn't the worst food tasting meal, but my boyfriend and I both got sick shortly after eating. It's a convenient food option, for sure, but you're better off leaving the hotel or at least eating on location..."}
{"text":"Say Hello to the incredible shrinking food....don't worry about receiving  Americanized  huge portions  at Outback ..oh no  I am sure that when they shrank their salads and portions of veggies  it was with your waistline in mind.   Once upon a time you got a really hearty salad at Outback with a big old slab o meat..but now  it seems they a reducing their bowls and portions to cut their costs.  Food is still decent just shrunken.  Kind of like those shrinking ice cream cartons in the store...  My husband' salad was so small that he exclaimed  \"oh it's so adorable\" ....  not what a steakhouse should be hearing.  Food still tasty-ish  , but we have been going as an extended family for several years and long ago we were stuffed when we left... no worries now .... no mate  no worries..."}
{"text":"I QUIT THIS CHAIN A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO...WHY DID I GO BACK!  Times quoted were accurate and not guessed.  A couple of years ago when I was working in the Toledo Ohio area, I stayed in the town of Maumee at a Courtyard.  Right next to it was an Outback.  I wrote a couple of not so good reviews and swore off Outback forever.  My wife and I went back yesterday to an Outback in McCandles Pa. WHAT A MISTAKE!  This restaurant made the one In Maumee look like the best Restaurant in the chain.  1.  Call ahead seating.  What a joke. We called and were told that if we were there in 10 to 15 minutes we would be seated promptly.  We arrived in 10 minutes only to be told it would be 25 to 30 minutes.  45 minutes and we were still waiting. 2.  Finally we were seated and the hostess that sat us dropped the menus on the table like we and the menus had no worth.  35 minutes later a waitress came to the table. 3.  My wife ordered the 12 oz Prime rib.  When it was served, it was a ribeye.  When we questioned her, she said that they were out of the 12 oz Prime rib. I asked, do you just substitute without asking when you run out of something.  I just got a blank stare. My wife's  baked potato was not done and it was lumpy and hard. 3.  We had to ask for their normally delicious warm brown bread.  After quite a while we were presented an unheated loaf.  You can imagine what it tasted like. 4.  Not for me.  I ordered the bone-in Ribeye, which is their specialty.  Since we live near Pittsburgh I asked for it to be done \"Pittsburgh Medium\".  This means charred somewhat on the outside and medium inside.  It came out Pittsburgh raw. I stopped the manager at this point and he said he will cook it himself...raw again. He did offer me a glass of wine, but the meal was a disaster. We paid full price but were given a couple of small gift cards. That was a too little, too late as where would I use them?...As I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here may times. It's the only steakhouse in the area so it gets more of our business than it otherwise would. We find the food very inconsistent. I think the cooks in the back could be much more consistent in how they prepare the food. One time we get a nice coconut shrimp and the next we get an over soggy over breaded plate of shrimp. The steaks have gone downhill over the last few years. Having been to many steak restaurants all over the US, I think I could say we know our steak cuts. At Outback, we too often but not always get a generally undefinable piece of meat. We really cut back on going to this once good restaurant. I think the chain is replacing quality with profits. We sure hope the consistency and quality come up a notch."}
{"text":"Great steak tonight! We came here for my mother-in-law's birthday and everyone was raving about their food. I would highly recommend them. Good steak at a competitive price. Decent prices on the kids menu too. Kids meals starting at $5.49"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meals. Then the owner came up to talk with us. She Jess. Was wonderful  The hospitality was awesome.  I highly recommend this restaurant for Friday nite dinner"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in AZ.  Their filet mignon is amazing!  My daughter has food allergies and the wait staff is so wonderful, they will literally bring me ingredient labels even going as far as to cut the label off a box for me so I can read it myself.  Love their brownie al a mode too!! Omg!!"}
{"text":"BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE. Accidentally brought out steak tacos instead of chicken and were so friendly and accommodating and took it off the bill. Overall great experience. Outback really has picked up a lot in the past years. Inexpensive and yummy. Great lunch spot too! Thanks good server and manager!"}
{"text":"Got the new tomahawk ribeye.  Tasty but not worth $50.  At least a 10 ounce bone.  Cooked a perfect mid rare."}
{"text":"So I go to Outback quite a bit, and I must say;  would it hurt to smile and be kinda generally happy?  You're in the service industry... At least pretend you're happy!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the idea of having Your Takeout Order delivered Curbside Apparently before 1pm is Not an Option. You even ask for my vehicle type and color. I want my 3.00 tip back since I had to go inside and wait for my order..."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday last night.  Our server was Ebony, she did a great job. The food was yummy.  We reserved a table for 8 and it was ready when we arrived.  The manager came by to check on us.  An enjoyable evening was had by all.  The Ribeye is the bomb, try it with Garlic Butter & Mushrooms."}
{"text":"We came in at 10 to 6 with a party of 5 and had to wait about 15 minutes to be sat. We went to wait outside because the inside seating was full. I went back inside to let the hostess know that we hadn't left but were waiting out front on their big comfy patio chairs. We were sat as I said in about 15 minutes (I expected to wait much longer at 6 o'clock dinner rush) and when our server came to greet us he let us know the manager wanted to give us an appetizer for our wait!! Mind you we never complained about the wait, as I said I expected longer. I just thought this was above and beyond customer service! Our server was very attentive and the server that brought us our food was great as well. The bartender was a little backed up so it took a while to get our bar drinks but, hey, it happens. Overall we had a great experience and everyone we interacted with was helpful and hospitable!"}
{"text":"Overall such a poor experience. The hostess/ greeter was very nice, and then it went downhill fast! Waited nearly 10 minutes to see my server. Waited another 15 minutes to get the free bread and butter.  She didn't bring out the food. Made me ask for a refill on my drink. She was pretty much MIA for my entire visit. Trust me, her tip reflected that!"}
{"text":"Waited several minutes for the hostess to show up at the podium to seat us. Once she showed up, she had an attitude!  We told her we'd like a booth for 2. She said, \"fine it'll be 5 minutes.\"  I'm said REALLY!! The place was nearly empty!! We told her we'll go somewhere else. She again \"fine \". That young lady just cost the server and the company money!!!"}
{"text":"The service was AWSOME! C.J the manager was very professional, compassionate, and HANDSOME (SUPER FINE). We had an issue with our dinner and they fixed it without an issue. Rebecca W. was a sweet and speedy server. I will be back.!!"}
{"text":"Nice service...friendly staff. Can't go wrong with the Outback special...bloomin onion is always good as well as the caesar salad...yum. Ribs are kinda tough, but its not a rib joint...so stick with the steak.  Overall good experience every time."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with Outback.  It's always good, no matter what you get.  I hate places where I feel like I have very few options cause there's only a few good things on the menu.  Suffice it to say, Outback is NOT like one of those joints.  Apps are good, salads are bomb, sides are tasty, seafood is fresh, chicken is delish and the steaks are always on point (as they should be!).   Hubby and I went here for a late dinner last night around 9pm.  We were seated immediately in one of the booths in the bar area and approached by a cool server who bore a somewhat disconcerting resemblance to Wolverine of the X-Men franchise (not kidding at all and when we jokingly asked him about it he said he gets that from pretty much everyone.  awesome...) It was late and we were hungry so we placed our order right away.  We started off with onion petals, which is essentially a mini bloomin' onion.  Perfect for us as we didn't want to spoil our dinner.  We got a loaf of the complimentary bread which is maybe the only thing at Outback that I think isn't anything to write home (or Yelp) about.  Kind of hard, kind of tasteless and the butter they serve with it is either the blandest butter ever or just plain fake... a la margarine.   We both chose salads as one of our sides so those came out next.  Husband with an (anything but) basic side salad (those croutons...I die!) and me with the granddaddy of all salads - the Outback wedge.  Never a better salad was made, people.  Disclosure: it's made with bleu cheese dressing and bleu cheese crumbs are sprinkled on it.  Well I despise bleu cheese, like with a passion, so I got for the wedge minus all the bleu cheese.  So here's the details: a generous lettuce wedge, ranch spilling down all over it, topped with bacon crumbs, red onions and cherry tomatoes.  All of this amazing goodness on top of a juuuuuuust a little bit of some incredibly delicious balsamic vinegar.  It's just heaven, really.  And while I'm mentioning the salads, can someone tell me why and how the ranch at Outback is the best on the entire planet?  No?  Well, I can tell you, then.  I got the scoop last night.  Shhhhh...they include a pinch of cayenne pepper in there to give it a kick!  Genius!  And a-freaking-mazing! Husband got the ribeye and was happy with it other than the fact that it's cooked on the wood grill and the wood that they use gave it a slight woodsy, smokey, lighter fluidy taste.  Eater, beware - if you like to taste meat and not wood and smoke (although in talking to Wolverine it seems that a lot of people do like that), ask them to cook your steak on the flat top, not on the fire grill.   I opted for the sirloin and lobster tail special.  Ok, seriously?  $15.99 for a 6 oz sirloin and a big fat, juicy, flavorful lobster tail?  I am not kidding you.  I got it medium rare (is there ANY other way to cook a steak?!) and it was cooked perfectly.  I was worried about the butter situation (see above) but was relieved when my entree came with a side of warm melted REAL butter.  Dipping that lobster in that butter and savoring every bite was like being reborn, I tell ya.  After the onion petals, the salad and the lobster, I had 2 bites of my steak and just couldn't do any more.  I wanted to, I really did cause it was damn good but I would have been rolled out of there if I had continued.  No loss though, I got my dinner covered tonight! The service was great, the food excellent, atmosphere friendly and we got some real bang for our buck.  $60 for 2 quality steaks is a bargain in my book.   I love Outback, mate!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, for the first time in a few years, and I was pretty impressed.   We walked in and were seated right away, but I did notice a complimentary self-serve water station in the waiting area that I thought was a super cool touch. The water had lemon and orange pieces floating around the top of the container and the area for the clean and dirty glasses were both very visible and largely labeled that I can imagine there is no cross contamination, unless you are blind, but in that case you won't know there is a complimentary water stand and you probably won't be reading this review...  Anyway, the service was great - for the most part - he did forget to refill my lemonade, but he was on top of the water and iced tea refills. We started with the every so famous, bloomin' onion, that was delicious and soon after we got our complimentary whole wheat loaf of bread. I ordered the Ahi Tuna appetizer and it was a little overcooked. I would not order it again, but everyone else in my party ordered steaks and they all were very pleased with the temperature at which their steaks were prepared. The restaurant itself was very clean, but my only gripe about the environment was that it seemed that the hostess sat everyone next to each other! I know only certain sections of the restaurant are open, depending on how many servers are working at the time, but at least separate the parties by one booth so that each table can converse with each other without yelling over the table next to them."}
{"text":"It have been a long time patron oft his Outback. They had done some updating of the interior, which looked nice. Immediately I was seated my server brought some terrific freshly baked brown bread and butter and some water right after taking my order.  Within 15 minutes my meal arrived. I had the 6 ounce sirloin steak, broccoli, and a sweet potato with the butter and brown sugar on the side ($11.99). All the food was prepared exactly as I had requested. My server was friendly, checked back a couple of times to see if I needed anything, and delivered the check just as I finished my meal.  Parking is close to the door. The dining area looked very clean. I will continue to keep this steakhouse in mind whenever I have a craving for lunchtime steak (too many steak houses do not open until 4pm)."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a few days ago with my family. We were one of two tables in the restaurant.   I'm not sure if my server was new and they made him work lunch because of that, or if my server was having a bad day, but our experience was very sub par.   The bloomin' onion is always a delicious and salty staple at any outback. It's crispy, has a great dipping sauce, and is served hot.  Steaks are bland and he mixed up the steaks my sister and I ordered. She likes hers well done (/gag) and I like mine medium rare- you know, the proper way to eat a steak. Both steaks weren't even the temperature we ordered. She got the medium one. I got the burned one. Both of our sides were served cold. My mother enjoyed her salad though! Can't really mess that up.   We only got one refill on our drinks the entire time we were there, which was about an hour and a half. Took about 30-40 minutes to get that, even after reminding our server."}
{"text":"The lady who attended us was very nice and friendly. The food ( baby pork ribs ) was so good and tenderjuicy. I almost eat even the rib bone ( ) seriously...itz good. I am sure I'll come back and recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Stopped in the for happy hour bar menu.  Pretty cheap and solid overall, but the drinks do outshine the food.  The staff is always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Definitely one of our favorite restaurants in Surprise. For a chain restaurant the food is great. My husband always gets the ribeye and is never disappointed. We love the owner Susan who is always walking around and checking on things to make sure it's great."}
{"text":"We were quickly seated. Unsure what to order we looked over the menu, and the menu flyer that was advertising some type of meal and desert deal on Wednesdays. While looking at what to order and comparing pricing with that advertised deal I believe our waitress came over maybe 5 or 6 times asking if we were ready to order. I swear this was in maybe a 15-minute period. She was nice but this was annoying. When I put down my menu that's a good sign I'm ready to order, but I was still looking at it.....   My steak was good, not completely well done but not enough to complain over. My drink was great but I ordered both sides broccoli, half was cooked to my liking, the other half was not."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out this place since I think I've been to Outback only  once...maybe 10 years ago lol and because they just opened this location last week. Very clean, lots of seating and nice atmosphere.  We arrived around 5:40 yesterday and they told us the wait was about an hour! Ah! But we wanted to try it so the girl took our name down, told us to come back around 6:10 and we walked to Petsmart. We came back right at 6:10 and seated us after 2 minutes. Nice! Only a 30 minute wait. Our waitress was awesome, I feel bad that I forgot her name but I do remember she was a Brown's fan lol. She was funny, knew the menu, gave us recommendations and probably stopped by our table around 10 times just to make sure we were doing alright, refilling our drinks and making us feel comfortable since the kitchen was really backed up and there was only one bartender. They just opened last week so it's totally understandable that they haven't worked out all the kinks yet.  Onto what we ordered!  Pitcher of Strawberry Peach Sangria: Refreshing, sweet but not like candy and a great deal at $15 since we got 4 glasses worth.  Aussie fries: I loove cheese fries with bacon! However these were a 2.5/5. Not that seasoned or that much bacon and the cheese only covered the top layer of fries. Once you got under those top 10 fries, you were left with regular french fries. Wah! I will have to point out though that the bacon we did get wasn't overly cooked to a crisp like most places and I really liked that.  12 oz Ribeye: Boyfriend got this and said it was pretty good. He said it wasn't a perfect medium rare but it was good enough. And he loved the loaded baked potato.  Alice springs chicken + coconut shrimp combo: Yum! I got this and it hit the spot for my calorie loaded craving. Chicken had melted cheese, mushrooms and bacon with a mustard sauce on the side. And the coconut shrimp was good sized, had great flavor and came with a sweet marmalade sauce. I could definitely come back for this.  No dessert cause we finished around 7:30 and had to catch a movie at 8.  I don't usually go to places like this, I feel like it's just a  step up from chili's, applebee's, or tgif but everything had good sized portions, decent flavor, and service was really good. Will definitely be back when I'm craving this type of food."}
{"text":"Came here for my daughter's 19th. North day tonight. The waitress was terrible. She forgot portions of our order and when we spoke to the Manager the service only got worse. She came and dropped the ice cream in front of her and said happy birthday...no singing.  When she was told that my daughter would like he same song that everyone else received she came back 10min. later with two other servers who literally walked away before they were done singing."}
{"text":"Had another great steak/filet.  Cooked perfect.  One of the best steaks I've had in Vegas and I've been to some high end steakhouses."}
{"text":"DON'T order steak. Save yourself the disappointment & just make it @ home, as it will probably come out the same , if not better....& Don't come with a big appetite, b/c  I dont know if its just me, but..it seems as though they REALLY cut portion sizes too. Even the salads seem skimpier. I really don't think I'll be spending my $ here again.."}
{"text":"Service was bad and food was just ok. Was craving a blooming onion and it was salty and it came before our drinks. Took forever to get our mixed drinks so we asked for water at least and had to ask twice for water while eating the onion. We asked for bread and never got it. Asked if we wanted a bag for our leftovers and never got it. Noticed another table by us was having the same issue with having to ask a couple times for things so it wasn't just our waitress. Sad thing is they weren't busy at all and now I know why. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love chain steakhouses for the consistency of what you have a taste for and what you get.  Sadly, after it being awhile eating at this Outback, I was disappointed.  The Victoria's Filet was tasteless and tough.  Yes I order medium well and I get that it's going to be more \"dead\" than not, but I always get this temp and never complained and the sweet potato was half the size as 10 years ago.    We ordered the shareable pitcher of the specialty margarita.  I can't remember what it was called.  For $17 I thought we'd get more drink then ice.  Only enough for 2 glasses.  Small ones too.  And after telling our waitress about it, she explained the it's meant for at least 3 drinks and its pre made.  If I was ordering the house margarita at a Mexican place, if expect pre made, not here.  It had too much sweet and sour mix too.  Tasted pre made.  The waitress even commented that we weren't the first to complain about this offering.  Side note, yes I get this place shouldn't be known for its margaritas but still....  On a positive note, the new updated decor is fantastic!  And our waitress, Kailee was entertaining, personal and accommodating."}
{"text":"Service was ok.  Server was friendly and the food was ok.  For the price I would rather have longhorn steakhouse food."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars.... I ordered the Surf N Turf (Filet Mignon and Lobster) with a side of broccoli and fries. We also ordered the ribeye with a side of broccoli and a loaded baked potato (her side of broccoli never arrived for the record). I can't even begin to explain how upset My stomach was... sorry to whomever reads this review, but I had the Hershey squirts for a solid couple hours after leaving. This hurt my stomach so badly that I had to hang out in the bathroom during recovery. What a waste of an evening and $80.... never going to this place again- disgusted that their food destroyed my stomach that badly. Btw- I'm an extremely healthy 26 year old male at 6'0, 205lbs..... I never have that kind of stomach issue. Safe to say you'll need to find an outhouse after leaving the outback; gnarly"}
{"text":"Well, after reading the other reviews I understand why I had the experience that I had here tonight. The service is unbearably slow and they were not busy. We waited an hour for our meals. The food was good but the service and wait time are horrendous here. Avoid this place if your on a timeframe. The managers are effective here and do check in. actually Samantha tried to make this right for us but it was just too terrible. The managers do try to help with the wait, but something else must be wrong here. I would not want to be one of the managers here, this place is rough."}
{"text":"The Independence location is so much better than Parma.  Excellent service and the Manager, Samantha, even stopped by to check on the service.  Food was served hot and as ordered.  Steak and lobster special was a plus for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've gone to Outback but my girlfriend was craving the unlimited shrimp deal. We both ordered the 6oz sirloin with unlimited shrimp.  The food came out quickly and our server, Asia, was very attentive the entire way. The steak was cooked perfectly and we both opted for the wood fire option. This gave the steak a smoky wood flavor. The steak was seasoned well and was surprisingly juicy and tender. We both tried the 3 types of shrimp; fried (crispy), buffalo and scampi. Our favorite was the scampi. The shrimp was on the small side but it was cooked nicely in the butter sauce. The fried shrimp was good, but there was a bit too much breading. Skip the buffalo shrimp, its basically the fried shrimp in not-so-good buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location since it opened.  About 10 years ago it was awesome.  We even visited a couple times a week and never sent back a meal.    Understandable, over the years ownership and management has changed...but for this location, it's been for the worst.  Much worse.    We are to blame for still going here so often even though the food is totally hit or miss. Nine out of ten times the steak is overdone.  Even when we explain to the server prior to ordering and ask his recommendation on how to order the steak, it's still like leather.   Ok, so I feel really bad for saying this because I'm thinking management reads Yelp...but the manager who walks around is just plain creepy.  Plus he doesn't know how a steak should be made.  We complained about a super well done steak and he asked me if it was over or under done.  The thing was black!   I suppose it's nice he walks around, but send a manager that doesn't make people feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"What happened to Outback? The last couple times I've gone for takeout they have continuously forgotten my condiments today after I waited 10 minutes to place a take-out order. Was put on hold to verify my salad, and waited outside for 30 minutes. My medium steak is raw in the middle, I received the wrong salad, and my extra sour cream was a small drop. I think this will be my last visit"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out,  that is definitely not the way to go.  The order was really messed up.  My husband ordered the Outback Special,  medium well, it was  pretty rare. Why can't you eat your steak medium well if that is what you like.  The condiments for the loaded baked potato were really scarce.  Would have killed them to include a little more butter and cheese.  The salad was by far the best item.  I ordered the Victoria filet, haven't tasted it yet.  I was so disappointed when I saw that the potato soup was cold and there was less than a half a bowl.  The condiments again for the sweet potato was disappointing,  there is barely enough to taste it on the potato.  Roll good as usual,  but would it have hurt to include a little butter.  One thing for sure we will never do take out again.  What a waste of $50.00."}
{"text":"I know its a chain And I should hate it.  But I can't help it. I love me some bloomin' onion, pumpernickel bread, and potato soup.....  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Outback!"}
{"text":"As I read reviews and see things like \"it's unhealthy\", and \"tasteless food\", I can only disagree.  I've been to this Outback Steakhouse several times a week and love it.  The seasoning is always on point and I never had a bad experience there.  Like someone said in their review \" the average person is either too lazy or too ignorant to realize that a good NY Strip can be prepared for half the price and in half the time\", so why are you dining at Outback then?    By the way the Caesar salad was awesome and the bread is fresh.  Sounds like you are an unhappy individual to begin with and probably tip under 15% or want management to review your post and offer something for free."}
{"text":"I'm a little late in posting this. We visited this restaurant on Valentines Day. I enjoyed my medium rare Ribeye steak with garlic mashed potatoes served with delicious broccoli. One thing I really enjoy is their seasoning on the steaks. It really helps to ramp up the taste from mouth watering to actual salivating! My husband ordered his Ribeye steak well done along with a baked potato and a Cesar salad. His steak wasn't quite well done, but since our bartender didn't check on it's perfection, he went along and ate it. He is not one to tolerate even a little pink, so I know that he didn't enjoy it as much as he should. I had a Bloody Mary and enjoyed it. The lady sitting next to me even oggled it. My hubby had a Margarita and remarked that it was only OK. I do think they could step it up on the Margaritas a bit, since they are so popular around here. Over all I enjoyed my meal. We were invited to come back and visit by the manager, since last time our visit was less than satisfactory. I so think the grill masters should take more care in cooking steaks to order, since steaks are a big draw for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the staff is always super friendly. Ive never been disappointed with what I order from here! They always get my crazy orders right.. even when we pick up take out! The curbside pick up is so convenient!!"}
{"text":"Funny how much I love Outback, but only ate a meal at one of their locations just a few times? I have always enjoyed Outback, It's different with a kick in the flavor. Last time I tried this location, I was amazed at how many customers were their! We had to come back and place a reservation. Steaks are just awesome, service was great, have no problems with this location."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here for two. Was surprised that it was pretty empty for a weekday. We were seated right away. I ordered the chicken sandwich, It wasn't that bad.  Our main issue was that since it wasn't that busy. We had to wait for awhile for everything? There was plenty of workers there, but some were not willing to step up and help. Most people eating out for lunch on a weekday has a time limit. Must get back to work in a reasonable time. Outback didn't step up to make sure everyone was getting taken care of."}
{"text":"Okay, Where do I begin? Maybe I should show a timeline. 8:20 pm seated at table.  8:45 pm no drinks which were simple iced tea and water. 8:50pm Manager comes to table.  8:53pm Take order.  It is now 9:23 pm still no food. Half empty drink glasses and dust is beginning to settle on our table. We have a \" new person\" and a table of 8. And the restaurant is not busy. Where did they go wrong? Stay away... for that basic meal, not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Just ordered through online pick up people were really nice and on time awesome service thank you"}
{"text":"First of all, maybe some of the \"steaks\" might be delicious.  But the \"sirloin\" is definitely not.  I took my kids there last night for the first time ever, because the other place we wanted to eat was closed on Mondays (surprised) and OutBack was nearby.  /regret.  My daughter had the \"kids meal sirloin\" and it was not good at all.  Dry, with very little flavor.  She disliked it so much she asked for steak sauce, which she never generally asks for.  THEN, the waiter forgot she asked, and I had to ask a different server to get her some A1.  My daughter's words:  \"I can't believe any kids like this steak.\"  My son had a garden salad with Ranch, and he liked that OK.  ( Hard to mess up a basic salad. )  He also liked his baked potato.  But he also had a sirloin, and did not like it much either.  Both kids had leftovers which I decided to take home, hoping maybe to add the steak to something else like a stew or soup.  I had the filet  ( which was kinda like a prime rib cut ) with mushroom sauce, a baked sweet tater, and the vegetable medley, which was snap peas, yellow squash, carrots, and broccoli I think. It was decent, but definitely not worth $14.95.  The potato was the best thing on the plate.  I had never really been impressed by OutBack the 2 or 3 times in my life I had eaten there, and this trip confirmed my suspicions.  Will not go back - ever.  Overpriced and just not tasty food."}
{"text":"First time trying Outback's in Arizona   Place was not crowded yesterday, Saturday night,  We made reservations just Incase it was full on Mother's Day weekend.   The atmosphere is romantic  The service was decent. There was a girl there being mean to our server about him cleaning up his area. Although she may be right, belittling and Talking to another employee like that around customers is very unprofessional, even though you were right, you looked like a total bitch.   Our server very nice, got our order correct and had all our food out timely.   The food was Amazing ! I had the bone in rib eye, garlic butter on top, steamed broccoli and side of sautéed mushrooms.  --I don't recommend the mushrooms way to much Cooking wine in it, tasted like pure alcohol. Maybe cook it in garlic butter, garlic and some Salt.   The ribeye was cooked perfectly. Ordered medium and it came out perfect. The mash potatoes where decent portioned.   Bartender did amazing at making my Jameson and cokes. Not to much and not to Little of alcohol.  Overall great experience.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Wanted prime rib but waitress came back and said they were out. I had a steak that she. Said is the same cut as prime rib. I got the 12 ounce since she said it would be better as it was thicker. Ordered it medium and it can rare. I sent it back and they cooked it longer. Second time around was good. House salad was as expected. They brought out a loaf of hot bread which was not that great. You come to outback for the meat and it was very good. Place was mostly empty."}
{"text":"Tonight my father in law chose this Outback Steakhouse to celebrate his birthday and it was an experience I was thoroughly impressed by, considering several incidences. First and foremost, we ended up having a party of 8 instead of our initial party of 4, my husband promptly notified the host and he immediately worked with the server to accommodate seating due to the change in the number of people attending, there was no wait for us to change tables.  Secondly, I have to give a huge shout out to our server Tyler, she was extremely professional and held her self well. She should definitely be working somewhere WAY higher class than Outback Steakhouse. She spoke with a maturity that is, in my opinion, NEVER seen from a young person in that setting. She addressed each and every person at the table with ether sir or ma'am. At one point a small dish of mustard slipped out of her hand as she was setting it at the table and it accidentally splattered all over the side of my aunts black blazer. Thankfully my aunt was very forgiving and  Tyler swiftly apologized in a professional manner, kept her cool, took the blazer and cleaned it with seltzer water while we all started eating. Never, at any point did she over dramatize the situation or seem overly embarrassed. I was VERY IMPRESSED with how she handled the situation.   Following the mustard mishap, the manager Christine came to our table to acknowledge the incident, offered to have Outback foot the dry cleaning bill and swapped information with my aunt! So awesome of them to do that!  The meal was wonderful, we never ran out of a drink before it was offered to be refilled and everything came out just as expected and nobody's order was messed up. The checks came swiftly and were promptly taken and returned in the same manner. While I try to avoid chain restaurants, I just might make it a point to stop back by this particular Outback, should the situation call for or permit. Bravo!"}
{"text":"We were in Champaign on business Thursday evening and went to Outback for supper. The hostess was able to seat us right away and even moved us to a different table because there was a very large group beside us with several small children. The server we got was GREAT! Sorry I don't remember her name, but we were sitting in a booth in the bar area. My husband ordered the small filet, medium-rare to medium, and it was perfect. His side was the baked sweet potato. He asked for brown sugar only, no butter because he's lactose intolerant. The little cup holding the brown sugar has a big ball of butter right on top, but he was able to take it off and the brown sugar was fine. I ordered the grilled salmon with steamed veggies and it was perfect. I like that choice better than the Firecracker salmon with mango salsa. It was cooked correctly and not overdone. We don't always have great success with restaurants in the Champaign/Urbana area, but Outback was great."}
{"text":"Steak was good , service wasn't the best at all... The odor from the bathroom didn't help at all.   Went in to wash my hands and no soap, the smell of urine was unbearable... Asked to talk to the manage and was able to get the PROPERTIER JOHN JOHNSON  ... He wasn't very receptive and not good at handling very helpful feed back.... I just explained that they just opened and no reason there shouldn't be soap or a horrible smell in the bathroom.  I'll make sure to avoid anything he Owns or manages."}
{"text":"My family and I go to eat lunch giving outback another chance since the last experience wasn't good and the waitress brings bread my son goes to eat it and it has mold! Absolutely disgusting will never go eat here again I warned everyone walking in"}
{"text":"The food at curbside was awful.  I usually go inside and enjoy myself at Outback.  The curbside food was sloppy and cold and I arrived 5 minutes early for my food. I will never order takeout here again.  DO NOT ORDER TAKEOUT HERE!"}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow & steak was complete burnt. Manager made excuses about being short staffed but hey short staffed had nothing to do with burnt good"}
{"text":"Crap service tonight. Even with just a few patrons at the bar these girls just have horrible work ethic. More focused on their pal sitting at the end. One bartender brings the drink then disappears. I had to flag the other one to put in an order. I find 9 times outa 10 if your server is a female in their twenties you get shit service. These millennials  don't care about customers."}
{"text":"I love the food and I love the service.  When our family goes out, this has been my son's first choice since he was really little and couldn't finish the kid's meal in one sitting.  I love that they are so great at making food the way you want them to prepare it.  This has come in really handy when we're following a strict diet plan.  I love that it's so close to my home as well."}
{"text":"Super salty and sirloin is chewy and way too salty. Server spent 25 minutes getting my husbands beer. Didn't even ask why I didn't eat more than 2 bites of my steak. Also didn't get our phone number for the rewards!"}
{"text":"We went back to this Outback to give it another try and everything was wonderful. I love the new table side ordering too. The new garlic medallions are the best!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly, helpful, and attentive.  Great prices, nice atmosphere!  My steak and my husbands were both cooked a perfect med rare! Thanks!"}
{"text":"The first time. I went to Outback was with my mother. She loves their steak and we would go spend time together, eating a meal here and cztching up. Every time I eat here I have the same thing--rack of lamb, apple chutney & a baked potato.  Outback has great service, good food and a nice atmosphere. I love eating here for the memories & the lamb. Sweet, succulent lamb."}
{"text":"I ordered a 10oz ribeye cooked medium and it was nearly raw. The rest of the meal and salad was OK but nothing to write home about. We were given a gift card to try out the restaurant and when the receipt was returned it was the incorrect amount on the remainder excluding the tip. Had to resolve using a manager. Friends of ours returned to use their card remainder and were told it had a lower balance incorrectly. Get a receipt if you plan on returning."}
{"text":"Very poor service!  Takes over an hour for your food to come!  When it arrives it's cold or not prepared the way you requested.  The manager tries to come to your table to butter you up!  How bout prepare my food the way I requested, and within a timely matter or better yet credit my entire bill!  Get it right OUTBACK!"}
{"text":"Steak places are a dime a dozen on the strip so why would someone go to Outback?  I mean just next door their is Smith & Wollensky's and across the street is Mastro's Ocean Club not to mention Craftsteak and Striphouse all within a 5 iron shot of the place.  But what if you don't want to break the bank?  All of the aforementioned joints require most people to take a second mortgage out to afford.  Therein lies the beauty of Outback.  You can go in and get a delicious steak at a reasonable price (around 20 bucks) with decent sides and a casual atmosphere.  That's exactly how I found myself at this particular Outback the other night.  My cousin was in town and staying on the strip.  We wanted to get in touch with our carnivore roots but didn't want to have to sleep in our car as result.  Looking out from her room at the Monte Carlo, we spied Outback next to the giant Coke bottle and over-sized M & M (only in Las Vegas!).  We ambled across the strip and found the Outback to be tucked away adjacent to the Coke World shop and requiring an elevator ride to reach the host stand.  Once upstairs your removed from the hustle and bustle of the strip and can settle into a nice meal.  We were immediately seated even though the place was jumping and drink orders were taken promptly.  After perusing the menu I wasnt sure if this Outback was a little more expensive than others because of its location or if all of them how have raised their prices recently because I did notice the prices inching up higher than I last recalled.  They were still reasonable however and I ordered the Outback special which is a 12oz Sirloin and my cousin got the Prime Rib.  Both cuts were cooked right to order and the accompanying salad and potato were more than sufficient.  I loved that our waitress recognized my insatiable thirst of diet Coke and kept a steady stream of pops heading my way,    There was a nice view overlooking the strip from the restaurant and while the space was loud we could have a conversation without any problems.  This Outback is the perfect choice for people visiting Vegas and wanting a good substantial meal without all the production of a fancy \"casino\" restaurant.  Plus it'll save you some bucks so you can eventually loose it on a slot machine later in the night....or on the Indianapolis Colts as was the case with me...."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst steak I ever had. I took it home to give to the dog, he ran away, haven't seen him since.  Over priced slop. I looked around the place & felt sorry for the poor bastards that think that's good. Outback is ripping those poor devils off!"}
{"text":"Good thing the food is decent because our service was not!  I'm not a fan of the little devices on the table to place an order, but our server insisted on using it.  Well, our appetizer wasn't put in, barely got refills on our drinks. I changed my side dish (with the waiter) it never happened. He never even returned with the check, but he sure showed up quick when we had cash on the table.   **Note to servers, if I have to put my order in myself, whether It be for food, drink or appetizers your tip will be effective!!"}
{"text":"So it had been a while since me and Outback had a date.  Not sure when they got the new menu but it was a bit confusing.  I just wanted my classics!  After I located my usual selections, we ordered the Bloomin' Onion.  It was a bit smaller than usual.  The outer layer was more onion skin than it was actual onion. The prime rib is now seasoned, and I have to say, I didn't care for it.  I liked the natural flavors.  However, I'm not going to deduct starts for that since the menu change isn't location specific.  What I will say about this Outback is that we received excellent service.  Our waiter was on top of our drinks, brought more dipping sauce out before we even asked for it, and checked in with us often.   I'd definitely go back to this particular Outback!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Outback Steakhouse. I have to say I'm pretty happy with the food here. The service is really lacking though.   I had a NY Strip Steak. It was cooked perfectly to order and came in at 12 oz. My father in law had a rack of ribs and he said they were pretty good. My wife had some sort of shrimp that she enjoyed. The Crab Stuffed Mushrooms as an appetizer is a must!"}
{"text":"Hello I went there tonight with my family we had a good time and the manager Susan dose such a. Great job the server was good always asking us if we need  anything  the server Ricky what a wonderful job"}
{"text":"I came here once in a while to eat at this Outback. I came in with my family on May 13, 2016 around 9 p.m., some one greeted us and took us to our table. Our server was great but the food was alright.   First off, we ordered two appetizers and four entrées.   - BLOOMING ONION - Coconut Shrimp - BACON BOURBON SALMON - OUTBACK SIRLOIN & LOBSTER - BABY BACK RIBS - RIBS & CHICKEN ON THE BARBIE  All the food we ordered were ok except the RIBS & CHICKEN ON THE BARBIE. I ordered this entree because I thought it sounds good. But when I saw the entree with my two eyes, I was SHOCKED the portion of the food was SMALL. I could of gone to my favorite BBQ restaurant where there's bigger portions and get the same price. DISAPPOINTING. Some of the food are great and some are BLAH.  I would recommend try eating somewhere else since this restaurant is also pricy."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to the Henderson location of outback steakhouse and all five of us enjoyed it immensely. Service was great the food was outstanding and we only had a three minute wait when we came in. No complaints here at all.  I had the New York strip steak-perfectly done the way I like it charred on the outside, medium rare on the inside. Steak was tender juicy and ample. Loaded baked potato was great.  Diner 2 had the baby back ribs and she said they were the best ribs she had in a long time. They sure looked good. Diners 3 and 4  had to Tilapia with crab sauce and they too said the fish was perfectly done and moist.   Diner 5 had filet mignon and while  fillet mignon can be somewhat dry hers  was not. The blooming onion that we started out with and shared was as always outstanding. Our waitress Nicole did a great job of taking care of us and kept her eyes on us to make sure there was nothing we needed.  Oh, by the way call ahead seating is a must or you could face an hour to an hour and a half wait. No complaints on this trip ...hope future trips are as good. If you haven't tried Outback steakhouse in Henderson I'd suggest giving it a try."}
{"text":"Had Blooming onion, 2 Steaks, 2 sides and a piece of Cheesecake .for $40, great price, The service was well paced and quality of the food was very good.  My wife and I were marking our 33 years,  We made a good choice in going to the Outback in Mesa, A tip of the hat to the Manager and staff, GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"I have not written a review of a restaurant in over 4 years, this terrible experience has brought me out of retirement. Let's go through the timeline.   We walked in to an almost empty restaurant with only about 4-5 tables seated. The hostess had been talking with someone at the bar and upon seeing my wife and I she shuffled back and without any emotion asked how many in our party and then led us to our table. She clearly enjoys her job, especially since she didn't crack a smile the whole time.   Our waitress was pleasant enough. She took our orders and then commended us for trying to be \"good\" about our food selections (my wife has a yeast and dairy allergy, I'm not sure how \"good\" we were trying to be). That was a bit patronizing but engaging. She was really on top of making sure our waters were refilled. We both ordered sirloin steaks, medium rare.  When our food arrived, we both cut into our steaks to discover that my wife's was a solid rare to borderline raw, while mine was a slightly more cooked rare. Hers was cold in the middle, mine was at least warm. When the waitress came back we requested they be cooked to the temperature/cook we had ordered. She then proceeded to argue with me about if I knew what medium rare meant, and pulled out their menu to explain what each cook level means. She ultimately decided that my warm rare was less cooked than my wife's almost raw steak and the proceeded to take the steaks back so she could have them both cooked to medium well. Why medium well you ask? Good question...   I am not a toddler, nor an imbecile. Apparently this steakhouse has a different understanding of how beef is cooked than the rest of the food industry. They apparently also have a policy that if the customer doesn't like how it is cooked, to argue with them and to convert their steak into borderline shoe leather. My steak came back practically well done; it was chewy and bland. My wife's came back medium and at least had some juices left in it.   We will never frequent this pathetic steakhouse again. Stay away unless you want to be belittled for your choices and want shoe leather instead of steaks. You have been warned."}
{"text":"When we went here they firstly don't honor any deals that are online and the prices for food are rediculous sorry but I didn't win a jackpot and I didn't go to gamble I wanted to walk the strip.....paying $50 for 2 people .....now come on people really? I really don't care about where it's located.....honor deals or make food cheaper....We're going again this weekend and will NOT be going here this time better off at a fast food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dinner was fabulous! We started with the blooming onion and it was good. We love the spicy sauce that comes with it! We also started w/ the crab stuffed mushrooms. The flavor itself was great but the texture was lacking. Instead of having a nice crisp on top they were just kind of mushy. Kevin ordered the full rack of ribs w/ fries. They were good a little too saucy but the flavor was good and they fell off the bone. My son had the junior steak & fries and enjoyed his. I ordered the Firecracker salmon with a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and I loved it! The salmon was moist, juicy and the flavor was spot on! The veggies that came with it were cooked perfectly and the soup had a great flavor and a nice spice to it."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great dinner. Mushrooms, Caesar salad, and a sirloin.  Everything was wonderful. The best thing was the waiter. Donovan. Donovan was doing different accents, he was very entertaining. Even the kids had a great time. Of course the food was good but the atmosphere was wonderful. My son had the kids steak dinner meal. It was a great deal.   6 ounces sirloin with a side, pretty much half the price of mine.  Thanks outback and Donovan for a great night."}
{"text":"It had been a long time since I had visited this Outback. They had done some updating of the interior, which looked nice. I arrived at 11am for lunch, craving a small steak (I have been eating mainly fish and chicken lately). I was seated immediately and my server brought some terrific freshly baked brown bread and butter and some water right after taking my order.  Within 15 minutes my meal arrived. I had the 6 ounce sirloin steak, broccoli, and a sweet potato with the butter and brown sugar on the side ($11.99). All the food was prepared exactly as I had requested. My server was friendly, checked back a couple of times to see if I needed anything, and delivered the check just as I finished my meal.  Parking is close to the door. The dining area looked very clean. I will continue to keep this steakhouse in mind whenever I have a craving for lunchtime steak (too many steak houses do not open until 4pm)."}
{"text":"Our waiter was nice Josh. The service was super slow though. We just waited and waited. The signature sirloin tastes like shoe leather. Drinks were good. Hamburger was ok. Orders were not correct and girl actually asked if we wanted to slide baked potato off one plate to other. They also ran out of dessert spoons so we had ice cream with a fork. Kind of funny."}
{"text":"I am a fan of outback in general, it is a decent enough meal for what it is.  Perhaps it was that I went close to closing time, but the blooming onion wasn't cooked all the way and the chicken that I got was unimpressive.  Waiter was pleasant and the look/atmosphere was the same as any outback I have gone to before."}
{"text":"Tried to correspond with Madeline at Outback customer service.  Madeline said, \"as a token of our appreciation, we would like to send you something that you can use to help pay for your next Outback meal. When you get a moment, please let us know your mailing address so we can get this out to you.\" A \"TOKEN\" seems insufficient! I was not told that this issue would be addressed with the restaurant manager and sous chef, that steps have been taken and policies implemented to ensure that this type of deceptive practice does not occur again.  Madeline chose to IGNORE my email and has not responded.  On 10/17/17, I provided the restaurant manager my address and to date 11/1/17, I have not received a \"TOKEN\" or anything from Outback Restaurant.  As I stated before, BEWARE OF WHAT TOU RECEIVE FROM THIS RESTAURANT. You will not receive what you ordered. Which is DECEPTIVE and FRAUDULENT. As Outback Restaurant is charging you for a higher priced larger 10 oz. piece of salmon and giving you a smaller 5.6 oz. piece of salmon. The proof is in the picture!!!"}
{"text":"We've been back for hamburgers-- I know that many head to the Outback for Steaks, but we love their burgers.  Cooked (correctly) to order, toppings well prepared, bun buttered and toasted, fries really yummy.  Guilty pleasure fulfilled!  And, as always, friendly courteous service."}
{"text":"I was a kitchen manager for this chain for years as well as a corporate trainer (opened stores) in the 90s. I ordered Aussie cheese fries with an Alice springs chicken without mushrooms. I instructed the bar keep that my chicken was to be dry, over done but not burnt. I said have them use a steak weight which is how they cook steaks here. A reflective light weigh metal device. I got a chicken breast cook just done.  I hate chicken unless it is overdone. The fries were not Aussie cheese and he forgot my dressing.  The upside is was they scraped the mushrooms off prior to bringing it out to me but they were on there at one point."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The filet and lobster tail was perfect.  Its hard to beat a great steak and lobster tail for under $30.  Also the service was on point."}
{"text":"This was our favorite restaurant for years and years. Over the last three years the service, food, and quality have gone downhill. Most recently we ordered takeout and both burgers - when we got home were rare. So much so that I couldn't even eat mine and had to throw it away. Keep in mind we would go here weekly, at least four times a month. I can't bring myself to go there at all anymore. Even when we have gone in to the restaurant lately, the service is slow and they are often out of many of the steaks. I sent a message to corporate regarding our most recent take-out order and never heard anything.  there are not a lot of places to eat in the South Hills area, but I would save your money and try something else."}
{"text":"The downfall of a great place.  The bar probably still rocks but if you sit down in the restaurant area be prepared to be disappointed. They have integrated those stupid screens where you can order and pay for your meal.  We used it to order a dessert and we had to wait nearly 15 mins for them to bring a melted mess minus the correct number of spoons.  The random dude that brought it out said he would have had it sooner had he been able to find a spoon. With the addition of screens comes bad service.  He never did bring an additional spoon.  The Carmel cookie was hard and had a light soup of vanilla ice cream on the top.  I told a newbie who finally noticed and he did bring a spoon but by the time I was able to try some it was neither warm or had much if any ice cream on top.  Highly disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Very impressed by the online ordering options for carry-out; full walk-through the choices/sides/options and pick your time to have it ready - they were spot on with the timing, everything was warm and ready to go.  Very nice to get in and out quickly !"}
{"text":"This is a modification of my original post. I came back here tonight against my will. BUT the staff and service did a total 180!!!   The waiter was very pleasant, I did not get my eye almost poked out and the staff seemed more engaged with the customers   Brandon was a rockstar and everything was perfect!!   Great job tonight!!    This would have been a 1 star but the main entry was pretty good. However the wait staff, and management needs some serious help.   We came to Outback to have a good family time, and the customer service blew that good time out of the water.   The waiter had a who cares attitude the whole time. I understand it was pretty busy when we got there, but there was absolutely no motivation, excitement, and seemed he did not care to even be there. I do not even remember him breaking a smile the entire time he talked to my table. The food was pretty good when we got it, and we had to wait around for another 10 more minutes for a kids bowl of mac n cheese...  When he is serving our plates, I had to move my head back to avoid his forearm in front of my face. Not even an excuse me, pardon me, or let me reach across. I am almost sniffing this dudes frickn armpit. I am starting to think that his important tasks in the back are clouding his better judgement for any kind of manners.   The waiter barely came around to check in or to see how things are going. I figured he had better things to do in the back, or must have been super exhausted from all of the people that were there.   With the food coming out late, a server that does not even smile, and barely checks up on his table. Things got funny when we try to order dessert!!  As we start talking about what is good on the desert menu, he is waving his arms and talking with a lot of animation. I get that, and do it myself at times. But if I have a pen in my hand... I will make sure that I am aware of where my hands are at to a customers face.   Then it gets better!!! I had to reach up to block the guy from getting carried away and poking my eye out. Then instead of saying sorry, or my bad, or anything else like that..... Instead the waiter gets pissed off about it, and acts like a total jerk. Oh and it gets better!!! When they came out with the shake I ordered, it was warm milk with a small scope of ice cream!! Seriously?   It gets better!!!!  I ask to speak with the manager, because I am thinking there is no point in talking to the waiter that is more interested in being in the back, and is acting like a total jerk at this point. When the manager comes over to our table she goes into full defense mode of her waiter, the staff for making my shake \"the right way\" because she saw them make it.   I am starting to wonder what they were doing in the back???? By this point I could care less what the manager had to say, or hearing her defend the waiter or the staff in the back... I seriously wonder what they were doing in the back!!   Then it gets even better, I told her that I did not want the shake, and it looked like milk with a scope of ice cream which is what it looked like. The whole table saw it, and we were all laughing because I must have upset him from not wanting my eye poked out?? She said she would take it off the bill (which we already paid for, so we were not expecting a free meal). Without us realizing it, the waiter double charged my order... I am seriously wondering what was taking up all of his time in the back??   I seriously doubt I will go back to this Outback. There is one off of the 17 that has better servers. Heck, even with my recent business trip to Pittsburgh the Outback over there was 5 stars all around. Don't waste your time with this Outback if you expect to have good customer service, and a manager that does not try to blow smoke up your backside because her employees are screwing up."}
{"text":"We came in here during a snow storm so not to many people inside. The staff was super friendly and came around to check in to see how things were throughout the time we were there. The food was perfect, and we could not ask for anything better."}
{"text":"Fantastic Steak! I always get a great steak at an Outback and this place was no exception! Cooked to perfection! Love the bread and butter, and had a great selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I must admit I have a thing for Outback.  But this Outback is something special...  Their interior has been remodeled within the last couple of years and it looks unlike any I've seen before.  It's absolutely delightful!  There are new designs and murals on the wall, and neat dividers between booths.  The bar looks wonderful and the table tops are shiny and new.  There are all new wooden floors too.  This place got an overhaul and looks great!  Our server was a new girl who had been there a few months, and she did a pretty good job.  I had the spinach artichoke chicken flatbread pizza as an \"aussie-tizer\" and it was AMAZING!  It's only available for a limited time and I highly recommend you get to try it while they have it!  There is an awesome happy hour that spans as long as their open, \"billabong hours\" they call it.  In Australia a billabong is a watering hole, and so at the Outback the bar is their billabong. Their  small draft domestic beers are only $1.95 and the house wine is only $2.50 a glass.  I know right?  Awesome!  The food was outstanding as ever, 10 oz Strips are delicious and the perfect size.  And to top it off with a chocolate thunder from down under was the icing on the cake!  This place is just legit from top to bottom.  On a side note, the manager there, Scott Hughes, is an amazing guy.  I've met him a few times and he's always so incredibly cordial.  He is the essence of hospitality and customer service.  He is always walking around talking with guests ensuring everyone is doing great in his establishment.  He really takes pride in his work, which is so rare to see nowadays in the restaurant industry.  This guy is great at what he does and I'm glad I know him.  If you're in the neighborhood by Superstition Mall I highly recommend going to this place.  It's got great food, great people working, and great management!  Woohoo!  This is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I'll be perfectly honest with you all, I'm pretty biased towards Outback Steakhouse.  This location is a little slower, but that just means you get sat quicker! =)  The staff is friendly, and the prices reasonable.  There is a very large regular bar crowd that comes into this location.  But with their happy hour prices, who can blame them.  Outback's happy hour is \"as long as they're open!\"    Happy Hour includes:  $2.50 on House Wines - Nathanson's Creek (Chard, Merlot, Cab, and White Zin) $2.50 on well drinks $3.50 on well martinis $1.95 on domestic drafts - Bud, Bud Light, Coors Lt, Miller Lt, Amber Bock  Yeah, I know, it's a rockin' Happy Hour!  Mix in some Australian decor and a juicy Strip and I'm set.  The proprietor, Hollywood, is a great guy and is very customer oriented.  He cares for his staff, his regulars, and all first-timers.  If you go in, make sure you try and get to meet him...he's a class act.  Great staff members include: Kris, Coco, Tony, Brian, and Sarah.  The people really make this place, and the fact that Outback has flair is pretty cool too!  Great food, great location, great drinks, let's go Outback tonight!!"}
{"text":"The best lamb chop dinner via takeout ever!  The chops were excellently crusted and tender insider.  Although one chop was a bit pinker than I'd have liked, none tasted gamey.  Even my 19 mos toddler enjoyed bits of it.  There were 4 double chops and totally worth the $22 + the side salad + rice.  Nicely portioned sides, too and I was able to sub the sides instead of mashed potatoes and veggies.  Loved the online ordering and the wait at the curb service.  I really could've eaten more but then the calories wouldve gone up and that 's not good for my waistline.  I would reorder this again!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here recently after visiting the coke store downstairs. The service and food were good. The room was very small and shaped like a triangle so it made getting out of the room to get to the bathroom difficult. The servers and customers would collide and one server nearly tripped and fell on my 2-year-old as I walked her to the bathroom."}
{"text":"The food was amazing the cooks know what there are doing! The bold spicy steak is amazing. My favorite is the coconut shrimp with the Orange marmalade amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for over 10 years and it's always been very good.  I'm not sure if they switched cooks or where they are getting their meats but my last two visits have been subpar to say the least.  If you're known as a steak place then learn how to cook a steak.  This sounds simple, right? On my last visit about a week ago I ordered a Porterhouse, baked potato and grilled asparagas. While waiting I ordered a half order of the Bloomin Onion pedels.  Should have skipped those, really greasy and not hot.  My steak came out on life support, the potato was so small I thought it was a raw onion and they burned my veggies."}
{"text":"First time back in nearly five years.  Nicely remodeled and well appointed.  Has more of an upscale feel over what I would consider a \"sports bar\" setting.  Nicely done.  When you pay 30 bucks for a steak, you shouldn't feel like you are in the middle of a college football bowl game.  It is a chain, so you can do better but if you are price concscious, Outback satisfies."}
{"text":"Worst meal i've ever had and I didn't even get my entree.   Was craving a steak and decided to go to Outback since it was the closest \"steakhouse\" near us. The service is absolutely phenomenal. Our waiter was super polite and attentive. Was quick to bring us our drinks and bread. With my meal I ordered a side salad (which came out very quick) and I began eating. Halfway through my salad I reached for another bite and a  DEAD bug was in my salad. It took a lot to not reject what just went in my mouth previous. I quickly alerted the waiter and left and will not be returning. That is a serious health code violation and god knows what else is back in that kitchen if that's in the side salad. Do yourself a favor and go to a real place for steaks. Stay away."}
{"text":"For the price, Outback is really hard to beat.  At lunch, the endless salads and soups are great.  The Bloomin' Onion is always a favorite. I am not going to kid anyone, the steak is just average, but they won't kill you for $29 or more.  I have to say, the service here was really great!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a shame that there staff doesn't match the new decor and building.  Awful service.  10 min wait at our table without being acknowledged. Finally told the hostess that we wanted to move tables and asked if we could sit in the bar. She nodded.  Before we were about to grab a table in the bar the poorly mannered and trained bartender screams across the restaurant we can't sit there.  Awesome. That was all I needed to know what a shitty job the manager did hiring & training for this location.   We took our business up the street to there other location on warm springs and Las Vegas blvd.  great service every time. Maybe they could send there staff to that location as well and receive proper training."}
{"text":"Went there with my family after my college graduation. The food took longer than normal only because of the high volume (normal for graduation night). However, the waitress and manager were very communicative and took care of our appetizer for us. Offered to by us all dessert but we were too full, but appreciated the customer service very much. The service was good and the food was good as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice recently, and both times EVERYTHING we ordered was so over-salted, it was gross. I remember this location being good in the past, so I have no clue what has happened as of lately. I would avoid here, you spend the same amount for an awesome meal at the Brown Derby in Streetsboro, expect that one is way fresher and better!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but we had the best waiter EVER, Donovan!!!! Super funny, helpful, great Australian accent ever! Great time!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a great location for curb side ordering, but the last 4 or so times I've gone, \"it's always something\". Whether it be forgotten items, food prepared the wrong way, long waits, or just forgetting to bring out my food, it's way too much of a hassle. I'll go else where thanks."}
{"text":"The bread was not tasty, the butter tasted \"off\" the Ceasar salad was just ok. It is a steak house primarily but the Sirloin while flavorful was tough in parts. I enjoy a trip to McDonald's more or certainly Culvers. Our server was not exactly Johnny on the spot."}
{"text":"Three and 1/2 stars.  Being in Charlotte, where the lowest fast food franchises get 4 stars I couldn't understand why Outback rated so low ... but I think I've figured it out: if there's one thing that local Yelpers are unforgiving about, it's $$$$.  Charging around $20+ for 10 to 12 oz of beef with a side of mashed potatoes may be average at the national scale but it's pretty expensive for this type of venue here. So much so that I went for the burger instead, plain, nothing but the meat with a dab of mustard. It was served juicy, cooked the way I asked and the ground beef was primo, among the best burger meat I've had anywhere. The Caesar salad, like always, bears no relationship to the real thing but the dressing had a tasty bite to it so it was not boring. The fries are the standard frozen stuff but they were cooked right and not over salted or spiced with artificial flavors.   The damage for the burger with fries and the salad was just under $12 - not including drinks, tax and tip. Considering the quality I think it's reasonable and Outback has become my go-to burger in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Awful. Absolutely awful. Do not eat here!!!  For starters, there was no hostess present when we arrived at the restaurant. We sat down in the entry-way and waited. Two more couples arrived....still no hostess. My boyfriend walked in and flagged someone down to tend to us.   An older lady finally led us to a table, she was cold. There was no name tag on her, but she did not give us the time of day. No apology from ANYONE was given to us for our wait to be seated.   Upon being seated, our server arrived, bringing us water. We had to ASK for bread (a staple at Outback Steakhouse's)...  To top it off, our EXPENSIVE steaks were prepared incorrectly. They were ordered to be \"medium\" but both were over-cooked, grey and dry.   Seriously, do yourself a favor and eat anywhere else besides this Outback. We should have chosen Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse or Gordon Ramsey's Burger. Or Earl of Sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been to Outback a few times in my home city (Las Vegas) and by far the experience has never been as great as the visit I had at this location. Our server Eric L was was awesome even with a big party he was taking care he still managed to be attentive to our needs. The food was amazing as well. I would only wish the service and food we were given can be past on to the other locations-Thank you Eric and staff for a great experience"}
{"text":"Came here around 4pm on a Saturday and got seated quickly, it wasn't busy yet as they  just started dinner rush. We were seated right beside the kitchen (really annoying because of the pots and pans clanking beside us). Our server never greeted us until after 10 mins (it was not busy) we get our drinks shortly after, as we just ordered we sit and wait for our appetizer to come out. 10-15 mins passes and finally our server comes out and asks if we would like their brown bread, at this point I was so confused because I thought they normally bring out the bread right after you order? I don't know maybe it's different elsewhere.   Everything came out so SLOW! We didn't get our food until 5 pm!! That's an hour we waited for two entrees!!! My steak was cooked more med-well and I asked for medium, it was soooo tough and chewy it was hard to chew down. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Love this place a lot and utilize their Curbside Takeout service, as it is fast and friendly, plus being on the way home from work, wee can pick it up and enjoy a nice meal at home and not have to face dinner crowds and waits.   Their service has always been really good and reliable and their staff members are always friendly. We've never had a bad meal from this restaurant either. It's always been delicious and still piping hot when we take it home.   I recommend this location because they are fantastic and provide excellent service."}
{"text":"Ate at Outback for lunch with my family. Went back to hotel and vomited for the next 13 hours. Cause? You decide."}
{"text":"I was there during the Mother's Day debacle. 3 kids and my wife. It did take 2 hours to get our dinner. With that said, the manager comped our meal and we have since gone back several times. Always good service and well prepared food and cocktails. Everyone has a bad day sometimes."}
{"text":"Loved the service!!! Julie is the best! She's so kind and nice made us feel really comfortable and enjoyed our meal! And the food was great!!"}
{"text":"Five stars because of the service! The owner Angelo is great and our waiter Harvey was super nice and really attentive. I will definitely be back and soon!"}
{"text":"Kids like to eat here and we've always had good experiences at the Huntersville location. The staff is friendly and the service has always been above average. Food is what you would expect at Outback, a decent cut of meat for a very reasonable price. It does get pretty busy on the weekends, but we generally go before 5:30 and rarely have to wait."}
{"text":"The Victoria cut Filet Mignon (9 oz) with a side of mash potato was amazing and melted in my mouth! Great location (center of strip) and fast and attentive staff. Will go back to try signature ribs."}
{"text":"I have a smile on my face after eating Victoria's filet. That steak cuts like butter and melts in your mouth. Sadly our hostess wasn't at her position but we found our way to the bar tables. Took some time to get drinks but that may be due to short staff for bar. The food was way too good though. THANK YOU CHEFS!"}
{"text":"We had a celebration dinner here tonight. We were personally served by Caleb, the manager, who made sure everything was perfect!!! I love going to this particular location b/c they spoil me!!! The food and service are impeccable, and when something is amiss, they go to any lengths to make sure we leave there happy. This Outback has not forgotten that the customer is always right. Thank you for a great evening!!!  Michelle D in Phoenix"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the Outback in Gastonia yesterday. We ate at the bar, we were the only people at the bar and I have to say it was the worst service I think I've ever had. The bartender would just disappear for very long periods, she had no other customers but us.  She did this during our entire lunch. Took forever just to order a beverage and then we waited forever again to order our food. Two customers now. I would hate to think what service would be if they were busy. The food was good no complaints there."}
{"text":"Started off good. However when we needed to pay to get to an appointment our server Ronald disappeared. I had to go to bar to pay for my bill, and ask for to go box, however, my husband in the mean time seen our server asked for box, so he took food, waiting at door, till there literally no time to spare. I think server was remaking it or had to much to jugle, we had to leave our food that we paid for $47, worth behind. Was so dame PO. Will be back. Even at 12:37pm. They couldn't handle the crowd on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the food here. I can never get anything other than the Alice springs chicken! I like stake but this Alice springs chicken gives you cravings. Also the bread here is unique and scrumptious. The service is efficient and their margaritas are fantastic when I am in the mood and can splurge."}
{"text":"I've dined at plenty of Outbacks, plenty of times, and I must say that this is probably the best of all of them, and here are two reasons why:  Kent Sallman, Server Cody Hancock, Shift Supervisor/Acting Manager  In order for any dining establishment to meet my needs, the service must be better than the food, because, after all is said (and eaten!), the STAFF are what bring me back.  If I am treated rudely, I'll never return, regardless how good the food tastes, or how reasonable the prices are.  I take into account the quality of the cuisine, of course, but again, I give the majority of my assessment to the quality of the personnel, and the two folks noted above, EXCEEDED my expectations, definitely.  I will continue to choose this particular location, whenever I have the urge to tear into an 18 ounce Porterhouse, prepared with \"no pink\" inside.  This one has permanently \"spoiled\" me!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. And I wont be back.  First time, my steak was over cooked and dry.  service was nothing special.  Second time, was horrible. My family and I arrived at 3pm our order for drinks was not taken until 3:20pm and no server greeted us, besides the hostess. The hostess then came to our table and sauid someone will be with you.  I was ready to walk out, but my husband said to stay.  Then we over heard the 2 servers fighting about 2 large parties.  Large parties=GOOD tips. Finally our server came and took our order.  Our food came around 4:15pm. and we had to wait 10mins for the server to come and give us utensils.  The place was not busy at all. Overall, paid for Lame service, food was Ok not the best, long wait, inexperienced servers, not professional, NOT coming here again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. First date in 2 months because we work so many hours and the service & food was pitiful. We sat down, excited and ready for a good night, we told the server we were looking forward to being at her table as it was our first date after getting engaged 2 months ago, but we waited for 30 min for our food and they brought out his Med-rare steak done Medium then 10 min later my chicken with no sides. They could have at least brought my sides while he ate his steak or offered us bread, but instead she kept saying \"I'm sorry, it's not my fault\". They compensated my meal, but they had so many ways to make it suck less. Thankfully my fiancé makes  the time pleasurable. NEVER RETURNING."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying the food was amazing, the cooks did an excellent job these 2 stars are for the cooks team!      Dec 1 2017 our 3 year Anniversary.  We live in Maricopa which has very few option for places to dine, which is what brought us to Chandler last night, it's a little bit of a drive for us but usually worth it.. USUALLY....       The server (tall black male not sure his name because he didn't introduce himself, and the host didn't tell us his name either just \"your server will be over\")  after ordering a bahama mama he returns to inform us of the long list of things they did not have for it. I happily switched to an Adios (amf), after a few minutes the server walks to our table with his phone out and proceeds to ask me \"what's in It?\" I mean what kinda bar tender do you have that can't look up drinks themself on Google just like i did while sitting at the table.      THEN our blooming onion comes out, but we have no silverware or napkins. We sat there with greasy fingers for a couple minutes before flagging down a waitress that wasn't ours, who then brought us bathroom papertowls, you know the ones folded up together that come out of the dispenser in the bathroom. WHILE EVERYONE ELSE HAD NICE CLOTH NAPKINS WE GET PAPER TOWLES! STILL NO SILVERWARE EITHER.  Then our meal comes GREAT WONDERFUL Looks GREAT!  We went through our entire meal and the server only came by one time, my husband drink was GONE, and he started drinking mine because NO Service.       I also found it quite rude when all the servers announced the Officer who just graduated the academy, and our server stood by the computer pretending like he didn't hear the girls announcing this.        THEN we pay on the tablet thing, because again no service, we get up now to leave NO one tells us to have a good night. Then as I walk around the building to my car the server is at the table picking up the tip I didn't want to leave, He got 8 dollars from my husband THAT I WOULD HAVE NEVER LEFT! SO I see him doing this and I intentionally walked up to the window and waved bye.  Every but of service we did get was like pulling a tooth, and to watch that man pick up my money from the table even though he couldn't say bye 30 seconds before was sickening, you stood there and watched us walk out you couldn't say bye, but your entitled to my money. FROM SERVERS TO HOST TO THE BARTENDER TO THE NONEXISTANT MANAGEMENT THIS PLACE WAS A JOKE!   We stopped at Native on our way back into Maricopa for drinks although it was karaoke night BUT at least we get service there!"}
{"text":"Decided on Outback for a late lunch after walking around aimlessly on the Strip. The Outback is located inside Casino Royale on the second floor. The restaurant looked pretty gloomy and drab.  An eager server promptly took our drink and food orders. The food was off as if it were defrosted right before it was served to me on a plate. I do like Outback but this one did not do it for me. The prices are higher due to location, if only the food was decent, I would not have minded paying more. The service was good."}
{"text":"Outback was one of our favorite restaurants when we lived in Thousand Oaks, CA.  But we've never tried this one.  So we went for a late evening snack.  The grilled shrimp on the barbie was just like we remembered it.  And the Alice Springs chicken is my wife's very favorite.  So the evening was fine.  If it weren't a chain it might be a four star for some people.    We sat at the bar and ate there - say hi to Heidi.  She is super!  Almost makes it a four star, as well.  We'll go back again."}
{"text":"50 minute wait for curbside carry out, told it would be out in 15 minutes after waiting 5 minutes, took another 30+ minutes! Numerous cars and other food couriers have came and went while I wait and wait. My order was small and simple: six ounce sirloin, grilled asparagus, dry baked potato with a strawberry shortcake dessert. WTF..."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the lack of customer service at this location.   We'd planned for days to have an early family dinner out on Saturday. We arrived a bit after 4 pm. We walked in and the young man at the host's podium did not look up nor did he greet us. Well,ok, maybe you're new and don't know how to appropriately greet your customers. He told us it was going to be 5 to 10 minutes of a wait. We looked around and the restaurant was barely full at that hour. Why the wait?  Very curious. As we moved toward the seating, I thought it was odd that the rude host didn't even bother to ask our party's name or the number of people who were dining. My husband went back to the podium to give him our names and again, no eye contact from the host and a mumble that he didn't need it. Again, very strange.  The host seemed immersed in his work of some kind; reviewing a chart over and over. Come on!  If you're the host, do your job!    While my husband and son used the restrooms (which they reported were gross and smelled of urine) I sat there getting more miffed by the second. Why should I give this place my hard earned money? No way. I decided we were leaving.   On our way out the manager opened the door for us and thanked us for coming. Hah!  I asked him if he was the manager and he said he was. I promptly told him that the host was rude and recounted the story. It appeared as if he was going to reprimand the offender but guess what?  We did not receive an apology from the manager. That is the very least he should have done. It starts from the top down and I know who the main culprit is.  I've decided to never go to this chain again! Ever!  Get your team together manager or this location is doomed."}
{"text":"Brandon was our server and he is incredible!   My husband and I came here a few weeks ago, but it was only tonight when I had a terrible experience at Applebee's that I was reminded of how great Outback is and how they really set the standard in this class of dining establishments.   We were seated quickly, and they were a bit on the busy side. At first we waited for a little while, but Brandon made up for it and then some!   He knew the menu like the back of his hand and even accommodated my craving for spicy chicken and asked the cooks to spice it up! This place is no Ritz Carlton, but it was delicious! He even recommended some appetizers that were the perfect size for the two of us.   He stayed on top of the drinks even as it became more and more busy. He had personality and interacted with his guests and seemed to enjoy his job.   Great experience, great service. Thanks Outback and Brandon!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times.   The staff is very friendly.  The owner is awesome ! She is very hands on and customer friendly.   The food is yummy !  We will come back again and again ! ! !"}
{"text":"We had a birthday party of eleven people with kids of all ages too. Our Server Beth was awesome. She got the job done. Our food was delicious and everything was cooked perfectly. I would absolutely go back. Thanks for a great memorable lunch for our grandsons birthday."}
{"text":"I will stick with my previous (4 years ago!) review and say \"A-OK\".  Because it is.  Outback is reliably good.  They won't knock your socks off with exciting flavors, but the food is good and the portions are adequate.  I kept it simple today.  A burger and fries.  The grass-fed beef burger.  It was good.  The fries were a little too salty (and I like salt!), but they were fine.  I also got to try the tortilla soup and the philly sandwich.  Both were good.  We were all satisfied with our meals.  And the table bread is nice.  Service also was very good."}
{"text":"My opinion of Outback hasn't really changed.  It's an adequate steak house.  Nothing special.  In the past I said some locations seemed better than others.  My visiting is not very frequent now so I don't know if that's still true.  One of the big differences was always the Blooming Onion.  Some places were limp and greasy, others were light and crispy.  I felt like something simple, and had a gift card, so we came here today.  I had a simple burger and fries.  Also ordered was the soup/salad combo and a chopped steak.  Everything was fine.  Not outstanding, but solidly good.  And we do like their bread service.  Nice little warm loaf.  An OK place to go in a pinch, but I don't think it will ever be a destination we plan on.  Except that I still have almost $10 on that gift card, so I do need to make a point of using that soon."}
{"text":"This place has went down hill over the past few years. Food is nothing special now but more importantly, the service absolutely sucks. Call in times are over the top long. So disappointed in every way."}
{"text":"Had the 4 course meal. French onion soup, which was pretty good but very salty. Then a blue cheese chopped salad which was even better then the soup. A 6 oz sirloin Rare & mashed potatoes that were very very dry. Most of my steak was rare till the end which was cooked medium. But it had good flavor. Then Desert which was cheesecake with a raspberry sauce. That was the bomb. My only real complaint was there wasn't much time to have the soup & salad & then they brought dinner. I wasn't even half way done with both so I missed out on eating the soup & salad. We should have told them not to put our steaks on till we were done. But all in all it was good"}
{"text":"Excellent Dinner with my favorite person. Also we had an exceptional waitress. The food is always consistent here. The Lobster is to die for. Cooked just right as was my rare steak"}
{"text":"Ordered Filet Mignon, veggies and garlic mash curbside pickup on 3/21/2011.  It was good, not quite great.  Service for pickup was excellent."}
{"text":"This is like the 5th visit in 2 months always perfection. I light have upset a manager. I am sorry for that, but managers need to know when to say great and walk away.  But still a great place to dine at. Best Steakhouse experience around."}
{"text":"Saturday night, January 4th 2014 about 5pm.  We came in & it was jammed packed with people.  It was about a 35 minute wait.  We asked to be seated with Victor, the young ladies at the podium were more than accommodating.  I had no idea we were celebrating my Birthday four days early, it was a nice surprise.    We ordered soft drinks & a half order of Aussie fries (yum). I was going to get my usual, the Sweet Glazed Pork Tenderloin (11.99). Victor asked me if I had tried the Porterhouse (14.99), I had not & it looked delicious. I figured it would be nice to try something different.  I had mashed garlic potatoes & broccoli for my sides.  This Porterhouse is freakin' HUGE.  I even snapped a photo of this thing. It came out medium as I had asked.  I could not finish it in the end & I ended up being over stuffed. Outstanding service from everyone.  I snapped pictures of the menu while we waited on the drinks (for yelp).  All & all it was delicious, 10/10 service.   I even had dessert since today was my cheat day (I'm wheat, corn, Walnut & peanut intolerant). I had a slice of bread & Oreo ice cream that was fudging amazing (haha)."}
{"text":"This location never really disappoints. The waitstaff is friendly, a manager always asks how things are. I stick with Outback because the food is consistently delicious.   Today I ordered an 8 oz filet, classic cooked, medium. When my steak came out it was...just not what I pictured it normally looking like. It didn't have the dark crusty seared outside. It was thin. It was cooked about medium well/close to well, and probably due to this it was tough. The texture was the worst part because I get the filet for the texture. Despite the fact that it's not usually the MOST flavorful cut, it's worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness. The classic seasoning & sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts.   I am NOT the type of person who sends things back, however, my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didn't think it looked like a filet. So, when Andrew the manager came by and asked how things were, I quizzed him about what cut he thought it was. He got it right...8 oz filet. I told him I only asked because it wasn't what I was used to a filet looking/feeling/tasting like. He agreed that it wasn't ideal and insisted on getting me a new one. I told him it wasn't necessary, and if it was the filet I'd eat it despite the lack of the usual Outback perfection. Nope...Andrew wouldn't have that. He brought a new one. The new one was undercooked, but since Andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me, he promptly took it back to be fixed.    This time it was PERFECT. It was thick like a filet should be, and was cooked exactly medium...red in the center but not bloody. The searing was precisely what I always look forward to at Outback. It was the best steak I've had in a long time.  I was very happy with the way Andrew and our server Shelby made me feel like a valued guest and made me feel like it was OKAY to let them make my order perfect. I don't think I'll become one of those picky sender backer types, but it was nice to know that at this Outback location I don't ever have to settle for anything less than perfect.   Between Andrew and Shelby, this location has secured me as a customer and I will be back next time I want a fantastic steak!"}
{"text":"Really good food and the prices aren't that bad the service is good. I'll be back believe that."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about going here after reading the reviews but it was the most convenient after watching a movie at the theater.  I was by myself taking some time for myself without kids.  I sat at the bar and my bartender was awesome.  She was very attentive and made sure I was taken care of. The male bartender didn't seem all that great. The food was on point as well as the cocktails.  The only downside was the manager.  He made sure to check on the \"regulars\" but nobody else. I get wanting to see how the regulars are doing since you see them often and you make money off of them. However, if you are already in the bar area asking out their meal tastes you would think you would ask the others how their meals are too. Just my opinion. ..."}
{"text":"I agree with Marcus S. Just close the place already! Only open for Dinner During the week. Fridays & weekends, open for lunch. Have a friend in the area who wanted to go. Worst service ever. Was not offered bread. Bar service took forever, unlike the food. Soup, Salad, drinks, all served at the same time. Probably because the place only had a few tables and wasn't busy at all. My burnt entrée arrived, & a fairly decent hamburger, within minutes of soup and salad. Server checked on our table, with 2 loaves of bread in hand. Not for our table though. We thought they didn't serve the bread during lunch? His surprised face said it all. I called to speak to manager when I got home. Manager offered to replace meal next time I come back in. I told him it wouldn't be happening. Save your money. I left hungry after ordering 3 courses and sending the main entrée back. Too bad, I'm usually an exceptional tipper."}
{"text":"There is a reason this location barely stays open. This was supposed to be a medium burger, not raw. They consistently raise prices and the quality keeps getting worse."}
{"text":"I have a few issues with tonights meal. First I wish on sat night when I'm taking out the girl, they would get it right. Also this particular outback has consistently been terrible. I honest love outback and the manager was nice about things and comped the meal. But I didn't get the impression they are going to fix the issues. Or even capible of fixing things. Service was slow. Not terrible just subpare to start with. Salad had almost no dressing.  Soda was very good and bread was fresh. The baked patato was obviously in a steamer for at least four hours. That's just wrong. Can I please have a fresh one with my steak. The crab was the worst I have ever eatten.  The crab was dried out. My steak was so dry I almost chocked on it. I had beef jerky that was more tender. My girlfriend ordered her steak med well and it came out rare. This is the problem. We finally chased down the server who was not good about checking on the food and he had it cooked properly.  You got a second chance do it right?  No it tasted like they cleaned the grill with grill cleaner and scrapped all the old junk off the grill and then recooked it on there. That's just wrong. I felt like it was my fault for not ordering a rare steak.  Seriously I'm not sure how they could have made the meal any worse.  Shame on you."}
{"text":"Had a little incident and the staff was very helpful. Jason was exceptional. We enjoyed our meal. Steak was cook to order, it is hard for me to get that everywhere I go. Thank you again to the Staff that helped us because of the incident in the bathroom. Thank you Megan as well. Max was our server and he was very patient with us too. Thank  You all."}
{"text":"I really, really hate to give this location a 2 star rating, as we have eaten here quite often and the steaks have always been good, and I can't say enough on the good side about their loaded baked potatoes!  BUT, tonight my husband and myself decided to try the prime rib.  BIG mistake!  I ordered the 20 ounce, medium rare.  When it arrived it was so red, not pink, but red, that I thought they were kidding!  I happen to love rare meat, sort of a barbarian here, so I decided to give it a try.  It was so hard to cut with their big steak knives, and when I did get a piece cut and tried to chew it, it was so tough I didn't know whether to try and swallow, or spit it out!  My husband asked if I wanted to send it back to get it cooked further and I said what for, that is not going to help the strands of unchewable fat running through it.  Instead I boxed it up and brought it home for Jake - he could care how it's cooked or how tough it is, he's an Australian Shepherd who eats anything from spaghetti to pickles, so he loved this prime rib.  Unfortunately, I did not love it and will never order it again!  Sorry Outback Steakhouse, but you really goofed on this one!  P.S.  Dinner was $55.00!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible and I haven't even gotten to the food. My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to dinner out. We were promptly seated near the bar, but ended up waiting for quite a while before having to ask the host to request a waiter/waitress. Meanwhile parties that came in after us (and seated next to us) were having their drinks served. We must have become invisible and cease to exist once we entered this establishment. Once we were served, the food was decent."}
{"text":"We ordered here online and picked up the food. Overall delicious! I have not eaten at Outback for years, so this was a really nice surprise. Everything was good. The staff had not come out to the car after 5 minutes after the allotted time so we had to go pay inside, which was not a big deal. All in all -- it was good! Not quite a 5-star experience or food (the steak was nicely seasoned, perfectly cooked, but really pretty tough), but a very nice 4-star Sunday night dinner \"in\"!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in 8 years since I had a 300$ Steak!!! See my car was broken into while I was indulging in a juicy steak and lobster tail. So needless to say I got sick anytime I thought about coming back here. Fast forward 8 years and it's TakeOut Tuesday for my family where you have to go with the Pick of the Week by whoever turn it is to pick. So I'm at Outback...scared. Lol. So I park my Car in the front and thank the heavens we were seated by the window and I can see Sandy(car) in full view!!!! Now let's get to the food....  I don't know what I'm the hell took me so long to Come back!!??? FEAR and also I have up Beef 4 years ago. But BABY!!!! I'm back not to Beef but Outback. There are so many other options and all is great. They even let you customize your meal. And that is spectacular!!!! Their bread and salad is one of the best and most slept one I think. I was tipsy off of one drink and my waitress was cute, funny and uber knowledgeable. One downfall is the lighting is way too dim and sometimes I find that suspect but their rating was an A so I didn't complain. Will be back...and yes parking at the front and seated at a window."}
{"text":"Can you give a restaurant a lower rating for just not changing?  Guess so.  Seems like Outback does what it always has, it just has gotten kind of boring.  Blooming onion is still awesome, the vegetables are awesome and the food is good.  I guess I'm just spoiled.  No reason not to go here, but it just seems like there are better options nowadays.  They need to do something in improve their visibility."}
{"text":"After receiving 2 complimentary cards given from an Outback representative in Poway, CA due to lack of service, this place provides an exceptional service. We were served right after we sat down, and received our breads 3 min after. The waiter was timely and friendly and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"It's 12:45 pm and the half of the restaurant is empty, but the party of 3 needs to wait 30 minutes to get a table! Why? Because they don't have enough servers, this is rediculas,  will never come back here at lunch time, I don't have 2 hours for lunch,"}
{"text":"We've eaten here in the past but ate here again on Valentine's Day. The wait was an hour and a half but guess we should have expected this on Valentines.  The staff was outstanding. We kept asking how long we had to wait. Other people of course had the same question. The hostess continually answered this question with a smile on her face all night.  Our waitress was outstanding. The food was incredible. We even managed to force down a desert which is rare for us.  We'll definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Ok, I am providing this quick review because I feel that even though there are millions of quality steakhouses in Las Vegas, this brand is a magnet for money-conscience tourists rolling into town.  Hence the reason I am jotting these thoughts down as guests from LA wanted something quick, and affordable off (but still near) the Strip.  You can always count on great comfort food here, and the service is equally good...quick and responsive.    The quality is not comparable to say, Hanks or Morton's, but they have a full service bar and plenty of offerings that will make the most picky eater happy with their choice.  Caution! Their are trained to \"up sell\" everything, so be prepared to order items you cannot finish...kudos to their training program!"}
{"text":"The good the bad and the ugly, I had the bone in ribeye and it was cooked to perfection it tasted great  and it was probably one of the best steaks I've had it outback steakhouse. On the other hand my wife ordered a salad with steak on it, they couldn't get the order right three different times. The people who brought it out were snooty, and they've pretty much ruined the dinner because he couldn't sync our meals up together."}
{"text":"I have never left a yelp review before but this time I have to speak out.  I suggested Outback for lunch and was left looking like a fool for doing so....We had a out of town friend visiting that we brought with us, we came for lunch at 1:30pm after having to wait 15 with a buzzer in a restaurant that was almost empty, that was sort of like a joke, but took it in stride.  I ordered the 1/2 rib eye steak sandwich and was given the smallest roll with a paper thin slice of meat covering 1/2 of the tiny roll.  When the server came by I showed it to her and told her it was very lacking, her response was that it was that way because it was only one half of a sandwich.  How that makes up for a skimpy sandwich, it was literally a half of roll with some melted cheese on it.  I am a caterer and never would serve such a item to a client or then come up with some ridiculous excuse for why it was like that.  She offered to make me another, which I said no thank you too one was enough and everyone else was finished eating by the time she offered.  So she then handed me the bill for the sandwich...."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Outback Steak House of old. I don't know what's happened to this place, but the portions are smaller and the food isn't as good as it use to be. Won't be back!  That's good news for Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"What happened to outback back in the day it was great. Now it just blaaa, very very small portions and the price compared to the serving size is way off. I promise this is my last time here. Place just has a whole fast food vibe to it now really sucks i remember it was great"}
{"text":"have had eaten there many times before and enjoyed the food but when my wife, daughter and I ate there on Monday we all wound up very sick the next day and the only thing we had in common was eating salad from Outback. No response from the manager."}
{"text":"Food was excellent (thus the star)!  However, our server, Jennifer, was not as attentive to us as she was to the other diners.   She passed by our table without asking how our food was or if we needed any refills.  I saw her go to the table in front of and behind me and ask how they were doing.  I couldn't believe she deliberately ignored our table.  When I asked her clearly for a lime for my Diet Coke, she asked if I wanted lime or lemon.  Really??  She was not friendly and didn't even attempt to be.   I don't think she even ever smiled.  Just made us feel like we were bothering her, it was awkward to ask her for things.    I also was disappointed because their dining room time was different on line (until 1030 pm).  They were only open until 9 pm.    Although I like their food, I will not be returning to any Outback restaurant.  Lots of other restaurants with much friendlier staff who seem genuinely happy to help you enjoy your dining experience.  And for the price we paid...why, even servers at Chick-fil-A were much better."}
{"text":"Good steaks, good prices for Vegas Strip. Robert was an excellent server."}
{"text":"Normally I always come here and it is great service... But, think twice before coming on a holiday... a busy holiday at that--- Xmas eve!! They are out of volcano shrimp!! One of the new items they are advertising!  Ok so I understand but then I order another new item on the menu.. The South Wales sangria.. Waitress comes back with-- I'm sorry we are all out!! So seriously now it's getting annoying. Finally we order our meal.. Well the steak skillet-- waitress comes back with \"I'm so sorry but we are out of the skillet meal\".. The meat?  \"Yes\"  At 8:00!!! 2 whole hours before close and I think it would be quicker to tell me what they do have rather than what's \"sold out\"!!! Completely unacceptable, especially for a \"professional\" chain, yea right this place is a complete and utter JOKE!  Ok this is a steak place!! Your out of the drinks you advertise and the volcano shrimp!! Sooo just be prepared to be disappointed tonight if you do decide to spend your money here at outback for a NICE DINNER!!"}
{"text":"Went Saturday nite 4:30 for prime rib with family the prime rib was excellent for me and my brother in law my wife orders chicken & ribs very disappointed again!!! Three tiny bones very little meat and Chicken over cooked very dry That is three times on that meal never other again It says third of a rack well a third of a rack should be 4-5 bones"}
{"text":"I love this place. You all can go pay for your high priced steaks. But the flavor, the drinks, the sides the portions.. yeup Outback is still my favorite place for steak . AND THEY TAKE RESERVATION. They have a full service bar, I recommend the vicotria fillet, with soup either French onion or the creamy potato. They do half orders of their appetizers, you just half to ask. My mouth is salivating just writing this review."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on 5/9, party of 3. I got a coupon in the mail for $8 off 2 entrees. Kudos to Outback, the coupon says 'or $4 off one entree', which is something I like, you should not have to miss out on discounts if you are dining on your own.  Our server was a young man, very friendly and nice.  I had the New York strip, it was good, cooked as I ordered. Hubby had a steak sandwich and he liked it very much as well. We don't eat as much as we used to, so we had a little left overs.  I didn't try the bread, but they did like it and had like 2 pieces I believe.  I had a side salad with blue cheese and it was fresh and tasty. But, the surprise of the night were the green beans. I am doing low carb and thought it was a good idea to try them. They have never been a favorite of mine but these ones were delicious. They had this buttery flavor and they were bright green and crisp. I think I almost ate them all before tasting my steak.  Not so good was the dish that our daughter ordered. Well, the dish itself she liked, but the portion was way too small. I believe it was the Seafood Mixed Grill, which is mahi, scallops and shrimp. I didn't count the shrimp but it had 2 scallop pieces, and a small piece of mahi that was like an ounce or so... It was probably smaller than the lunch portions at other restaurants. : ( She finished it and was still hungry so we shared some of our food with her.  When our server stopped by to ask how we were doing we mentioned it and it seems we are not the only ones not very pleased with that portion : ( $9-$12 would maybe have been OK for that dish, but it was around $17, so thumbs down on that mini Seafood Mixed Grill."}
{"text":"I have not been to the Outback in years as past visits have, well, sucked. I am not one to complain, I just never go back if I have a bad experience or two. Seriously, there are too many good places to go out to eat to return to business who don't focus on their food.   So my boss loves this place and she wanted to go and of course as she is the boss I agreed to return to the Outback with her.   I have to admit this place has changed. Our server, Bree, was excellent! A server can make or break your meal and Bree was on her game.   The food was really good, OK, I am super picky and was ready to hate it as I have in the past but tonight was different. I ordered the teriaki marinated sirloin. It came perfectly cooked at medium with sweet potato, salad and bread all for $12.95.   Maybe I got lucky and came here on a good night but I am glad I did and will definitely return."}
{"text":"The best of the best are here !  Great food. Great service !  The staff is smart and they know good customer service !!"}
{"text":"OK, the blooming onion is terrific, albeit greasy and unhealthy, but who cares about then when you order fried food? But the steaks--ewwwww. Don't know who is cutting their meats, but that New York I bought last weekend was an awful combination of fat and gristle. And my friend's sirloin was no better. The waitress was too harried to notice that our steaks remained on our plates when we asked for the check. Too bad."}
{"text":"Overcrowded and average food. I wish the bar were ALL ADULT. WHY? because people bring children and babies in carriers out at late nights and spoil if for those who dont have children.  I wish SOMETHING had vegetarian offerings. Everything has unhealthy meat and dairy in it. Yes I know this is a steakhouse but some in our party want to eat better food.  A FAMILY restaurant should CATER to all families and my family has NO kids.  was dissapointed. the food looks way better on the menu than when is served. It looks like 17 yr olds are the ones cooking."}
{"text":"Outback constantly delivers, came here earlier for Valentines Day, even though they were busy the host was very nice and assuring. Our server was busy but came and checked on us at the perfect time. Really loved the ribeye and lobster tail :). My girlfriend had the ribeye with a baked potato. Great food and service definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"First time at out back yesterday and the whole experience was great. Little bit of a wait but considering the end of the school year dinners it wasn't that bad. Food was amazing and so was our waitress"}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience tonight!  We have become \"eat at the bar people\" and let me tell you, this instantly became one of our favorite bars to sit at. Bret and Trent were nothing short of phenomenal. The water glass never got empty and they were spot on with drinks. I love the fact that this bar carries a local brew (Lovelady). That right there bumps a bar up for me, even if it's not a brew I enjoy. That being said, they had the Outbock which is a cross between an IPA and a Bock, and it is AWESOME!! We ordered the crab cakes for a starter. If you have followed us at all, you know we are crab cake snobs. With that, we really enjoyed Outback's. When they brought them out, it smelled like crab, always a good first impression. They were very good with a good balance of crab vs. breading. We will definitely be back for those. We ordered the Ribeye and we were very pleased. Cooked to perfection and a very good cut of beef. We were very happy with our food and our service, and we will most certainly be coming back. Be sure to say hello, we'll be at the bar."}
{"text":"While the food was good I'm only giving one star because the service and then the follow up by the manager was HORRIBLE and OFFENSIVE!! When my meal didn't come out right, the waitress avoided me and then the manager came over and said there was a \"misunderstanding\" between me and the waitress.  When I told him there was no misunderstanding, he started to laugh at me and said, \"that's not what the waitress told me.\" He never apologized for the misunderstanding, didn't offer any accommodations, and simply walked away. What happened to making sure the customer is satisfied. I will never eat in that outback steakhouse again."}
{"text":"My niece want to go here for her birthday, on a Friday night.  The wait was about 30 min.    The onion blossom was not as crispy as I remember but still pretty good. Its horseradish sauce was stronger than I expected.  I had to ask for a side of ketchup.    My steak was cooked as ordered (medium rare) but lacked taste somehow; the lobster tail was grilled right.  The steak of my niece was on the dry side (overcooked). My daughter's steak was as she liked it (medium rare).  For dessert, we shared a gigantic scoop of ice cream and whipped cream and an Oreo waffle with more ice cream and whipped cream.  We couldn't finish.  The service was good. Our waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"5 of us came here for a late lunch. Although the place wasn't busy, we had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table.   I was not going to write a review for this Outback because it was like any other locations. However, I decided to write one due to the service we received.   1) Our table had no silverware even after the food had come out. We had asked for them repeatedly as well.     2) It took about 15 minutes for water, soda, and lemonades to show up but the worst part was when the waitress SNIFFED each one of the soda right in front of us to differentiate between diet and none diet ones. She said you can tell them apart by sniffing (by the way, she got them wrong). This is so unacceptable. We were totally shocked with this behavior!   3) We ordered a salad with dressing on the side but it came with dressing already on the salad. We didn't send it back because we didn't want to wait as the refill for the lemonade took 10 minutes.   4) One of us ordered mashed potatoes with the order but it came with a baked potato so it had to be sent back. Also 3 orders were supposed to come with honey mustard but didn't.   5) The waiting area had water but all they had were dirty cups...  I felt like the waitress had her mind somewhere else the entire time. When we asked for something, it either came out wrong or slow. She was only good for the last 5 minutes when giving us the checks.   I'm a big fan of chain restaurants and I usually enjoy Outback. However, I was purely disappointed with this location."}
{"text":"Outback isn't...bad...but what's the point? For a chain it's not bad, though. I'll consider going if friends want to. And for the record, I agree with the previous reviewer that the Bloomin Onion is just disappointing on all levels.   Maybe the ultimate problem is I never want a cheap steak. An expensive steak can be delicious, but if you're not going to go balls out for an excellent cut of meat and preparation, there are so many more interesting things you can do with that same steak (I'll take a steak huarache at Taqueria Guadelajara or a kebab at Shish Cafe any night of the week for less money).  Sometimes you just want something familiar, though, and if you're considering going to Outback you know what to expect.   But I might cry a little."}
{"text":"No shrimp on this Barbie. Strictly Soup & Salad Barbie at Outback in this house. The best part is I can order it online and then bump to Tupac, tweeze stray eyebrows and wait for them to bring it out to my car. Now that's VIP service playa!  They have a soup and salad combo deal for $9.99. Plus tax and tip I'm back on the road for just under $15. It also comes with a loaf of that unhealthy, but super fucking good honey wheat bread. The portion of the soup has gotten smaller over the years, but still seems to be the perfect portion to satisfy me. My favorite is the Creamy Onion, but will settle for the Potato if I have to. The salad is my favorite simple dinner salad around. Cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, cheddar cheese, olives and garlicky soft, buttery amazing croutons. Top it all off with their homemade Ranch dressing which I'm convinced drizzled on bubble wrap or a hairy elbow it would still rock my universe. This meal is by no means healthy, but it is my comfort meal that doesn't leave me bloated for days. Especially enjoy it during hoodie season.   Beautiful salad porn take one: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zEOfVGv6DeprEzmFYMFhXA?userid=Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA#yHDt1iDFgHvGdrfwhFYQ6Q   Online Ordering.  Only problem is they don't always have the soup you want even though the online system lets you order it. I don't like this. They need to fix this shit. The guys and girls that bring it out to your car are always cool and make sure you have your full order. In return I am nice to them.  Yes, 15 bucks is a little steep for a freakin' salad and cup of soup, but it's good for the soul and I don't have to do tons of social interaction to get it thanks to the online ordering and curbside pickup. I can go home and eat it in my Underoos and legwarmers and get my Honey Boo Boo on. #fuckingwinning."}
{"text":"Great NY Strip Steak!  They cooked it perfectly medium as I ordered it.  Very juicy and flavorful.  5-stars for the price.  I like going here for cocktails and casual environment.  Some of the higher end steakhouses tend to be stuffy and focus more on wines instead of cool cocktail drinks.    Homestyle mashed potatoes and loaded baked potato were 4-stars.  The strawberry peach sangria was very good and refreshing.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Update: 12/06/2016  Came here for the sirloin steak and unlimited shrimp for 15.99 after work.  The steak was very good for a $10 steak. :)  Nice taste.  The loaded baked potato was very fresh and tasty.  The shrimp on the other hand is a different story.  The taste was flat.  It had no flavor and the quality of the shrimp itself is so so and very small shrimp.  The male bartender, who was very nice, asked if I wanted to get another shrimp plate in.  I declined.  No one in the right mind would want seconds of this.  So this is how Outback makes money.  Advertise unlimited shrimp and then give shrimp so mediocre that no one would want seconds.  Sad but true fact of marketing to get people to come in.  The strawberry lemonade tasted gross and supersweet.  It didn't taste real.  The female bartender had an unpleasantness about her like she is ready for a fight every time someone asks her a question.  She asked me a question.  I couldn't make out what she was saying so I asked her what she said.  She had a look like she ready to fight with me.  Not sure why these people work in customer facing jobs.  The host on the other hand, was very cool, as usual.  Hence, the 4-star rating instead of 5.  Why do they hire people like this at restaurants?  Next time I will order the steak without the shrimp.  Update: 10/08/2017  The filet mignon medium was good.  A solid 4-stars.  Missing a little bit of flavor."}
{"text":"Awesome place Nate was a very nice and attentive gentle man. They had problems with the Coca Cola beverage dispenser and a man named Cody came out to explain it to us such a nice man.  We ended having a Sprite and were not charged. The food was warm and tasted so good. If they continue to have great customer service and food I will continue to come here. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"This location has been recently renovated.  The steak and sides are excellent at this price point.  We asked for steamed broccoli with no butter and it was cooked perfectly.   Good Service."}
{"text":"I feel like Outback needs a menu change.  Dont get me wrong, I really like SOME of the stuff, BUT it just feels so old at this point.      We still go there, but not nearly as much as we used to."}
{"text":"No surprise, no good. What was I thinking?...   Staying on the strip and outback is literally downstairs so I thought I would pick some food to go.   Prime rib- oh my... fatty, chewy, not tender but mushy. I opened the container and was immediately turned off.   Lamb- biggest mistake of the year. Worst lamb I've ever had. The wine sauce was also clumpy. The whole thing was just a salty chewy mess.   Burgers- these were probably the best items if the night, but who can screw up a burger? Got a bacon cheese and mushroom Swiss. I didn't taste them but I heard they were ok.   Fries were mediocre, garlic mashed potatoes were just meh, the baked potato soup was par and the Caesar salad had more fake Parmesan cheese on it than lettuce. Overall my meal was way over salted and way under flavored.   This is the last time I will ever go to an outback."}
{"text":"Unlimited shrimp is the best ever!!! When they said \"we're gonna keep it coming\" they are not kidding..  i love our server matt.. love this place :) be back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Food took forever to come out despite restaurant being about 1/4 full. Food didn't all come at once. Both beef items in our group were way over cooked. Took a while to get greeted once we were seated. Hadn't been to Outback in a few years. Unlikely to go back."}
{"text":"Went last night - the service and food were spot on. Outback is always a very consistent chain restaurant.  The seared ahi tuna and beef nachos (on freshmade chips!) were the highlight of the evening.  The main variation is always the server - sometimes they are terrific and other times they are forgetful and rude. The management at this location is quick to head off problems though!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to come here for my birthday dinner, my girlfriend and I arrived early so we sat at the bar ordered two drinks and an appetizer. Once our table was ready we sat and waited for the rest of my family to join us. We had two different servers come say hello, one woman was very professional, friendly and offered me another drink. Once my family arrived we had a second server, young male maybe 25 years old or so. He was obviously very new... We had watched him struggle with tables around us and had a manager?? Following him helping him set down food and drinks. When he came to our table I knew we were in for a bad experience. What happened to the professional friendly woman who started taking care of us! I wanted her back as our server! This gentleman took 20mins to bring out drinks, 40 mins to take our order and over an hour and 20 mins to bring out our food! We were there forever and unfortunately ate ice cold food. I've never choked down a steak cold before but I wasn't about to wait another 20 plus mins for hot food. Our waiter deliberately avoided our table, couldn't hide his frustration or overwhelmedness to save his life. Sweating profusely and continually wiping sweat off his forehead after taking each persons order. We had to ask for bread and drink refills which should be something you do and watch out for constantly... Once dinner finally came out.... Hahaha it was a shit show. Wow I've never seen someone mess up an order so bad. Food was on all the wrong plates with the wrong sides. And the check..... Wow he charged everything he could ala cart instead of it being an actual meal... For example I had the Victorian Marsala mushroom filet migon and instead of giving me the steak off the menu I ordered... He charged me a regular filet with side of the Marsala mushrooms.... Which was a dollar more expensive than just the meal itself. I don't know if he was just trying to charge us more expensively or what but these were menu items... Nothing we made up or anything so I don't see why there were extreme charges. The manager that was following this gentleman around in the beginning was no where to be seen once he took our table. And what happened to the experienced waitress!!??   I'm a server myself so I understand restaurants and how it can be as a server but I had no sympathy for this guy.... At the end of the night we tracked down the waitress who started us off, gave her 10 bucks for taking care of us, she told us she got table jacked and that the guy who had our table was new but out of training. Well let me tell you he needs two more weeks training or this job is not the right one for him! And yes he still got a tip, more than I wanted to give because he didn't deserve it but my girlfriend wouldn't let me leave less. No manager stopped by and no one up front when we left. We don't even know this male waiters name... He never said it. Glad I got an appetizer and drink at the bar... I had patience throughout the whole experience but definitely won't be back. Outback.. Do yourselves a favor and make sure your wait staff is properly trained before throwing them out on the floor to take care of family's for the night. You want your guests to have excellent food and excellent service... Then make sure your employees are properly trained. Thankfully there were other serving staff around to take dirty plates off the table, to get us drink refills and etc. I appreciate the wait staff that sees a server is neglecting a table and they decide to step in, even for something small, I appreciate they see other tables and not just their own, they truly do care about their customers."}
{"text":"Thursday evening dinner was excellent. We started with Alice Chicken Mushroom Quesadilla appetizer and I ordered a Rum Punch. My wife then ordered a 6oz. filet and I ordered a 6 oz. sirloin. We had grilled asparagus, broccoli, mashed potato, baked potato and everything was absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"I had a good experience overall. My meal was cooked well. My waitress was nice. Her name was Jodie.  I had sirloin, cooked medium, tasted fine. Also, shrimp with crab on top. I think I won't get that again. I like it better with just butter. I had a wallaby darned, always tasty! If you don't have patience, don't come. It is a little slow, but I'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"Came here bc it was close to my better half work. Started with a blooming onion that was a little on the greesy side. Then we got a couple side wedge salads and split the porterhouse steak. The wedge salads were crisp and tasty, steak was cooked rare but we ordered medium. I was hungry so just ate it anyway. Service was on the slow side as well. Skip this place and spend a few extra bucks and have a great experience at one of the many steak houses in vegas that has good service"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick drink and munchies...service was good. The mushrooms on the appetizer menu were good....but don't order the crab cakes...so little crab that you didn't even taste it. So much breading that they were dry. Ran out of sause before we could finish...."}
{"text":"I had a little issue recently with this restaurant and its amazing what happens when you speak with the right Person Things Get Resolved Thanks Mark With Outback for doing a great job resolving my issue i have now changed my mind and i will remain a longtime customer of Outback"}
{"text":"Well, it has been a very very long time since I have been to an Outback.  So long, that I had forgotten it was centered around an australian theme.  If you didn't know any better, you would think Outback meant cooking steaks \"out back in your yard\" or something. Just in case you really don't know, Outback is a region in Australia :)  Anyhoo, we had a gift card, and so felt much obliged to visit this chain.  To drink, I ordered the margarita trio: Three 4 oz. samples of fruity pomegranate, mango and lime made with El Jimador Reposado Tequila. Very good and got a nice buzz from them.  Then came the caesar salad.  It was decent.  We split the entree:  11oz open flamed seared sirloin (cooked medium) with shrimp on the barbie; and we added-on coconut shrimp.  Our 2 sides where garlic mash potatoes and french fries.  First of all, it was alot of food.  So glad we split!  And I hate to sound like some sort of steak snob, but I usually won't go lower than Ruth Chris or Flemmings for steak, with places like Maestro's and Harris topping my list.  Well, I learned my lesson on that type of attitude!  I was very suprised at how perfectly the steak was cooked and how tasty it was.  The garlic mash was appetizing and the french fries were... just french fries.  I wanted to order dessert but I was too full.  We had a great dinner here.  Service was efficient.  Atmosphere was typical chain like feel, not bad really.  Great budget friendly steakhouse that I will come back to when that steak crave kicks in and I don't feel like dropping $$$$ for meat."}
{"text":"Recently went here for Mother's Day and it was packed (like every place in town) so that wasn't a huge issue for us. I had called a few days prior and put my name on the list since they don't take reservations. Upon checking in when we arrived they told us it was only going to be a 30 min wait since we had our name on the list and 30 minutes went by...40 mins...50 mins...60 minutes...buzz, now our pager goes off. I overheard quite a few people while waiting that it was going to be a 60 minute wait (why bother calling ahead at that point or telling us it was only going to be 30 minutes). Oh well...When we got seated we got our bread and drinks and placed our orders. My order was messed up but they instantly corrected it...(I ordered the Prime Rib and the Filet came out)...They were super quick on correcting that so it wasn't a huge issue and I had originally ordered a petite cut and I knew this was the largest cut so that was extra points in my book. We left very full and overall had a nice dinner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner at Outback on 11/13/16.   We've had Outback plenty of times, but this was by far the best experience we've had. 90% of our positive experience was because of our server, Dylan. The other 10% was because the food was amazing. Both myself and my boyfriend work in the restaurant industry, so we feel very qualified to critique on service, presentation, knowledge of the menu, attentiveness, etc. Dylan was excellent in all areas of being our server. What really stood out to me was when my boyfriend ordered, he ordered the prime rib. Dylan said they may have run out of prime rib already, but he would go check for us. Dylan left to check with the kitchen who did in fact confirm they were out of prime rib.           I appreciate this because of another experience at the Outback on East Blvd when I ordered the Alice Springs Quesadilla WITHOUT mushrooms, our server said I could not order it without mushrooms as all the quesadillas are made earlier in the day so there was no way to remove the mushrooms from one order. I've ordered the same quesadilla prior to this visit and asked for no mushrooms, and it's never been a problem so I was kind of taken back by this servers response and annoyed that she didn't even bother to check with the kitchen staff. Anyway, I digress...back to our great service at the Independence location.        However, Dylan said he would go check with the kitchen regarding the prime rib. Unlike the server at Outback on East Blvd who did not bother to check with the kitchen regarding the quesadillas. I appreciate Dylan taking that 1 extra step to check on the prime rib. During our last visit, we also found out that Dylan was a new server! I was surprised to learn this as he knew the menu very well.   We will be back to visit soon & hopefully Dylan is still a part of the staff at Outback on Independence!"}
{"text":"We have been to many Outbacks and this has to be the worst service we ever received. We are at the bar since normally they are more attentive there; however, this was not the case. Poor service and totally ignoring customers are not an effective marketing tool. Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time trying this outback steak house. Good was delicious. Service was very slow. Especially when we arrived and we're the only ones here. Would come again. But would want a different waitress for sure."}
{"text":"I have always loved going to Outback Steakhouse for as long as I can remember. The last few times I feel the food quality has dropped in a major way. My wife and I ordered a Blooming Onion that was much smaller the last couple of times then previous visits. The taste was ok but still not it was.  I also ordered the hot wings   The wings were barely eatable   The quality of chicken seemed poor and it was very dried out.  I am not sure if it's a local resturant issue or if all Outback quality has dropped.  I know with the rising cost of food the resturant business have raised their prices but it seems the quality of food has suffered to. I will be in no hurry to go back anytime soon.  That's sad as I always liked them before."}
{"text":"I received gift cards so I thought okay we will give them another try.  We went at 445 to avoid the rush. Our waitress Rayanna was AWESOME!!  So  friendly, helpful and genuine. We ordered appetizers as our meal. The wings,  mushrooms and coconut shrimp were hot and fresh!! We were served bread and butter with our drinks. All in all very nice!!"}
{"text":"My food was warm, my blooming onion was over cooked, you can tell the that the grease needs to be changed.  I only received one soda, never got a refill. The waitress was very nice and polite,  the food could have been better."}
{"text":"Well, this is the \"THIRD\" time this certain location has tried to pass off a sirloin for a fillet!!! My wife and I eat here pretty regular but, it seems from time to time they try to slip in the notorious sirloin for the fillet.  My question is: ( HOW ) many times do they do this a day / week  to other people???  Yea, and charge the higher price and get away with it.  Some people have good pallets  ( my wife ) and others unfortunately don't. No wonder they make a killing!!!  Fillet's don't have grizzle line running through them.  So, if you eat at this particular Outback........\"BEWARE\"!!!!  Don't get scammed."}
{"text":"Heaps of American friends rave about the Outback Steakhouse so one night when the wife and I were driving around looking for dining options we decided to give it a try.  Speaking as someone who spent the first 34 years of his life growing up in Australia, I can categorically tell you that there is nothing even remotely \"Australian\" about the menu items at Outback. Yes, you can get \"Fosters\" beer, a beer sold almost exclusively for export and exceedingly unpopular in Australia, but if you ask an Australian what a \"Bloomin' Onion is you'll receive a blank stare - This is AMERICAN food.  I ordered some baby back ribs and a bloomin onion and my wife some sort of pasta dish.  The food was absolutely disgusting - My ribs were very fatty and underdone and drenched in far too much of their sickly sweet sauce. fries were overcooked and dry.    The famous \"Bloomin Onion\" was so greasy I felt like I'd eaten a few tablespoons of pure lard after eating only a small portion of the thing.  I have no idea why people rave about this place - The Outback Steakhouse is a faux Australian restaurant that amounts to nothing but a generic US steakhouse that doesn't even get close in quality to similar places such as Chilis."}
{"text":"Great food as one would expect, awesome server.  i had won some cash and was tempted by other steak houses that boast 100.00 steaks, but i chose outback, it is always a perfect meal. even tho this one is on the Vegas strip, it is not a tourist trap, prices are just like any other outback. plus you get to ride the elevator behind the giant coke bottle on the strip!"}
{"text":"I had a bad visit, but nothing like guy who found that huge hair in his quesadilla.  OMG my stomach still hurts after seeing that picture!!!  We stopped in about 8pm on Sunday night and sat in the bar area in a nice cozy booth.  Bar was empty, and I mean empty!  Most of the employees were gearing up to go home for the night.  We ordered our food, seconds later the bartender engages in the loudest conversation ever with other employees who were already done for the night about a roller coaster.  No big deal, but then the conversation kept going and going, louder and louder!  I felt like I was listening to my drunk friends during a football game.  Steaks came out way over cooked and the mac & cheese for $5 was like eating dirt.  For $60 I think I can do way better in the Phoenix area, we won't be back.  By the way, where was the manager and what was he/she doing for the 1 hour & 30 minutes we were there?  My head hurts from tonight's visit."}
{"text":"We order take out regularly here. They always get our food right. Hot and fresh and tasting just like if we were sitting at the resturant. The service is always prompt and friendly. However remend them to give utensils they ALWAYS forget. The potato soup is awesome!"}
{"text":"My filet Minon was over cooked. I had to ask for salt, had to ask for silverware, had to ask for steak sauce, had to ask for ketchup and my cheese cake was frozen."}
{"text":"Service very slow.  Food very dry and tasteless.  Not a place we intend to return.  My entree was delivered burned and crispy.  My wife had the same thing and hers was done just right.  When I showed the waiter, his response was, in his opinion, hers was a little under cooked.  Either way, one of our meals was not prepared correctly and should not have been delivered.  Then, I waited forever for my meal to be prepared correctly.  Everyone else at the table was finished by the time I got my meal."}
{"text":"The prices are crazy 20$ for a 8oz steak the flavor is very good but they need to work on their prices"}
{"text":"Our server, Leann was great. Greeted us with a big smile. Brought our drinks in a timely manner & slowed our food service just as requested. Thank you Leann for a great night out."}
{"text":"This is another go to safe spot. Your typical chain steak joint with affordable price points. They make a decent steak and have seasonal options.  On the particular day we came, it was a bit cold in the restaurant. Our server was super sweet and helpful and got the AC turned up. We haven't had bad service ever. They also have these little computer pads at your table to order drinks, appetizers, and kid meals so you can get it started right away. Although every server we've had, has been so attentive that I've never needed to use it.  They serve complimentary bread. And for most entrees (if not all) comes with a salad. A little heavy on the dressing but I'm not one who likes a ton of dressing so it might be ok for most people.  When I've ordered steaks, they come out pleasant and just as ordered. I usually get the sweet potato, which is yummy.  Today I got a wild hair and decided to go with the tilapia with lump crab and the broccoli with cheese. The crab was good along with the sauce... the fish was ok. But tilapia has an odd taste anyway, just more so here."}
{"text":"Great service. Unfortunately baked potato was smaller than usual, broccoli was over cooked, porterhouse steak cooked unevenly other than that everything else was good."}
{"text":"Steak chain, that's about it.  Look for the chain to be renamed or sold within 3 years. Nothing special and loud. Better steak than the Keg however and better prices"}
{"text":"Let me just start this review by saying I would never call myself a \"chain restaurant\" type of guy. I typically view chain restaurants to have poor quality food which lack overall flavor so I tend to visit chain restaurants very very rarely. My wife and I happened to have a gift card so we figured we would take advantage of it. The service was a little slow in the beginning but the problem here definitely is not the service....it's the food. This is the exact reason why I try to stay away from chain restaurants because I feel like they lack creativity and flavor in their dishes. Major complaints are as followed:   Chicken wings....abysmal. Not crispy at all and weren't even tossed in a buffalo sauce?   Volcano shrimp appetizer was lacking in flavor in my opinion even though my wife enjoyed this.   Grass fed burger: For all I know the meat wasn't even grass fed. I asked for it to be medium it was basically well done. Overall not a horrible burger, but nothing good to really say about it.   The food needs to change. Despite being a chain restaurant, the prices aren't that cheap either. Burger was $13 and the wings were $11. I can think of dozens of other places where I can get cheaper wings and burgers with much better quality."}
{"text":"I came to this outback location for the first time yesterday.. I will not be coming back. Our servers name was alyce and she was very nice and a great server..as for my meal..not so good. Our appetizer was way over cooked. My meal..well first off I wanted a medium steak n I got a well done steak. My crab legs were way over cooked. The meat was hard n dry. They gave me a new order of crab legs which was good. My bFs steak was over seasoned. His garlic mashed potatoes were over seasoned as well. But I put in a order to go...I literally waited 45 mins for it to be done. If it wasn't for my server being so nice n apologetic I would have just left.. But I will not be returning. And in the future if I do it won't be on Tuesdays bc the kitchen staff is horrible"}
{"text":"I've gotten to where I really like Outback's Take Away (To Go) program.  This is my first visit to this location.  I'm used to going to the Henderson location, where they have designated parking for Takeaway, and I did not see any for this location, so I parked and went in.  I waited in their little takeaway area, but I felt like I kept getting in the way of their servers.  My server was very nice and my food came out fast and seemed to be prepared as ordered.  My steak was ok, it seems like they are not getting the best quality of filets these days though.  They have been a little tough lately and not a center cut quality.  It was my first time to get their Garlic Mashed Potatoes, but it will also be my last.  I'll stick to their great baked potatoes.  The Garlic Mashed had no flavor.  They didn't even have any salt & pepper in them.  And it was loaded with skins, which I don't care for.  I had to doctor them up quite a bit when I got them home.  They still have the best salads of any chain though.  Love the tangy tomato dressing.  I used to love Outback, but I think they are another chain that has just grown so much that the quality really isn't as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I do like the new location.  It's a very nice restaurant.  And the people who work there seem friendly.  That being said, the service is a little on the slow side.  I waited awhile to get my drink order, and even longer to place my lunch order.  The salads keep getting smaller and smaller.  it used to be the best salad in the game, but the portion size is very small now.  I ordered an 8 oz Filet medium well, and it was pretty much well done.  I didn't send it back or complain.  I just asked for some Lea & Perrins to put on it, and that took forever to get me a bottle of that.  And the baked potato looked great, but only half of it was edible.  The rest was not cooked.  I did like the new Castaway Cocktail.  It made everything else bearable.  I was already having a pretty rotten day, I really just wanted a good meal.  That's why I went here.  It was decent, but not quite the Outback standard that I've had in the past."}
{"text":"Had a well deserved dinner with Wifey and the service was great. The Queen enjoyed the Margaritas."}
{"text":"We have lived here 10 years.   This Outback was great 10 years ago.   A few years ago the steaks starting being very tough and very tiny.     Even the filet.       So we hardly ever go anymore.   Decided to just have drinks and 2 appetizers.   No more expensive tough steak for us.   Well the blooming onion was greasy and not even cut thru.     We had to try and hack thru with knives to rip off the blooms.   That resulted in the batter in our hands and the onion still attached.    The quesadillas were awful .   Rubbery and tough.    Our bill was over 30 dollars.   We keep saying we aren't going back but we mean it this time !!!   Also prices have gone up at an astonishing amount.     Certainly not worth it.     Too bad. It used to be a nice place.                              Thank you for your response.   Email is nhardy2001@yahoo.com"}
{"text":"We celebrated my wife's 24th birthday on Friday night at this location with 19 people. Now I've been in the restaurant business for a long time and I know how hard it is to accommodate 19 especially in a small restaurant not designed to do so, but they did an amazing job. Service was on point and the kitchen staff did an incredible job. We all had steaks of different temps come out at the same time, and every single one was cooked to perfection. And I tell you what our family its VERY particular when it comes to our steaks. Kudos to the whole restaurant, we couldn't have left happier..."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and ordered the cheese fries for the appetizer. I always ask for them layered so that you get a lot of cheese and bacon throughout the dish. These used to be a lot bigger than they are now, but for the two of us, the portion was fair. We both ordered the outback special 6oz with baked potatoes and salads. The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned great. The baked potato was loaded up with everything and they definitely weren't skimpy with the toppings! The service could have been a bit better, especially since it wasn't that busy of a night."}
{"text":"After another show, went here for a quick bite to eat. Turned out not to be so quick, after a strawberry margarita, blooming onion for an appetizer, and a perfectly grilled salmon filet with a side of French green beans. Our server mentioned she'd given her two-week notice to attend law school and was quite fun to be around. She even sent over a couple of shots of Patron (tequila) on the house. Strong!  Wasnt' too noisy or crowded, although there was a nice vibe throughout the place. Also nice to watch the world championship of poker on the LCD tvs hanging over the bar."}
{"text":"This is the review update, the original is at the bottom.   It just gets worse. In the last two weeks we've din d in once, and had takeout once.  The dine in experience wasn't bad. Steak was ordered medium and came out well done. No biggie. They made me another one.  My wife's potato had a huge black spot inside but she didn't say anything. The wait staff is always good, it just seems that the back of the house management is sorely lacking.   Today I called and ordered a 12 ounce sirloin, medium, and shrimp with mashed potatoes and veggies, and a 9 ounce sirloin, medium well, with a baked potato.  I should have paid more attention when they brought the order out. Got home and the mw was rare and the m was well done.  Plus, once again my wife's baked potato had a large black spot in it. Additionally, there was no shrimp with my 12 ounce sirloin. I called to ask if they had put the order in correctly and on the 3rd transfer got a manager. I inquired and was told, no there was no shrimp ordered with the sirloin. Not a sorry or an oops or anything else.  It would have been nice to  at least have gotten an apology.  I actually did ask for the shrimp.    We'll find another place to go to from now on.   ......................  This location is usually pretty good but every once in a while something wacky happens. I had a big to go order yesterday totaling over $60. In the order was a loaded baked potato. Here is the tiny cup I received with chives, shredded cheese, and bacon bits. You can see from the picture that there are essentially five tiny cut pieces of chive, half a teaspoon of bacon, and less than a tablespoon of shredded cheese.  Pretty pathetic."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I visited any Outback Steakhouse and after reading recent reviews about the waits even when making reservations;  I was more than unsure about this voyage.  On this occasion we were celebrating a birthday. Contact was made with the manager prior, and we asked if we could bring our own birthday cake.  The manager acknowledged / granted this request, and when the first of our party arrived they were met with several more than helpful employees, we were seated immediately, (despite it being super busy),  and the manager took the cake and stored it in their fridge.  Nicely done.  Our waiter \"Nate\" was out of this world good.  Was on top of everything from answering questions about food, making sure we always had full glasses, and was never pushy for us to leave as cake and presents were open.  Thank you management and Nate.  Your presence definitely added to this night, and you have your customer service skills well in tact.    Our food was better than I remember previously from prior Outback experiences, but when the service is good everything just seems to flow.  I went with a wedge salad with blue cheese, the prime rib, garlic mashed potatoes, and of course the trademark blooming onion. The Mrs. went with the Alice Springs Chicken, and we washed it down with a couple tasty brews.   I must say there was no complaints from either of us on anything we ate. Standard good all the way around.  If I had to suggest one thing.  This location has redecorated their interior to appear a little more modern.  I was always a fan previously of the rustic Australian decor, and if still present mite have been the difference between 5 stars instead of four.  Actually I would be giving 4 and half if that were an option.  All in all a great night from start to finish.  Thank you again to the unnamed manager, and if your ever in here see if you can request \"Nate\" as your server. Thank you outback for making my father in laws 62nd birthday a good experience for all."}
{"text":"Overall our experience here was ok. For a Sunday they were clearly understaffed as we were a party of 12 and only had 1 waitress. Although we scheduled a \"reservation\" we still waited an hour to be seated. The waitress we had was very nice and did the best she could under the circumstances. The service was slow. We were there for about 2 hours total. Everyone's food came out staggered which was weird and there were several steaks not prepared properly. The icing on the cake was that my food never came and apparently the order was overlooked. After bringing it to the attention of a manager and our waitress, they put the order in and when it came out it was hot, fresh and delicious. I have attached pictures of other plates but none of my own. I guess I was so hungry once it came out I got right to it and forgot the photo op. Oh well, next time. Hopefully service will be a bit faster and better coordinated. By the way, when the bill came, they had automatically comped my meal. That was awesome and made me feel they really did care and acknowledged the screw up.   This location is new, clean and the quality of the food was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"First off, we got right in. Seated right away. Music is very loud in here. Ordered the ribeye as I was always told its easier to cook in here as a medium well steakvwith just light pink in the middle...ordered the blooming onion. It came to us cold, hot plate....so that tells us it was under the light waiting.....Salad was good. Waiting for water, we are dry. Took forever. Waiting for the steak. Well, it was undercooked. Bloody. Sent it back this time getting the filet. Came back too done. Well done. Now we are trying another filet. Ugh. Why cant they cook steaks correctly by their chart?! Unbelievable. Manager is really nice. He talked to me about how I needed it cooked. I told him I asked the waiter how his cook was tonight as sometimes they have an off night. He said he was great.. Now the manager is cooking my steak. Still not pink in the middle. Manager comped our meal. That was very nice of him.  Will NOT be back to this Outback again. There are much better steak houses in this area. Im not a tourist here. Dont treat me like one."}
{"text":"Ya know, I like this chain because they serve foods for people who may not be able to ever rationalize spending 40 bux for a steak.  I like going here and seeing families out for their special night together.    I also like coming here with hubby to eat a steak and lamb chops for a decent price and sit in a high-top by the bar to watch whatever game they have on while we munch on decently prepared food and enjoy ourselves, as well as the good service we have consistently received from this location.     The east side is where I was born and raised, a blue collar side of town that is far from the bubble of the UW-Madison campus.  I walk into Outback and am reminded of my childhood, this is where my parents would have taken us.  I swear eastsiders have a certain look and way about them that I can spot instantly.  They bare the rough edges of experience, carry it around with them as a badge of pride - the ones whom life never spoiled, in fact quite the opposite. My roots. I come here and am reminded of where I come from, as well as why I left.   Our server was impeccable, our food was perfect.  I always order the 6 oz petite steak seasoned and cooked on the flattop, green beans, garlic smashed potatoes, and a side of scallops or shrimp.  Hubs always orders the lamb chops with potatoes and asparagus and a refreshing drink like strawberry lemonade or a lime drink minus the alcohol. Our server is always able to come up with something super tasty and non alcoholic. Kudos to him and his kin for accommodating that. We're always happy with our meals."}
{"text":"I have always liked Outback.  However the last 3 visits have been marginal at best.  To be fair. One was an actual visit and the other two, take out. But the point remains.  Bad experiences.  I ordered a sirloin well done when i was here with a side of mushrooms.  The steak was so overdone it ceased to be edible though it had butter sauce smothering its dryness.  The mushrooms seemed drenched in water and quite tasteless.  My take out experience resulted in a filet that was spongy and tasteless.   The baked potato was burnt and the sides were missing.  The last take out (filet well done no pink) gave me a practically rare piece of steak that made my nephew scream as he jates bloody meat.  Not sure whats going on.  A solid 2 for, well, it was food."}
{"text":"My family of 6 went to Outback on late Sunday afternoon for dinner. I have 3 toddlers and a 10 year old. When the waitress came to get our drink order, I went ahead and ordered off the kids menu for the 3 little ones, along with a Blooming Onion, and a French Onion Soup. The only positive thing about our meal and experience was that they brought the kids' food out right away and their food was decent. Things went downhill from there. The Blooming Onion came out shortly after that and it was horrible. It was overcooked and had a burnt taste to it but worst of all, it was like we were eating pure salt. I really regret not complaining about it or sending it back. Then we waited, and we waited, and waited some more for the rest of our food which was a chicken sandwich, a philly cheesesteak sandwich, and fettucini alfredo with grilled chicken and grilled shrimp. I have no earthly idea why 2 sandwiches and a pasta dish would take so long to bring out to the table. The restaurant wasn't even that full. When we finally got our food, the grilled chicken on the pasta was dry and unseasoned and the alfredo sauce was thick and just plain weird. The breaded chicken sandwich my son ordered was greasy and just not good. He orders the same thing at other restaurants and eats it all but this time he took a few bites and said he couldn't eat the rest. The waitress was friendly but she barely came to check on us and we had a very unenjoyable meal that I paid over $100 for. Do not go to this place unless you want horrible food and not very good service. I totally regret not speaking up at the time!"}
{"text":"I really I'm going to need some consistency!!!! Sometimes steak is perfection....juicy, flavorful, tender and just enough pink but still cooked thoroughly.   And other times after 2 bites it's in the trash and I'm on my way to another restaurant"}
{"text":"Saturday call ahead seating for party of 6 at 1:30.  We arrive at 1:25, empty restaurant and they have not even begun to set our table?   Finally get seated only to find that they are short staffed, takes forever to get drinks.  FREE Bloomin Onion comes and we order another along with our meals. Second Bloomin Onion arrives, no salads?  Salads FINALLY arrive followed by a HUGE wait for main course. My steak sandwich is CREMATED and tougher than leather so I complain.  Enter The Manager who describes herself as OWNER, she apparently missed the part about the customer ALWAYS being right and chose to debate my comments about slow, crappie service - REALLY?   Replacement steak sandwich while tasteless was better but the damage was already done!   The Manager had already kicked me across the street to her competitor Longhorn for my next steak!  Outback has lost their focus AND A CUSTOMER especially at the Windsor location.  I will avoid the Outback on Independence in favor of the Pineville store IF I choose to give them another chance?  Note,  our waiter was on top of his game but the support staff and store manager were out to lunch!"}
{"text":"Outback always delivers great steak with warm atmosphere. Steak that melts in the mouth of full perfection. I highly recommend Outback Steak to fulfill your cravings as much as your hunger."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood to have a good steak so I thought hmmmm I really don't want to break the bank by going to an expensive steakhouse but I really want a good steak so I decided to  go to Outback. There was plenty of parking outside, immediately was greeted and sat down. Ordered the Natural Bone-in Rib eye with a side of Macaroni. We also ordered small rack of baby back ribs but since I did not eat that I cannot really give opinions other than it looked great! lol Back to the steak! It was definitely a great portion 20 oz, the steak was very well seasoned, cooked just right, and was the perfect size for me. I didn't even need A1 sauce since the steak was so juicy! Service was great mate! Overall great steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Food was as always (think that's across the board stable in outback), but was again extremely positive surprised by a waiter that went way beyond what's normally done!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. We had the tomahawk steak and the ribeye and of course the bloomin onion!!! Waiter was incredible. We had a good time."}
{"text":"So I was too lazy to make dinner and I needed an excuse to have a drink right after work and I decided to go to Outback since I haven't been here in years. I wanted to sit at the bar since it was just a party of two and they have TVs there . The bar area isn't that big but it's a fairly decent size and they have a few booths if you want to order food as well.   Looking at the menu, I noticed that there was some new items and portion options, which was just right because I was hungry but not gluttonous-hungry. And well what do you know? The drinks were pretty cheap too! I don't even think it was happy hour either... awesome.   I ended up ordering one of their 6oz steaks that came with two sides of your choosing (I had a huge bleu cheese wedge salad and garlic mashed potatoes) for under $10. Not bad at all for the portion and the price! Outback, I shall see you again when I feel too lazy again to cook!"}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised!!  I had such a nice experience at the bar in this ridiculously packed restaurant!  I stopped into outback for dinner because of the Outback Bowl deal - free bloomin' onion with any purchase!  Yes.  Yes, please.  Because it was just me, I didn't call ahead or anything - but hoped for a spot in the bar/seat yourself section.  This place was packed full of people.  And they were like sharks over those booths, so I sat myself at the corner of the bar.  Mandy, the bartender, was very nice - and she didn't give me that \"oh, it's just you? Eating alone? Forever alone?\" look.  Thank you, Mandy.    I ordered the outback bowl onion and a Caesar salad with shrimp.  I heard Mandy tell one of the other servers that the bloomin' onions were being picked up left and right in the kitchen, regardless of ticket.  It seemed like Outback was having some trouble with the demand.  Mandy actually flagged down a server with an onion and told her to give it to me.  I really appreciated that!  Sometimes I get skipped or forgotten about when I'm eating out on my own.  Not this time!  Basically, everything was delicious.  Onion was crispy and hot, shrimp Caesar salad was perfect.  I took a to-go box for my onion, and forgot it when I left (like I usually do).  Mandy chased me out the door, onion in hand and asked if I still wanted it!  I know that she was crazy busy in there, taking time like that is impressive!  I'll definitely be back, probably sitting in the shark infested bar section."}
{"text":"They over cooked our steak & all they offer was to make US another steak so we have to wait. Not a good service."}
{"text":"Came here on a date night! I honestly did not know East Blvd had an Outback, where have I been?!  Anyways, we were greeted and sat immediately. The server, I cannot remember his name was nice and polite. We ended up sharing the porterhouse steak - medium rare with two loaded baked potatoes and a side of the mixed vegetables.  The steak came out perfectly cooked and was delicious! I have not had their baked potato before but it was definitely delicious and it actually might be my favorite so far! It came loaded with sour cream, cheese, bacon, and a little green onion. The potato was not over cooked, and they baked the potatoes with sea salt (I believe that's what it is) on the outside because it was just fabulous! I have never had it prepared that way before, but it definitely added a little something extra to it. You are probably reading this thinking I'm just being extra, but I LOVE potatoes!  Anyways, the vegetables... they were carrots, zucchini, and squash. They were under seasoned and over cooked. They were mushy. Ew.  The server did check on us several times and most of the food was yummy!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"We came here for two reasons...  1. We got some gift cards for Christmas 2. It was my fiance's birthday Last time we came to an Outback we shared the 28 oz (I think) steak and added an extra side, but this time we decided to just get whatever we wanted (and more)! For starters, we had the sampler plate. It came with the blooming onion, french fries with cheese and bacon, and fried mac and cheese. The blooming onion (it was just pieces) were slightly over cooked, but the sauce is AMAZING! The fries, were pretty good but it seemed like it sat in the window for a little because the cheese just came off in one huge lumb... so we basically just had plain fries. The fried mac and cheese, were alright. Everything was fried on this sampler, so when we got to them we were just a little over the fried foods. It was nice and hot on the outside, but not scolding on the inside.  For my entree I got the steak and lobster tail. I think I got an 8 oz steak and my side was a stuffed baked potato. The steak was cooked perfectly - medium- and the baked potato!! I love their potato, and it was nice and hot.  The only downside to the meal was my fiance's steak was not cooked correctly. He asked for medium, and it came out really rare. They cooked it longer, and the manager herself came out to deliver the meal.  We also shared two of their shareable drinks. My favorite was the strawberry one! You can not taste the alcohol in it at all! The second one we drank was the blackberry one - he preferred this one."}
{"text":"Excellent service and high quality food.  I had the grilled samon and perfect baked potato, my bf had juicy sirloin and huge crunchy coconut shrimp. Delicious."}
{"text":"We'll fellow PV'ers the family LOVES this place.  We go to take advantage of their Outback special (6oz sirloin, salad, and baked potato) for $10.99 but mostly for the lovely lady that has been taking care of us forever, Kristen. Ask for her but she only works Mondays but don't mess it up for me please!"}
{"text":"Lovely birthday dinner with friends. Food great...all 4 steaks perfecyly prepared. Seeet potato very yummy. Service good. Only complaint was the temperature inside the restaurant was too hot!"}
{"text":"Used our Dine Rewards nearby on 'date night'. Always like the atmosphere there. Service was OK, but seems to be very slow to bring drinks from the bar each visit. Not sure why?? Tried the filet & bernaise-crab dish featured. The photo looked MUCH better than the actual presentation.  Overall a nice experience but average & nothing special (chain restaurants)."}
{"text":"I went to Outback for a family dinner recently and absolutely loved the food!  Our waiter was very friendly (and funny) and the food was cooked to perfection.  I ordered the porterhouse steak and it was a perfect medium and the coconut shrimp was delicious.   The only thing I didn't care for was the Blooming Onion.  I'm not a big fan of onions and didn't really like it, but my family members seemed to think it was okay.    Great food and service overall."}
{"text":"The service here is friendly ,your drink is never empty! Staff is well tuned they know how work at high volume well."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. The specials were a good value and we're plentiful."}
{"text":"This is an Outback Steakhouse like any other .. except it's in Las Vegas .. on the Strip .. and you know what that means (maybe)?!  Service. Exceptional service.  Our waitress treated both of our families like royalty, bringing whatever we needed, when we needed it. Sure it was a bit hectic at times, and she brought extra things we didn't need (sometimes, even the wrong drinks) but it's the heart that I admired.  On top of that, the food was good but somehow the quality of the steaks just weren't quite there - like the ones we would order at home. All in all though, steaks - how do you go wrong? ;)"}
{"text":"I went out to Outback for a light snack. I was seated promptly without any delays. My server was very attentive and helpful with the menu. I ordered the side salad along with the soup for the day. The salad was fresh and crisp and I promise they have the best garlic croutons. The soup was better than I expected it was a creamy onion and cheese soup. And of course they brought out their famous bread and butter!"}
{"text":"My brother took me there for Father's day. Service was fast and my meal came out just right. So did everybody else's meals. The best part. I didn't even have to see or pay the bill!"}
{"text":"You know you will always have a good experience at Outback but it's even better when you see the best hostess ever with a GREAT attitude and smile ! She just brightens your day. I frequent Outback on LV blvd and it is always a pleasure to see Nikki. I wouldn't go to any other location just because of her ! I recommend this location for a quick lunch, meal with your family/friends or just to have your favorite drink. They are busy so remember to make reservations during holidays or peak hours. Asst Mgr / Bartender Anthony also good. Michael the manager is helpful, caring and nice as well!"}
{"text":"Typical Outback location tucked away in a nook of sorts that has an Azteca restaurant and Boston Market. Visited this location for an early dinner with my parents due to being gifted a giftcard.  We arrived around 4:00 on a Sunday and was promptly seated. The restaurant was busy but not extremely so, nobody was waiting. We were greeted by our waitress and placed our drink orders as well an order of the famous 'blooming onion.'  My parents had a couple of questions regarding menu items and our waitress admitted to not knowing the answers. She also didn't attempt to find out.  Our blooming onion arrived hot and crispy. I was surprised the accompanying sauce was on the spicy side. It definitely has a kick! This was my first time having the blooming onion and I really liked it, I now understand why it's so popular.  For my entree, I ordered the small portion of the seared ahi tuna. Since it was so early, I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal. The tuna was another surprise - it was actually pretty good. The asian slaw that comes with it provided a nice, cool bite for the slightly, peppery tuna slices.  I really liked the fact that Outback provides a lot of other non-steak options. My mom ordered one of the chicken dishes and really enjoyed it, she raved of the juiciness of the chicken.   Will I be back? Not likely but I didn't leave Outback disappointed."}
{"text":"Now I don't hand out 5 star reviews to many establishments.....and I didn't think I would ever give one to a place like Outback Steakhouse.....but it was a divine experience I had there last evening. I took the wife there for dinner because I received a 25 dollar gift card from my employer....so I decided what the heck. There are so many great restaurants located within walking distance of where we live that we have not visited....well now I can take this one off of my list. We went for an early dinner around 5:30pm or so and Tiffany....who was just simply wonderful....was our hostess. If your ever visit this establishment don't hesitate to ask for her....she is very knowledgeable and so very friendly and attentive to all of your needs.  So I was pretty hungry and since I have not been to the Outback in years I didn't know what I really wanted. Back in the day I would have ordered the steak with the blooming onion....but since I don't eat red meat now steak was out of the question. Right now they are featuring a Red White and Bloomin menu and 5% of the proceeds go to the soldiers overseas....so I had to order something off of this menu to support them. I had the Chicken and avocado Flatbread which was simply delicious and can be quite filling enough if you don't have a real appetite. I followed that with some New England Clam chowder which was well seasoned.....and I have to tell you I was shocked they were serving it.....because most restaurants only serve it on Friday's, so the fact they had it on a Saturday...was a pleasant surprise.  I then had the Chicken and swiss  burger....which was ummmm....ummmmm.....ummmmmm....good. I mean that chicken breast was juicy....... smoked..... and fire grilled to perfection people....wohooo!!!! I then finished off my meal with a stack of waffles with the strawberries....almond cream....and almond shavings sprinkled on top.....DELICIOUS....and this coming from someone who doesn't like nuts of any kind.   Now let me mention again I ordered only the Flatbread dish and the Waffle desert off of the Red, White, and Bloomin menu....but they do have more on it....and I encourage you all that visit to PLEASE show some love to our soldiers risking, fighting and dying to protect our nation by ordering at least one item off this special menu that by the way has only been out for 3 days now. My experience at this Outback was truly eye opening I will definitely return and I hope all you visit very soon as well. So until we meet again Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends."}
{"text":"Taste not very good but not bad. The problem is service, all is nice but i just feelsome littlenot enough, and the lastthe waitressjust stareing me decide tip, whichlet me feel so uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Friday night...big dinner crowd for unlimited shrimp etc.,.the wait was a bit cuz they were really busy but the staff was great! Once the food came they were on top of it just like every visit I've had at this location. Didn't have to wait long for refills. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We just celebrated a Birthday at Outback Steak House. We were all a surprised at the new seasoning being used on the steaks. It's on the spicy side, we were thankful that our server told us before we ordered. PLEASE Outback ..go back to the old seasoning or at the very least give patrons a choice. This use to be our favorite place but we won't be back until this is changed. Eight  out of eight in our party were disappointed. The service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on Sunday 11/10 for my normal 8oz sirloin and discovered they now have Halibut on the menu. Halibut is one of the few fish I eat and I am very picky about the quality of it. On our waiter Brandon's recommendation we tried it and we were glad we did. One of the best halibut steaks I've had. Brandon told us they have the halibut until the 19th of November and that it has been extremely popular. We will be back for it again! Brandon was also one of the best waiters I've experienced at any restaurant in the past year. Helpful, informative, very friendly & polite and more than met our needs. We will ask for him on our next visit."}
{"text":"We decided to try the restaurant again, and I severely regret it.  I stick to my original thought that a steakhouse should be able to cook a steak to the desired temperature.  Our cheese fries were disgusting burnt cheese is not good old fries are not good.  The only thing that was good at all from the meal was my salad."}
{"text":"I love Outback anyway, but I discovered something new today: the FRENCH ONION soup! Ooolalala!! The staff was very friendly as well. I needed a mobile office so to speak. They walked around the restaurant looking for a table with an outlet. That was super sweet!"}
{"text":"I received a coupon for $6 off two entrees so me and my husband decided to give it a try. We hadn't been to an Outback in quite some time. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken, he had the chicken fingers with fries. Our little complimentary bread loaf was really stale. I guess it was sitting out for hours. The next one they gave us was warm and fresh. My chicken was good. Nothing to rave about. And why doesn't the meal come with two sides? I mean for almost $15, why not two sides instead of the meat and some vegetable medley? I had a salad instead of the vegetables (because I don't like yellow squash), which they brought out before the meal. When my food came it was a lone piece of chicken with some cheese on it on the plate. It looked pathetic. My husband liked his chicken fingers. Although he did peel a lot of the breading off of them.  Overall, it was meh at best. We would not return unless we had some sort of spectacular deal. The $6 off was not enough. I expected much better."}
{"text":"Awesome service!!! Food is great, ryan was very kind and polite, even the manager BILLY , pass by saying hello. A wonderful experience we are not very picked or annoying we just like to eat and go, but the way this people smile and talk to us MAKE MY NIGHT, thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we have been here we have had a great experience.  Food has been good, hot with no complaints. We had ribs last time and were pleasantly surprised how good they were. Love the salad and baked potatoe. Will go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner here. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The waitress was quick, sweet, and got it all right.  I had the 6oz Outback special sirloin, broccoli,  and a baked potatoe. I order that small steak medium rare and end up with a small but thick steak every time. They sell one of the best slices of cheese cake going, but I was too full."}
{"text":"Poor service, sat by a loud mouth man, drunk of course,  but it was so annoying could not have a good quiet moment,  they seemed so focused on gossip in the kitchen never asked to refill my soda. Food was not like the food in Minnesota outback, so terrible"}
{"text":"Went to Outback for my birthday. The food was really delicious. They ended up cooking my steak a little too rare for me. When they brought back, I had two fresh new sides along with my steak. I appreciated that for sure. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Had the \"special\" filet and Crab it was yummy but kinda pricey ....   asparagus a dollar more don't mind if it was  Good but I left most of it.. tasted one that I didn't care for can't eat another \"burnt \"asparagus. .  Waitress was a sweetie! !!"}
{"text":"Always good food.  This is on our favorites list.  Exceptional service last night by server Cody."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times and both times have been great. We actually prefer this location over Rock Hill.   One thing I love is the call ahead seating or reserving a spot online. Every time I've used it we're seated right away and earlier than the time we said we would be there. And these times have been during a busy Saturday night.  Service is great at this location. Drinks and our appetizer came out quickly. The appetizer actually came out the same time as the complimentary bread. We were close to the kitchen, so managers and other servers constantly would help out if they saw we needed a refill. Our dinner was timed perfectly and it came out soon after we were done with our appetizer.   The food is pretty good. I love the bloomin' onion, but my husband doesn't. So we go for the sampler which includes onion, loaded fries and fried Mac and cheese. It is pretty greasy and I always feel guilty eating it. The onion pieces didn't disappoint and the dipping sauce is amazing. Fries were pretty standard and the Mac and cheese bites I didn't care for. They just seemed like cheese nuggets and I couldn't tell where the macaroni was.   For my entree, I got the Queensland shrimp and chicken pasta.  It was good, but very similar to dishes in other restaurants. The shrimp was plump and I liked it was grilled. The chicken was juicy but a little underseasoned. The pasta was good and the alfredo sauce was great. It didn't seem overly buttery or cheesy. And it had a kick of spice which I enjoyed. The husband ordered a porterhouse which he devoured so I guess he liked it."}
{"text":"So basically tried coming back to Outback after not going for about 6 months. What the hell happened to this Company? The portion size got smaller and the prices went higher? If you order the No rules pasta with chicken and shrimp, they used to give you 5 shrimp now they give you 4????  The NY strip used to be 14 oz now it is 12 oz but price went up higher. Used to be that if you ordered a steak it came with choice of soup or salad and a side like baked potato, veggies or something else.  Now you have to pay EXTRA for the meal side item and guess what, price is still the same or higher like they were including the dinner side like they used to. This was my last visit to Outback here ever. Good luck Outback, you don't keep old customers by making the portion size smaller and raise the price.  Hospitality Management 101."}
{"text":"Always has been my favorite steakhouse.  The coconut shrimp is absolutely amazing and I get it every time.  Their tangy tomato salad dressing for their salad it also amazing.  Never a disappointment when we go, and their bread they give you with the meals is delicious.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Likes: Service, Bloomin' Onion, desserts, and facilities.  Dislikes: Dry steak, bad sides, and is kind of dark inside."}
{"text":"We arrived and the hostess was very nice. We were seated promptly but it took the server awhile to come over. We ordered our drinks and food right away because it took too long for him to come over. We then waited another 5 minutes to get our drinks. We ordered our food and after about 10 minutes another server came over and tried to have us order again. We told him we already ordered. Our server came over with our food and said that he would take the blooming onion and another food off the receipt because we had waited so long. The waiter tried to make it right which was the best part of the lunch. The waiter was very nice but the food was not great. Some of it was burnt and over done. I gave this restaurant two stars because of the wait and the bad food."}
{"text":"I only eat at Outback maybe once or twice a year, but have to admit I've never had a bad meal.    I had a ribeye with broccoli and mushrooms.  Cooked perfect (medium) with a lot of flavor.  Veggies were very good as well.  Might be tempted to give it a 4 (it was a good steak) but the service was so-so.  Sat at the bar, and the two female bartenders seemed to be in a bit of a spat (or at least one had an attitude with the other).  The grumpy one got mad and slammed a glass and broke it, and the other one cut her hand cleaning it up.  Not what I want to see during dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Having just been redone, we were excited to try again. We did call ahead seating and was told 40-45 minutes. 90 minutes later and multiple check-ins with the hostess, we had yet to be seated. I was confused because there were multiple tables that were not bussed for 20+ minutes. To make it worse, people surrounding us had been receiving cold food and sending it back all night. We ended up leaving and I do not plan on returning. Good thing we have a Longhorn Steakhouse and Texas Roadhouse coming to make up for this institution."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here for quite a while as previous experience was less than wonderful. However heard things are better, so tried it again. Steaks are wonderful! Jamie was great, the crab was less than superb but she made up for it by a complimentary appetizer card. Very pleased to find the quality of the food is back."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was just a bad day or a bad waiter but I didn't enjoy my visit. Arrived for lunch at 1:26pm and was seated immediately. My fiancé and I ordered an Ahi Tuna Salad and it came out within 10 minutes. We ordered our entrees (crab stuffed Tilapia) when we received the appetizer. We sat and sat and sat. We were talking and when we realized we didn't have out food we called the waiter (who never came to the table after seating us and delivering the appetizers) he said the food was just done and coming out. An hour later. Needless to say the food was cold which means it was done and left sitting and the waiter didn't provide prompt service. I'm sorry we won't be coming back here. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Haven't dined at Outback in many years and probable won't be back. TEXAS Roadhouse blows them away.   Service was terrible. Sat at the table for quite awhile while staff walked by many times without saying a word. Our server, Jim, had no personality, he definitely is in the wrong field.  The food was mediocre. The ribeye sandwich was tasteless and it was all bun. The beer cheese fondue was not hot and the pretzels were salt less. Blooming onion burger was best tasting item in our party.   Think twice before dining here, spent $34 on mediocre food and poor service."}
{"text":"This is the lowest rating I've ever given an establishment, however much deserved!! Went for a family gathering and the problems were to many to count! 1st props to server Danny\"\"\" He tried so much to satisfy our party, But when the cook, the manager the bus person all fail ??? The manager gave us a bogus excuse that two employees called in the other location lost air conditioning and this location lost air, but was restored hours ago?? Danny thank you as I told the talented server not your fault its management. We got comped apitizers, thanks !!! I must say that there were soo many screw ups that me and my family are no longer fans of this location! That sucks because we use to love going to Outback! Not this location"}
{"text":"Horrible service,  took 20 min just to get an iced tea. Food did not impress me. The waiter was rude & the table was dirty. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"We order soup and a salad on line, seems like the salad was ready for the trash but they sold it to me instead, very disappointed. What happened to quality nowadays?  Always, always check your meal before leaving the premises, too bad OutBack can't be trusted."}
{"text":"I ordered the filet mignon with a lobster tail here for dinner. The steak is a 6 oz cut which is great because with the lobster, complimentary bread, and included sides, I don't need a huge 16 oz hunk of meat anyways. I got corn tortilla soup and fries. The soup was actually really good, I would recommend it over the veggies which look very basic and the mushrooms, which were mediocre. The fries were good, although I was sad that they serve sweet potatoes and not sweet potato fries. I got the steak cooked medium and and it was tender and juicy. The meat in the lobster tail was a bit salty and tougher than I like, though.   Someone else in my party ordered some kind of shrimp and steak dish, and was super disappointed because the picture on the menu was very misleading. The steak was about 1/3 as thick as in the picture, and the shrimps were tiny. I know you can't expect your meal to look as good as their staged and touched up photos but it was really a huge letdown in comparison. She did also order the raw tuna appetizer and ate it all herself and loved it.  This place is pretty good for a fun night out with family."}
{"text":"Absolutely love eating here.  The food is amazing. I always get the tenderloin and steamed lobster tail. My other half had tenderloin and shrimp. We order the loaded potatoes that are garlic mashed. The asparagus tastes like fire grilled. Amazing.  Portions are just right size and there are lots of add ons to choose from.  The lobster tail was steamed but had a lot of water in it... still great flavor. When I go I always get seated by the bathroom, now we just ask for another section. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Outback is a pretty good steakhouse that we tend to always frequent when in the Las Vegas area. We even go when it's a family member's special day. The service has always been okay. Have seen they've remodeled the place inside and out, though mostly on the outside.   This time out, it took forever to try and get seated and even though they had 4 people working the front entrance to sit people down, they were non-communicative and non-attentive. You could tell they were young and not well versed in hospitality. Though we were a larger group of 7, and they were quite busy during dinner time, the wait was over 45 mins. While they told us 30-45 mins., I had to go to them for updates every 10 mins. as my elderly parents and young nieces were very hungry. And to top it all off, it was my brother-in-law's birthday and he chose Outback by name to celebrate his birthday. The front staff acted as if they could care less if we patronized--continued to patronize their establishment or not. As we saw many and all other customers get seated as the waiting area with the covered benches were empty, we and especially my bro-in-law grew sick of waiting though a table was finally almost available, we just left. It was his call, but I felt so bad for him since it was supposed to be his birthday dinner. The front staff made no effort to offer us to stay or even apologized for the long wait. Suffice it to say, they just lost some longtime customers from out of town."}
{"text":"Hmm lots of negative Nancy's in here. I claim shenanigans. This Outback is really cool. You get a nice view of the strip and the Mirage volcano, quick service and a decent meal for a good price. Granted the menu is slightly more expensive than outer OB steakhouses, but what more do you expect from Vegas? I had the Outback special, with steak, mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. It was very good and tender. And our waiter was really nice and attentive. I dunno if it was me though, but it seemed to feel a bit hot in the restaurant. They really need to crank up the AC in there."}
{"text":"I have been coming  to this outback for years with my wife. Anniversaries, birthdays or any other excuse I can think of to come eat here. I always order the cheese fries to start and the Alice springs chicken. The quality of food has always been good and any time I have had even the littlest problem they have always made it right with us. No restaurant is going to be perfect all the time. I will continue to visit this outback for as long as they continue to deliver quality food and good customer service which I have experienced every time I have been here. I recommend an extra side of honey mustard for the chicken, don't worry it's free."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to an Outback in at least three years.  Not because I have anything against Australia, just because I hadn't ever been 'wowed' - and because we live in a fantastic foodie city.  Knowing the tab was on someone else made coming back a no brainer.  Side note - I have always ordered a large Fosters when I go to Outback... and every time I'm reminded why I never drink it anywhere else.  We got the appetizer trio - the ahi tuna / coconut shrimp / avocado & crab tower - and it was really REALLY good.  Like all three components - spot on.  I thought we were headed for greatness.  It was at that moment that I realized our server was more concerned with his appearance and phone than taking care of his tables.  At least five different times our glasses were empty / we needed something and he was nowhere to be found.  I got the prime rib and asked for the creamy horseradish - when it arrived, and it was raw / fresh horseradish I didn't really make a fuss.  However, my girlfriend's mom insisted that I ask for the creamy.... so we did.  Ten minutes later, he came back, plopped it on the table and said \"we were out - so I had to make some\".  This plopping of items on the table became entertaining because it continued for the rest of the meal.  BTW - the prime rib with horseradish cream was really good... matter of fact, everyone enjoyed their meal that night with the exception of the service.  Goes to show that excellent food isn't enough to get some of us to come back!"}
{"text":"We love this place!   Great food,  had lobster and steak tonight.   Yum yum!  Service is always exceptional."}
{"text":"Our first time at outback and it was very good. We were seated right away and were attended to within minutes. We both ordered steaks, green beans and mashed potatoes. Moderate sized portions (but thats a good thing since we don't like to fill up too much), and the steaks were flavorful and cooked to perfection. Excellent mashed potatoes and FINALLY green beans that aren't overcooked and mushy! Overall, very pleased with the service from Josh and hostess at the door was very nice. Even opened the door for us! We'll be back for sure, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Default for a decent steak at a decent price.  I usually get the 6oz Outback special, cooked med rare and a wedge salad and baked tater loaded.    The food is always good especially for $9.99. A 6oz steak is no huge but paired with the free bread, salad and tater.. it is plenty.   Service is always good."}
{"text":"We use to go this Outback on Craig road and the service was great and so were the steaks. Over the last two years we have eaten here twice and taken out our food. The quality of the food has  gone down as well as the service.  Our visit last night was our attempt to give it one more try. Service:   Our waiter was not the friendliest guy.  He took our drink orders and forgot my water after two reminders. Our appetizers came out and we had no silverware. One of the busboys happen to walk by and gave us our silverware. Our waiter cheered up towards the end....most likely because it was closing time.   Food:  shrimp was too oily. Fried mushrooms and cheese fries were great. The tortilla soup was stale and tasted like it was in the pot on the burner all day. My steak salad was good. The meat was well done and the dressing was great. Our entire meal with drinks, was over 70......too much for just a mediocre experience.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I do enjoy outback for its consistent quality. House salad is amazing with their signature dressing. I get the filet every time with sliced tomatoes and it's mostly always great. Please Arizona.... you really should bring back that crazy good fudge Chocolate Cake! It was the only Chocolate cake I liked anywhere. Other states still have it on their menu, which makes me fall off my chair with notice.   They actually have really good after dinner desserts, so good, it's worth not filling up on dinner. Save room for the sweets at the end. Then roll out to your car."}
{"text":"Love outback had a great meal with my friend service was great. Food was good steak was tender"}
{"text":"This location just opened at a new location on Ikea Blvd this week and it was awesome. The decor is spot on and everything was clean and pristine. Our server, Willie, was great and stayed on top of everything. Our food was on point and exactly as ordered. The proprietor was very friendly and really makes the location phenomenal.  10/10 would recommend everyone to give them a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Such a nice location. Our server is wonderful, courteous and kind. On Wednesday's they have a 9.99 special includes a little steak or chicken with a side and a soda! Even for it being a holiday everything came out fast and hot. Atmosphere is nice with a lot of people in here it still feels calm. Kate who I think was a manager even came out to check on us. Chocolate thunder from down under was delicious!"}
{"text":"Outback seems to be shifting into less of a nice chain dinner stop into a more expensive version of Applebee's. My wife and I were surprised when we arrived last night and our host encouraged us to put our order in on electronic machine rather than with our server which made the whole experience feel a little less date night. I guess it's convenient for some people but just felt a little more casual than we were hoping for.  Asked for more bread which never came. Ordered my steak medium rare but it was a heavy medium. My wife's tilapia was the most rubbery filet either of us have ever tasted. Potatoes were warm at best.  Happy hour drinks were rang in at full price.  Aside from the rubber fish, any one of these other things probably wouldn't have bothered us that much but all together it's probably enough that we will find some place else next time.  Update: outback contacted us and gave us a gift card to \"try again\". The service was much better and nothing was cold. Steak was cooked right but I was amazed at how much pepper was on the steak. I mean, I'm all for a bit of seasoning but HOLY COW. I had a large pile of excess pepper that was able to scrape off which made it mostly palatable. Likely won't be back but I suppose someone else may still like this place."}
{"text":"I rarely review a chain, however I end up back at this Outback time and time again.  The service at this location is always great.  The staff are always friendly and get your food to you fast.  In terms of the food, I think Outback has some very underrated dishes.  Starting off with their bread.  I don't know what kind it is, but it is some of the best bread you will ever eat.  I am usually almost full on the bread alone.  For appetizers, my favorite is the mac and cheese balls.  They are different than any other fried mac and cheese app I have had.  A very gooey white cheese combined with a light fry makes for a great dish.    My go to meal every time here is the bloomin burger.  Outback definitely uses fresh meat because it is cooked to a perfect medium rare every time I get it.  The bloomin pedals and bloomin sauce to top the burger are an amazing combination that makes this one of my favorite and most unique tasting burgers.  Another favorite dish that I have had are the coconut shrimp.  I don't even like coconut for the most part, but the way they are done at Outback makes all the difference.  They are crisp and flavorful and pair perfectly with the remoulade sauce that comes with them."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience! I had a 6oz filet and lobster with the French onion and broccoli! Everything was cooked perfectly. The French onion soup was really cheesy and came out piping hot! The manager, Craig, even came to chat with us to see how everything was going. He was extremely polite and caring! He truly cares about his customers."}
{"text":"First visit here in a couple years and was pleasantly surprised. Took the family for my mom's 97th birthday and they didn't disappoint. Called earlier in the day and was able to put my name inside we had minimal wait when we arrived for dinner. One of the managers visited the table which was a nice touch. Food was very good and the temperature was perfect. I don't mind waiting for freshly cooked delicious food. Our server was nice but we had to ask multiple times for refills and boxes otherwise would have given 5 stars. Will definitely visit again in the near future"}
{"text":"Had the steak with a bloomin' onion of course. PM me if you know of a better bloomin onion in the east valley! Service was fine, food was a tick above normal."}
{"text":"We put our name down a day in advance... when we got there the wait was 30 minutes (the same as walk-ups)?? People who just showed up got tables before we did, despite the reservations. This frustrated me quite a bit but I was glad they offered beverages while we waited.  The food and drinks, however, were very good! The complimentary bread was warm and fresh. Good service on busy nights. Our waitress was very nice and gave us a lunch special at dinner time! Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Our families came to celibate the birthdays of two of our grandchildren.  It was real busy for a Thursday night and the hostess seated all eleven of us promptly.  The waitress came by introduced herself and took our drink orders.  On her return we placed an order for a couple of appetizers.  Everything started to go down hill from there.  Someone, not our waitress, delivered two orders of Blooming Onions (we only ordered one) to our table and left.  When our waitress came to take our order we informed her of the mistake.  Said she would look into it.  After what seemed to be 20-25 minutes our dinners arrived.  Everyone that ordered steak found them either way under cooked and lukewarm or cold.  Same with the side dishes. My wife said her Alice Springs Chicken was good and one grandson enjoyed his hamburger, but other than that no one was happy with their steaks.  Needless to say we didn't order any dessert to celibate the boys birthdays.  To top it all off they charged us for both Blooming Onions.  Lesson learned, we shall not return to pay for sub-par cold food at those prices!"}
{"text":"Outback what's up with this chain Been to outbacks on Long Island this pa one is from another alter ego outback and it's not good Came here on a weekday night Place almost empty  Waitress greeter says give me a few minutes while I clean a table um was that a joke ? The place is almost empty  After 10 min or so we are seated in bar section  Fine ok ... Waitress informs us sorry no brown bread  Um ok outback we love your warm bread  We get a burnt onion  Then our food arrives  My little piece of salmon and a measly little potato  Sons steak was fine  We order a take out steak for husband guess what no potatos left luckily he eats veggies  Waitress friendly enough  But table wait  No bread  Then no potato  And this outback  Gets 1 star  I foolishly return this time many more diners  35 minute wait and a whole bunch of empty tables What's going on here?  Waitress was very friendly  took drink order and food order at the same time because we know how slow it can be... steaks were ok but I cried my fish had bacon on it YUCK I was very clear no bacon so 20 min later my new bourbon salmon arrived it was ok just a little peppery but the whole joy was lost because son and husband were done eating. Waitress was sweet and took it off the check   Take some lessons from Long Island outbacks and fix the situation here"}
{"text":"Went there and got there Valentine's special, it was a lot of food and a decent price. The food was good except I ordered my steak RARE and got medium. This is a steak house and they should be able to cook steaks to order. It wasn't even medium rare. The service was pretty good though. I'll go back if there's a good special but I'll make sure I order my steak fresh out of the package and then maybe I'll get it rare."}
{"text":"You never know what you will get here. I've been dining at this location for years, if I had to sum up my experiences in one sentence it would be they are consistent inconsistent.  Our table was never washed from the previous party, their leftover sticky food got on my coat as I sat down. I cleaned it myself with water and napkins.  Our waiter must have been new (I hope) he did check on us through dinner but didn't bring us silverware or app plates when he brought our appetizer I had to go to the bar and request my own because he was nowhere to be found.  Steak didn't come with the dressing as ordered.  I didn't even bother saying a word about anything because this is my expected experience when I go to the outback..."}
{"text":"My little dude and I's birthdays are one day apart (best birthday gift I had ever and will ever receive)...so while we were celebrating his 4th year on earth my birthday was put on hold...which was A-OK in my book. We finally got around to having a family party to ring in my 31st year and I decided on Outback because I was craving some cheese fries.   We were seated within 5 min and greeted by Gavin who was delightful and knew all about Ratatouille (I try to bring the kids portable DVD players to restaurants so they don't terrorize the other guests. Best money I have ever spent.). Of course we ordered cheese fries, steaks, salads, the kids usual mac and cheese and the Wallaby Darned cocktail. The cheese fries and the Outback Special sirloin were the highlights. I loved the lobster and mushroom topping you can add on. The steaks were cooked perfectly (med-rare is the only way to have a steak in my never-too-humble opinion). Everyone in my family was happy and we will be back soon. Make sure you go earlier because the wait can top over an hour or sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I've come back here many times because the steak and service is great for the price .  This time is differ, service was great but they messed up on my steak 2 times . The manager bought my food out and agreed my steak was overcooked than undercooked the 2 nd time . It  wasn't that busy but still waited a while for my food . I was so hungry and dining alone . Regardless I got a big bill . I didn't want nothing for free but waited so long for good was ridiculous . Still I was very pleasant . Lol oh well."}
{"text":"Okay as I write this review, I am a little confused but I'll get to that in a bit.  I understand Outback is not a 'great' Steakhouse so let's get that out of the way. As a chain my experience is that they are very consistent, medium prices and  decent food. That being said, it is my mother's FAVORITE place so when we got together in Vegas, we all decided that we'd be taking my mother to her fave eatery.  First, an order of drinks. One frozen margarita with salt, one on the rocks with no salt. The waitress repeated the order and left. A while later the waitress brought our drinks but with no salt anywhere. My mother isn't a wave maker and so let it go. The waitress to her credit did realize the error (at the table instead of at the bar)and offered to correct it but Mom declined.  We placed our orders with all of us getting entrees that were combined with endless shrimp. Three steaks all medium rare, one chicken. Two salads: one with onions, one without. As we were ordering, another table was seated next to us. Shortly, the waitress returned with a tray including our salads as well as the drinks for the new table next to us and bread. Our salads were apparently prepared by the bartender because, as with the salt on the margs, onions were omitted from both. She dropped off our salads and turned to the other table and gave them their signature OB bread on a board, we got nada.   Originally we weren't going to ask for the lost onions but once we saw we also weren't getting the bread we decided to ask. We got her attention after she took the other table's order and asked if we had to special order the bread. She said no, it's on the way. \"Oh\", I said \" but you brought theirs\" And she says \"yes, yours is coming.\" Okay, we were there first but whatever. The bread came out in a bit along with the missing onions, so everyone at the table could at least be eating something.  Before the person who had to wait for her onions could finish her salad, the meals arrived. I cut into my steak and it was extremely tough. It was cooked properly though which can be tricky for a place like OB. All were tough. I cut off a piece, put it in my mouth and....nothing. The 'famous' Outback spice blend that is normally on the steak was nowhere to be seen. It was bland. I put a little salt and pepper and took another bite and chewed for days. My mother was still struggling to get through her first piece with the knife.  Again, I know we were not at the best steakhouse but I've been going to OB long enough to remember when the New York strip was called the Ayers Rock Steak and the shrimp on the barbie was served on the yummy bread slice so I have something to compare. My mother was unhappy, my steak isn't good at all and the third steak being the small 5oz just plowed on through and focused on her flow of shrimp. We call the waitress over and explain about the the steaks being very tough and bland. My mother asks for another steak while I switch to chicken.   The waitress leaves and to her credit, the manager arrives to see what the situation is. My mother explains the toughness of the steak to which the manager responds \"Well, the New York Strip is our toughest steak.\" by way of explanation. I suppose if we had never had steaks before in our lives, it would have been a suitable one. I ask about the seasonings and how the steaks here didn't seem to be seasoned like all of the other OBs. Her response was that she could not speak to what the other restaurants do. Okay, I guess that's fair in a way.  A little bit later, the manager brings the new food to the table and says she will wait until my mother samples hers to make sure it is okay. My mother starts cutting...and cutting and the manager just turns and leaves. No comment, no waiting to see if it's cooked properly or if my mother will ever be able to cut through it. She just walks away without a word. When my mother does finally get through it, it's well done. Remember, we all ordered medium rare. The waitress returns and my mother expresses her dissatisfaction with the second steak. The waitress offers her something else and my mother decides to just have the shrimp and no steak.  We finally get the check. As you might imagine there is a mistake. While both my and my mother's original orders are removed, instead of changing mine to the chicken and endless shrimp combo, it's charged as two al a carte entrees, which is more $. I show the waitress who is confused again. She leaves, asks the manager, returns to tell me I changed my order and that's the charge. I explain again, she leaves again, returns saying she \"got it now\" and fixed the bill. This time it is correct.  To be continued in the comments......"}
{"text":"We have continued to frequent this Outback since my last review, and until last night, the food and service were commendable - no complaints. Just the way Outback should be. But something must have changed, because last night - a Saturday night - when we arrived for dinner at 7, and were seated almost immediately, things immediately started to go wrong. We had no silverware or napkins until we asked for them - and that was after we had already finished our appetizer of coconut shrimp. I had a hard time getting the server's attention to request the napkins and silverware.  Then the server forgot to bring bread until we asked for it, and she explained that they don't bring out bread now until after you've ordered. Almost ten minutes later, we still didn't have bread, so I asked her again. She brought the bread, and I cut into it right away, and it was cold to the touch. I have never in all my visits experienced cold bread at Outback. By the time I got her attention and she brought out another (warm) loaf, with apologies, our entrees had been served, and it was kind of too late.  My grilled salmon was one of the worst servings of salmon I've ever had at any restaurant - almost tough and chewy, rather than delicate and melt-in-your-mouth, as I've had it before at Outback. The baked potato was on the small side and not quite done - definitely not fluffy like they usually are. The manager never did come over to ask how things were. It was my birthday - my real birthday - and I had hoped for the same good experience we've had pretty regularly at this Outback, but now I wish we'd gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came with gf for dinner after a long week. We both love steaks and this was close to home. We both started with some alcoholic drinks and got carded which was fine. Skipped the onion blossom this time and went straight for entrees. She ordered the new york strip med rare. I ordered the ribeye. Food was great. The place wasnt too busy and our server was attentative. My one complaint was that the server decided to card me again for using an Amex card to pay for our meal. I noticed she didnt do the same for her other tables. Race aside, i felt profiled. Not going back again just because of that. I treat everyone the same at work and expect the same back."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner at Outback last night. We ordered salmon, onion rings, two bottles of white wine, lamb, filet mignon, salad and steak. Everything was amazing! Our waitress was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.(If only I remembered her name) I always have good experience when I come here. Its not just delicious but the food is pretty cheap too for a steak house. To top it off, I left my wallet which had everything I need(My resident card(which costs about $300 to replace), all credit cards, cash and license) and i called the following day and found out that the buzzer kept it in the lost and found. I came back today and picked it up. Thank you Outback!!! I will definitely be back SOONER THAN SOON :)"}
{"text":"This is completely based mainly off our experience with one of the best waiters I've ever had...Josh. .was awesome... now why only 4 stars , You may be wondering? ? (Well because ...it's my review lol) .. no seriously,  the 4 stars was due to when we walked in we were greeted promptly  (which was great) .. we were taken to a seat by a hostess ... (which appeared ok) ..but the seat she sat us in was on the middle of some upper kinda part of the restaurant like literally in the middle of the floor  (SMH)..AND she never bothered to ask our party of 3 if we preferred a booth or table.. (kind of rubbed me wrong ).. but I think the real shock was when I asked her what he favorite drink on the menu was (it's vegas I ask everyone that..lol) and she says I'm not a server .. I wouldn't know ... (shocked face)...okkk....well we eventually move to a booth and got the reason I wrote this review. JOSH... he was knowledgeable,  conversational,  and just a delight. The food was awesome . He was attentive.  The fact he also had other restaurant recommendations as well for a variety fo different kind of foods was awesome..he made sure we were well taken care of ..and... I was very pleased with the experience. . This outback is definitely worth the visit! !!!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I was a bit worried with some of the reviews that were left... BUT.... everything was AMAZING!!! Bread always good, dinner was cooked to perfection! Service was fantastic! Our server Juan was amazing! Our cups were always full, plates cleared out quickly and he checked in with us perfectly! His positive attitude and hospitality did not go unnoticed. We will definitely be back! Hopefully we can get Juan as our server again next time!"}
{"text":"What a joke. We called ahead and were told there was no wait for a table. Arrived five minutes later to find a 30-40 minute wait. The host's response when we told her ? No apology. Just said that she didn't have a phone at her stand so it wasn't her we spoke to. Won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Amazing steaks with lots of flavor!! Had a relaxing time out with my husband,and it was just what we needed. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place and wonderful food! I wish they would add on to this location with some fun stuff, like an open outdoor seating on the roof or fun outdoor place for kids.... Etc my sister had the wallaby darn and loved it and my kids love the macaroni and cheese! I however love their steak, it's my favorite!!"}
{"text":"We were seated as soon as we got there and ordered drinks relatively quick because the waiter was so attentive. My fiancé and I ordered the Outback burger. Her's with American cheese and a Cesar salad, mine with cheddar and bacon. Our burgers were spectacular! She didn't have cheese when it came to the table, they happily brought us a slice."}
{"text":"This outback location really knows how to keep their customers happy. After a slightly bad experience they did everything in their power to make sure my next experience was nothing short of awesome! Michelle is an awesome manager and really knows how to provide great customer service! The food as always was wonderful tonight. I will continue to go to this outback location!"}
{"text":"HEY, WHERE YA GONNA GO WHEN YOU WANT A TASTE OF DOWN under???  Steak-Busters. Ooops I MEAN the outback, oops NOT the Australian outback, I mean the chain.      I was stuck on a Friday without any food but what I really wanted was a steak.  6'O'clock I fed the cats, then checked the internet for steak houses near me (I hadn't had a steak in over a year and I'm a self-professed meat eater).  Looked at Texas Roadhouse (too loud), Cheesecake factory (too many complaints on Yelp!), others were pricey, I just wanted a steak! wha wha wha     I will always remember the Ayers Rock (vs. the New York Strip which looks a lot like Manhattan(from and aerial point of view)) steak presented to me about 15 years ago at the same restaurant with wife and kids (Greeters and waitress were all very attentive to my needs, I just wanted a quiet meal for a single person at about 9pm on a Friday night (wife away on travel, I let the waitress know we used to go there years ago when our kids hadn't grown up and moved away ha ha so....).      Done to perfection, they know medium rare."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars for the service!  Our server was Amazing!  She recommended the lamb chops for my wife and according to her were very tasty.  I always order Alice Springs chicken which is my go to and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for lunch because I had a gift card from work. Entryway has got to get a brand new rug and clean the floor because it really stinks. Me, my mom, and daughter were seated quickly, got our drinks pretty fast, and ordered fast. My mom had the small (emphasis on small) Alice springs chicken and cesar salad. She gave it a 3 1/2, probably something she could make at home, but worth trying. I had the bleu cheese side wedge salad that was the best part of my meal, very good and something different. I had a burger no bread, not bad flavor, I asked for medium and I got medium rare, no big deal. My daughter got grilled chicken and fries, they were a 1 to her but she's picky so I'm not surprised. I'll go back, if I get another gift card haha"}
{"text":"I  love this place their steak is very delicious  and their appetizers are great . As a man who loves steak this o s a place to go. It is a very relaxing atmosphere to dine."}
{"text":"We came in about an hour and a half before closing and no one checked on us for the first 10-15 minutes of us being seated. We had to ask someone to take our drink order. Our waiter kept forgetting to bring bread and small things we asked for, at the time we were the only people in the section. My bf's chicken was not cooked all the way through. Another friend we were with ordered the no rules pasta, the entire table got their order before the pasta came out. The waiter insured us that the pasta would be out in \"5 minutes.\" When the pasta finally did come it was made with macaroni noodles, because they were out of fettuccini noddles. We were not informed of this before the meal came out. The manager came out and offered us a new meal. We have now been sitting 30 minutes waiting for the new meal to come out. Tables who arrived 30 minutes to an out after our party have left the establishment. Hands down the worst experience I have ever had while dining out!! However, the manager was very understanding and comped the entire meal. We made sure to leave a tip."}
{"text":"We continue to come here because the steak is delicious. ..however the service fails more with each visit.  And now the food has started to go downhill as well...tonight overcooked steak and cold veggies.  We have finally decided to stop coming."}
{"text":"Ok..  Went there on a Friday at about 3.  Ordered two prime ribs.  12 oz and 16 oz.  They were cooked perfectly but we noticed immediately how much fat there were on them. Honestly, about a quarter of it was fat.   We pretty much put all the fat in a bowl and when the waitress came over, she asked how was everything.  We said, the meat is cooked exactly like we like it but it seems like that is a lot of fat.  She took the bowl and I am assuming took it to the cook?  The manager came over and said she understood we did not like the prime rib.  Nope, it was not that we didn't  like the prime rib, it just seems there was a lot of fat on them.  She offered whatever, and I explained that was not my point but thank you.  The waitress came by later and genuinely seemed concerned about us being not happy.  All in all, I will go back because they seem to care.  Not sure why the cook would not cut off all that fat however."}
{"text":"ok, so my last experience with Outback was not the best. this time taking into consideration we were in Vegas was much better . I came here with a couple of co workers and a dealer we all ordered steaks and they were all done right and nice cuts. of course we paid the price the difference between the Outback and Hugos Cellar in Vegas were about $20 I will take Hugo's hands down for service. the meat was on point in both places. we had great service and food and a view of the strip I got the check  I had SLOW-ROASTED PRIME RIB Seasoned with an herb crust, served with au jus and hand-carved to order and  wood-fire grilled. with a side of shrooms. everyone else had ribeyes and fillets but the went med well so I will not talk about that, there is no point to having beef jerky for dinner go bit into a slim jim!"}
{"text":"This evening I ordered a takeout order. The girl that came to our car was wonderful and sweet. Our food order wasn't complete and she immediately ran inside to fix the problem. I'm rating this a 2 star because another employee (I'm assuming was a kitchen employee) came stumbling out the door holding her stomach. Another employee shortly came after to check on her. The girl did not look like she felt well. My steak could have been cooked by that sick girl. I asked the takeout girl if the employee could use some help and she replied with no concern and said she wasn't sure was what going on. If your employees are sick, they should not be working around food. I won't return.  Needless to say, I will not be returning. I threw my food away. I'm very victimized by Outback Steakhouse. I refuse to eat contaminated food."}
{"text":"A few years ago I didn't know about Pink Slime meats. It is a process in which meat has additives and ingredients that are pressed hard together to make meat look and taste better. So they say.  . There are several companies who are using PERFECT looking meat. No flaws looking do you know what i mean. THE Perfect piece of meat is not really what it seems. I call it Fake Meat. I visited Outback 2 times in the last year due to friends going there. And I saw FAKE meat on the plates. NOT your geniune butcher cut meat straight from a cow. Now I dont know their process or where their meat comes from But I have to give them a thumbs down. As for service always seems good service, but your there to eat, question what you eat and where it comes from. I do."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to an Outback for a very long time.  And it will be a very long time before I go back.  It's okay.  Just okay.  And maybe that's the problem. Our server was great.  My steak was good, very lean, cooked the way I asked.  The sweet potato was good.  My son ordered a burger piled high with crispy onions, and he enjoyed it.    The server recommended a wedge salad, which I did not like.  To make it unique, the chef added a balsamic dressing to it.  The blue cheese and balsamic were not a happy pairing.   The brown bread Outback is known for was okay, but I prefer the slightly sweet brown bread from Cheesecake Factory.  The blooming onion, which we thought we liked so much in the past, has lost its luster.  Too much for two people and neither of us liked the dipping sauce.    These days it seems an eating experience has to be terrific from start to finish, and Outback just doesn't hit all the high points."}
{"text":"5 of us went and 5 of us had a good meal. Our waiter Cooper was very nice and attentive. The garlic mash taters a bit lumpy for the way I like them, but they were decent. They serve a killer margarita! I had a 6 oz filet med/rare and it was done perfectly. Went around 6pm and I am used to Outbacks always being packed and loud. This one was not."}
{"text":"The good was great, onion blossom great I had fish tacos deliciousness but please stay away from the blackberry martini, it was disgusting it taste like cough syrup."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars, I would. I'd honestly go into the negative. We made a \"reservation\" for 8:45, even called in before we arrived. The dumbass (excuse my language) at the podium said \"5 mins, your table will be ready when you're here.\" We get there on time, weren't seated until 930. Oh, and they seated 6 people in a booth. My family and I are not big at all, but even we wouldn't have fit comfortably. The manager offered to get us a drink while we waited, ordered 2 miller lights... 2 seconds later, he asked \"you wanted bud light right?\" Because his friends came in and he stopped in the middle of our conversation to talk to his friends. I nearly lost it. I snapped back and said \"MILLER.\" Dude, you manage an outback, your job really is not that difficult. Our waitress was alright, I suppose... Forgetful but alright. She tried her best. A for effort. We ordered a couple apps, waited and waited and waited and waited. To the point where my dad, brother and I craved a cigarette. So they started walking outside, for a smoke, the dumbass at the podium said \"if you go out, you can't come back in, company policy\" when they told me that, I was livid. I told her, I'm gonna have a smoke, and get my wallet unless you don't want me paying for this dinner. Honestly, it's pretty bad if you start craving a cig in between apps and entree. Anyways, steaks came out... Warm. Ordered medium rare, my steak nearly gave me lock jaw from chewing it so much. We should've saved this horrible experience by eating at the damn chili's next door. I swear, a blind, tasteless person could've cooked a better steak than the chefs in charge of this joint. Sorry to be so harsh, but this is seriously the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I want this meal comped, and matter of fact, I'd like to be reimbursed for my time wasted in this restaurant.   My conclusion, if you want to get treated like nothing, be surrounded by the dumbest staff in America and eat DOG FOOD, then this outback is the right place for you!   To the blond hostess, that sucks so bad at the easiest job in the world... Congrats. You're employee of the month!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight for an early dinner.  Service was excellent.  Disappointed in the steaks.  Absolutely no favor at all and tough.  Mashed potatoes where cold and also not much favor.  The onion blossom and salad was excellent.  Meal was disappointing for the $$$ spent.  Don't think we will be returning anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a shoutout to Natalia our server! Even though it was super busy, she was really attentive and patient with us when asking for anything!! Thank you Natalia for your awesome service. You're appreciated!"}
{"text":"This is our regular Outback, today it was a major disappointment. From the wait staff, servers, bartender and even the manager, no one cared! The bread came out cold and I had to search to find butter as there was so little in the container. It didn't improve from there, it took about 15 minutes for them to take our order, by the way they weren't busy like normal. Once our food arrived my husbands fries were immediately sent back with the kitchen delivery as they looked as if they had been fried 2 times before. 10 minutes later the manager stop by to apologize for the fries and ask if the replacement was better. We co uldn't answer because we were still waiting. He then ask if everything else was OK, I told him that my steak which was ordered medium was swimming in blood. It was half eaten and he offered to put it back on the grill. I declined as I wanted to eat it with the rest of my food. My husbands fries finally artived as the waiter check back on us for the first time since we had been served. Before he arrived I went to the bar to get our ice tea refilled. The bartender was in no hurry to get the refills, as she seemed offended that I ask. So the free appetizer coupon from the manager will go unused as that was our last visit."}
{"text":"Great taste and very good service.  It's been a while  since I last had lamb because I didn't know where to get them. Imagine my surprise when I found the lamb on the menu.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Server Christina was outstanding!!! Brandon cooked one hell of a bone-in ribeye!!! Everything was cooked as ordered including the well done blooming onion."}
{"text":"Haven't really had good experiences at Outback Steakhouse's throughout Vegas (not this one specially), but I'm sure glad I went this time.  Jordan G was our sever and I will request him from now on. Very personable, very friendly and took care of us with a smile. I really, truly hope he's there the next time I come to this very Outback."}
{"text":"I don't know what to expect anymore out of chain restaurants. Before, I used to be excited to go to Outback/Friday's/Chili's/Applebees etc, but now, ehhh. Went here today for an Easter sunday brunch. Since most of the restaurants were closed, we had no choice but to try and eat here. Went inside, was seated fast because it wasn't busy at all. Maybe 4-5 tables were occupied. They weren't busy and there were still dirty tables waiting to be cleaned. SMH. Anyway, our server was nice, average. The food was, well, I seriously had better. I expected too much I guess. We ordered a combo from their lunch menu - Caesar Salad and an Outback burger, a half rack of ribs and a chicken bacon burger sandwich with \"Aussie\" fries. Funny about the \"Aussie\" fries, it tasted just like \"American\"/ \"ordinary\" fries.   Anyway, the Caesar salad was meh. Forgettable. The Outback burger and the Chicken and Bacon burger were both mediocre as well. To be honest, I've had better burgers in Carl's Jr. The ribs though were decent. It was soft and flavorful.   Will I come back? No, not really. Not  because I had a very horrible experience but, on their pricing, I can have a much more decent and satisfying meal somewhere else. Or maybe we just ordered wrong? I don't know, and I won't know anytime soon."}
{"text":"Please take this review with a grain of salt, because I am a steak snob. I prefer USDA prime beef.   Like all locations, the go with the Aussie feel. It's a bit tacky, but not overwhelming. To start, I will say that their pumpernickel bread is quite amazing. I went through three loaves during my meal. It's hot from the oven and served with whipped butter.  I had the 8 ounce filet medium rare. It was cooked beyond medium, so much more done than I liked. The waiter sent it back, but didn't seem to be in a good mood because of that. It was a bit off putting, because there are few things worse than an over cooked steak. The second attempt was better. The beef quality wasn't near what I'm used to. Although that's why it's about $20 instead of $40+ that you pay for prime beef. So I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We went for dinner this evening.  We order a hamburger and fried shrimp.  My wife ordered a salad.  It took over 20 minutes for the salad to arrive.  We say for another 20 minutes no food.  Ask the waitress and she made excuses they were busy.  They were not busy half empty is mor like it.  I asked for the manager who took another 5 minutes to show up.  He said she forgot to put our order. And he offered up some SOUP while we waited.   I said no thank you and offered to pay for what we had.  He said that was ok and we left never to return.   We go to the companies other restaurants and even members of the frequent dinners club but not sure if we will patronize any of there restaurants again.  Stay clear of this one with people who don't care"}
{"text":"We stopped going to Outback years ago because of the consistent poor quality and service.  However, we received gift cards this year, so we went back again.  I must say, this Christmas Eve dinner at Outback was one of the best family holiday dining experiences we've ever had!  Naively, we didn't call ahead to make them aware we had a party of 9 arriving, which could have been a headache for them and us. But they managed to get us all squeezed together, VERY quickly and extremely cheerfully.  The service was outstanding and all of our steaks were cooked perfectly.  Chris, the owner, and our server (Jay?  The one with all the customer service award buttons!) did everything they could to make our visit there pleasant, comfortable and lively.  They succeeded and then some."}
{"text":"Always great here we love this place cause there so nice and the place is clean and comfy!!!!! Cold Amstel also a plus !!!! My fav beer can't go wrong with that......;)the 8 ounce steaks came out great perfect and two side Cesar salads and mash ..... Hit the bellies great !!!!! The only thing bad was the sangria tasted like pink watered down lemon aid with a strawberry just sitting in it doing nothing very weak !!!!' But all was great.....  Stick with beer and wine and if dinner will be great..... Servers are the best and manager always comes out to check on u to make sure ur happy with meal and I love that that's how u run a buss!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing staff (Courtney), will definitely be back!!!! Couldn't have been a better experience!!"}
{"text":"The Good: Price, average food The Bad: Service The Ugly: The long wait for your food"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials. Try the Bleu cheese pecan salad and the Steakhouse Quesadillas"}
{"text":"They changed their Wednesday night special. Still great but no dessert. Instead they added a beer. They didn't have sweet potato but gave us asparagus on the house. Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Linda and I were there for dinner last night and meal was mediocre. Her steak was so/so and stringy. My meal was extremely salty We were disappointed but service was fine considering how busy they were"}
{"text":"Horrible service waited 20 minutes for table for 2. Tables for 6 got seated immediately twice. Don't honor their own specials on the website slow"}
{"text":"I came here a couple days ago with my grandpa and it's always the same, the food is decent and just on the border of decently priced and overpriced.. My grandpa likes it though, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Expect to wait forever for average food and service. Not worth the money or time.  The waiter was not friendly nor helpful. the lighting was too dark. The tables and chairs were rickety and the table was unbalanced--Poor drinks. The dining experience was awful."}
{"text":"I have come to this location for lunch a few times. Nothing really snazzy about it. Just know that if you only have an hour to spare, make sure they know this and also ask for the check as soon as your food arrives as it makes things so much easier and quicker. Food is good ( try the endless soup and salad as its cheap and tasty, especially the tortilla soup)"}
{"text":"Sllooooooww service - make note Dinner here last night for my daughters birthday. Just three adults and a baby, 730 on a Tuesday night. It was empty which surprised me for an outback. (We usually go to the one in Huntersville or rock hill)  Service was so slow - took 40 minutes for order of cheese fries and ahi tuna appetizers. Then another half hour for our simple dinner order. The manager came by the twenty minutes after appetizers were ordered and told us they would be right out. Didn't offer any compensation for delay. There were no more than 10 tables seated, there was no excuse for the delays. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Went this evening for a family dinner. I got the steak house salad. My steak was cooked medium, just as asked.  Iced tea was fresh.  Good service even on a busy Friday evening.  I'm a satisfied customer, over all.    They are currently renovating the exterior so watch your step in. Also the wooden floors are slippery, so beware my heeled divas out there!"}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of Outback Steakhouses, but for some reason this one makes the best Victorian Filet (drunk or sober). It is always cooked just right and delicious to the last bite. I usually come here once a year, and have yet to order something else on the menu, as the filet is that good. The location is right in the middle of the strip, the price is right and the wait is usually not that bad. I'm sure I'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"We went here Saturday for lunch and there was hardly anyone there which was a surprise.  I got a 6 oz steak that was so dry. I was craving the Mac and cheese that was also really dry, and they put this breadcrumb topping on it that was spicy which I didn't care for.  My husband's steak was also dry.  Pretty disappointed for the quality of the meal at those prices."}
{"text":"Yes... this is a chain. Nonetheless...we had some grade A service here! I feel so badly that i cannot remember our servers name...he was a tall gentleman, bald; by choice it seemed, and a smile to boot. He was generous to an extreme...he and the manager were super involved even though we were there during lunch/dinner. We were constantly checked on and updated on our meals and given beyond graciousness through our service. We will be returning based purely on the amazing service and care this place provided even beyond the convenience factor. It honestly felt like the service was at a 5 star likeness...maybe we were lucky, but I am grateful nonetheless."}
{"text":"..Pretty average experience. We had a gift card laying around since Christmas. Finally we didnt know how to spend our friday night (we're soo cool) and decided to use up our gift card.   I ordered the Wood Grilled California Chicken Sandwich. it had bacon, lettuce, tomato, herb aioli & smashed avocado on top. It was okay but i was expecting more flavor. My sandwich came with fries which were ok but a very small amount.   My bf ordered the Prime Rib Dip Sandwich (like a french dip sandwich) & chose macaroni & cheese as his side. He said the sandwich was average like mine but I did try his mac & cheese.. It was actually really good.  He also ordered their mini chocolate shake. I didnt see a regular sized offered. The mini was $3 and it was super tiny. I'd rather there just be an option for a regular sized shake.. even if it was a buck or so more.   Service was fine. Food was average. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Funny story though-- 2 days later i received an email for a free blooming onion. I'll head there for that for sure... forgot all about the blooming onion dang."}
{"text":"It's been years we've been at Outback, just because my hubby didn't like it back then. We gave it a try tonight after about 7 years. The blooming onion was good as always.  My daughter ordered a burger with Mac N Cheese. Her comment to it was:\" burger was kinda ok, Mac n Cheese a total no go. My little one liked the ribs, the other little one didn't eat all his chicken strips, but I tried them and they were pretty good. I had garlic filets, they had a really good taste, but for the meat choice I should have perfectly nice pieces and not some fatty ones. Vegetables that came with were ok, besides the carrots that were not really cooked, they were like almost raw. The mashed potatoes are not my favorite."}
{"text":"The service we received was great. The food (loaded bloomin onion) was average - pretty much what can be expected from any Outback. Nothing special but definitely no complaints   We sat in a booth in the bar area and the only complaint I have is the bartender. He was loud and obnoxious and we had to listen to him sing loudly and joke with staff and customers. He was dancing around behind the bar. This was going on during our entire visit. He was loud enough to hear over the music and restaurant noise and it was just very unprofessional and obnoxious."}
{"text":"Outback has fun marketing, made blooming onion mainstream, and a great college bowl game between the SEC and Big Ten. But the food is lacking for me. The steaks are not that great, been to outback a few times ate different location and its always underwhelming.  The blooming onion is good, but then again not sure if I had a bad one.  The steaks weren't that good, tried a few of them all taste like I could make them at home. This place screams chain steak! Not seasoned, regular cuts of meat, overpriced for the quality, and leaving you searching your smart phone for a better steak house.  I would avoid and save your money for a better steakhouse. This will keep save your money from going \"down under\"."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner one night early on a Saturday evening.  When we arrived at the restaurant it wasn't too busy and they were very efficient at seating us.  We ordered our drinks and looked over the menu --which left me with a couple of questions about one of their salads.  When the waiter returned he asked if we were ready.  So I asked my question: \"Can you tell me what comes on this salad?\" --the menu wasn't overly descriptive.  His response was: \"Erm, well, it's a salad, and it comes with steak!\" --good job genius, that's what a \"Steak Salad\" typically comes with.  Any way, so I order this 'Steak Salad'; I can be quite daring sometimes.  The food was served quite prompt --as I could see why when I received the salad.  This \"Steak Salad' was an iceberg lettuce, cut in two --they put one half on the plate, uncut --like, just a chunk of lettuce, with some dingy looking piece of meat which looked like it was from a 130 year old cow.  Though I will say the steak was halfway tasty, it really didn't look too appetizing, especially stuck next to a green rock of lettuce.  When the genius waiter said  \"Erm, well, it's a salad, and it comes with steak!\", I guess he wasn't screwing around --it really was just steak and salad.  The restaurant itself was somewhat dirty in appearance and everything, including the table, felt a bit grimy.  I will say it looked nice from the outside, however, though that doesn't mean much if the place is a hole on the inside.  The overall experience at this place was just all right --nothing special at all.  I would eat here again, but only if it was the only place left in Charlotte that had power and food."}
{"text":"We stopped on a Friday afternoon about 2:30pm and was greeted by a waitress/hostess and asked for a half table half booth, me and the misses can't agree on tables. We were informed that was not possible, those were being saved for a large group coming in soon. We place our order, ate, and no big group ever showed up, as we were getting ready to leave a young family was seated at these tables, they were a big group of three. I like the food but the next time I am lied to by the cheap help they can stick the business up their waazoo!"}
{"text":"I love the prime rib!  We were celebrating a late Mother's Day and wanted to eat here.   The waitress needs to be more informed and serious about allergens.  I asked specific questions and she didn't give the correct information about the ingredients in the dishes we ordered.  Balsamic vinegar and maple syrup are not the same for one lie she told.  Fortunately it wasn't an EpiPen reaction.  It didn't affect the tip but certainly had an effect on the rest of my evening.  Is it safe for me to go to Outback anymore?  Does anyone that works there care that this could happen again with worse results?"}
{"text":"Love this place, went here for our anniversary yesterday, ordered the Outback Special and the New York Strip + Bloomin Onion for appetizer. So good. A lot of food. Must go back soon. All this and Cherry limeaides (to die for!!!!) for $45! satisfied to say the least."}
{"text":"Steak was burned out, broccoli had the cheese over cooked u actually could chew it like a gum .. and potato soup had flour balls still like wasn't well prepared/cook , the worst outback here in Vegas food presentation was awful!! Henderson location still my favorite one!"}
{"text":"Ate here after the Cubs game the other day.  Have to admit I'm not a big Outback fan but I had a gift card so we went.   The service was pretty good. We were seated quickly and the waiter was friendly.  I ordered the large prime rib. It was not very good. It didn't seem to have any kind of rub on it for flavor. It had a fair amount of fat on it that wasn't good. If it has good flavor I don't mind a little extra fat.  Not a good meal for what it cost"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. You would expect a great dining experience for the price. The place is run down and messy. The booth in the waiting area is torn in many areas so that my first observation. There is a sleeping bag under the bench out front like a homeless person is using it at night. Tables not cleaned off and the server Emmon brought food and just set it on the kids coloring books and crayons they were still using. I ordered the tilapia and it was horrible. The changing table in the restroom is so loose it will not hold a child. They do not take pride in this facility at all. I will not be back."}
{"text":"There are a lot of negative reviews for this location. I personally didn't expect anything above average eating here, but the experience was actually pleasant. Inside there was a lot of customers. We only waited maybe 2 minutes for a table which was nice considering how busy it was. Our server came over and took our drink order right away. She soon returned with our drinks and some of that delicious free bread. There's something about that bread that's just so good! Priced at $7.29 hubby and I shared a \"Bloomin' Onion\" because it's not a visit to Outback without getting one. The bloomin' onion tasted great, I just hoped between the onion and bread that we had room for our meal!  I ordered a 6 ounce Filet priced at $20.49 after the addition of a blue cheese crown to the steak. I also for another $1 added a \"Wedge Salad\" to complete my meal. The wedge salad was awesome and almost a meal itself. The steak came with mashed potatoes that tasted alright, but might have been sitting on the plate for a bit because they weren't very warm. It also came with \"Baked Potato Soup\" that was pretty good. The steak really surprised me. I didn't expect much, but the steak was cooked to my liking, was tender and had good flavor. The blue cheese crown was too much. I little goes a long way in that department and while I usually like it on my steak, this time they could have scaled back and maybe even used actual chunks of cheese instead of a mixture.   I don't know how often I'll visit, but after this surprisingly good experience, I will not hesitate to rule out Outback Steakhouse in the future."}
{"text":"Steak was prepared to perfection and the staff was extremely friendly. We like how the manager goes the extra mile to make sure we were well taken care of. And our waitress Mandy was very professional and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this outback. The curbside togo is awesome. They have a great friendly staff. Food is great. I have been to other outback and this is the best one so far."}
{"text":"A little hard to find. Food cooked as asked and tasty. Service was great, even manager assisted one of our groups order request."}
{"text":"Zero stars for poor management. Picture this........Saturday night 530 pm 23 open tables and ten people checking in and we are told it will be a15 to 20 minute wait! May I repeat there were 23 open tables!!!!!! Totally mismanaged franchise. Manager response welcomed. Probably no next visit. We left and are enjoying another restaurant."}
{"text":"Having been here many times, and feeling that overall it was average for a chain steak restaurant, I must say I was disappointed tonight.  We began by calling ahead, after being told there was only a 15 minute wait time. Upon our arrival, we were told we would have an additional 15 mins. before we could be seated. Luckily it ended up only being 5 additional mins. As we are being taken to our seats, the hostess turns and says I'm sorry your seat has just been taken. We then go back to the waiting area, to be re-seated at the table that we were originally to be seated at. Here two elderly ladies were asked to move so we could sit (both embarrassing and unlike me).  The waiter was pleasant, checking in on us frequently. Meals arrived timely, presentation was satisfactory, and looked delicious. Unfortunately, my sons chicken was not cooked thoroughly. The waiter quickly apologized, and offered my son an alternative. Following was the manager, who apologized repeatedly, paid for our family's meal (minus the beers), and also offered my son an alternative to his meal.  The recovery alone earns them 3 stars! Originally I had only have 2 stars. Thank you to the waiter. & manager for such a generous and prompt response."}
{"text":"In town for work and dropped in for dinner . The food was late and cold came out at different times. Not impressed with this location"}
{"text":"My wife and I are upset at the call ahead policy. We called 30 min and they said we could be put on the list. Got there and they just put us on the bottom of the list like we had just arrived. Not cool, you have LOST my Business!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken tortilla soup as my appetizer which came out very quickly. The soup was very good however I could not spot the chicken in it. For my entree I ordered the ahi tuna sesame salad. The Tuna was great.   For an Australian themed restaurant the music selection was not to my liking. They played mostly current Pop music that was too loud."}
{"text":"Yikes. Had a horrible meal here 8/21/11. Ribs and chicken with fries. Nothing was appetizing. Chicken breast smaller than my palm, ribs were dried out and gummy, fries were limp and gross. Bad bad news. Beer was good. Service was passable. Management does those annoying take visits."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and have yet to have a bad experience.   My fussy group of 5, all from out of town and staying at the nearby Sheraton, didn't even faze the waiter. Even with 5 individual checks, and an additional check for drinks.  Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.   The food was good, and I heard the drinks were good as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food. I enjoy Outback. I love their steaks made to order with steamed broccoli. Their mixed bar drinks are lacking in alcohol and more fruity than potent that's why I stick to iced tea or soda. Beer selection is good and dessert selection is not disappointing."}
{"text":"My feelings on outback are mixed. They provide very reasonably priced steak which is often what I'm looking for. I don't want to grill at home and I don't want to spend as much as a quality steak house requires. I really want to like outback. The only issue is that I often get questionable meat. I know it won't be the best steak I've had but some times it has like veins or tendons or something in it (or something like that). Sometimes the steak just seems a little worse than the lower price tag would necessitate. Very good staff though!"}
{"text":"Completely underwhelming. Slow service, over-cooked burger with a cold piece of cheese on it, barely warm mashed potatoes. We could never eat here again and be fine. Outback used to be the place for delicious food and friendly service but this place seems uninterested from start to finish. You'll get a better burger at a sports bar."}
{"text":"I had the outback sirloin along with mash potatoes & Mac n cheese.. Everything was good but the Mac n cheese was amazing!!!! Good Service & great food!"}
{"text":"I eat here regularly. Staff is always very friendly, service is never lacking, and the food is consistently good. I would recommend this Outback to anyone."}
{"text":"This is strictly for how they operate their \"Call Ahead\" seating. Their food is usually impeccable. I will never understand their stupid call ahead, maintain two list, absurd process. I called ahead at 6:50 pm. Was told the wait was 40 min. Great as I would be there in 40 min so I had my name placed on the list. Got there at 7:30 and they couldn't find my name. So they put my name on the \"call ahead\" list and told about 30 min wait while they were on a 1 hour wait at this point (exactly why I called ahead).  Talked to the \"manager\" (really just the key server) and she said they did have my name on the \"call ahead\" list and my wait would be about 30 min. That the \"call ahead\" list just shortens your wait to about half the current wait. Really? And just how do they go about calculating this? My wife has worked for Outback for over 6 years and says that system is still as screwed up as when they first introduced it.  Here's a novel idea, when someone calls, just put their name on the list! If they're not there when called, skip them, just as if they showed up in person. Really not that hard and you don't have to maintain two separate lists forever trying to explain your logic in doing so to customers.  The truth is, Outback really doesn't care about this system. They're always on a wait so no big deal if customers don't like it and go home. It just reduces the wait time. So we left and went across the street to Gordon Biersch. That's another review."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to an Outback for a number of years, as our local location has lost favor since Texas Roadhouse (Yum!) came to town.  But we found ourselves here while in Henderson, NV on business.   The place was packed but we were seated right away for some unknown reason... it certainly wasn't our celebrity.  Our waitress was very nice, and attentive, despite the heavy customer load.  The owner was also buzzing around checking in with patrons, wanting to make sure everyone was being served well.  Don't know if he was actually the owner, or if he would do anything to help, but it was a nice touch.   Prices were higher than I expected, but everything is getting more expensive these days.  They are a bit higher than Texas Roadhouse though.   Everything we had was good; the steaks were prepared as ordered and we left satisfied, and perhaps a little overstuffed.  It was easily my best experience at an Outback Steakhouse, but it was a big bill for just two people."}
{"text":"Had the Victoria's filet 8 oz. It was delicious as always. The mashed potatoes were not very flavorful though. Could have used some garlic or something. I also got a side of snow crab with my order. The crab was alright. It seemed like it was overcooked and it was kinda dry."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer was cold!  Ask for Jessica as your server if she's not available ask for Justin."}
{"text":"We were seated at a table and waited 20 minutes before anyone came to the table. We ordered and 40 min later we got food. The server was friendly, food tasted good but not a place to come if you're in a hurry got here at 6:30 finished at 8"}
{"text":"Customer service was fantastic. Hostess was polite and entertaining. Waitress was on top of things and friendly. Usually love outback. But, Got food poisoning. Don't eat the prime ribeye."}
{"text":"In my opinion as a traveler who is on the road 200+ days a year it was tasteless, marginal, boring food. Had not been to Outback for 10 years for no special reason but I guess my last visit was not memorable Had a rib eye, companion had a sirloin and shrimp. Bread was cold when served, steaks were tasteless, they forgot the shrimp on the order, baked potato not quite done..a boring meal presentation Beer was cold and the butter was soft"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this Outback before, but won't go back.  I ordered a full rack of ribs.  I got the smallest set of ribs I've ever seen and asked if this was indeed a \"full\" rack.  Oh yes, you have 9 there - a half rack is 6.  What?  When did 1/2 (6) times two equal 9.  I only had six on the plate, so after a discussion with the manager, it was agreed I would only pay for the half order.  The fries were so salty, they were inedible.  Then my husband discovered, after eating part of his pork \"chop\" that it was resting on someone's receipt.  He thought the bite he took was a potato skin.  The manager's solution was to offer to buy a desert.  Really?  After eating a receipt?????  Our bill was $50.00.  If you go there, better check things out.  It was a BAD experience."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, dine in!! I must say their food and service exceeded my expectations. Much better than the other locations in Vegas and I was just passing by. Too bad it's a really far drive from my house. Thanks again for the outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Because the french onion soup at YardHouse did not satisfy me and I remembered that the french onion soup at Outback Steakhouse was pretty yummy, I asked my fiancee to take me there.  Initially, he thought I wanted steak so he suggest we go to the steakhouse at Green Valley Ranch.  I told him that Outback has the 4 course meal for $15, which is a steal!  Not really when you consider the quality of food served to you.  Both Earl and I opted to pay a supplementary charge of $8 to get the 6 oz Victoria Center Cut Filet.  It supposed to be tender, but guess what?  Mine had the sinue, which made it tough and chewy as hell.  I tried really hard to cut the sinue off, but ended up having Earl cut it  off for me.  C'mon now Outback...Can you really call it \"tender\" with that piece of crap it it?  I also paid the $1 upgrade to change the walkabout soup of the day to my french onion soup.  At least that was good.  Earl had the walkabout soup, which is lentil and sausage soup.  He commented that it's a good thing I didn't get that soup because it tastes like crap.  When it came time for dessert, there are only two choices to chose from, the cheesecake or the carrot cake.  We took that home and I did not enjoy the cheesecake.  What kind of cheesecake does not have a crust?  This crappy cheesecake at Outback Steakhouse.  WTF?  Seriously people.  Stick with the crust because this noncrust cheesecake is crap.  Now service...CRAPPY as well.  The server breath smells bad.  Every time he talks, I have to gasp for air in a different direction.  Additionally, he happened to left his drink tray on our table while tending to other guests.  WTF again.  After he took a table's order, gave another table their to go boxes, clean some plates off of another table, he then picked up that drink tray without saying one word to us.    The night's dinner experience was crappy, nonetheless, I am OUT and never come BACK."}
{"text":"Sadly not up to par at all.  After bad meal..mgr was kind enough to send gift card and invite us back.  Hoping issues had been addressed we took out of town guests and the table tallied much more than the gift card...but the food was an embarrassment..truly terrible  My mother ordered a grilled chivken breast on skewer w veggies as did I.  They brought a plate w 2 flat breasts both on one plate w nothing else. We asked what is this?  Thinking it must've been a mistake and server said oh sorry did you want two plates. ..I started laughing because it was so ridiculous!  The breast were not frilled right..they were dry..greasy and tasted lie they'd been cooked with something else on s flat fry surface...like something you'd expect from a Dennys.  The vegetable was a gigantic chunk sitting in water. Worse meal than last if you count raw seafood as better. My Brother and his guests dinners were also pretty bad.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We went to outback for dinner on Friday for dinner and were sorely disappointed! It took over 45 mins to get our food and mine was cold. They took it back and microwaved it and brought it back to me...shrimp should never be microwaved! It came back rubbery but I didn't complain. My husband's steak had no flavor and had to be replaced also. With all the trouble we had. You would expect at least 10% off but the manager offered am apology and that was it. On the plus side, our waitress, Samantha, was very sweet and stayed on top of our drinks and shrimp refills."}
{"text":"Thanks to Kelly we had a great time from the moment we stepped in the door! Food is great, service was perfect, and atmosphere was amazing! Great job Outback!"}
{"text":"This was my 4th time at this location. The water with lemon tasted like it was poured from and into dirty drinkware. There're was dust and cobwebs on the lighting over the table and on the window ledges. The server kept walking by and didn't acknowledge my table to see if there was anything else we needed(which we did). My friend took her napkin and slid it across the top of the back of our booth and of course, there was an excess amount of dust collected on it. The manager even came to our table but didn't acknowledge the dust coated napkin that was in front of his nose.   The previous time I visited this location there were 2 roaches, one was crawling on the floor by the bar area and the other on the wall by the entrance. It was also very dusty outside due to the building being opened during construction.   There were couple more issues which we addressed with management on the two previous occasions but a bit lengthy so I'll spare y'all the details. Just know that this isn't the cleanest location."}
{"text":"Service was fair, food was decent. But soon after dining at this location, later that evening, my stomach was in knots. Didn't sleep well and the next day I missed half a day at work!  All because I couldn't leave the bathroom. (I will leave out the details, but imagine the scene in Dumb&Dumber. The part with \"Harry\" in the bathroom, before his date with \"Mary\").  I had a sirloin and the coconut shrimp. I also had a friend tell me the same thing happened recently to her family. Coincidence, doubtful.."}
{"text":"Had a group of about 20 for a bday party. Called ahead a few hours in advance and on arrival only had to wait about 10 minutes (outback doesn't do reservations).  They had two servers taking? care of us and they were both amazing!  Thanks for taking such great care of us!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here for the last 7 years, every 3-4 months or so. The restaurant must be under new ownership and we won't be back again. In all honesty, my dinner was great, but my partner ordered the 8 oz. prime rib (his usual). What was delivered looked kind of like the meat patties you get on McDonalds 99cent burgers, only thinner. Even the waitress said she'd never seen one that thin. The waitress offered to get him another one but he declined and just asked her to take it away after about 3 bites.  Here's where it gets bad. The 'owner' came by and said 'I'm the owner, I can do anything I want'. Unfortunately, any admission of error or apology doesn't seem like anything he wants to do. He could have at least 'passed the cardboard thin prime rib off on a new chef', said 'I'm sorry' or 'our mistake'.  Such a shame.  We left as soon as possible. I had to leave the rest of my dinner uneaten; a nice 12oz prime rib and 1/2 lb of crab legs because I couldn't enjoy my dinner while he was sitting there miserable.  We won't be back to this Outback any time soon, and will be eating at a different one.  A simple apology would have done wonders that comping his 'dinner' didn't. We prefer to pay for value received and don't really appreciate comps in lieu of quality and integrity."}
{"text":"Great food, good service.  Probably the best Outback in Las Vegas for service and food quality.  Good place for families.  Definitely use call ahead seating during the busy times."}
{"text":"There's a 10 minute wait for a table at 1:45 in the afternoon, and maybe 10% of the tables are occupied. We ended up at the bar - and waited 10 more minutes. Sheesh."}
{"text":"I ll make this easy.. the bartender was great the salad was good the bread was softer and the potato was cold and small. Now the stake was great, the steak you could have pulled a part with a fork. wow i love it when you can do that . But the baked potato should be hot with ever thing melting a round it. All i got was a half cooked baby potato with cold butter. oh well maybe next ."}
{"text":"We got our seat right away, Brett was our waiter, he was right on us soon after we sat down.  I'm (trying) to make more smarter choices when dining out.  So it took me a bit longer.  So Instead of soda, or a adult beverage, it took me a while to choose water!  And I chose the Sesame  Salad with Salmon, and the onion soup.  Now I could have left out the onion soup, but ohhh well, at least it wasn't the blooming onions......Right?   OMG, everything was so good, I think this is going to be my new go to salad spot.  The manager, came over and checked on us.   I can't remember her name.  But that salad was so big, I couldn't eat it all.  And I think it was only 600 calories for all of that!  So if this is what eating healthy is about!  I'm on board with that.  Overall, a great experience with this location!  I will be back for another salad, even if it's to go."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I have always been an Outback Steakhouse fan! This is my 4th time coming here and I keep thinking my bad experience was just a one time thing, but it no longer is! And I want so bad for this Outback to do well, because it's close to uptown! I ate at the bar and the bar has a stale beer, dirty smell. Like things have not been cleaned properly. Everyone knows when you walk into a place what that smell is and this Outback had that smell! I had to ask for my spot to be wiped down because there was food and crumbs everywhere! In fact, Ive been sitting here for close to an hour and the bar spot next to me is disgusting. It had potatoes, old food all over the bar and hasn't been cleaned in an hour! Yuck!  Each time I have come here, my baked potato is undercooked! Same thing again tonite! Plus the bread isn't even warm enough for the butter to melt on it! Lastly, it is a Wednesday night and this place is empty? Maybe 4-5 tables occupied? I have never, ever been in an Outback that isn't packed, any night of the week! Sad, again because I'm a fan! Nothing worse than eating at the bar and having to hear 4-5 servers hanging around \"airing out their dirty laundry\" and having to hear all their complaints!  This Outback needs a total overhaul! Clean it up and improve the service! Outback was always known for their service! This one I don't feel the warmth! The staff is distant, don't really care and I feel it is \"just a job\" for them! That is a recipe for a failed restaurant! Sorry, I really want this Outback to do well, but I won't be back until they get much better!"}
{"text":"If you have any food allergies don't go there! Even though we were very specific, they still put butter on the vegetables and steak. Had to send it back! Service was slow and food was less than mediocre."}
{"text":"I enjoy outback. .. I think the steaks are good for the most part... veggies dont taste fresh, they may even use frozen chicken breast for the salads... I recently had a chicken Ceasar, the children was horrible,  tasted like chicken from a package I had gotten from Walmart. .. and it was a miserably small portion. And I got the walk about soyp which I love. .. I should have sent it back not only this time but a couple times before because it was not hot... more like. .warn.. please look into this"}
{"text":"Service was great. My steak was on point. My wife's however was not. She asked for well done and it came in med. My step dead as well asked for well and it was med. Mine was rare but I loved it. Over all service was great. Would give 5× but messed up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I realize they recently opened and that's the only reason for the second star.  We went there for a family members birthday. Called a day ahead for reservations at 6. Their reservation system isn't reservations. They just put on the waiting list early. So we showed up at 5:40 and checked in. Since we were listed for 6 they said our time started then and would be less than 25 minutes.   Well an hour and 20 minutes later we received our beverages at our table located in the bar area.  As for the food. My asparagus were burned and tasted like char. The filet was good but as for the steak combo one of us ordered well ridiculous. Australians would be embarrassed that this represented Australia. The steak was so small it more resembled a chicken strip.   It was a horrible experience and we won't bet back to any Outback Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Somewhere between \"meh\" and \"A-OK\" It is a typical Outback chain restaurant.  Nothing special or unique about this location.   The food is decent but nothing to write home about.  The plus side is that there are often coupons for anywhere from 10-20% off of your bill if you dine in.  This is usually the only time we dine in.   The last time we visited, it was around 9:00 on a Saturday night.  It was VERY loud.  I felt like I was at a crowded sports bar rather then a steak house.   The steak quality seems to have gone downhill.  I've gotten the Outback Special before and found it to be tender and tasty. The last time it was full of fat and not cooked properly.   Overall, about what you would expect from a chain location.  Nothing fantastic, but nothing too horrible either."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout here tonight and the service was great! We ordered a filet with sweet potato, wedge salad, wings and a piece of cheesecake. I didn't have to wait too long, they remembered everything in my bag, including extra sauces and that delicious bread. She even brought me a drink while I waited. The food was all pretty good. The cheesecake slice was really tiny for $5 so I would pass that up next time and the wings weren't my favorite, but I was happy overall with the food and more so the experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner since I was staying across the street.  I sat at the bar and the service was awesome!   I ordered the Salmon with a Baked Potato and I cannot complain it was killer!  Of course the warm bread loaf was good as well!  Keep up the great service and you will never have a complaint here!"}
{"text":"Would have given zero stars if possible.  We had a terrible meal tonight.  My son and I had burgers, the bottom buns were both rock hard, the burgers were rare and we ordered medium.  The Cheese was not there.  My wife's steak was rare, but she ordered medium rare.  The blooming onion was burnt on the bottom, raw in the middle, and breading was hit and miss.  The waiter said he'd bring bread. Then showed up 15 minutes later.  Had it not been for my grandson, who loves Outback, I would have walked out.  Worst burger I've ever tried to eat."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Gone from best steak and lobster to the worst.   Ordered the usual...didn't look or taste right. Long story short, the manager says we don't grill lobster anymore, we steam them. Also don't use Aussie seasoning anymore, just cover with Paprika.   If I wanted paprika I would go to Albertsons.   To add insult to injury, both my wife's and my steak were gristle. Was one of my favorite dishes at one of my favorite restaurants. Won't order again.   I guess the procurement department has taken over the menu."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Outback! And this location is one of the best! The staff is great and the food is always on the mark! It only took me one visit to Outback to know it has some of he best food and to become addicted! Also this location is only 5 mins from where we live!.."}
{"text":"Very bad experience . Order food and it was wrong and they took it back. By the time I got my food back my family was almost done. Manger Joel brought the food out and said if I needed anything come talk to him I needed him to tell the food was still wrong and fries on the plate tasted like salt. Never did speak to him after I had 2 staff try to get him. I guess I wasn't old enough or something else because he did help every elderly person. I would of loved not to pay for the meal I didn't eat."}
{"text":"David, Dylan, David, Dennis & Ray are awesome! In fact, everyone we have come in contact with has been so friendly! And the food is great, too!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite to eat, neither of us really hungry, but aware it may be some time before we get another chance. We sat at a table at the bar, because there was no wait. Our server was friendly enough at first, but that changed as soon as he surmised we weren't the Whales he had hoped for.   After he made his pitch on the top-line steak specials, my friend replied that we were actually big fans of their burgers. It was a nice comment, suggesting that he would have completely sold us on the steaks, if we had not already set our minds to the burgers instead. It was the kind of statement polite people use when they want to do something other than what you suggested.   He just stared at us with this look of disgust and said \"I think the burgers here are crap.\" In a mater of seconds, the waiter's demeanor turned completely in the other direction. All of a sudden, it was if he couldn't get away from our table fast enough. He coldly flew through our burger orders like he was auditioning for the role of Flo in Alice.  Some other guy actually delivered our food, but as he approached the table he proudly proclaimed \"Welcome to Burger King.\" If we didn't now any better, we would have concluded he was auditioning for the same role. He literally 'dropped' our burgers, then turned and walked away.   We dug into our burgers, still wondering if anyone was going to bring us some silverware and napkins - oh and some ketchup would be nice too. Not surprisingly, we had to stop yet another server to get the silverware and our ketchup got dropped off some time later. The ketchup hit the table with such force it almost spilled onto our fries for us.  My friend and I were so involved in our business discussion that night - it really should have taken no less than a naked cowgirl floatin' across the ceiling to get us to pay attention to anything else, but amazingly enough, the piss-poor service at this place got both of us dropping our jaws in disbelief.  Not only do I want to write this review, I want to call the corporate headquarters of Outback Steakhouse and suggest they fire the entire staff - right down to the management that allows that kind disgusting behavior to take place.  Hey Outback - you have lost me as a customer - forever!  Oh, and the burgers were crap."}
{"text":"I am fundamentally against eating at large-scale chain restaurants.  I prefer to go with the locally owned stuff.  Both of the times I've eaten at Outback, it was because I got to eat there for free.  That said, Outback is decent.  On my first visit, I had the Victoriana Filet (or whatever it's called) with broiled bleu cheese on top.  That was pretty good, considering I'm not much for steaks (but am one for melted cheese).  I think the boy had prime rib, which I heard no complaints about.   On my second visit, I had the \"Port Tilapia\" (or whatever it's called), which is smeared with some kind of creamy cajun sauce, and is accompanied by freshly steamed veggies.  OM NOM NOM!  Now that was seriously delicious.  The bonus being that, given the fish and vegetable aspect (and setting aside the cream sauciness), I didn't feel like such a fat bastard upon leaving.  One of these times, fellow diners insisted on eating one of their epically calorie-loaded \"Bloomin' Onions.\"  Admittedly, I was curious about trying this 'appetizer,' because I'd heard of its legendary calorie count.  \"I'll bet that tastes AWESOME!\" the Wisconsin Girl in me said.  Yeeeah, not so much.  It was a greasy, breaded onion that falls apart when you try to put some on your plate.  Yuck, blech, ptooey.  The service is on the scary side of friendly and helpful.  The humongous steak knives they give you for a small piece of bread really skeeve me out to the point of not wanting to use them.  The wine list was fairly unimpressive (and given their Aussie theme, I thought I'd be able to find better Aussie vino, but whatever).  Also, the hostesses tend to be skankily dressed teenage girls....what's up with that?"}
{"text":"It's just okay. We went for fathers day. Everyone was nice, but all of the food was pretty salty. Everything was a little slow and the waitress was really nice. I don't think we'll be going back. The quality of food seems to have deteriorated since I last went there."}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed dinning here, but this time I wanted to try something different, I had the tilapia with the crab topping, YUCK.. The crab was mushy and just had a funky taste to it, and I like crab, I scraped it Off and continued to eat the fish which was ok, I think next time I'll stick to the usual \"outback special\" and bake potato .. That's always good . The service was good and they did adjust our check for the crab , they're always good about that.."}
{"text":"We go to this outback quite often and can rarely find anything to complain about. Last nights steak was delicious and our server Tyler was friendly and quick. Great family place :)"}
{"text":"Went for father's day, even though it was quite busy our server, leslie, was fantastic. Prime rib sandwich was a melt in your mouth experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my favorite neighborhood Outback has closed.  This video is quite fitting, I believe:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjT9LDZ_D60"}
{"text":"We had great service and food from Jason. My sister and daughter thought their steaks were delicious. My son and I thought our Salmon was equally delicious. Good value for great food on the strip."}
{"text":"I like it here.  It's a nice date place, and even a good place to bring your family, hang out with friends, or you might even have a good \"power lunch/dinner\" with a business partner or client.  The restaurant is mostly well-kept up, the service is fairly consistent (good), and the steaks are better than average.  Not steakhouse quality, of course, but you are not paying money for that, either! Try the bone-in ribeye, 22 ounces of amazing.  Very satisfying meal for what it's worth, with excellent sides. Our favorites are the broccoli, potato soup, and baked sweet potato.  Great if you are on a diet.  You can order low-carb, and skip dessert.  Downside is if you come at a popular time, you may have to wait.  Avoid that by calling ahead to get on the \"priority\" list (no reservations), or go at an unusual time like we did: 5pm on a Friday night.  Parking is fairly easy, and it's a good area."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the bartenders to try keep us with drinks. The only thing keeping Outback from 5 stars is the bathrooms. They aren't maintained and they aren't really clean. Big bummer when they recently remodeled the joint."}
{"text":"I came here this past Valentine's day and did the Valentine's day deal. I went to a different location the year before and had a horrible experience so I was a little on the hesitant side to come here this year. We sat at the bar because I needed to go home to study so I didn't want to sit and wait for a table even though the wait time was only 45 minutes. The bartender was super nice and friendly and gave us great service all night.  Drinks came out super fast obviously and bread was right behind the drinks. The bloomin onion came out shortly after and was delicious. The batter was really crispy and wasn't saturated in oil. About halfway through the onion entrees came out.   I ordered my steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. For sides, I ordered the broccoli and upgraded to the mac and cheese. I highly recommend upgrading to the mac and cheese. They have the best mac and cheese. It is super creamy and very well seasoned. They use the spiral noodles so the noodles hold the cheese sauce more, which is awesome. It also comes with some crunchy bits of something on top that adds a nice texture. I was kind of in a hurry so I asked for the check and dessert as well as boxes to be brought out. That all came out pretty quickly. I choose the cheesecake with the raspberry syrup. They go lightly on the syrup which is nice since the syrup is kind of sweet. I would prefer fresh raspberries or strawberries, but the syrup still tasted good.   I will definitely come back to this location again. Service and food was great without them even knowing about the horrible experience I had the year before at a different location."}
{"text":"Goodness what a long dinner and not in a good way. My boyfriend and I went to dinner here because we had some gift cards from the holidays. We got seated in a booth which I was happy about and the waitress came pretty quickly to take our order so I though things were going to be super easy peasy for dinner.   They had a valentine's day special going on, which included the blooming onion, 2 entrees, 2 sides each, 2 side salads, and cheesecake for dessert for $42. We decided that was pretty good deal and ordered it as well as the valentine's day special drink, the love potion. This drink was super good. It was not too sweet and had a really good fruity flavor to it.   The drink came out almost immediately, so again I was thinking dinner service was going to be on point. The blooming onion came out shortly after with no salads so I thought those were coming out later before dinner. The blooming onion was good. The breading was crispy and very seasoned and the sauce that came with it helped balance out the seasoning. Without it, the blooming onion may be a little too salty, but who eats it without the sauce anyway? Once we finished the blooming onion we sat there for quite a bit of time before our waitress came over to see if we needed anything. I asked her if we could maybe have our side salads since dinner was talking a little long. She told me we had the option to pick between the 2 sides or the side salads. I told her no I'm pretty sure it's both. (I even check on the way out to make sure I was right, which I was I am never wrong when it comes to reading the menu.) She then continued on that I was wrong, so I decided not to argue with her. Then, I kid you not, we waited 30 minutes before our steaks came out.   The steaks weren't really charred, but to the point of burnt and thankfully still (mostly) medium rare in the middle. I personally like the taste of burnt, but I think I can say that most people do not like that. My boyfriend, for example, would be one of those people, but asking for a different steak would have possibly taken another 30 minutes to come out. For sides, we ordered the mashed potatoes, the baked sweet potato, and upgraded to the asparagus and mac and cheese. We obviously shared all of the sides. All the sides were decently good, with the mac and cheese being my favorite of the 4. I felt like the cheesiness was what I needed to help with the overall saltiness of the steak and asparagus. I have no comments about the side salad since I never received it. I can't imagine I would have had an critiques about it though.   When we were done eating, it took us another 30 minutes before we were able to sign our receipt slip and finally leave. We were literally sitting there waiting. We weren't talking, still eating, or making it seem like we wanted to be there for any longer than we needed to be. I don't know whose fault it was that dinner took so long... whether it was that the kitchen lost our ticket, messed up our order and had to redo it, or the waitress completely forgot to put our order in. I don't know but I could tell the waitress was feeling pretty pressed about how long we were waiting for food. She was very nice, but I wish she would have told us what was up. I also don't know why it took so long to run our gift card and credit card.   All I know is Outback Steakhouse owes me 2 side salads and at least an hour of each of our lives back. I was super not happy about this trip at all."}
{"text":"Outback has definitely recently stepped up the menu to stay competitive, and I have to say I'm impressed. This is my third visit since noticing these changes, and they are all for the better. I love the snack plates, they are delicious. Love most of the new menu items. The steak has improved,  and so has the seafood. This is no longer just the home of the bloomin' onion. You should definitely check it out. At this location specifically, the service is great. We had Nicole tonight and she rocked it. Was so refreshing to get exactly what we requested from someone who is also pleasant and witty. She definitely added to our dinner experience. So much so, that I'm typing this from our table while contemplating dessert.  P.S. Order the off-menu mac and cheese, which is very simple with velveeta and milk, and is freaking delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge Outback lovers.  I appreciate being able to get REAL food for a price that is not ridiculous.  This location is hit and miss.  We have had a handful of bad experiences here, usually with miscommunication with service.  Things like all food (apps, salad, main course) all arriving at once, orders being incorrect, or missing parts.  What I will say is the management is quick to hop on helping these situations in whatever way they can.  We have never asked for it but have received something free or a percentage taken off to help our troubles.  This is why we keep frequenting this location despite the problems."}
{"text":"We ended up trying this Outback that just opened at Concord Mills on a Friday night.  It has only been open a week- I was in between 3 and 4 stars but all issues (and there were a lot) were corrected.  We did call ahead and were told 25-30 min.  When we got there we still had to wait that long.  We asked to move tables after our first seating because my infant son was with us and they helped us with that.  Our server was clearly new to serving- and was nervous, and I think was a little behind.  We had managers and other random people back and forth from our table all night.  We honestly had an issue with everything- (wrong drink, wrong salad toppings, wrong side) with different people in our party (there was 4 of us), but like I said, they quickly corrected it.  We all ordered steaks- and they were all delicious.  Mine was cooked a perfect medium rare as I ordered.  I would want to come back after they work the kinks out.  Currently, it's (very) rough around the edges, with a ton of new staff, and there's a very chaotic atmosphere.  The actual restaurant is beautiful and has an awesome patio- excellent potential."}
{"text":"We came on family and our meat were very good. My T-bone steak was very tender. The waiter was friendly. Price is very correct. We will be back for a next dinner."}
{"text":"Service is always 4-5 stars but food quality and food prices barely a 3 star. Great place for a beer and good conversation. We will return and hope for an $11.99 lobster tail to taste like the price and be more than 3 small bites."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. We did a call ahead, and we had 9 of us. Our waiter was wonderful. I got a filet and some got other types of steaks and the lobster. Everything was cooked perfectly. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and important. I had not been here in a while. I recommend this to anyone. Just make sure you call ahead."}
{"text":"Just like any Outback, but  this one serves lunch (which I am told is rare for them)!  Decent food, excellent service, and hell, it was happy hour (2 for 1 domestic drafts) - w00t!  //end rant"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night Food great Service Great And Mandy the bar tender was excellent!!' She really had to hustle taking care of a full bar as well as service station She is Great !!!"}
{"text":"Our food was \"okay.\" We were in for lunch ordered some beers and lunch combos.  Beers came out and they were at least a few ounces short, first salads came out and once I got through the first few bites, the bottom of the bowl had enough dressing to make another salad.  Soup came out lukewarm. Our waiter seemed to be entirely focused in another world, short, and while not rude, not very welcoming either."}
{"text":"I always love Outback! Our waitress was Cindy, and she was absolutely wonderful! She was so sweet and put up witb my dad's drunken antics."}
{"text":"Bad experience, not coming back here again!  Went to celebrate my dad's birthday. We were told 15 to 20min. During this time the manager/owner came to bring us some menus to look at. After a while everyone was being seated, we still remain in unattended. After 40min I went to ask how long more. Was told again in 15min. So here we are wanting again, while a table of 8 has remain free for the past 30min and they didn't even thought of us to be seated there. Few big groups walked out and we continued to not even be notice. Over an hour now, still waiting. I went to see the hostess and complain to here that clearly there where several tables open. The manager came and started to tell us that our name wasn't on the list otherwise we would have been seated. I clearly gave them my name at the beginning and at the 2nd time I checked on the wait. At this point beyond frustrated. The manager then start to stay that we are next to be seated. Definitely not, remaining here any longer. Lucky for us we ended our night at a Mexican restaurant, better experience there...Happy Birthday Dad!"}
{"text":"This would have been a 2 Star review but the food was good and increased it to 3. We've been to this specific location a handful of times because we're local and live nearby. Normally on a Sat, just like all other restaurants, the wait is about 40-50mins long and that's what is expected but this review was based on a Sunday night. We arrived Sunday night around 7:40pm and when we walked in, there was about 4 people ahead of us and was told the wait was about 15 mins. We told the host this was a party of four adults and two kids so we needed two high chairs. Another party came in after us and was maybe a party of 5 and they were seated ahead of us! They were seated on the North end of the restaurant which had plenty of tables that would have fit 4 adults and 2 high chairs! Not only it took 45 mins to seat only 4 adults and two kids with only 4 people ahead of us on a slow Sunday night and seated a party as big as us ahead of us, but after 30 mins checking in they asked us about our high chair situations. They asked us like they didn't know! 5 more mins we would have walked out and they deserve 1 Star.   Finally being seated they seated us in a more busy area which was on the South side of the restaurant and we couldn't get the 2 high chairs we requested 45 mins ago on a slow Sunday night! Not only that, there was a free table that could have fit all of us but instead we were put in booth that forced us to only have one booster. This was a very disappointing experience before we even had a chance to order water.   The waiter was good, he actually was a lil slow on checking up on us but he did get my son a bowl of grapes a couple of times so that was greatly appreciated. I was already annoyed of the seating situation so considering that the waiter did a good job. Of course the food was good, three of us ordered three different steaks and all three were great so as I mentioned earlier the food bumped up my review to 3 Stars but I was ready to leave and give them 1 stars"}
{"text":"Coming from Wisconsin to Vegas for the very first time, we were very excited to stay at the Royal Casino and eat at The Outback Steakhouse. I have never been to an Australian restaurant before and was looking forward to a unique Las Vegas dining experience.   I don't know what I was expecting.  I thought that they might have Kangaroo & Crocodile steaks, but it turns out that Australian food is pretty much the same as American food, but it was still very exquisite.   We started with some sort of Australian onion thing made with a seasoning & orange sauce that probably came from some Australian herb or vegetable.  Very exquisite!  This was served with a brown bread & butter tray.  I've never seen this in America before and must be some type of traditional Australian delicacy bread.  For the main course I had some ribs that the menu said came from Down Under.  Likely from an expertly raised Australian hog.   It was exquisite.  My date had a cheeseburger.  She's just as not as adventurous an eater I guess and wasn't ready to try Australian cuisine.    Overall, I liked The Outback Steakhouse a lot and will come back the next time I'm in Las Vegas and staying at the Royal Casino."}
{"text":"Lets start by saying that this was our worst outback experience to date.Our waitress was cool but the food was of poor quality. Our \"bloomin\" onion was a greasy plate of almost burnt pieces of batter.We had trouble finding the onion! Steak was flavorless,and my salad had about a 1/4 teaspoon of dressing.DRY. The worst part was sitting there listening to a guy shouting \"ORDER\" every couple of minutes! Not an enjoyable time.We saw several complaints about the food from tables around us, so maybe this is just a location to avoid?"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I came in on a weekday around 230 and sat at the bar.  There was hardly anyone else there -employees outnumbered customers.  I ordered a drink and it arrived quickly but the bartender kept disappearing.   I had a question about the menu and had to wait over 10 minutes for her to come back.  I ordered and she brought my salad fairly quickly but then disappeared again.  She didn't come back until I was finished.  I don't blame the bartender because she seemed to be very busy with other work.  Management needs to schedule a bartender during the day that can actually tend to the bar customers and not have to be doing other duties in the kitchen.  Or, and here's a novel idea, managers need to help out instead of having the bartender do two or three other things.   I didn't see a manager while I was there."}
{"text":"Had the awesome privilege of attending a Yelp Elite event at this new Outback Steakhouse location this week and throughly enjoyed myself . The hosts treated our squad like royalty. We had the opportunity to sample some new menu items and some outback favorites . The manager was awesome, accommodating and enthusiastic about us being there . We received a detailed menu about what we were sampling which included a beer flight.  Lots of pics, lots of laughs. Joining Yelp was one of my best decisions in 2017."}
{"text":"Visited the Concord Mills location over the weekend and enjoyed my stay. This location is a newer one so there is a spacious feel to it and an updated decor. The server was very friendly and attentive. I tried the chicken and shrimp pasta here for the first time ( not a big steak person), and it was decent ; not too spicy or too greasy. The pasta entree was so large, I had plenty to take home. I enjoyed some favorites (blooming onion and medium chicken wings ) and a new seasonal Gingerbread cocktail that was cute and delicious .   I like that this restaurant is so close to the mall as well, makes getting something to eat after shopping convenient."}
{"text":"The cook this day was not cooking... Our order was not too out of whack but it sounded like there were a lot of screw ups all around us. We heard the manager tell one of the servers that she had enough of the cook today so she was basically going around calming customers back their eats. So I admire that about her. Poor people, though. I mean, I asked for my steak well done but came out medium... I still ate it cause I still enjoy medium steak, but it's just not what I wanted at that time. Not sure if we will revisit this location in the future."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Outback Steakhouse this evening. We arrived at 8 pm and it was absolutely packed. After taking our name and providing us with a buzzer, the hostess directed us to some nearby benches to wait. There were small tables with menus for us to peruse, there was upbeat country music playing, and a young female server was going around the waiting area with a tray full of fried shrimp for us to sample. The wait was very pleasant for a wait and we only ended up waiting 15 minutes or so. Once we were seated, our server came by almost immediately with fresh bread. She took our drink and appetizer order and had both out almost instantaneously. Everything was piping hot, flavorful, and delicious. Our server was so sweet and checked in at least every fifteen minutes. The manager, Michael, checked in too and made sure we were happy. Overall, we were very impressed with our meal and definitely found a new favorite restaurant. The only downside is it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Service was poor, food, just ok.  Took too long to order drinks, then food. Two in our party ordered steaks with salad. Had to ask for the salad after steaks arrived. Food took too long to come out. Another waitress brought our food out and didn't ask if we needed anything; just dropped the food and left. Had to ask the server for steak sauce and was never offered additional bread. By the time he brought the steak sauce, my steak was cold. Everything we had to ask for took like 15 min for the waiter to return. Another table next to us had problems with their food taking too long and another table was served a Blooming Onion that was cooked too long. The manager came over and offered us dessert which we declined but offered to comp us somehow. After having to ask for our check, noticing nothing was comp'd and growing tired of waiting on the server again we finally walked to the hostess and told them we wanted to pay. They said the server should have taken it, but we told them we got tired of waiting."}
{"text":"I get to go service on a regular basis. Food is good, not the best out of the outbacks I've visited but good nonetheless. The new broccoli with cheese it awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the surprise az location today for lunch. It started out to be a very pleasant luncheon, until meal was served. I had the porthouse porkchop it came on very smal plate with lots of grease drippings under the meat once I cut  into the meat the drippings went every where on my blouse.   I did tell the waitress and the lady who seats patrons, but seemed it was an oh well type of reaction.  Was not looking for a free meal just wanted some to speak with the cooks regarding what happened, so know one else would run into the same situation.  From the reactions that was not going to happen. No one bothered to get the manager.  I see Longhorn and Texas Roadhose restaurants in my future. Just be ware of the grease left on your plate at Outback."}
{"text":"Jesse, our server, was so friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and prepared to perfection. Andrew, the owner, and the assistant manager on duty both stopped by our table to check on us after hearing how horrible of an experience we had at another location (bad enough that we left without even a hello). I cannot thank the staff at this location enough for making our Saturday date night!"}
{"text":"The service gets worse and worse every time, 3rd strike for this location. So bad we left after waiting 15 minutes for anyone to even greet us. NEVER again!"}
{"text":"Ordinarily I give good reviews bc the restaurant and the servers deserve it. Unfortunately that is not the case for the meal I received this evening at Outback. Ordered a martini and evidently Charles forgot. Other patrons that showed up later than I received their drinks and left the area before he even started making mine. Awesome... Sarah was nice and had taken the order, passing it to Charles. I ordered a filet mignon medium, mashed potatoes,  and grilled asparagus. I got a well done steak that looked like shoe leather and tasted like a salt lick. The potatoes and asparagus were also quite salty. I firmly believe that if you have steaks on the menu and call yourself a steakhouse, you should be able to put out a good steak no matter how busy you are...pardon me for expecting better! I will NOT be going back. It is unfortunate... Didn't finish my wine and left w a tea as I was parched after this meal. So sad...  And I will tell all my friends and acquaintances as no one should have that experience."}
{"text":"Now where to start?   My mom and I came here on a Monday night and there wasn't a wait so we got seated really fast which was great but the table the hostess wanted to seat us in was wet. There was even the yellow sign on the floor saying careful wet. We had to request to be moved to another booth. So ok, nothing too serious. Our waiter came and we ordered our food. Now he was really nice and I have no complaints with him. My mom ordered tilapia that came with crab meat and mushrooms on top. The food came out and her tilapia was plain, nothing on top. So we told our waiter and he went back and told us they were cooking it up and he apologized. The crab meat came and it was cold and looked under cooked. When we told him this he took it back and got the manager for us. The manager was nice and listened to us without giving us an attitude and even offered us dessert on him.  Now while my steak came out just the way I asked I can't help but to wonder how one dish comes out perfectly while the other was far from it.   Now finally we got our check and somehow a $2.99 ice cold beverage was added while both my mom and I got water. Can you see our confusion?    Let's just say I highly doubt we'll be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Deveyn is the girl to definitely see when dining at this Outback.  She is very outgoing, personable and cares about her guests.  I have to been to many Outbacks, and I will continue to return to this Outback because of Deveyn.  I had a friend in town and Deveyn made our experience great!"}
{"text":"I love Outback but I do think that your service can vary from visit to visit and location to location.  My experiences at this location have been decent.  I will continue to frequent this location.  I recently tried their new menu out at an elite event and wanted to bring the folks here to try it out too.  Everyone loved the ribs! The new Siracha ribs are amazing! A nice combo of sweet and spicy. (With a whole lot of spicy.) Try not to fill up on the free bread before your food comes. My meal usually feeds me twice but that's partially because I go a little over board with the free bread.  I love their cheese fries but make sure you get them layered and with some ranch dressing on the side.  My favorite salad to get is the pecan blue cheese salad with the balsamic vinagarette. I've actually gotten it to go a few times just to eat for lunch the next day. Hmmm, what else can I say about Outback?  This location is great about correctly cooking your steak to order.  If you are stilly iffy about Outback, check them out on a Wednesday when you can get a choice of chicken on the Barbie or a sirloin, a side of fries, and a soda or small beer for $9.99.  It's a great price and a great way to have an inexpensive steak dinner without breaking the bank.  The only reason I didn't give this restaurant five stars is because I've been here twice and both times the service was lacking.  This could be because I had the same waiter both times or it could just be a fluke. Either way, I will be back!  Love me some Outback!"}
{"text":"I had a pharmaceutical dinner at this Outback Steakhouse location. The group was large and we had some issues, but the manager made up for it. I deal with the manager of this location reguarly and he has upper management skills written all over him. If it wasn't for him. This location would have gotten 3 stars in my books. The food is great, the servers are nice, and the prices are amazing. What else do you want at a restaurant? If you are going to come here and compare higher end steakhouses to Outback. That is not a fair comparison. Come here once, and you will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Don't come here! The new sign and paint looks great but that doesn't mean the food is. Got the Fosters Beer Fondue which was not all that bad. It was on the saltier side so if you like salt then you are good to go. Ordered a cheeseburger and added bacon, bacon was not present when the burger came. Ordered a NY Strip cooked medium, steak was over cooked and had more fat on a NY then I have ever seen. All of the food was room temperature, nothing was hot like it had just been cooked. The service wasn't bad but was not good either. Stop asking if I am \"still working on it\", I do not work on my food. I learned many years ago to not ask this."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided on take out tonight and Outback was our choice. We used the online ordering through their website. Blooming onion, 2 orders of babyback ribs, shrimp ceaser salad. Used their curbside service which was quick and easy and took the food home. Unfortunately, in stead of the blooming onion, we had Auhi tuna instead. So back to Outback I went. Talked to Marc the manager, who for my trouble removed the charge of the onion and gave me one for free, told me to keep the tuna and try it and gave me a coupon for another b-onion on my next visit.  Wasn't too happy I had to drive there two times in one evening, but was very happy the way the Marc and the staff handled my problem. I would/will eat there again."}
{"text":"About a year ago I went here and had an excellent steak and crab leg dinner.  The atmosphere was good and the waitress was excellent.  We went back recently for a mini celebration with our daughter and we were very disappointed.  The waiter was sort of preoccupied and unfriendly,  When I found out that crab legs were unavailable I was disappointed but understood why as they don't carry them year round.  They felt that I still needed to talk to the manager because of my disappointment.  I didn't but out he came anyway.  He was wearing yesterday's wrinkled shirt with what looked like food stains on it.  He also appeared very tired and thus unprofessional.   He apologized for not having the dish I wanted and told me when it would be available next.   The waiter could have done that.  They then spilled a drink over the back of my coat.  They got me a new drink, blah blah blah..... 2 of 5 stars for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"So my husband and I have gone to Outback on three different occasions. Each time we get the Sirloin Steak. We learned after the first couple of times that when we want it cooked Medium we need to say Medium Well. No matter what we say, the steak always seems to come out very bloody and more of what I would consider to be Medium Rare. We then have to go through the hassle of flagging our waiter down and asking them to put it back on the grill. We then have a 50/50 chance of it coming out Well Done or Medium Well. For a restaurant that considers themselves to be a 'steakhouse' I don't believe we should have to go through this hassle every time. We have never had a hassle at any other restaurant so I don't think our expectations are off. Its just very disappointing. I would just caution anyone who visits them that if you're particular in how a steakhouse prepares your steak, be ready for the rigmarole. As far as their other foods, we love them! The potatoes are awesome as well as the Onion Petals and their wallaby drink. Rating poor as their main menu should be the steak and I have not been happy each time."}
{"text":"this was a bad night for them. both my husband's and my meal was completely screwed up. he ordered a steak med rare and it came out three diff temps not sure how but it was rare on one end well in the middle and med at the other end.  I ordered a filet med well just to receive a rare steak.. sent it back just for more rare to return...lol also my loaded potato... not so loaded! wont go back ever"}
{"text":"This location is always busy . Service is always top notch . Food prepared very well. I recommend this location . Very consistent and very happy with the service and food ."}
{"text":"I seem to be on a chain kick today,  although their menu is limited and I can only seem to find one menu item that I return to, the Alice Springs chicken, they offer curbside togo, the food is usually ready within 15 minutes of calling or ordering online, and they've yet to mess up an order. avoid the shrimp, they can be a bit veiny."}
{"text":"The worst experience we have ever had!  I will never and I mean never go to Outback Again Matie!  They ruined our 29th wedding anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Went on Veteran's day... was a bit dissapointed that our hostess did not give us the view of the strip considering nobody was in there but understood that the bar tender needed some love too and was glad he served us cause he was most attentive... the food was fantastic here for lunch and affordable for some beef which I desperately needed being married to my veggie hubby recently... LOL.. go up the Coke bottle to a little bit of beef heaven!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this outback location and I definitely be returning! Not only was the food fantastic, our waiter Cameron was awesome! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I always have a decent meal and experience when I come to this Outback location. I either do dine in or pick up. I will be honest some of my past servers need to learn how to communicate better with people but I am more there for the food.   The grilled shrimp is so good. You can get it as an appetizer or get a smaller portion with your steak. I still call it the outback special but the sirloin is very good. I sometime order that or the Salmon. Yes I order fish at a steak restaurant. Their Salmon is very good and every time I have ordered it, it has been cooked correctly.   Outback is a nice family restaurant where everyone is welcomed. You can have large groups or just 2 people. It's nice to order a nice meal and not be breaking the bank. The take out service is very good. The food still tastes the same. You can order online which is awesome. Outback's website is very customer friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted to post a review for these guys. I was there last week. Our server was great. We had some issues with the food but the GM came and spoke with us. He did everything in his power to correct the problems. I will be back because of the effort of management to make our experience positive. Thank you for the attention to detail and willingness to ensure your patrons have a positive experience"}
{"text":"Outback has a check in offer for a free upgrade of the Outback Sirloin. I hit up this check in offer. When my bill game I was charged the original price of my upgrade. I should have been charged for the small steak. This was not being honest and my server acted liked nothing was wrong.    My  potato soup was not very good. It was not creamy and runny. It was a bowl of chopped up potatoes. I love this soup so I was disappointed.    The steak was great and of course I loved the bread. I know I will be back but servers need to be honest and not try to play greedy just to get a bigger tip. I would have still tipped him well but that changed because of dishonesty."}
{"text":"Hostess was rude and seemed annoyed she had to do her job. Waitress was good. Food was good. The hostess is everyone's first impression so that is why Outback gets a 3 and not a 5."}
{"text":"We were seated in the bar with our 2 kids because we asked for a booth.  It took forever to be waited on.  We arsed a bloomin onion which wasn't great and asked for ketchup and bread at that time. At other locations we've been to,  you don't have to ask for the bread.  A longggggg time later she brought the bread,  no ketchup. I ordered tenderloin medallions without the vegetables ( med to med-well). I normally order well-done,  but thought I'd try something different.  It came out barely warm and almost bloody,  with peppers (which I can't stand) and onions. We were there entirely too long and weren't offered any compensation for the terrible meat."}
{"text":"OMG, somebody slap me for trusting this place to hook me up for dinner with the takeaway option since I am house-sitting a mile away and there is NO food in this house.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad which is supposed to go a little something like this, \"Sesame Salad* Grilled Chicken, Ahi Tuna or Salmon, mixed greens, red peppers, chopped cilantro, sliced almonds and sesame seeds tossed in sesame vinaigrette.\"  Well, I got bagged mixed greens..you know the type, romaine with a few strings of dried out carrot and red cabbage.  There were no peppers, no cilantro and FINALLY they gave me zero almonds or sesame seeds.  Are you kidding me? Oh, it gets better, I didn't even get any dressing!!!  I also ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms...inedible.  just mush with no \"rooms.\"  So I'm starving, I'm out thirty bucks and I hate myself."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a while, and I must say they didn't get any better with time.  COLD food, flat beer, and long wait times. 10 minutes for a beer when your sitting next to the bar is crazy!  My wife ordered coffee,and you guessed it COLD!!!  The server was good, but that's about it."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY slow service.  Waitress didn't come back to check on us (we were a party of 8).  Majority only got water so this should be a no brainer.  Food was good, but again management need to light fire under the service teams ass.  Terrible service.  I suspect that is the reason for the previous low ratings.  Perhaps this location is a franchise that can't get their shit together, not sure.  If I'm in the area again  I would venture to one of the many other restaurant options in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered our meal for take-out. My daughter gave me a gift card for my 50th birthday. My husband and I both ordered prime rib dinners, one with smashed potatoes and the other with a baked potato. We also had a nice, crispy green salad with aus jus on the side. My husband went to the location on Mayo Blvd and picked up the meals. The meals were fresh and hot when we opened them at home. The prime rib was cooked as we specified and was tender and juicy. The potatoes were hot and tasty. We enjoyed our meal. Everything was prepared with care. It was our first time ordering food from this location. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"I have a child and I'm not about to subject other diners to her tantrums so I ordered a meal to-go. I show up 25 minutes later and it was not ready. I love outback so I'm perfectly ok with waiting. The person that walked in after me and placed her order there got her food before me. After 25 minutes of waiting the stupid emo kid gives me a bag. I point out that my name is not April and he then apologizes and gives me a bag that had been sitting there for 10 minutes.... I'm sorry but if I did that I would have said how sorry I was and offered something to make up for it- like a coupon or something but the kid just turned around and left. Maybe the dine in part is better but because of this experience I'll never go to this outback again."}
{"text":"Someone gave us some gift cards to the outback and we decided to try it. Hadn't been in years. We had the prime rib and filet and they were both awesome. Not sure why we hadn't gone sooner! Great service!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you are so hungover at 6pm from the previous day in Vegas that you just need some cheesy fries and 6 pitchers of water. Outback is clearly the place to go for just that. After we were seated, we waited about 10 minutes without anyone coming over. A waiter from another section saw us looking hangry (hungry angry) and came over to see if we had been helped. He apologized profusely and took our order immediately. Our own waitress came by and apologized and ensured us she'd be helping us. The manager then came over without us requesting, apologized again, and told us he would comp the entire meal and to be sure to order dessert. All 3 of them checked on us frequently even though they were crazy busy. We were so impressed with the way they handled their service issues!!"}
{"text":"I went to both locations on the Strip.  The first one was by the M & M factory - ugh do not go in there!  I usually get good service but not this time.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi...why was my fish raw inside??  Gross!  The server (I cannot remember her name) was pleasant but she was slow.  We waited for 20 minutes or so for our drinks...then they charged us almost $10 for some lemonade!!  The bread was good...you should never go wrong there...but her service was crap.  My Mom ordered the soup; the server said it was two cups...no way possible  and they don't even serve it in a bread bowl....the one positive is the mgr comp'd the meal...but that didn't stop me from being hungry....she said that the cook wanted to eagerly serve us....with raw fish??!!  really??!!  The second location I went to was across from Caesar's palace...our server Kat...major improvement from the other spot. She was courteous and a good server.  She tended to our needs so we didn't have to ask for anything which was nice.I would come back to this location VS the other one...."}
{"text":"I don't recomendable the first time to be there Saturday and I didn't like the wait they told me to waiting is one hour and it wast more then that and they take the call instead the people waiting there and they have a few tables empty in there they get mad when you ask them how much more to have to wait there? That's why we left from there I never go back there again I don't recommend to any of my friends these happen in the one in Westlake"}
{"text":"I can only surmise that Outback Steakhouse's ubiquity in America stems from the fact that the average person is either too lazy or too ignorant to realize that a good NY Strip can be prepared for half the price and in half the time.   I'm quite certain that at no point did salt, or his feisty brother pepper, touch my steak. I'm absolutely positive that the 100% grass-fed steak I bought at the local farmer's market didn't have a massive piece of gristle in it, unlike the one I consumed at Outback.   Even the Caesar salad was as dry as the Sahara. When the best thing on a $20 plate of food is the \"Aussie fries,\" which were crispy, you have a world of problems.   My only solace was the fact that tonight's meal will forever be a black mark on someone else's bank statement."}
{"text":"Love their salads....  Wedge w/Roquefort dressing. The rib eye ~ seared (was perfectly cooked), salmon (catch of the day)was excellent, and kids menu, medallions of beef, was very good too. Ordered the onion blossom and spicy wings for our family as appetizers. We were a large group, party of 19, and the servers did not make any mistakes. How about that?"}
{"text":"Outback?  Ok.  I had the Outback burger with fries. It was a good size..nice flavor and pretty juicy. My boyfriend had grilled chicken with veggies and a side of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were bomb..way better than the regular fries. They glazed them with some kind of honey sauce. Delicioso! The only downside was it was a little chilly in there. Also, it seems like their menu got smaller and portions too.  My boyfriend was still hungry after his meal. Oh yeah, the server kind of messed up our order. (Can't win 'em all) So all-in-all, on this trip I'd give it 3.5 stars.(come on yelp, no half stars?)"}
{"text":"My compliments to Bartender/Waiteras Helena and Dave the Manager. I have eaten at this location several times. The service and food has always been excellent. Dave the manager goes way out of his way to make sure you have a great experience. I haven't seen that kind of .. quality and service in a long time. They make the best Pork chops I have ever eaten. Thanks again for an excellent meal"}
{"text":"I watched another commercial about how big and juicy the steaks are at OUTBACK. Wellllll , I just got paid and wanted to take them up on their offer. I could go for a nice fat steak.( sorry heart ) I arrived at this clean & very taken care of place in the middle of Upper St. Clair.  I was greeted and seated very quickly. ( Thank You for that cause I'm Hungry) Waitress ( TESS ) was unbelievably busy waiting on several tables at a time , might I add , with speed & efficiency that I have not seem in a long time. I ordered the 18oz. Sirloin medium. French onion soup & baked potato. not to mention the 22oz. Samuel Adams winter. Ya know , sometimes , you just gotta go for it ! And I did.  I can't give this experience a better review. Well , except the HORRIBLE dinner music choice. I'm sorry , but RAP music does NOT belong in a family place in my humble opinion. WAY to loud and very annoying. The Food & service were top notch for sure. but please ,,,,, nice quiet jazz ? classical ? maybe some  R&B , or maybe no music at all might have been best.  I'll be back. You'll recognize me with the earplugs in. LOL"}
{"text":"Loved the cheese fries. Not bad for me considering I've never been to other outback locations. Food takes a while to arrive. Sirloin was dry and wasn't cooked the way I asked...rice wasn't too good. (Me being Hispanic like my rice to be perfect) The coconut shrimp were really good."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time we have been to the Outback on craig road and the smell inside is getting terrible."}
{"text":"I took my husband to this Outback location last night for his birthday, and it was unfortunately a really disappointing experience. For starters, we seemed to have four servers who did not communicate with each other. It was bizarre! We had 4 different people ask for our drink order, 3 of them came back to ask about appetizers etc. I appreciate that they were asking us, but it got to be a little redundant and annoying as we were trying to talk and got interrupted every 2 minutes with the same questions. Next, when we very first sat down, I told the first server that it was my husband's birthday while he was in the restroom, hoping that someone would at least tell him happy birthday! Not a word the entire meal. Third, my meal came out extremely burned. Not overcooked, burned to the point that it tasted burned and inedible. I sent it back and it took forever to replace. My husband was 90% done with his meal by the time I got mine! A female manager did come to bring the new plate and said she'd be back in a few minutes to make sure it was ok this time. She never returned. Such a letdown for a birthday meal!"}
{"text":"Anthony was 5 STARS!! He is pleasant, efficient and polished. The restaurant was packed, with guests waiting for dinner. The entire evening was exceptional. From the wait on the patio, where we met a very nice couple, then brought a sample of an appetizer.. To the exceptional service Anthony (our server) gave.  Good meal per usual..... So kudos to the kitchen staff!!"}
{"text":"Brought my family in that we're visiting from California. Told us 5 minutes before serving entree that they ran out of prime rib, so I ordered a ribeye...we all got ONLY our meat; which was cold. They took the meat and then we just got potatoes. So then a slab of prime rib comes out; well done but the mgr insists it is pink inside...well done. What a sh*t show. I will NEVER go back nor recommend it."}
{"text":"I wish i could give zero stars.  Service at this location is pitiful. The manager all the way to the hostess have ZERO understanding of how to set expectations and run a restaurant.  Call ahead? Hah!!  Called ahead at 6:10; arrived at 6:25; told we would sit by 6:45. At 7:20, we were told we should probably pray but we were next. At 7:30, a different party of 9 was seated ahead of us. The hostess said, \"Oh, I don't know what happened.\"  The managers response was to tell us again, we were next. Somehow, I doubt it.   It is now 7:51, and we still have not been seated!"}
{"text":"We come here for lunch almost weekly, because the food is good. Unfortunately today we walk in to a restaurant with 5 seated tables and we are told if our large group doesn't squeeze into a both we have to wait.  I think this girl has lost my future business."}
{"text":"First time at an outback restaurant. Food was good. The flaming onion or somethings rather was huge, I helped eat it but I was almost full by the time the entree came to the table. Our waitress was nice but she seemed off of it (somewhat flustered) during our dining. It was a very busy Sunday that we went there though, so I don't blame her. Overall it was a nice luncheon."}
{"text":"My cousin and I went last night because we saw the commercial for the steak and crab legs for $15.99. We are from Boston and were unsure of the seafood in AZ but decided to try it anyway. The crab legs were dry and hard. I tried to eat them but just couldn't. The waitress was nice and polite. She removed the crab from our bill and offered a free dessert, which I politely refused because my stomach was turning.   We got to the restaurant before 8pm and it closes at 9:30pm. It was almost empty and we were seated directly behind the hostess station. We were talking and laughing between ourselves when I heard the hostess talking to the bartender about how we were from Boston. I don't know why she felt the need to relay that info but I was a little insulted that she was talking about us. We tipped the waitress generously because it wasn't her fault that the crab was inedible.   At 9:10pm, we went to use the restroom before we left. We were washing our hands before actually entering the stall because of the finger foods that we had eaten and before we could even use the restroom, the lights went out and it was complete darkness. My cousin started to panic and we were searching for the exit with our hands. When we got out of the restroom, the bus boy was laughing and the bar tender was looking down at his phone, trying not to laugh. I'm pretty sure that the lights were turned off purposely. My car was parked directly in front of the exit and when we got into my car, most of the staff were staring out at us. It felt like we were being punished for returning the food.   I've never had such a rude, passively aggressive, unprofessional experience at any restaurant in my entire life. I will NEVER return to ANY Outback location EVER again!!!!  I literally got sick when I got home and was truly disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"So I recently went back to this establishment about a week ago for my Mother's birthday. My rating hasn't changed, but I wish I could rate it ten stars!  IT WAS SO GOOD! We could tell that they underwent a management change and oh man, it was a great change!  The food came out searing hot, our server was attentive and well-mannered (and also amusing!) Unlike the previous time we were here, the portions weren't crazy-out-of-control and everything was just right!  Honestly it'll be hard to top the experience we had, but if they continue heading in the right direction then they can definitely top it!  Sidenote: Get the salted caramel cookie. Do yourself a favor and get it-- don't even question it, JUST GET IT :D"}
{"text":"The food is always good at Outback in the restaurant, but tonight I made the mistake of ordering to go. My order is simple. blue cheese chopped salad,8oz signature steak,and honey brown sugar  sweet potato. So first I parked in front not noticing the side door. As the girl led the way through the restaurant I almost slipped near the take out because the floor was slick with grease,you could actually see it. Fine, it happens. I get my food and head home. Open it up and become highly disappointed at the low quality of food I was served.  I got there within the prescribed 30 mins and my food was cold, I had to peel my own sweet potato and it had rot spots on it that had to be removed. The amount of butter and brown sugar I received was so tiny I had to add my own. The salad I also had to add the vinaigrette to and shake it up to coat it. I order a medium steak and got a well done. I was just very disappointed in their to go department."}
{"text":"My chicken did go back, manager came over and said yeah it looked pretty bad. I'll take it off the bill. I refused anything else. I'm done with Outback. My hubby's potatoes came out nuked. Really outback really!! He asked for them warmed not nuked!! Now I have to find dinner someplace. Can't wait for new places to open!!!! Wish I could do minus stars. Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah Outback, you suck!   I will not return, the food is good(for a chain) but not anything to drive more than a mile outside of my way to goto.   The new ordering system of me having to order an appetizer or desert through a touch screen! Give me a break you are a full service restaurant charging more than a lot of others. This isn't McDonalds but now is to me.   Outback you really need to rethink this! I also was told by my waiter tonight that a lot of people had quit over it, but he is happy as he is getting a bunch of hours. I think that a waiter expecting a tip where I order or pay at a station is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I am late with this post. I really like Outback, to hang with my family. We just hot appetizers this time. Service was a little slow, but food came out hot, waitress Makayla was nice, friendly. I will go back."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to Outback a few years ago. This place has really gone downhill. I came here for lunch & I didn't like anything I ordered. The bloomin onion was over cooked & tasted like it was sitting out for an hour before it was served to my table, my steak was completely over cooked, & the side of mac & cheese was over seasoned with pepper. It wasn't even edible. Absolutely horrible. The food was expensive for the portion & the quality that you get too. Such a waste coming here!"}
{"text":"I went there wens night with my girl I had the ribs they were dried up not soft and the potato was cold and under cooked my girl got a awful cooked  piece of steak that was tough and dried up.The salad was good.they changed since I was a regular there"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese burger, they forgot the cheese and brought it out on a side plate and we still had to pay for the cheese! Food was just ok, restaurant is going down hill."}
{"text":"Michelle is by far the best server ever! I enjoy having the Outback Special. To me it's the best value out there when it comes to eating. This location is new with great staff and a manager that interacts with all of the guests. Beware, check in online or you can expect a lengthy wait. Happy hour at the bar until 6pm."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Outbacks before. It was, until now, decent, nothing special but nothing to ever complain about.    I took my kids as a treat. They are finally old enough to start appreciating steaks.  So my 14 year old orders a New York strip medium I order my filet medium rare.   When we get our steaks mine is rare and hers is medium rare. She didn't want to eat hers, it was bleeding all over her plate. The waitress even asked her when she ordered \"you know medium rare means pretty pink in the middle\" Which, she's had steaks before. I've ordered steak often as well, I always order the same and I know what to expect.  I don't mind a rare filet, so I didn't complain (I hate sending food back) but I did complain about my daughters because she wouldnt have eaten hers AT ALL.  So the waitress took the plate and the manager brought it back, it didnt look bloody and my daughter was sitting across from me so I wasnt close enough to see, I think she ate another 2 or 3 small bites and when I asked for a a to-go box I realized just how VERY well done her steak was, so rather than a bit more cooked when sent back, it had been completely ruined.  I was pretty pissed but if they had JUST taken it off the check I would have been ok.  Then the manager came back over after I talked to the waitress.... She proceeded to explain to me how the standards of Outbacks \"medium rare\" and \"medium\" were VERY different from ANY other restaurant and that it should have been explained to me when we ordered.   If its different than EVERY where else, than its not what anyone would expect.... This must happen often. Thankfully I don't mind rare, but why ruin my daughters meal and basically blame me for not knowing your very own special way of doing things.  Then you patronized me.  This is why I choose to write this review. I don't EVER like to be talked down to and I always am very respectful to the wait staff, so to be spoken to like that... Even with them taking my daughters meal off the check, I won't be returning. That's not what I pay a extra to eat out for.  My waitress was a doll though, VERY attentive, very sweet and understanding and I over tipped her (including tipping for what I would have paid for my daughters meal.)  EDIT: I forgot.... We also ordered cheese cake pops. They tasted like stale gross (left uncovered) refrigerator. I'd have complained about the level of disgust I had with them while the manager was at my table but..... we took them to go and had ordered them before I realized my daughters steak was ruined."}
{"text":"Tonight I had a great dinner with my husband. Tori did a great job taking care of us in the lounge area. The strawberry peach sangria was delicious, sweet and great flavor, so good I drank 3 :). My hunny had ice cold bud light. I had the sirloin (mw) and grilled shrimp(4) with a loaded potato and fresh broccoli. it was very filling. My husband had the build your own steak with the sirloin (mw) with the seasonings but cooked on the grill which he thought was a little on thw dry side. He had the aussie fries as his side but thought they were soggy and bland, he preffers large steak fries. His dinner presentation was on the boring side, not very impressing but his dinner salad that he started with was fantastic. It was the perfect salad for my husband... Lettuce, cheese, croutons, bacon and ranch only. It was crisp and delicious. We will definitly be back to visit Tori, thanks for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed that I'm having to write this... Outback has been a favorite forever. But this location is bad, and poorly managed. I've gotten curbside takeaway a couple times now and the food is always cold and tastes old. They give you bread in the to-go bag but don't even attempt to heat it up for you. The ribeye melt is a total waste of money.. it's a tiny little sandwich better served as a snack for a hobbit. And it's $13. There's a million other places I'll be eating from now on. Boooooo!"}
{"text":"This was the first time going to this Outback. It was very nice when I walked in, the new design was very cool. The staff at the door were all very friendly. Even though the place had a lot of guest, we only waited 5 minutes to be seated.   Once we were seated, we started looking over the new menu, but it didn't take long to decide what we wanted. Our server was also very friendly and helpful. We ordered the 3 sampler for an appetizers. It has cheese fries, blooming onion petals, and fried Mac n cheese balls. They were all very good.   For the main entree, I ordered the steak and shrimp. Both were cooked perfectly to my liking. Normally when I ask for a medium steak, I get it everything but. However, my steak was a perfect medium. Overall I had a decent meal and I would come back.   I did notice the table in front and behind us had some kinds of issues with their meal and one table even waited a long time for their food to come out. We had no such issues. Our waiter was very attentive and always checked in on us and wanted us to leave happy."}
{"text":"Very typical outback experience.  Walk in to a 40 min wait. Not too bad.   We grabbed a drink at the bar and waited for a table. Drinks were well make and I don't think too expensive.   Place looked clean and well kept up.  We stalked a little at table and were sitting within 15 min.   Waiter was very good. Gave us enough attention but never hovered.   Ordered the bloomin onion a staple. Very disappointed in it. Totally greasy and lacked flavor.   Steaks were done very nicely.  Well cooked medium Bone in ribeye. Excellent flavor and I was very happy.   Also got the cheesesteak. Was very surprised at how good it was.   Excellent overall experience"}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes for an online order for a manager to bring it out and be argumentative with me. Zero sympathy. No one talked to me during the whole wait time. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"It's a place to go for a filling and quick dinner during the week.  Went there last week Thursday, the place was not busy so we got a booth right away.  Atmosphere is laid back, clean restaurant, staff was attentive and all tables were bussed within 5 minutes of patrons leaving - great job!  Ordered the 11oz sirlion steak and the combo plate of filet mignon and shrimp scampi.  Sirlion Steak was ordered medium and it came to the table perfectly medium (good job!).  The Combo meal was a bit disappointing, menu and server should have explained what lacked when plate showed up: there were 2-3 slices of filet and 3-4 scampi pieces.  Luckily, we were not all that hungry and so the serving was a-ok!  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"There are far better steak options on the strip.  You're probably coming here because you want something familiar or someone else suggested it.  We went in June 2015.  Waiter was a good enough guy, service was decent.  I ordered the cobb salad which listed \"mixed greens\" and I got iceberg lettuce.  Should've known better.  Probably the least exciting salad I've had in a long time.  I realize this isn't their speciality, but you know... it's not hard to make a salad appealing, especially if they followed their own directions and used \"mixed greens\" instead of iceberg.  I'm not one to complain for free food, so I ate my salad so my coworkers wouldn't have their meal disrupted.  They all seemed to enjoy it more than I did.  Do yourself a favor and go try out Gordon Ramsay's Steak over at Paris.  Much better presentation, food that is just so much better in every way, much classier, but unfortunately it will be a lot more expensive.  Even if you don't like Ramsay's tv shows, he is a very wealthy and well known chef for reasons beyond his personality."}
{"text":"We arrived on Saturday night with a large party, with a call-ahead reservation. Of course the place was hopping but we were assured our table was nearly ready. As it turned out, the occupants of the table had finished their meal, paid their bill and were sitting and visiting, and visiting, and visiting - for an hour!  David, the manager was very aware of the situation. Because of the size of our party another table coming open soon was not about to happen. When our table finally opened we were treated to complimentary appetizers and desserts. Our servers were quick with excellent service and our meals were delicious!  Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Warning:  All Outbacks are NOT the same.   That being said, this location could have been on another planet.   First off, dirty silverware.  Granted it could have been rolled into the napkin wet but it looked filthy.   The Caesar salad had so much dressing it literally choked you and I grabbed for water.  The plus, it was served cold.  I like a cold salad.  Too bad I couldn't finish it.    The NY steak was requested medium.  It came out cold center, raw, and it was cooked on a flat top.  They didn't bother to season it with their trademark seasoning so it was tasteless. That went unfinished too.    The two stars represents the restaurant and food.  The server was five stars.  He really should be working in a first class restaurant.  Not this place.   My tip represented his efforts.  Thanks.   Sorry I won't be back.  Perhaps the place next door."}
{"text":"I went there with my two friends and I had a great experience! Everything we ordered was cooked to the right temperature and tasted great. Our server Justina was more than helpful on the menu and got all our food out in a timely manner. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We get take out from here about twice a month. Overall, good food, but take out routinely takes longer than they estimate. Also, items are forgotten so check your order before you pull away."}
{"text":"I usually get the sirloin,  but the fish dishes aren't bad either.  Steak is always nicely cooked,  along with the delicious side dishes.  Desserts are delicious, save some room for them. The tally nice thing is that they are consistent!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day because all the restaurants near the Sands Expo were super crowded. It's on the smaller side and upstairs. I got the shrimp appetizer and it had grilled shrimp and coconut shrimp. I also got a side of the steamed veggies. The shrimp was pretty good and not too heavy. The veggies were soft and flavorful--I could taste the butter! Overall, a fine lunch with good service. Go here if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Took long for food long for drinks long for the check. On top of that our classy waitress jazzy thought that it was ok to take our $100 on $75 not bring any change and assume a $25 tip for herself. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service. We made a reservation for 7pm and were seated immediately. Coconut Shrimp appetizer was good. It was extra crunchy and the sauce for it was sweet and a little tangy. I ordered the 14oz New York Strip with marsala. The flavor was great. I wish it had a little more sauce. Shouldn't have ordered appetizer because was too full!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had. We were not seated for 15min wile only 5 tables were taken with 35 open. After being seated another 20 went by before i went to the bare to get a drink. After talking to rude staff we finaly got water after 45 min of being there. After that had to send back food because it was cold to the touch. I would fire my employees if they ever treated someone like that"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Outback Steakhouse in a very long time, but since my grandma invited me, I thought I was going to a great experience. Unfortunately, it was very loud when we got inside, and we rather had to wait 45 minutes until our food came out to be served. When I saw the prices for the food, I thought, this is ridiculous? And what more is you get a small serving for a cruddy meal. I could feed a family of 6 for what i paid for."}
{"text":"We went for the new All you can eat shrimp - what a disappointment it was.  We were a party of three at around 4 pm on a weekday.  The steak was good - the shrimp was good when we had it.  Our meals came with 10 shrimp each.  We immediately ordered another round & waited over 25 minutes to get 8 shrimp each.    Ordered again, and again and again.... And each time, the wait between servings was longer and longer.  We asked the waitress about it and were told it was a new deal at Outback and the cooks were not used to it nor had a routine down.  The same was told to us when we spoke with the two hostesses who promised to speak with the manager when he came on duty & have him call us.  Of Course - no call ever came.    When you are offering all you can eat of anything - you better have a plan in place and people/employee's to make it happen.    WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY - especially when we left the Outback & our 17 year old asked if we could stop at Steak 'N Shake for a meal & shake to go.    We had business in Independence Ohio and stopped for lunch - we live almost an hour northeast of there.  WILL NEVER TRUST ANOTHER OUTBACK AGAIN.  I have my receipt - 9/27/2013 should you need or want a copy.  I wasn't going to write - but feel you are not going to get better/learn to fix the problems and to let others know about our situation.  Laura L."}
{"text":"First, the positive - the customer service on the phone was very friendly and cheerful.  I had a chicken sandwich however, and was quite disappointed.   The chicken was bland and had wilted lettuce and not much other than some sauce to flavor the sandwich.  No love at all with this meal.  The second star was for the friendliness only.  Come on guys- a supermarket deli could do better!"}
{"text":"Had a super nice waitress. The food was pretty tastey. Our only complaint was that It was freezing inside."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for dinner.  Salad was brought out and server said she would bring me silverware.  10 minutes pass and no silverware.  Bartender was not attentive and didn't realize I was just sitting there staring at my salad. I finally had to say something and he didn't even say sorry.  Just the worst service I ever had.  Sadly the employees represents the restaurant and I would avoid this place from now on..."}
{"text":"Just a little off on everything; service was polite but slow; food is typically so good and consistent, but tonight it was just OK. Mixed drinks were weak.  I typically really enjoy Outback but I should have listened to the lady at the hotel!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location so many times I can't count. This dining experience was one of the best. The beer was ice-cold and refreshing like beer on tap should be! Our waitress was attentive, checked on us frequently, and made sure our orders were correct. Also the Thunder was delicious, we order one every time."}
{"text":"Terrible! Over an hour wait for food that is not correct. Shell in crab supreme.  Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for years, usually a good experience. Last night We were very disappointed, in the service as well as the food. We even asked if it had changed owners, it had not! Really hoping it was just a bad night and that this will not be a regular problem!"}
{"text":"1st time here and last ordered the cobb salad the dressing was warm the salad was warm and the \"crispy chicken \" was not hot...omg awful place  Please temp the food Please!!!! I payed $12.99 for an awful plate!!! The server argued with me said no its cold..bad service..."}
{"text":"For starters, we went on Jan.2 when they had a special free \"bloomin onion\"  We were seated promptly, but the restaurant was freezing.  I had to eat with my coat on.   Our server was nice but seemed kind of flustered.  I ordered the rib steak since I had a gift card (nice!)  When I got the steak , I looked at it and said \"Huh?\"  didn't look at all or taste like a rib steak should.  Next table guy had a prime rib,looked good, not like my steak.    The manager, Abby came over and immediately took it away, and gave me a new one (hubby finished his meal by the time I got mine)   The server then charged me for 2 rib steaks!  corrected the bill.  Have to say the Manager is absolutely the greatest!!   She said next time, she will personally pick out my steak.   Last week we attended again after super bowl and got a free onion again.   Steak was just right and service really good.    Ask for Abby and she will do her best!"}
{"text":"I love the service here. They are very attentive, friendly, and helpful.   I am obsessed with the Thunder From Down Under dessert. It's a warm fudgy brownie with nuts topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It seriously hits the spot.   The Blue Cheese Wedge Salad is delicious. The lettuce is crisp, the dressing is flavorful and not heavy, and all the toppings enhance the flavor.   Filet mignon is juicy and perfect. Plain and simple.  Baked potato is classic, soft, and hearty.  Key Lime Pie Martini rimmed with the Graham Cracker Crust is sweet buy not overly. I don't like my drinks too sweet and this one was balanced just right. Make sure they put the graham cracker crust because without it it's still good, but not as great. I went 2 times and they ran out of the graham cracker crust.  Regardless, I love this location and will return happily."}
{"text":"We avoid eating at restaurants often because my daughter is allergic to a lot of stuff. When we do attempt it, there usually not much she can eat. She usually ends up with steamed vegetables.   After hearing from other allergy parents that Outback is a good chain restaurant for our predicament, we decided to give it a try and we're so very pleasantly pleased. The manager came over and we discussed what she could and couldn't have. We decided on grilled chicken which they made specially avoiding cross contamination. She actually got a plate of food and ate it without any sort of reaction. That is such a huge thing for us!   Our server, Ian, was fantastic. Very friendly and accommodating. Our food was great. Everything came in a timely manner. I am so happy we gave it a try. We will certainly add Outback to our list of safe places to eat and will return to this location when we find ourselves in the area."}
{"text":"We were out of the Las Vegas area for vacation, and it was nice to know there was a chain restaurant close to our hotel so we decided to come here and grab dinner two times while we were in town. The first time we decided to sit down inside the restaurant of course it was very full but the wait times which they gave us were 25 to 35 minutes, But guess what it only took him 15 minutes to seat us. We will have to say the service there far exceeds any other Outback Steakhouse we have been to. The other time with their services for her to go order it back to our hotel this is why were giving five stars to this location the service there after to go order were very friendly making sure we had everything we can possibly need to make sure our meals were perfect. When we got back to our hotel we do not have to go looking for knives silverware extra napkins utensils any of that stuff. While we were there waiting for our food they were very accommodating allowing one of us to wait inside as our food was coming up. I will have to say if you're looking to grab a meal on the way home this location is number one to go to. If you're looking for a good chain steakhouse this will be the location you want to come to"}
{"text":"We had been in town for an event and after spending all day outside we decided we wanted a place we know and could get a mean that we are familiar with so Outback Steakhouse was our decision.  We know we are in Las Vegas and we could have had type of food for our taste, but this was the location we decided.  When you arrive you have to follow the signs to the elevator (yes, inside the coke bottle), to ride up to the restaurant level.  You enter and greeted right away, we were told it would be a 30 minute wait, which for a place like this is not too bad, we decide to wait as we did not want to go any place else (knowing us we would walk for an 1 hour trying to decided where to eat).  We were waiting for a table for 2, which we figured it would be within the time frame allotted.  To our surprise all the other customer in front of us were being sited really fast, and within 15-20 minutes we were at our table.    When we sat down the waiter was there almost at the same time to take our order for drinks, and since we had been outside all day, this was very welcoming to us.  We ordered our drinks (ice tea and root beer), the drinks where at our table within a few minutes which was great especially since we were thirsty.  The waiter asked us if we were ready to order our food, and we were as we do know the menu.  We order two steaks and bacon cheese fries (yummy).  We had plenty of time to take with each other and enjoy our evening out, including the waiting returning to our table to refill our drinks, we has small conversation with our waiter which made this experience very nice.    When the food did come out of the kitchen, it was served well, the food was hot and the order was correct (cooked and delivered).  We of course did enjoy our meal as we had been waiting for dinner to save for our big meal, and as we just sat there relaxing the waiter did check up on us often, yes your staff does make the difference to a meal.    As far as the location it was fun to look outside at the Las Vegas strip and people watch, plus the place was very clean (yes it was busy), the restrooms were clean and the wait staff was very friendly, without being over friendly.  Overall this location is great and if you are looking for a good meal, this would be a place for you to come to as the location sets this place apart.  We are not giving 5 stars as the hostesses were not friendly and the waiting room for a table was very small and you will have to move each time people arrive to get a table.  This would be a 4.5 star location."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the food.  My main takeaway from this visit is that the young kid waiter and the older lady waitress don't like each other and someone was working our table who stole it from the other or the other was trying to steal it.  I don't really know because I shouldn't have even noticed that.  Get me my food and GO THE HELL AWAY with that crap.  I just wanted a freaking steak.  BTW the steak was perfect."}
{"text":"I stopped by this location on my home from work, since I was craving a steak. I was seated promptly, and then my ordeal began.   My female server, who had a younger trainee in tow, decided to show her new charge just how far that she could test a customer's patience. She sat at my table uninvited to take my order, which is something that I find unprofessional, impolite, and intrusive. Then to my amazement, while sitting at my table, she proceeded to talk \"down\" to me repeatedly. If I had not been so hungry, and so concerned about this \"witch\" spitting into my food, I would have told her to KMA. Actually, what I should have done was just get up and leave.  The FOOD? Unmemorable, and not worth the price.   The SERVICE? Maybe the worst that I've ever experienced at any dining establishment.   I left a reasonable tip, when I should have left none. I was anxious to escape from this young, blond, crazy person, as soon as I could finish eating. I really hope that this person is no longer in the service industry, and I also hope that her young trainee learned to do just the opposite of what this \"girl' taught. I vowed to never return, and I never have, nor will I ever. This experience soured my feelings for the entire Outback Steakhouse franchise. I have not eaten at an Outback since this encounter.  On a positive note, this experience steeled my resolve to NEVER take any guff from anyone who is disrespectful to me as a paying customer. I will make my displeasure known to the manager, and I will also contact corporate headquarters. I also now feel no compulsion to leave a tip. If service is particularly egregious, I will leave three cents - to convey my displeasure at having my dining experience ruined. They usually get the message!  Life is too short, and my peace of mind is too valuable, to allow this type of BS."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered dinner to-go last night and it was pretty terrible.  They said our order would be ready in 20 minutes, but by the time we got home it occurred to me that it was probably ready in more like 5 minutes and sat there for a while and everything got cold and dried out.  My boyfriend's new york strip steak was thin and gray.  My chicken was cold and dry and my loaded mashed potatoes were dense and cold all the way through.  I realize that take-away food will never be as good as if you order at the restaurant, but even if we had eaten it there, I'm pretty sure it would have been mediocre at best.  This place is gross and we will never go back."}
{"text":"Great service, enjoyed the food but just that the ribeye I ordered was a little too dry for my liking for a medium-well steak."}
{"text":"Completely disgraceful, being a server I understand everyone wants to go home but really? We came in AN HOUR before closing.  Waited for 5 mins while the 2 people at the bar made it clear they didn't want us there by blatantly ignoring us.   Finally the hostess emerges and tried her hardest to discourage us from seating in the restaurant by offering the lounge which we thought over and decided that wouldn't be best for us.  Only to be replied to with \"it's technically the same thing\" no it's not and that a tad bit rude.  I would never make a guest feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, perhaps the staff would benefit from guest service training.  We left because it's clear an HOUR before closing isn't appropriate time to have dinner."}
{"text":"We used DoorDash this evening to order from Outback in Mesa on Clearview & Superstion Springs Blvd. I ordered a 6oz medium I repeat medium Sirloin steak. When I received it my steak was burned beyond recognition. It was black on both sides of the steak. It was like beef jerky. I called and spoke with the owner to tell him of my dissatisfaction. He told me it was not his problem and refused to rectify my complaint. He told me it was DoorDash I needed to deal with and refused to make my order right. I will never step a foot into that restaurant again. The owner is extremely rude and does not belong  in the restaurant business. I will share this with all my friends too! He picked the wrong person to be rude too!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my mother there for her 80th birthday. And, from arrival in the non-handicap parking spot 10' from the front door to leaving 1.5 hours later, everything was near perfection. Everyone from the greeter and hostess to the waitress and staff were friendly and the appetizer, drinks and meal were fantastic."}
{"text":"This is an update to update to an update.   Day before the Fourth of July = packed.   Great service, awesome food, didn't break my bank.   Coconut shrimp is to die for, sirloin is so flavorful, and the salad's just taste great. Plus their loaded mashed potato is awesome.   It was a great experience for my dad's 60th birthday."}
{"text":"This is the best all-around meal I've had in a LONG time.  Simple, yet delicious.  We were seated quickly, granted it was a Sunday evening, however for a restaurant on the Strip I was impressed.  Of course we shared a fresh, hot blooming onion.  Call me crazy, but try it with Ketchup instead of the special sauce...my wife and friends are sold!  I ordered the New York Strip and it was amazing.  Perfectly seasoned and perfectly grilled.  My only negative critique is they rushed the appetizer/salad portion of the meal.  I felt like Kobiyashi trying to inhale my salad when my steak came out merely minutes after my salad, but that's ok.  My wife and her girlfriend shared the full rack of pork ribs, and I must admit they were delicious as well.  Any place that can fully satisfy the insatiable appetites of two pregnant women speaks volumes!  I would happily pay to eat here again."}
{"text":"I like coming here not just for the food, the employees are all very courteous and prompt and friendly, you can tell there are a lot of regulars, i always sit at the bar and just about everyone that arrives is greeted by first name, great food, great people, great atmosphere,"}
{"text":"They consistently over cook the meat.  Worst Outback I have ever been to.  It's really bad when the manager has to keep bugging you to find out how bad the steaks are cooked.  Why isn't the cook fired?"}
{"text":"Went Sunday for lunch, our server was phenomenal. Very friendly and gave us excellent service. We ordered the Aussie fries as well as their sirloin and crab leg special. Steak was cooked perfectly & came out in a timely fashion. She even informed us of their new dine reward program so we could sign up before paying our bill to get credit for our visit so our 4th one would be 50% off. Their pumpkin cheesecake is on the top of my recommendation for dessert!"}
{"text":"Had a 30 min wait which was not so bad given that they had a sweet hostess pass out samples of appetizers and desserts along with water in the waiting area. I've not seen that before as it made our wait less crucial. Food was great and our waiter John was super great and hospitable. Definitely will be back!!! The Blackberry Sangria was delicious!"}
{"text":"The problem is that the manager is seating the guests and also taking care of tables because your stores so busy so we're waiting in line 15 people deep while she handles other things and gets one person every 10 minutes when we finally get to the line that's when she says we're out of the Black Friday card so we're wondering all the people start going faster and it was because the last five people, We word number 15 and there was another five behind us so that's like 20 people in line and when we got to the counter and she tells us we're out of the Black Friday card and we're not going to honor it and we asked why didn't you tell us while we're standing in line we could have left we didn't have to wait another 25 minutes to hear this plus the hour we already waited so it was an hour and 25 minutes of wasted.  she should tell the people inline ,by the way we only have 10 left with 15 to 20 people still in line.   that's ridiculous standing in line for an hour 25 min.to say sorry your out of luck  limited quantities.  You have  lost a customer there's other places"}
{"text":"The problem is that the manager is taking care of tables. The rude young Hostess is just telling people just wait over there the manager will get you when she gets a chance doesn't tell us anything else so we're waiting in line 8 people deep while the manager is doing other things and gets one person every 10 minutes or so when we finally get to the front of the line that's when she says we're out of the Black Friday cards. So We were number 9 and there was another 6 people in line behind us and when we got to the counter and she tells us we're out of the Black Friday card and we're not going to honor it and we asked why didn't you tell us while we're standing in line we could have left we didn't have to wait 55 minutes of wasted time. So that's ridiculous standing in line for an 55 min.to say sorry your out of luck."}
{"text":"I've had enough of poor service and bad food. Given the many shots had enough but there are other  places to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and wanted mashed potatoes....they have me a baked potato. I know it's not too big of a difference...but taste and accuracy are important to me. I waited over 30 minutes for my food that was supposed to take 15-20 and it was extremely cold. I work in the restaurant industry but I make sure my product is accurate and hot when it leaves the restaurant. I also ordered 2 breads with it and only received one. I'm extremely disappointed in this restaurant and it's not the first time I've had a problem.  Not just in this location but in a couple others."}
{"text":"Service was very good.  The food was excellent.  I had the Salmon and my wife had the Prime Rib with the original Outback spice.  Both were excellent.  We met a guest there from out of town.  The restaurant left a favorable impression on our guest.  Typical Outback... which I find to be pretty consistent from location to location.  We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, predictability; what else needs to be said. I had the salmon which was very good. A friend had MahiMahi which was also good. The third person in our party had the rib and chicken combo which was good; the meat just fell off of the ribs. Great service. Reasonably priced drinks. Call ahead seating or to get on the waitlist. During our visit on a Friday night at 7 PM we walked in, sat in the bar only five minutes and then were seated at our table.  I did call ahead to get on the wait list which helped to speed our seating."}
{"text":"Good location and like all Outbacks its crowded and loud and a good deal for what you get.  Let's face it Outback is 1 step above fast food so I won't review the food because it is the same at each one in the world. The 4 stars is more for the friendly and fast service as well as the clean restrooms at this location."}
{"text":"I have to remember to not come back here to this location. It's was not busy at all. Service was extremely slow. She came to take our order and then said she would be back & We got sat at the booth in front of the kitchen entrance. She never came back took another tables order.  My tea was totally watered before we even got bread. Ordered the outback special with shrimp. Finally it comes shrimp cold  But the servers were nice  We just had better experiences Just not coming back. :("}
{"text":"I come to the outback all the time. It's usually good/great, no issues. Today we came in for lunch and were seated the dining room to the left of the front door and it had 6-8 dirty tables in it. We were seated at a clean table in the corner. After sitting for over 20+ mins the tables are still dirty, the dining room in general is filthy. There is no manager in sight and only one server. My mom ordered decaf coffee, Our appetizer was good, came out quickly because we ordered it through the Ziosk.. we tried the new steakhouse quesadilla which was ok, not amazing, strong rosemary flavored which we thought was weird.My mom ordered the soup and salad, soup wasn't hot just like warm, salad was fine. I ordered a burger and after my mom finished her food I still had not received  it. Once I got my burger that I believed was delivered by the manager, we were missing fruit we ordered for our baby, still in need of refills. Our server was clearly overwhelmed and in need of help, he was really trying so hard to keep up.    Overall This was a terrible experience and hope they can make some improvements on staffing so that they can step up there game, improve ticket times and make sure food comes out properly"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we had a very mediocre experience at this location.  We had been waiting for several months to go out to dinner as a family so we could celebrate a special occasion.  We finally had a reason as it was my husband's birthday.  We arrived at the restaurant and were greeted by Hanna, a very nice Hostess.  When our server arrived at our table, I made sure to mention that it was my husband's birthday.  She acknowledged it and went about her business.  She was very nice and provided good service.  At least until it was time for dessert.  After the meal was done, she came up to the table and asked if we wanted dessert.  I was quite surprised as I expected her to offer my husband a complimentary birthday dessert.  She did not.  I did not want to make a scene so we politely paid the bill and left.  The next day I decided I should let the manager know that this situation had really put a damper on the evening.  To the best of my knowledge, I have never gone out for a birthday or anniversary dinner and not had it acknowledged in some way.  Well here is the final straw.  I called the Manager and he apologized and said he was sorry that there was no acknowledgement as they always sing and offer a complimentary dessert.  He then indicated that he would make sure to inform the General Manager.  Not one time in our conversation did he make a offer to correct the situation.  No mention of any future accommodations to keep our business.  It may seem minor but great service is in the details.  This restaurant has definitely lost my business!!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Outback! Tracy,  our server was very helpful in navigating  the menu with us so that we picked the perfect meal.  We selected the 18 oz. sirloin and it was cooked to perfection.  Tracy kept checking on us to make sure everything was fine.  Her service and the food were top notch!"}
{"text":"Our server John U and the manager Mr Stacy made tonight great. We had an issue with one of our entreés and there was no hiccup to make it right... Always great service. But the way they handled our small snafu, was second to none. Thanks again"}
{"text":"The service was awful here! Server was completely inattentive and we had to use the call server button just to get our waters filled up and it wasn't even busy. They messed up all our soup orders. They need better management there because we were not impressed."}
{"text":"Their Wednesday deal changed. It fucking sucks ass. Don't go unless you plan to spend money and eat disgusting French fries as a side in a fucking steakhouse."}
{"text":"Haven't been to an Outback in a while. I don't know if the portions went down or what but my plate looked so naked. A little piece of salmon and a few sprigs of veggies. Don't get me wrong, it was gooooood. But my husbands steak plate looked naked too. They need to dress it up or something. As much as you pay it should atleast look nice."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here tonight and it was terrible. The service was good but the food so very disappointing. I had their $9.99 steak special and it was tiny and burnt. My daughter was with me and we both agreed that \"we will not go there again\"."}
{"text":"Eating grilled chicken on the barbie makes me feel like a proper Aussie! The bloke who served us was a fair dinkum, great server! The tucker & grog where both grouse (aka: very good!) :)"}
{"text":"This location is way better than the last! Food is always pretty decent and I always get good service. I've had quite a few times that my steak gets messed up but they always fix it and do everything they can to make it better. I love that a manager always comes over when there is a problem. I am giving it 3 stars because the food is average. Overall, I love this place, and I will def keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's mom gave me a $50 restaurant gift card for my birthday and I chose to use it here. My boyfriend and I visited at 3:00 today and the place was practically empty, so we were seated and served immediately. We started off with a Bloomin' Onion and some drinks, a Heineken for him and a Strawberry Peach Sangria for me. The sangria wasn't too strong, but it wasn't what I was expecting taste-wise either (although this was my first time having a sangria). This was my boyfriend's first time trying the onion and despite the fact that he kept saying he didn't like it, he kept scarfing it down three Bloomin' Onion pieces at a time. Haha  He ordered the 22oz Porterhouse with broccoli and cheese and aussie fries, and I ordered the Hearts of Gold Mahi with sauteed mushrooms, broccoli and cheese, and 4 grilled shrimp. The steak (and shrimp) was nicely cooked and tasted great, but the fish was a bit overdone for my tastes, though that's coming from someone who likes their fish a bit on the rarer side. The broccoli and cheese was delicious; my boyfriend ate all of his, but the stems of mine were hard to chew so I only ate the florets. However, the sauteed mushrooms were delicious and came sitting in a tasty broth. As for the aussie fries, I can't tell you much about those because my boyfriend was too full to eat them after having the steak and broccoli (but hey, they're cheese fries with bacon in them so they've gotta be good).  Overall, it was a good experience with quick service and nice, helpful waiters (although two of them seemed a bit inexperienced). I would definitely go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there for much else than the steak."}
{"text":"I do enjoy me some outback (despite the constant worry of chain restaurant diluting of quality)  PROS: Consistent good food Nice wait staff plenty of parking (huge lot/shared with the Hotel) convenient location in Monroeville Really cold/crisp salads (Go for the Ranch, I'm not sure why or how, but Outback's ranch is \"different\" and good!)  CONS: it's a chain the potato soup (which is delightful) comes and goes--they need to just bring it back until the restaurant, itself, dies.   SUGGESTIONS: Baked Potato Soup (if they have it when you visit) Salmon (or Filet) \"Grillers\""}
{"text":"Horrible service. There was hair in my blooming onions. The manager brushed it off as if it was nothing. He was upset when I asked for them to be remade. I will never return!"}
{"text":"This Outback is in a great location for shopping at some fun stores and the parking is easy.  The food was served up quickly, our server was polite and efficient in taking care of our needs, and everything was clean.  The downside was the food prep - we wanted un-buttered steaks but when they came out they were very obviously covered in it.  It's not a deal breaker and we didn't have time to wait for a \"do over\" since we were on our way to another place after.  I actually prefer the steaks un-buttered at Outback since it brings out the flavor of their seasonings more.    Everything else was prepared to order and we will definitely go back again since this is the first slip up we've had at an Outback in some time.  Overall: A-"}
{"text":"This is our go to location when we are craving a good steak for a good price point! The staff is always really friendly and the place is kept clean every time. We usually get the no butter version of the steak and the veggies, since they offer that here, and it cuts a ton of calories from the meal and still tastes awesome with the seasonings they offer!  The brown bread they bring out in the beginning of the meal is always tasty and served up warm. The ambiance here is nice, and the booths around the bar area are pretty private if you want a date night out, see if you can be seated there.   Overall: A Food is always prepared nicely, they offer healthy choices with great flavor, and staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and lobster special at $27,99, On rhe menu it says it includes a signature salad.   On the left side of the specials menu where signature salds are listed for another special was their blue cheese chopped salad  The waitress told me I also get a side.  After hearing the list of choices I chose one.  The salad was good nothing special I've had better chopped blue cheese salads,   The lobster arrived missing half of it.  they told me it shrunk when char broiled, it was clealy cut as the entire top was gone. What was left was literally 4 small bites. The manager was nice and removed it from my bill.   The prime rib had no flavor.  The chocolate desert was good.  The bill added $1.00  for the salad and $1.00 for the side making this actually $29.99.  I've had much better dinners for this cost.  After arguing with thw waitress about the extra charges,  the owner removed them but also tried to justify.   An aggravating expensive meal I wont be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, server was very friendly and knowledgeable  Thanks Laura  Food was delicious as always  Perfect portions I had Victoria's filet, the best blue cheese wedge salad on earth and steamed broccoli"}
{"text":"We went here on Sunday afternoon and were seated. Hostess gave us our menus and that was the end of our interaction with anyone that worked there. After sitting for 10 minutes with a waitress waiting on the table beside us and behind us still nothing. Waitress gave check to pee behind us and the went on to proceed to the table beside us and refill drinks and clear off their table. Still nothing. We did finally get a look from her and guess what? She continued to walk away. So we got up to leave and guess what? The hostess that just seated us 10 minutes ago says thank you have a nice day. So needless to say we will tell everyone we know this and will never set foot in here again As of December 5th I did receive compensation for this in the form of 2 gift cards. I am appreciative for their generous and prompt attention to this matter."}
{"text":"Just ate with the family here after walking around the mall. The food was great, had a 6oz steak with rice and a side salad. Steak was cooked a perfect medium. My son had jr ribs. The food was plenty and service more importantly was phenomenal! Steve(n) was our server.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Great dinner our first at this outback. We had the 3 course special that they have for wed nights.  From $12.95 for a starter we had blue cheese wedge salad a 6oz sirloin and there cheese cake which is so good.  Despite it been a busy night service was fast and food was fresh and tasty, steak was cooked as we asked.  Server was new but he was very attentive and manager introduced himself and asked us how food was which was nice .  Will be back to this location as its one of the best out backs we have been to"}
{"text":"I have been to this outback about 5-6 times in the last 3 months and have always had a good experience. However last night was the first time we were let down .   The food was good as usual just the wait time was horrendous and our server seemed to forget about us for long periods of time.   Once we finally got to the desserts they managed to get that wrong and mess up the bill and when we questioned it they took over 15 minutes to fix it and bring back the correct dessert.   I usually have a great experience here and will go back but they seemed to be in over there head last night."}
{"text":"I love this outback location! I usually have excellent service when I come here. The sirloin steaks are always so tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly. Even the house salad and bread are above average quality and the prices really aren't bad. Two 8 oz sirloins, both served with salad and a baked potato only cost me $35. I recently arrived on a Thursday night only 30 minutes before the restaurant closed and we were still greeted nicely and received great service. The hostess, Alicia, made sure we felt welcome. I don't remember our server's name (maybe Jake or Josh?) but he was very accomodating and provided excellent service with a smile. I will definitely continue to frequent this location."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great value. Consistent quality. Victoria filet is my favorite with a blue cheese crown. Yum!"}
{"text":"So good with a party of 3 and two of them are under 10. Great patience and wonderful service from Victoria P."}
{"text":"Went out with friends, the experience was terrific the waiter was awesome, thank you for helping create a great outing!!! We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I love Outback, but this location is getting worse with each visit. Tonight's was no exception. Our server was friendly, but she was nowhere around most of our visit. She never offered refills, we had to ask. She did not bring bread until the meal was served. She entered the order incorrectly and did not really apologize for it. She just said it is not right and walked away. A manager came to the table to let us know she is recooking the meal. My husband told her he would just eat what he was served as long as he got his lobster tail. It turns out the cut of meat he got was $12 more than what he ordered. He was not told this, but we were charged for the more expensive cut of meat. It is not a huge deal, but it would have been nice to know! The cheese fries and mashed potatoes were so salty that they we could not eat them. The salad came dressed, which is okay, but there was almost no dressing on them. We could not ask for more, because our server did not come back to our table until we were finished. Two other servers helped us more than she. We were not asked if we wanted dessert. We ate around 4:30 pm. There were not 6 other tables of guests to be seen in our half of the restaurant. I wish I knew the name of the guy who brought us our containers at the end. He was the only openly friendly and helpful person we met tonight."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Saturday afternoon low drink specials and appetizer specials. Great service and now open at 11 o'clock."}
{"text":"Will never be back at this location after years of coming and knowing the staff and them knowing my daughter I felt disrespected with my family accompanying me. New waitress took all our orders at once with salads included. 40 minutes of waiting seeing two other parties arrive and get their salads and food we asked waitress what's the wait and was given attitude with a glare she was \"checking on it\".  Immediately said we are leaving and went to see the manager Hollywood. Always nice guy he didn't want us to leave but felt disrespected and told him last he will see of my family and I."}
{"text":"I had dinner here one night and 1st it was a long black hair in my stuffed mushrooms, they took them back and gave me another order for FREE!! Then I threw up ALL my food as soon as I walked out the door. I thought I was just super full but as soon as I opened my mouth, it all came out! I did accidentally order med rare instead of med well, that could of been the issue BUT I'm still never eating there again. Great server & strong drinks tho!"}
{"text":"This Outback Steakhouse is located right beside the Las Vegas South Premium Outlets, in between the McDonalds / gas station and the Smashburger. Parking can be hard to find, but luckily there is the south Premium Outlets parking to use if the lot is full.  The wait was not too long. I ate there at around 3:30pm but I'm sure if you went on a Saturday evening or lunch time, you would have to wait. The food was good and so was the service!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service!!! While eating I found a good size tendon thing in the middle of my steak. There was no way for the cook to know it was there. I brought it up to our server, Darryl and he immediately went back and had a new steak put on for me. Within seconds of him leaving the table another gentleman came over and apologized and asked if I still wanted to work on the current steak I had. Me being me I just couldn't continue eating it. So he took my steak and I asked him to leave my side dish. A few minutes later a different gentleman walked out with a new steak and a new side!! Not only was this issue I had taken very seriously by the outback team but they also took my meal off the bill!!!! In all the restaurants I've been in, and had an issue, I've never ever received such great service!  Thank you Outback!!!"}
{"text":"We went early evening on a Saturday and even then there was a 15 minute wait which is fine...tells us the place can't be that bad.  Typical Outback decor and was clean and decent.  Amanda, our server was fantastic and friendly which kept the third star because the food was just plain mediocre at best.  My daughter had the filet and lobster tail.  The lobster was overdone and a bit chewy, but since this was her first time with lobster and she didn't seem to care for the taste, I didn't send it back.  My wife had the chicken and filet and she liked it but didn't care for the mesquite taste the chicken had.  That was not Outback's issue, since it was wood fired LOL! Point is, if you like the wood fired taste then it's definitely there.  I had the 10-ounce Rib-eye ordered medium rare.  It was served with barely any pink in the middle.  In other words, medium to medium well.  The manager came by for a visit and I pointed this out and she agreed that this was definitely not medium rare and offered to get me another which was nice, but I chose to keep it and not make the rest of the family wait for me.  So, two over-cooked dishes out of three.  One of which was a steak.  If you bill yourself as a steak house, like Outback does, you should never, ever serve an improper steak.  I just don't get that.  We had some gift cards which is why we went, but the experience was just so-so at best.  There are other places that I would prefer to spend $$ and a weekend evening out."}
{"text":"if you want to have lunch at this Outback and want the Unlimited soup and salad be prepared to start with a regular size soup and salad and on every additional order watch the order get smaller and smaller in size. The first time I tried it my first soup was in a bowl and the next 2 were in small cups and my first salad on a regular salad plate and my next salad on a saucer plate. Tried it a 2nd time ....same results. The proprietor said that's what they do. If you enjoy the unlimited soup or salad options....go to Chili's or Applebees.......taste better, more options and they give you a 2nd order on a regular size plate and bowl."}
{"text":"Not only was my butter garlic ribeye yummy, but our waiter Gavin Z. Was amazing!! He was kind, courteous, timely, professional, and provided true white glove kind of service."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for lunch today, a Sunday. Although many restaurants make you order from the dinner menu for Sunday lunches, the waiter told us he would provide whichever we preferred.  I ordered the lunch no rules parmesan pasta with shrimp, a side of broccoli, and a Coke. Including a 20% tip, the total was $25. I know Outback' s food is too spicy for my palate, so I asked for very light seasoning. It was a tiny bit too spicy, but I enjoyed every bite.  My friend ordered the dinner ribeye steak. I didn't look to see her bill. She said the steak was tough and unflavorful, but she chose to just add some barbeque sauce rather than send it back.  It's been a long time since I've been to Outback. They've remodeled since my last visit. It's more refined than casual now, matching their prices better."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice in 2 months & didn't receive credit on my dine rewards for either visit even tho I wrote my phone number on the bill..  Can't get credit, because I have no receipt & don't remember exact amount (with change), really!?  Who keeps a receipt for dinner..? Spent over $95 & $108 each time, the least they could offer is a measly $20 off that I already earned! Won't be back.. Steaks have always been overcooked anyways.. I order them medium & they are dark brown in the center each time. Worst location when it comes to service & food quality, but LOVE the layout of this one.."}
{"text":"My wife and I were doing some Christmas shopping and decided to pop in for a quick lunch. We got there around 11 to beat any lunch rush. The hostess was friendly and so was the waitress . That's where the story ends. We ordered off the lunch menu. My Medium burger was a well done hockey puck. The Fish Tacos were very \"fishy\" smelling for something like a grilled Tilapia and otherwise bland. I think her house salad yawned. Very underwhelming, especially for a burger from a steakhouse. Comparatively, Chili's gives you more bang for your buck and pays closer attention to the temperature on your meat."}
{"text":"Came for the steak and unlimited shrimp special but was really disappointed.  Not sure which was worse, the food or the service.  Steak was over cooked and had to be sent back, service was so slow we finished meal before more shrimp came.  The Resturant was also freezing so the visit definitely didn't go well at all.  They loaded us with shrimp at the end but the damage was already done."}
{"text":"We came here after a long day with very big appetites. The fiancé sat down at the bar immediately and I ran to the facilities. I say that to say this: I came back and the bartender proceeded to ignore us for the next 15 minutes. Actively! Like, looking alllll the way around us while serving other patrons. Apparently, he said hi to the fiancé while I was gone, but didn't do or say anything after that. Really? We don't even have a water glass in front of us at the very least and we're sitting at the bar. This doesn't look weird to you? Fine. Whatever.   Another woman comes out of the back to help and about 5 seconds after that, the bartender comes over to introduce himself to me and asks us if we want some water. Seriously? Whatever. Better late than never, I guess. She comes over right after him and automatically prepares water for us because she sees we don't have any. We place our orders and wait. They have these little food trays that go on the side of the bar to make it easier for you to get to your food. Two of them sat next to us dirty the entire time. But the bartender found new, clean ones and gave them to these customers he couldn't wait to help as soon as they came in. Nothing makes me more annoyed than being ignored and seeing new patrons get super service. What the hell, dude? Is it me? I just got here! What could I possibly have done to you?  Anyway, I chalked up the service to an off night because I usually have a relatively decent experience here and just made a note not to sit at the bar anymore. Then I got my food. The sirloin looked fine, tasted meh. The asparagus? It was burnt as hell. I seriously wondered how you could plate that and bring it to someone. When the lady from the back came out to check on us, I asked for some new vegetables. When she brought them back out, she said they were already making new ones for me before she got back there. Which makes no sense. If you knew they were that bad, why would you plate them? They were hoping I ate it without a fuss and somebody else's cook time just got pushed back. The whole thing was just deflating. Next time we feel like some Outback, we'll just go to LongHorn."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered online the night before because I was too lazy to cook. When he got to the restaurant, our order hadn't gone though. He had to wait an additional 20 minutes. When he got home, the food was excellent. I ordered a sirloin medium rare and it was perfect. The mixed veggies were not mushy and the baked potato was delicious. My husbands food was cooked perfect as well. The only things I will say negatively is the wait and I wish they gave us more toppings for our potatoes."}
{"text":"I probably said this on previous reviews for this location but, this Outback, hidden above Casino Royale on the Strip. We always eat in the bar area since there's usually only the two of us. We get the larger filet mignon and split it, ordering the baked potato and salad with their honey mustard dressing. Then just order a second salad and we're set. I think they've raised the prices since we were there last time ($39.95 for the larger filet) but, as mentioned in other posts, you are in Vegas so I guess they fell people will have extra money. They are connected with Casino Royale as you can use your comp dollars towards your bill.  Worth a shot if you're at Harrahs or Casino Royale and you feel like having a great steak. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was good but food was terrible-over cooked and lukewarm. Restaurant looks old and in need of renovation too"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable!  She gave us suggestions on when-how to serve our food to accommodate everyone. Our drinks were refilled without us asking. Our waitress was really on top of her game. We shared a blooming onion, I ordered the surf n turf  w/ a salad for my birthday dinner. My husband ordered  a Ribeye steak, w/a salad. One of our children ordered mac n cheese w/ fruit , and our other one ordered a grilled cheese w/fries. Everyone was pleased and that's not always easy! If it wasn't for the fact that our kids were getting sleepy we would have gotten desert as well. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so. First off? Ask for Tiara or Caleb. Just do it. Second of all, the food is always great. Always.   I love the atmosphere. It's always packed on Friday: so screw those three stars. It deserves 4+. The waiters know us pretty well by now and they know that we don't expect anything less than perfection.   Super friendly, super family-oriented, super awesome food. Just super excellent!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a steak and it was well done no big deal bartender sends it back next steak not good nerves all over can't even chew it so what do I do I pay my tab did not complaint  the bartender tells manager and manage offers to refund money is that good service or should she ask how can I make things better or let me make this right just refunded card not happy with results"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great service and food.  Scott is an outstanding server and was very attentive with his customer service.  The cooks at this restaurant are the best Outback has to offer at any location that I've been at.  The food and Scott was so goo that we stopped by a second time but was told that he was not working.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Food was wrong also food was cooked wrong. If you are going to outback around here just drive to Washington this is the 2nd time this location has done a pour job."}
{"text":"Was the very best in town know the owner asst manager needs to be replaced along with the greeter at the door who insulted wife and I after waiting over an hour. Josh refuses to take care of problem. BEWARE !!! Crying shame I will be starting a legal process this week."}
{"text":"We had prime rib with a lobster tail, ribeye and wings and everything was very tasty. Our waitress was Cynthia and she was very good. She was very attentive. Food was served very quickly."}
{"text":"How many times do you give a restaurant a chance when every time, the service is erratic and scarce. My wife and I have been eating at Outback Restaurants for years, but it wasn't until we moved near the restaurant in Surprise, Arizona that we noticed a consistent problem with getting good service.   On previous visits, we asked for the manager, who was terrific and tried to correct things, but we once again returned and the results were exactly the same. Not good. Downright unacceptable.   The food was standard Outback OK. Don't get me wrong, but when I sit down, I expect to be greeted and start the experience off right. Usually, when we go to this restaurant, there is almost never a person at the front to welcome you. Unacceptable, There should always be someone to greet you. Waiting more than a minute for someone to seat you should not happen. This is too common here.  Twice we have told the server that a problem had occurred previously and even with advance knowledge of our bad experiences, we expect corrections to be made. Not the case. They have too few servers on the floor almost always. Guessing there must be employment issues.  The restaurant was not busy this time. My wife prewarned me not to complain, so I obliged. There were only two other couples in our area. After waiting a time frame that was unacceptable to get our order, I shrugged, held out both hands and asked where our food was. Simple response should have been \"Let me check on it.\" but we got \"Your food is being cooked\" with no apologies for delay. Whaa?  One other thing. I know we are in the age of digital electronics, but if I see another restaurant put iPads on the table, thus deferring service even more, Give me service, not a password. I see self-service again and I shall go Out Back and scream. I go to a restaurant expecting good service. This is the complete opposite.   Yes, we probably will give them another chance, but why can't we get a meal when they do not have our table abandoned or seated near the bathroom?"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my son's bday because Outback is his favorite restaurant. (Seriously.) I don't dislike Outback I've just never been impressed. This particular location was different. My family and I received some of the best customer service I've ever received at any restaurant before, especially for not being a high class 5-star type place. It was nothing over the top, they just covered the basics and covered them well. From having a guy to welcome you at the door, holding the door and \"Welcome to Outback\" to a nice hostess. I was meeting the rest of the family there so I was sitting by myself for about 10 minutes. From the time I got there the waiter was 100% on his game, he even bagged my sons to-go food for us. I know these are small things but unless you're in a higher end place most places just don't do this anymore. The waiter's name was James and he was definitely on his game. I will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"I'm super disappointed with Outback. We ordered our Valentines Night dinner at 11am this morning to ensure that it would be ready by 7pm. Not only was it ready 45 minutes late, but it was also missing part of the order. On top of that, part of the order was cold. The staff was obviously unconcerned with their failures and not forgiving at all for the delay. We've been coming to Outback for years but will probably be going elsewhere. Really unimpressed and disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go Melbourne steak with baked potato and grilled asparagus. Steak is full of flavor I put butter on top of the steak which gives is more flavor.  Affordable and very very tasty"}
{"text":"Years ago we were regulars, we stopped going because the steakhouse didn't know how to cook a steak. Tonight, we waited over 40 minutes for dinner without our waitress making any mention about the time our dinner was taking. We had to ask several times for water. Ultimately, we complained to the manager about our meal (not yet served) when another family, seated 15 minutes after us, was finishing their meal. The manager apologized for \"a mishap in the kitchen\" when my steak came out. My wife and 6 year old daughter had to sit and watch me eat while they waited for their steak. Eventually, my wife and daughter were served. The manager comped the meal, but we still had to pay for our drinks. Very little, if any, follow up from the waitress or manager during the rest of our meal. Very disappointing. Next time, I won't have a hard time convincing my wife to go to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Now I understand why the restaurant was empty last night. The meal was horrible. Ribs and chicken were cold. Shrimp was way past cooked. Hmm I think they need a new cook. Even the bloomin onion was bad. Will not return"}
{"text":"Such a shame I have to give this location a two-star rating, but I feel that I must. On Sunday I ate here with my parents and while yes, it was very busy, our service was among the worst I've ever had at any restaurant. My mom had put our name on the waitlist ahead of time using, I believe, Outback's app? Either way, we were put ahead of the line, and our wait still took almost 45 minutes when we were told it would be 25.   I know that's a thing that can change - it's no fault of the restaurant, really - but it was frustrating. The hostesses were clueless. We went back to return our buzzers and they tried to greet us again as if we hadn't been sitting across from them in the cramped waiting room for 45 minutes.   Onto the table. Our server was very much stretched thin and only came back to check on us once. I think he would've been fine on another other night, and it was obvious they were busy, but he wasn't the most attentive. Tables were left uncleaned for half hours at a time, and it just seemed to me that people in the front AND the back of the house were not doing what they were supposed to.   Onto the meal! While I did eat everything happily, and the quality was what I'd come to expect in my other visits here, I did mention to the manager that my medium steak was cold around the edges when it arrived, as well as gray around the edges (slightly overdone). Not a huge deal, but it greatly lessened the quality of that first bite of slight red I was hoping for (and had ordered). I have a feeling my meal was sitting up on the heated expo table for quite a while before it was run to our table.   Not to drag this out, but I thought they went to Australia to get our meat. I also ran into a mom and daughter in the bathroom, complaining about all the same things. \"They messed up my husband's steak and overcooked mine, too! They didn't bring us the right dessert,\" etc. The daughter was lamenting how much homework she still had to do that night. I feel ya, kid. I didn't want to spend 2.5 hours at Outback Steakhouse on my Sunday night either.   A general manager DID come to our table, and while she was very nice and applied a discount to our check, she seemed VERY surprised when I politely spoke up about our low quality service. If you're a manager and are completely clueless about how slow your food is coming out and how tables aren't being cleaned, then something else is going on. The back of the house was not up to par.   As if the service throughout the night wasn't enough, it took us nearly 20 minutes to get our check. Another waiter had to bring it to us because our server was busy splitting checks (really?). At that point I was ready to walk home. It may have been quicker!  A minor plus - during the long seating wait, a hostess brought us menus so we could give our order to the server once we sat down. That was about the only saving grace.   So, all in all, the food was great quality* (though not cooked to temperature), and the service was terrible. Visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"Just had a lovely dinner at this location and I can't wait to go back, our waitress's name was Veronica and she was so sweet, and just on it. We may even have our wedding reception there and we hope to have her as one of our servers. The food is amazing and always cooked to perfection :))"}
{"text":"So we got there with a group of 35... Yea.  They were very good to us and set us up in the patio area.  The wind was kicking up, so it got a bit cold, but not terrible.   The servers were great, quick and took care of drinks in a hurry.  They assigned 3 to our group which really helped. The food seemed pretty quick to come out.  The bloomin onions made it out ahead, which was super. Very please overall!"}
{"text":"Went to outback last night for my birthday and was disappointed. The hostess said it would be a 10-15 minute wait but a lady and her family came after we did and was seated before we were. Our server took atleast 10 minutes before approaching our table and took even longer to bring our bread and waters. The service was ridiculous and also being that it was a slow night. Not too many customers. Many were leaving when we arrived. Wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"Only giving it a 1 because you can't do zero.  We get there and they put my husband and 70 year old dad right in the middle of traffic.  In a very claustrophobic booth.  We ask to move after ordering our drinks.  Took 20 minutes to get our drinks even after we told both waitresses and the hostess helped us move.  Pops and I both ordered the 16oz prime rib so we could have leftovers for lunch the next day.   They bring out our prime ribs and say our baked potatoes are on the way.  Pictures attached.  Almost half of it was fat.  I said oh my gosh that's a lot of fat.  Waitress says nothing.    Pops and my hubby ordered salads and I ordered mushrooms as my other side.   They bring my daughters and husbands meals came.  A few minutes later we get out baked potatoes.   Hubby says where is my potato?   Well they had given him my mushrooms and he was well on his way of eating them.   So you would think I'd get new mushrooms right?  Nope.  Just slide the half eaten mushrooms to my plate.   Then we order another round of drinks and it takes 20 minutes to get a half chill fireball shot.     So not a good experience.  If I'm paying $25 for a 16oz prime rib, I should get \"close\" to 16oz.  Not 8oz of meat and 8oz of fat.    Also it's supposed to be unlimited bread.  How many loaves do you think we got?  Yup 1.   Not a happy experience."}
{"text":"I feel silly reviewing  Outback since pretty much every person on the West coast has eaten there at least once. That being said, I have to compliment this location on its food consistency, friendliness and just overall a good eat. They would have earned 5 stars but on almost every visit there are some minor issues with the service that can, and should, be corrected.  Bread never delivered, wine takes forever to come (salad comes before wine) check delivered before table cleaned.  I will however go back for the always great prime rib!"}
{"text":"This Outback is below average. I had 10 oz Ribeye I ordered it rare came out 20 minutes later well done . The front door hostesses were too busy talking to each other to actually take our name to be seated. Finally interrupted them and asked to sit at the bar and wait for a table. Bar tenders were just like the hostesses to busy to acknowledge us. Customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"The food is always good but the service is slow. Nice people just slow. Looks like new competition is about to open next door       Texas Road House."}
{"text":"Immer wieder gut. Die Steaks sind immer so wie ich sie bestelle. Auch der Service ist hervorragend. Komme gerne wieder!"}
{"text":"Came for prime rib it is 8:00 and they are already out of prime.  Just better management of the place"}
{"text":"The last time I was there, I sat at the bar with my date.   We ordered and the food was very bad.  The baked potato looked to be boiled. The steak was mostly gristle. Just not good at all.   One secret about Outback. NONE of their food is made in-house except for some salad dressing. Other than that, everything comes off the truck frozen.  I am done with Outback."}
{"text":"Its OK food, my burger was not bad but too much bun.  Greeter said it was happy hour but the server never mentioned anything about it.  Garlic mashed potatoes could be better.  Ribs are pretty good too.  Not bad for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible food for the price. Screwed up my take out order. Served me raw meat. See picture. I hate Outback, and I only went because I was give gift cards."}
{"text":"I wish I could remember our server's name. She is amazing! Food was delicious but a tad on the salty side. We love this location!"}
{"text":"Wait time is 25 minutes, not bad considering all the people waiting. The service was slow as it took an hour and change to get our food served to us.  Our table attendant gave us a complimentary dessert for 2 people and there were 5 of us??? I ordered steak and lobster and received the smallest lobster tail I have ever had. I have caught crawfish that were larger than the lobster tail I was served.  I can say that this dinner was not worth the wait nor the 80 dollar bill.  Very dissatisfied. I will not be going back to the Outback!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing,  came in with family on a Tuesday night, relatively empty dining room, was told it would be 15-20 minute wait. fir a party of 4. We chose to leave & as we were leaving another party of 5 showed up & was seated immediately.  will not return.to this location."}
{"text":"Outback Steakhouse has really good steak and appetizers but for some reason the food at this location doesn't taste the same as other Outbacks; the portions seem small, and the food doesn't taste as fresh or come out hot. I came here twice and both times the Bloomin' Onion was too soggy and salty. I honestly prefer the West Sahara location over this one.    During multiple occasions, they say \"It seems like you need a few more minutes, I will be right back.\" Maybe they were all trained to say that, but I personally like when servers recommend food and tell me what is the most popular at least."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my hubby and we had a great time! Honestly it was better than I expected. Last time we ate at an Outback (it was in Irvine, CA) we were super disappointed, and the food was awful. I had a gift card so we decided to give it a go and I'm so glad we did. Our server, Daniel, was FANTASTIC and the epitome of what an awesome server is all about (Hang on to him, servers like him are hard to find). He wasn't pushy and over bearing, yet he wasn't non existent either.  He was simply great at his job and made my husband and I have a really memorable date night. Another plus that I love, is the manager came to check on us just because! I think it's great when Managers take the time to chat with their guests, makes ya feel welcome! Way to go Daniel and Manager, because of you my husband and I will most certainly be back!!"}
{"text":"The experience started off bad when I was told I couldn't buy gift certificates and use them the same day. I then ordered for my fiancé and I. She had a Porterhouse and I had the worst Filet Mignon ever. I ordered a mid rare and it came back rare. Hers did as well but that's how she likes it (never had a woman order steak rare but love she eats it not burnt to a crisp like most). The filet was not juicy it was more chewy. It's suppose to be pink, but mine was gray. The potato was good as were the fries. I will never go back with such lousy customer service and a manager who lies. I say that because as he strolled around and I mentioned the issues to him he offered a free dessert then charged me for it.  I would have liked to have found a new steakhouse in Outback but sadly I couldn't. I cannot recommend this business or the food. Being on SSDI I don't go out much and I'm glad I'm in a wheelchair and have constipation otherwise who knows what my stomach would have done with it."}
{"text":"Have to get here at the right time or else you're waiting for about an hour to get a table. Me and my wife always get the NY strip and never had any problems with is other than a few times her steak wasn't really well done. Been here a few times now and their service has always been okay,we just had Michael the other day and he was the best one we've had there."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents for a quick dinner on a Monday night. It seems to be a busy location and there were a number of people waiting at the  front for tables, but nevertheless they found us a table in no time, which was nice.   We informed our waiter that we were in a bit of a hurry. I ordered the French Onion Soup. It should have been called Italian Onion Soup as the menu listed provolone as the cheese on top, but nevertheless is was delicious. I'm a big fan of F.O.S. Theirs wasn't exceptional, but fit the  bill with lots of gooey cheese and flavourful broth.   Our steaks took a bit longer than we expected to come out. Our waiter had warned us against ordering medium rare, which is how I usually order. He gave us the spiel \"Rare is warm red throughout, medium rare is pink with a warm red center, etc.\" I always thought med. rare was pink throughout, like a nice bright pink, with rare being more rubbery and almost raw. I had opted for the ribeye, medium rare despite his warning it might be too rare, while my parents each had a small sirloin. We all ordered mashed potatoes and veggies.   The steaks came. Theirs were pretty decent, generally pink-looking, even though my mother ordered hers medium. Mine, well, it was well-done. Grey with a tinge of pink. Barely. Nicely seasoned, well-marbled flavourful ribeye, but totally overdone from what I specified. Like a previous reviewer, I was in a hurry, and hungry, and ate the whole steak anyway. However, we did at first say something to the waiter about the long wait, and the manager came with two 4$ lunch coupons, which was nice. Then our waiter came back a bit later and asked about the steaks and I showed him mine. He agreed that it was overdone. To his immense credit, he got the manager to return, who then comped the (rather expensive) rib-eye steak and apologized profusely. From other reviewers' experiences, I'm wondering if they might have problems with the cooking staff getting orders right.   I find that unless I'm at a serious fine dining establishment, it's pretty hard to get a rare or medium rare steak. I've had staff say, \"That's how we do medium rare,\" when they bring out a well-done steak, and leave it at that. So to the credit of The Outback Steakhouse, they at least acknowledged their mistake. I give them three stars because generally I think the food is pretty good, and I know  my folks really like it here and have had many meals they enjoyed. At present, I wouldn't recommend them as a place to get a steak prepared exactly to your specifications. And thanks to our sever for being such a good sport."}
{"text":"Me & my girl go to this Outback quite a bit.  The ambiance isn't the greatest, but we always manage to have a decent steak dinner w/ drinks without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"i haven't been to an outback in years - probably at least 3. with the low carb diet situation and their semi-recent price drop, hub and i decided to check it out on friday night. a few years back their prices were significantly higher, and i felt like for what they served the prices were a bit arrogant. i'm glad i gave it another chance ... overall, i really liked it and i will be back.  the good: awesome service: very attentive without being annoying. she accommodated my every annoying request: an order of wings, 1/2 unbreaded (bet you didn't even know they are breaded to begin with!), all broccoli instead of mixed veggies with my entree, etc. the seared ahi was much better than i expected. wings were good. my steak really was excellent, and well seasoned. i loved my scallops.   the bad: caesar salad dressing was extremely fishy - much fishier than i remember it. hub's prime rib tasted like a re-heat. scallops were small.  i want to give this outback 4 stars, but with the salad situation and the prime rib situation i just can't."}
{"text":"I am deeply dissppointed. Medium/well sirloin was raw, Ribeye was medium instead of medium/rare and tough to cut even with a steak knife. That was my third and last attempt this year. They used to be the best, not anymore. Out total bill was $75 for two, I am willing to pay big for good quality, but that was a waste."}
{"text":"Brandon the Bartender was OUTSTANDING!!!! You Deffinetly Scored with Him!!! Very attentive, and great customer service with everyone at the bar. He was also efficient with the tables around the bar as well."}
{"text":"One of the better restaurant experience of my trip. While hotel rates are dropping,  food is not.  While I revel the number of choices The Strip offers, the spiraling economy always makes me think of the tourist trap.  I had an unfortunate experience in a not-named (but reviewed) Japanese restaurant earlier that week.  I was on a business trip while fellow colleagues visited rather posh restaurants.   With my family with me (and no, I did not expense their meals!) I demanded at least one nice dinner during trade show week.  I was in a mood for a decent steak place, anticipated paying a little more, but trying to keep the tab under $100 for three.  One of the complaints about this Outback is the $$$.   It's deserved.  But like me, it is a corporate franchise name in a convenient location, with many patrons not spending their own money.  Welcome to Las Vegas.    Walking inside the Casino Royale and finding the somewhat secret elevator we found the creaky floor lobby of Outback.  There was a wait, but not terribly long.  We were given a table near the bar and I ordered a rare cocktail.  Our server offered a pleasant suggestion for an extra $1 for an extra shot of the dizzy juice.  After a long day stuffed in a (monkey) suit, its good advice.  With bread, we did resist ordering an appetizer.  Wanting to experiment, I went with the Prime grade fillet while the wife went with the Choice.  In a mood to splurge, I ordered a lobster tail.    Prime versus Choice: The prime is more tender than choice but unsure if its that noticeable or worth the extra dollars.     The Lobster Tail: That was incredibly good!  My daughter went to my side of the table to make it her meal.  And it didn't need any butter.  Desert: Giant brownie cake and ice cream on top.  Though there was no cake *under* the ice cream, a form of cheating, there was enough there for three.    The Service: I was very pleased and relieved to be treated well.  Though a busy night, our server found the time to make sure we were okay and our water glasses not empty.    The Damage: With tip, it came near $120.  I wanted to treat myself and I did."}
{"text":"I have had some iffy trips to Outback.  This was great.  I came here with my boss.  We got a table right away in the bar.  Our waitress was propt and efficient and paid attention. My Steak was cooked properly and there was no hair in it.  Great.  Changed my mind about Outback."}
{"text":"I am pleased to give Outback Steakhouse a good review.  We went there tonight because an ad popped up on Facebook advertising a free blooming onion with any meal purchase tonight (Monday).  We were skeptical and were right to feel that way.  We got there and were informed it was a promotion with a racing event and a certain driver didn't get in the top 10, so no blooming onion.  We were disappointed, but out server, Daniel, said he'd take care of it for us.  We got the onion and then split their steak and lobster combo and added one extra side a la carte to round out the meal for the two of us.  Meal was very good.  Daniel was also excellent.  Often times for us, great service is more important than the quality of the food.  He was attentive to our pace (we're generally pretty speedy and eat out for the human need of food versus the experience) and just a real nice guy.  The check came and we did get charged for the onion, but Daniel took it off our bill as promised before I even completed my inquiry.  Four stars instead of five because it is still more than we'd like to pay eating out, but still a great experience.  I also fear this won't necessarily be a future experience when we do decide to go back, but I hope I'm wrong."}
{"text":"The food is usually good but lately curbside has been ridiculous, they give us a time it will be ready and don't come out to the car until 15 mins later just to take the payment, then another 15 waiting for the food!! And don't try the delivery service...HORRIBLE. After waiting 45 mins she's a no show so I called and asked about my delivery...shes concerned about the driver because she left the store 20 mins ago coming to my house so she put me on hold to check her safely!!! She comes back \"I'm so glad she's okay I was worried about the driver but she said she's 4 mins away\"... ok glad she's okay but why so late with my food??? over an hour delivery and she delivered my drink with the straw already in the cup.... don't trust that at all! I'll stick with dining in no more curbside or delivery!"}
{"text":"First time I have tried going to Outback for lunch. It wasn't very busy and now I see why. Our server name was Sabrina, she was nice but was a complete ditz. We both ordered hamburgers with no mustard. When the order came one came with mustard. When we told the waitress that the burger had mustard on it she said maybe the other burger has mustard on it? Like she got our orders mixed up and she had a look on her face like it was our fault. Never admitted that they screwed up. So she went back and got another bun. After that she never came back, she never offered us drink refills or asked how our meals were, in fact we were the only customers on that side of the restuarant and probably her only table. She might have been new but seemed to have hardly any customer service skills or serving skills.   So if you want good service I recommend not going to Outback for lunch because the service is slow, unless it was just our server who lacked skills. I don't think I will ever go back there for lunch just dinner but I hope the waiters at night are more skilled then the day servers."}
{"text":"One  for the short wait on a Saturday. I've been here on a Sunday and previously waited so long we sat at the bar and ended up walking out and over to joes after 15 minutes. Another  for our waiters excellent attitude and a third  for the excellent food. We never recieved appetizer plates for our appetizers or bread, they may not give those out for bread. There was a stack of coasters on the edge of our table about 12 or more the whole time. No one else had extra coasters on thier tables and we were seated next to the kitchen. Slight wait for the asparagus. I will say I'm not a fan of our waiter sitting on the bench directly across us to take our order. My husband and I usually sit on the same side of the table. We will be back, looking forward to a better all around experience. Steaks were delicious."}
{"text":"Well, my boyfriend and his two teenage children went to Outback last weekend, at about 7:30 on a Saturday.  We had a brief wait and we were then seated but received no menus.  The waitress (who informed us it was only her second week and she was really busy) then came to take our drink order without menus.  It took her THREE trips to bring 4 drinks.. and forgot straws.. finally I had to ask a hotess for a darn straw after waiting 15 minutes.  Finally, she came and took our order.. we had an app and ordered salads and soup.  The app came about 20 minutes later.. we deperately needed refills and plates! NOTHING CAME! Again, we asked a hostess.  The manger at this point was walking around.. talking to people and then proceeded to talk to the FOUR hostess standing around.  Then, a half hour to 45 minutes later.. the soup and salads arive.  STONE COLD SOUP and no dressing on the salad- we ate it anyway.  Then the entrees come out and she informs us she messed up my order, didnt tell me but chose to subsitute it for something I did NOT order without bringing it to my attention first.  Well, the subsituted food was cold.. VERY cold.  She incorrectly wrote down the tempatures of mine and my boyfriends steak and didnt even break us steak sauce after we asked TWICE- again, we went to a hostess.   About this time, we were 90 minutes into the meal and have gotten refills once (via the hostess) and the food was not only terrible and incorrect but cold.  We left around 9:30.. no manager ever came to talk to us and NOBODY helped this girl on his first week.. it wasnt even that busy but she was sinking and we were just left in the corner to fend for ourselves.  My boyfriend NEVER complains and he was visably upset and we couldnt get out of there fast enough.  We will probably NEVER go into the resturant again.  Its no wonder its never very busy and doesnt get recent or decent reviews- its hidden away at the end of North Prospect for a reason- nobody wants to go there and get bad service and even worse food."}
{"text":"I chose this location rather than Westlake, which is closer to where I live. That should show how amazing this location is! We called ahead, so we only had a 20 minute wait. We enjoyed our drinks at the bar while we waited. & the bartender was extremely nice & she made our drinks very well. Our servers name was Shawn. He's extremely funny & checks on you extra, but not too much. He makes sure you're taken care of & more !! I love having a server that loves their job, it really does make that much of a difference. Especially with chain restaurants. The food was phenomenal! I got the aged cheddar burger & my man got steak with Mac & cheese & mashed potatoes. I'm a big fan of garlic & my burger called for it. You could definitely taste it! Same with the Mac & cheese!! Also, you see the manager walking around a lot to make sure the guests are satisfied. I'd recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding! Everything we ordered was a little extra salty, but if was still good... I ordered the largest steak on the menu and added a lobster tail... The lobster tail was over seasoned and not that great... Should have ordered just the regular steamed lobster tail.  The steak cam and it was 60% fat... Ate what I could but still felt jipped... I just mentioned to the waiter that it was way too fatty of a steak... The manager came over, looked at the leftover steak/fat... Apologized immediately, said she would take it off our bill and asked if I wanted another kind on the house... I didn't as I was full from the appetizers, soup, bread and overseas one lobster tail....  The service was amazing... The food, rob ably 3 out of 5 stars.... Hope it was just a fluke...."}
{"text":"Wow who would have thought it!!!!! We went to dinner here for my sons girlfriends birthday an I have to say I was impressed. I think this is the best outback I have been to in Vegas so far an it's on the strip go figure . Everything we ordered was cooked perfectly from the blooming onion to the steaks. I had a filet mignon medium an it was perfect. The flavor was so good  no steak sauce needed. The salad an baked potato were also very good. Everyone else's food was cooked perfectly an very good as well. The customer service was spot on. Our server an Jordan who brought our food were perfect always making sure we had everything checking in us often. Very impressed. I can honestly say that I will be back to this Outlander even thought it's on the strip. I highly recommend this one to everyone."}
{"text":"Slowest Outback ever! After waiting 10mins we weren't offered drinks let alone were we acknowledged. Ended up leaving to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"The blooming onion was SALTY! I don't know if it's meant to be this salty or if some one spilled salt on it by mistake, but it was toooo salty. Inedible."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Took a long time to get seated. (Called ahead) still waited 20 minutes. Then we were forgotten about...the server assigned our table did not now she had our Table.  After about 30 minutes we ask a passing server if we could get some drinks...that's when they realized we had been forgotten. Food was slow to come out, some was not right and one steak was extremely grisly ...left 50 percent on plate...mentioned to server, she said that's how they usually are. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place still does not quality for a decent review as the food is just mediocre, bland, and service is horrible.  You know you have a real issue when ribs are hard to get off the bone and don't taste good with rich flavoring.  Our steak was cooked well done but tasted like rubber and the lobster tail was decent, but not the savory taste it should have been.  Twenty minute wait for unworthy food is unacceptable in any manner and doesn't deserve a return visit.  What was I thinking?!"}
{"text":"Over the last few years, the service has been subpar. A lot of times the waiter will take forever to bring out drinks, and there's been multiple times that it's been almost an hour when the food finally arrives. You'll get a burger with fries and ask for ranch when it comes out and you'll be 3/4 of the way done with your meal by the time it gets to you. The waiters and staff have all been very friendly and nice but my only problem is the slow service."}
{"text":"Good food, but good service depends on luck! Went there 2 days ago, got seated quickly ordered drinks, beer and margarita (margarita was average) my husbands food came and my side of mac and cheese came but my steak and shrimp where MIA they found my steak under the heat lamp and brought it to me well well well done....so i sent it back. Food was good once i got everything that i ordered waitress gave me free carrot cake for the mix up of my dinner. At the end of our experience i was happy"}
{"text":"I'm extremely sad to be giving Outback Steakhouse only one star. Seriously have loved this place for years. I also haven't been in awhile and I've never been to this location, so perhaps my bad experience is a just a one-off experience.   First, the place is really grundgy. They seriously need to shut down one day and clean that place up. Everything seemed old and depressed, but most importantly dirty.  Secondly, our server Osman had the WORST attitutde. I tried to joke around with him because we had a large party and I felt that he was overwhelmed, but really, he was just a server with a bad attitude. He said a couple of insulting things to me and I honestly started to make excuses for him and was, at one point, trying to make HIM have a better experience?!  He was so slow in taking orders and giving refills that I ended up going to the bar for my drinks. He would then run over to me and ask me if I needed anything. I'm wondering why he didn't ask me that at the table? Oh and he NEVER pre-bussed so all of our dirty dishes were stacked up all around us while we tried to visit and eat dessert.   Third, our food was horrible. I ordered the crab/avocado app and it tasted old and really greasy. I didn't even eat it. Food came out wrong, tasteless and just horrible.   Finally, when it came to our bill, Osman was unable to split the check for our large party. He kept getting the bill wrong and finally he just threw out a number and said I owed that, even though I clearly showed him he was wrong. I had a toddler with me, so just overpaid and we left.   Sad to say, I will NEVER be back to this location again."}
{"text":"Only my second maybe third time in life in Outback. I came late because that's how I roll. I really don't enjoy a crowd.  Headed straight for the bar which was pleasantly open. Kayla was my bartender, made me a flavored ice tea because I didn't want water or regular unsweetened ice tea. Cheers to that and then she made the the huckleberry moonshine cocktail, only 140 calories. My meal was a 11oz center cut steak, sweet potato and brocoli and cheese. All the food was deliciously seasoned. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I have been eating at outback around the country for years and this is the first time I have eaten at Outback in Las Vegas.  OMG.   The staff is so professional, the food is so exceptional, and the location was clean and creating a nice place to eat with family and friends.  The server was awesome, always attentive to the needs of my table and very helpful to the others at the table on what to order.  Me, I'm a Shrimp on the barbie kinda a guy \"yum\", an awesome filet, and a loaded potato!    My compliments to the kitchen, great food prep, out in a timely manner, served hot and was delicious.   Keep up the good work and definitely recommend to all at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Haven't been to an Outback in a while.  Not going back anytime soon  The good - Call Ahead Seating worked perfectly (party of 8) and the Blooming Onion  The rest - server wasn't having a good night and it showed.   One salad came out only after asking if it was missed.  A child's meal (chicken fingers) didn't make it with the the other meals.  Two of the steaks were \"chewy\" (I couldn't finish mine) and a chicken sandwich was sent back for being Under cooked.     Outback used to be a favorite of ours.  Too many other good choices to waste going back."}
{"text":"Great food fantastic service! Lee g, our waiter was awesome! Definitely worth every penny"}
{"text":"If you play the Lottery, Outback Pineville is the steakhouse for you!  To-go or in the restaurant, seems no one is watching the kitchen or the wait staff?  It's the little things, like keeping soft drinks topped off?  It's the silly things like the Management leaving the to-go wait staff to \"fall on their sword\" with lame excuses rather than reasons for a Corporate app that makes food side offerings (green beans) available that are NOT available at Pineville? Obviously, something easily fixed if someone cared.   It's the BIG things like to-go orders being incomplete?  It's the BIGGER thing, a steakhouse that can't cook a steak to your requested doneness?  And probably the BIGGEST thing, GM \"C\" who may need to go back to a food service environment that tolerates her mediocrity?   At the end of the day, a generally solid restaurant choice but continued miscues may cause you to take your hard earned dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I just ate at Outback with my husband, mother, and son and I left unhappy. I've been a server for many years and when I go out to eat I try to make it easy on my server but I was totally unhappy with the service we had tonight. Maybe 3 to 4 minutes after I got my french onion soup and my mother and husband their salads the food came out. So my husband didn't eat his salad because he didn't want his steak to get cold. I on the other hand finished my soup so my salmon was cold by the time I was ready to eat it. And to top it off the server never pre bussed our table  so we had no room. And our waitress would disappear. So having salad plates, dinner plates, empty cups and drinks on the table was more than frustrating. Honestly the food never disappoints me so I took my food home but service was definitely lacking.  Unfortunate dining experience tonight."}
{"text":"Other than being nearly impossible to get to, in the fact that you pretty much HAVE to drive on the strip to get here, this Outback is awesome.  Inside Casino Royale but upstairs so not in the middle of the slot action, this Outback stays open late.  Our party of 7 showed up at like 10pm on a Thursday night, and we were seated pretty quickly.  Food was all really good.  In fact, the Outback special my friend got was tastier than any Outback special I've had at any other location, and I've been to a lot of Outback's in my day.  I had the Mahi Mahi, which was really good quality but somewhat flavorless.  Definitely a great option when you have a big party and you all want steaks without going broke!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was extremely surprised by the tacos on the lunch menu... They are great and our server menet was wonderful."}
{"text":"I only gave this Outback Steakhouse a 1 star only because our server was good. But my complaint is that as a person with special needs with a service dog that I keep with me. I called outback earlier that day and made sure that it was ok to bring in my service dog. When me and my family sat down at our table I was told that by the manager Doug that my dog had to be somewhere else and that he needed to go. Which made me very nervous and uncomfortable which made my anxiety act up and caused me to shake uncontrollably because I was told that my service dog couldn't be with me next to me (which he sat quietly and didn't bother any customers or waiters). Even the man in the table next to me had to console me and tell me that the manager was out of line.   I will never come back to this place of business and I will be sure to let friends and family know how horrible Doug was to me and my family. The way he spoke to me was sick and disgusting as a person with special needs."}
{"text":"I have ordered \"to-go\" from Outback many times, my orders are accurate and timely.  Tonight the service was fantastic and the food was even better.  I love being able to order good food, receive good service and pricing was decent.  I order to-go at least twice a month and The Outback has not let me down.  Steak was cooked to perfection and the chicken was juicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Dear Outback,      What happened? Gone are the days where I could count on you for a decent, perfect temperature steak that I would basically take home because I had already eaten a whole loaf of your delicious bread. Even your tangy tomato dressing doesn't titillate me any longer.      Now, we've gotten into the pattern of weird service, and under/over cooked dishes. I'm not sure what the final straw was. Perhaps the skewer of shrimp you \"upselled\" to me, and then served raw.   I'm afraid that our relationship is reduced to a stop in for a sweet, icy Wallaby Darned before heading out for a meal.   Best wishes for better dishes,   Kelly"}
{"text":"This new location is great! Steaks are always delicious! We had a bad experience with the hostess seating people before us who had come in after us. The hostess explained that they were 'regulars' so they received preferred seating. My husband complained to the manager who later haves us dinner and dessert on the house. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Service was good. They had some issues with the food like mashed potatoes seemingly made with just potatoes. .. they were crumbling... The cook must have been checking the score for the big game and forgot. .. milk or cream and butter... oops! But staff was on top of the issues and took care of it."}
{"text":"The best place when it comes to outback. Perfectly grilled outback will surprise you, its very tempting, its juicy looking will make you really crave for it. A bite on it will make you realize how soft this meat is, every chew was very good. The best steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience when dining here. Gregory did a fantastic job serving us , he's very attentive and friendly. The no rules Parmesan pasta is my favorite! We will be back!!! Mwahaha"}
{"text":"The best outback in town The service is always excellent... I mean I just love how friendly and genuinely welcoming everybody is here (hostess and servers) , food is super tasty, and the environment is very comfortable . I just love it here :)"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Outback. Service is slow, and last 2 times we were there, we have had to ask for silverware after our meal came. Pass this one by. Black Angus is not much better with their service, but it is down the road, as well as other places around the mall for steak."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and lobster. The dinner salad was nice and cold and fresh. The steak and lobster was hot and delicious. Great food great service. Look forward to our next visit. Thank you Outback for making my wife and my dinner a great experience."}
{"text":"So it's a chain, which means I'm not expecting awesomeness. That said, I'm glad I had a gift card. If I had to pay the whole thing outta pocket, I may have been a bit more peeved.   The reviews below aren't over exaggerations. It's hilarious how on point each one was. Since I went through them today just cuz, I knew ahead of time that the service was \"found lacking\" by a ton of people. So I tried to compensate, and since I was meeting family there and knowing they'd want water, I attempted ordering waters all around so they wouldn't have to wait like we did. My husband and I got our waters after sitting there at our table for 20 minutes, and the waitress never brought out the extra waters requested. My family got there and got to wait another 20 minutes for their water. Refills were basically nonexistent after that.   After about an hour of being there total, we finally got an appetizer, the second one making it out after another 25 min. I had had the waitress take our food order at the same time as the appetizer since I knew they seemed to be having problems with taking forever with everything, but even so, we still ended up waiting another hour for our food to get to us.   I know it's a steak house, but I wanted a burger, and the burger was pretty dang disgusting. Oh well. We only had to wait another 20 minutes for the waitress to bring out the check, and thus ended our visit.   Everyone was nice though. No weird attitudes or anything. The waiters/waitresses just tended to disappear and not come back."}
{"text":"Outback surprised me. My girlfriend has a favorite salad there that she was craving one night so I went along. It struck me as a little strange that my vegetarian girlfriend would even have Outback Steakhouse on her radar, but I suppose stranger things have happened.   Anyhow, so we get there and it is just as cheeseball corporate as it can be, but I'm ok with that. Then our server turns out to be super nice and she recommends some appetizers that turn out to be really good and even my girlfriend's salad was tasty.   Word to the wise: don't be shaken by the corporation. Outback is for real."}
{"text":"It was only my second visit to outback probably my last service was very slow took forever to get refills on drinks. Food was ok portion size was disappointing I got 7 fries with my order. my wife ordered a side of vegetables with her meal and they didn't come till she was almost done with her meal. Not worth the 40 dollars I spent."}
{"text":"Visit date 3/24/17  Where do I begin..... FOOD: First let me start off by saying that I went to an event and was able to taste some of the items on the new menu and It WAS so good that I wanted to take my family so they could taste the items and get that same experience with the food also.... WELL....I had the Toowoomba shrimp with the blue cheese pecan salad and a sweet potato. I asked my waitress for my salmon to be cooked medium. It came back cooked well done with a crunchy top and everything. The salad is soaked with dressing and not many pecans. My husband said his steak was cooked perfect but a little to salty. We did not get our bread until like 2 mins before the food come out. And the waitress put the bead on top of a empty plate that our appetizer was in. See the video. She never came back to remove the empty dishes, we had a table full of empty plates. See photo and video.   Inside: I don't think Outback thought this restaurant out that much. You put a restaurant in the middle of the parking lot by the mall. The waiting area is not big enough. Because it was cold outside no one was standing outside. Myself and my family was standing by people who was at a table eating (in the bar area), I felt bad but we had no where else to stand.  We got there when the mall was still open, So parking was a HOT MESS!!! We drove around for about 10 mins looking for parking near Outback.   PLUS POINTS: They had someone going around offering the customer that was waiting to be seating a slice of chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"Several years ago I would have given this place 4-5 stars probably.  This location has been here for a long time and may very well be one of the first Outback Steakhouse's in the area.  I've got no major complaints on the menu items.  I particularly like their salads mostly because they actually serve them chilled (which every place should do!)  I've also had the small steak filet and my favorite is the talapia lump crab meat dish.  Also that's the lowest calorie plate on the menu...FYI.    My biggest gripe is that over time the servings have become smaller...boo!  Also, they hardly ever have drink specials....another boo!  That being said, I will always have to come here b/c my daughter absolutely loves the Mac-A-Roo-ni and Cheese kids meal.....so I'll see you again shortly.....lol :)"}
{"text":"I had to wait my food for 40 min  We even bring utensils from other table  We want something we had to wait for few min...  I wanted give them 0 star but I can't so..."}
{"text":"Stop for lunch.  We order an ouback special.   So gross,  actually tasted rotten like rotten cheese.   When we smelled it we realized it was rotten.  Don't poison yourself at this place.  Fat nasty manager offered us another rotten steak from the same bucket, no thanks."}
{"text":"I just went to outback tonight with my family, and the food was absolutely the worst. I order a burger medium well with just a little pink when I got it, it was all pink and my bum was as hard as a rock and I had a piece of bone inside my burger.. My dad had ordered a steak, when he got It was very raw it was probably still mooing when they put it on the plate, it's like they put it on the grill for a minute on each side and then put it on the plate. I will never go back to this outback i can't believe how bad our food was, we go there all time and this time was just the worst. I won't recommend this place to anybody. Very disappointed in outback!"}
{"text":"Service was good- drinks refilled before empty, plates taken when done with them, orders were all correct. However, the food was slow to come out. I tried the tortilla soup for the first time and it was surprisingly good- will definitely have it again."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout a couple weeks ago.  I was craving ribs however I was really disappointed once I tasted them.  They were way too salty.  We could barely eat them.  My husband thinks Outback food has always been too salty.  I guess he was right."}
{"text":"Love this place. My fiancé and I come here at least once a week. They never let us down. Great quality of meat!  Always have drink specials. and the staff is extremely knowledgable about the menus.   My advice is to sit in the bar area. Every works together as a team in that area - you will get premium service.   My tip - Victoria's Filet, medium, wood fired! If your not a streak eater the fish tacos were unique and yummy!  If you're not watching what you eat get the steakhouse Mac n Cheese!"}
{"text":"SSSoooo \"chain\" restaurant. Generic, overly salted and way overpriced. I don't eat beef, so maybe that's why I don't get it (I ordered salmon)."}
{"text":"Oh blooming onion... So bad but oh so good! Sometimes they do NASCAR specials on Mondays with a free blooming onion if their driver places in the top 10."}
{"text":"The \"McDonalds\" of steakhouses, near fast food quality at slightly higher fast food prices. Service here although not rude, fairly friendly actually but slower than turtles and not accurate order takers either. I have been to this location several times, including during construction and they were sorry for that inconvenience, but that was least of the inconveniences. If a server takes your order and brings the order to you when it is painfully obvious it is not correct, it is the servers fault... not the cooks, they cook did not bring the improper meal to me, and if they do not care about accuracy then do not expect a decent tip. NOBODY likes for a person in your party to not have the food in front of them while everybody does...then what?  either everyone waits politely until the order is fixed while the food cools off right in front of you OR rudely and awkwardly eat your while the one person watches everyone else. Atleast with this option the person without food has the floor to talk and not be interrupted which is ok, but what if this person happens to be on of the types with a grating annoying voice who is spouting glibly uninteresting annoying drivel??  The food here is average at best, and I have never seen a place that cooks steaks that does not know what the definition of medium is. Not Bloody not dry is pretty simple to me. The garlic shrimp is dry more often than not and not only do I not know why I keep ordering it, I do not know why I keep coming here (Actually I do but family likes it so that part is not Outbacks fault). If I was a real man I would tell my family off until they pick someplace good, but that is problematic because the other go to joint for them is Olive Garden which I can not stand. So in Closing, I very mediocre meal from time to time helps ground us so we could appreciate a really good meal when we have the chance to have one."}
{"text":"I have to admit if I had done this review a month ago I would have done 2 stars. We have been to this location several times and each time we have gone they have been out of prime rib. Tonight we got our dinner to go and it was late 9:15 when we ordered so I expected them not to have prime rib, but.... They did! They cooked everything perfect the gal at curbside was super awesome! Will definitely be back to give it another shot!"}
{"text":"I have to say, Linda, our server could teach Flemmings Town Square a thing or two!! Came here tonight with the Bf for dinner. The food was as expected...came out hot and tasted good, but the service was what really garnered the 4 stars. Our server, linda C was quick attentive, checked on us promptly, yet was not intrusive. My glass was topped off and she was on the ball. I took a moment to speak with the manager and pass on the praise because lets face it, we dont praise as much as we should!  This location will remain on my list for a good value meal with excellent service."}
{"text":"Too good to pass up. Fried rice and beef plates are the best here. Lettuce wraps for an appetizer with chicken are a really great start as well"}
{"text":"Always a favorite but tonight the steak melted in my mouth. What a great meal on such a cold -24f night. Our waitress couldn't have been better, honestly I'll have to add her name later. We got seated right away, appetizers were delicious! I'll be back very soon"}
{"text":"I took my Mom to dinner tonight and had very long wait from appetizer to dinner coming, then tough rare steak was brought after I asked waitress for update. Medium well was ordered which waitress confirmed from ticket. Manager Joey brought same steak back cut up saying they handle these situations with ''Cook up'' which looked dry and surface cooked. ''No Thanks'' this was very disappointing as I go in every couple weeks with good results. They removed from check but I left hungry and irritated at the long wait when they were not very busy along with lack of understanding and confusion. It will be hard to go back."}
{"text":"We used to live going to the outback for an outback special.  Well after last night we won't be going back soon. The ceasar salad was drenched in dressing and the steak was initially way undercooked for a medium as was my wife's. The second steak had no taste and just did not do justice to what once was an outstanding restaurant. It's a real shame to see how downhill things have gone."}
{"text":"We went on Halloween night for dinner 4 adults and 5 kids.  All the workers were dressed up and we were lucky to be served by Anthony M.  He was dressed up as \"the most interesting man in the world\"!!  He did an outstanding job and were were extremely impressed.  We got a great deal/surprise thy the kids meals were free due to coming on Halloween and we were lucky to win a free future steak meal. This was an awesome end to a fun day!!  Anthony M. was a superstar!! Check out his picture....."}
{"text":"Decent food as a chain.  Staff is excellent, attentive and fixed the minor issues we had spectacularly."}
{"text":"Es war lecker, leider war es nicht genug und ich musste noch etwas nachbestellen. Darum wurde es halt auch teurer. Das Steak wurde genau nach meinem wunsch zubereitet. Es dauerte nicht lange von der Bestellung bis mein Steak serviert wurde. Jeden Mittwoch gibt es ein Steak mit Getränk für unter 10$, jedoch ist dies nur als Vorspeise gedacht."}
{"text":"We came in with a big party. Our server was jasmine and she was great! She was so accommodating for everyone's requests."}
{"text":"Outbacks are my standard fare when I travel.  If i'm alone, and my colleagues aren't there to guide me towards the best Chilean seafood place or Thai wonderment, I go for tried, true, and meaty.  Outback is just that.  It would be hard for me to give an outback less than 4 stars.  Others I know think that's insanely high for a consistently good steak place.  I don't agree.  I'd rate it lower if the service at that location sucked and I'd rate it higher if something insane happened.  Neither were the case tonight.  Outback at this location was great.  Service was great.  Food was great.  'Nuf said."}
{"text":"I like this outback. I now realize I have reviewed outbacks in 2 states..they should hire me as a mystery customer haha...  The place was pretty busy and the hostess sat me right away even though my whole party hadn't arrived..I was grateful but started to feel bad when my serve kept checking in and my family was so sloooow..  Overall the salad I got was pretty good and they kept me full of bread..my son got a good sized burger and they were able to accommodate my FIL's Gluten Free Requests...  Overall, pretty good, pretty quick service, etc..  Writing my reviews is like de ja vu..I need to get out more and not order the same thing every time at the same place haha..creature of habit..."}
{"text":"We went here in {2.25.2016 @ 8:00p} and it wasn't great in my opinion. Yes we were a party of 11, however everyone's food came out warm except those that ordered steak. Now that's just strange to me that you're in a steak house you and steak is cold. I ordered steak tacos, my brother ordered a steak and my God-sister ordered a steak from the kids menu. After already waiting for food for almost 40mins, we had to wait an additional 20 for our food to cook again. My brother and I just had ours Togo, and my God-sister who ended up falling asleep {she's 12 and had to go to school the next day} she had hers to go also. I still did not enjoy our food. I still paid for my meal but I HIGHLY DOUBT that I go back. This wasn't our original choice for dinner, but the wait at the previous restaurant was also very long."}
{"text":"Outback.. don't want to include the \"steakhouse\" in the name simply because they have the hardest time cooking a steak. I have been going to this Outback for many years and let me just tell you.. it's gone so downhill I'm shocked it hasn't closed down yet! The management is probably the most embarrassing thing about this location. They really think that comping meals can magically fix everything with no consequences. For example, my brother and I ordered the same exact cut of steak and both medium rare. Somehow these fools cannot cook a steak correctly. My brothers steak was so well-done it was drier than the Arizona desert. Yes, in my 18 years of life I've been spoiled with the finest steakhouses, but really come on where's the so called \"premium\" cuts they always brag about. People send their food back left and right at this Outback and the kitchen still cannot get it right. Most likely because the management doesn't do shit to help them and will just comp the damn meal to make it \"better\". So one manager Jessica sent it back and later returned with a undercooked steak but my brother was way too hungry to wait for a third. Later on, Andrew the owner came by to chat. He was very rude and unprofessional and stated oh I heard you sent a steak back.. and that was it. No apology from him. I believe his favorite words are umm and like because that's all he included in the little chat he had with us. Probably the worst owner I have ever met. My dad was also with us and he helps run Best Foods of Phoenix. Usually he will talk a bit with the owner but this time around Andrew was not worth his time to have a conversation with about Outback. Oh but don't get me started on the new tablets they have at their tables. By far their worst move yet. Do they really think a tablet can replace a waiter? It's not efficient at all, and the unlimited games for $2. No parent would buy that cause most parents already have games for their kids on the phone. They should really think about getting rid of that system cause I don't want to tip a tablet I want to tip a waiter who checks in from time to time and asks us if we need anything else. You cannot replace that."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Took awhile for a waiter to come to the table. It took 40 minutes to get our food and my husbands order of chicken tacos ended up fish tacos. Got the waiter back and told him. We didn't have time to wait for a new order so we ended up sharing my shrimp. The waiter filled my husbands water glass 3 times and never asked me if I wanted more ice tea. What food we had was good. They weren't that busy so I don't know why it took so long to get our food"}
{"text":"I Got served great meat. Very good quality for the price.  Probably the only place on place on the strip where you can eat without paying out your ears.   Our server appeared to be quite new but was very eager to help out and fix any issue."}
{"text":"Where else can you dine next to Flavor Flav?  It's the Outback. It's a franchise. It's a great place to get steak and lobster!  The hubby and I frequently visit this location and the service is always great. The one time it wasn't, I didn't even have to say anything and we were offered free dessert. Props to management for recognizing that our food took forrrrrrever to come out that time.   I love that for $12.99, I can get a well seasoned, well executed 8 oz steak and 3 large coconut shrimp. This special is not always offered but I was super happy with this addition. The bread is amazing, the salad is great and the garlic mashed potatoes makes me happy.   During happy hour they have some pretty good deals on alcohol of all types.   Although there are so many options for steak in Las Vegas, I love the overall combined meal that you can get at Outback. Plus it's cheap!"}
{"text":"Came in for the endless soup and salad lunch...no big surprises there...its soup and its salad...Brandon (at the bar) did not offer to bring more of either...fine enough...didn't really need/want more...cool enough bought me a beer....friendly and attentive service!!"}
{"text":"I'm an Outback fan.  Not only do they have my name on the ladies' restroom door (\"Sheilas\"...yeah, bad joke I know...), but they have pretty darn good food for a fair price.  I had one of the best steaks of my life at this outback about a year and a half ago.  It was tender, melt in your mouth, deliciousness.  Since that steak, I've still been a fan of their filet, but they can be a bit inconsistent.  My mother and I both ordered our steaks medium, yet hers came out of the kitchen practically still moo-ing while mine was well done.  All in all though, it's a good steak, at a good price, with good service.  The sides are really amazing here.  Get the sweet potato with all the toppings (butter, brown sugar, yumminess).  You won't regret it.  The wedge salad has HUGE chunks of blue cheese (hint:  save them for your steak!  you'll save a couple bucks and make a good steak even better!) and the combination of the creamy blue cheese dressing with balsamic vinegar drizzled on top is mouthwatering.    They can be PACKED on the weekends, so come with a good book.  I believe that they are going to start an online check in ahead service soon to cut down the wait, but not entirely sure about that.  With other steakhouses and restaurants opening just down the street it will be interesting to see how Outback continues to perform.  That being said, I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Only here to use gift card we received. So expensive for what you get and the service. Fries are the saltiest I have ever had. I'm not eating them. Awful. The rib and chicken combo was alright otherwise and the Mac and cheese is good. Not the best Mac and cheese but it passes."}
{"text":"Second time at this new outback steakhouse. My patron magarita was perfectly made and my ribeye was expertly medium rare. My sister ordered the prime rib and between the two of us we had such an amazing meal we walked out in a food coma. The waitress we had was very kind and offered us great advice on the menu. Thanks for a delicous late lunch outback! :)"}
{"text":"Congrats to the cooks Eric and Estevan. My steak was out of this world. I sat at the bar and had great service. Matt J and Rod were the best at the bar. Best steak at a house. Roud House who!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered online for curbside to go. Our steaks were cold and dry. They were so tough to cut. We ordered the VICTORIA'S FILET® MIGNON & LOBSTER, which was most definitely not a filet and the lobster was the size of a shrimp. Very disappointing. The side dishes were delicious and so was the complementary bread and butter. Customer service was great, as soon as we pulled up, someone came out with our order. I appreciated that. I wouldn't recommend curbside to go but maybe dine-in would serve freshly made steaks."}
{"text":"We will be back after a night of great service, delicious food, and a wonderful environment. Thank you to Tiffany (I believe), the manager for making sure my steak came out correctly. The medium wings were a perfect appetizer along side there brown bread. Lastly, the asparagus and broccoli were the perfect combination with my sirloin steak. We didn't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. However the service was very slow, an appetizer arrived without sauce, water not refilled, dishes stacked up due to a lack of bussing. Dinner for 3 took more than 2 hours. When we left after dessert, there were still dinner dishes, bread, and empty glasses on the table. This saddens me, because I love the food."}
{"text":"Seeking steaks that are grilled to perfection? Want a calm atmosphere with friendly staff? Then come to the Outback on Southern and McClintock! Although it may be pricey, the food is definitely top notch. I ordered the surf and turf shrimp and sirloin and it was freakin' awesome! Additionally I had the baked potato and house salad. Both were also delightful. Hopefully I can come back soon!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner and got a booth right away. I was surprised there wasn't a wait. Our waitress was friendly, she could've improved on her attentiveness. My husband had to go looking for her for some condiments, and I would've liked a refill on my drink. All of our meals were great, no complaints there! I don't come here often but when I do I make sure to order a salad so I can have their mustard vinagrette! Their loaded baked potato soup is excellent too!"}
{"text":"I eat at the Outback Steakhouse on Stephanie about once per week and have always had consistently excellent food, service, and  a great overall experience. I highly recommend this location. Call ahead seating on the weekends for sure.  The bar area has open seating at a couple of long high tops. I breeze right to that area on a regular basis while others wait.  Nick at the bar is particularly awesome! All of the staff are great. Hard to beat this place for overall value and great food and service."}
{"text":"We have been to this location on about 3 or 4 occasions and have never had a bad experience.  The servers are always friendly.   I had the steak and lobster special, the outback steak was cooked medium and was very tender and tasted excellent.  The lobster was steamed and stuck to the shell a little bit, but once i got it loose, it tasted good with butter. Not bad for $16.99.  We will continue to eat at Outback on occasion."}
{"text":"We ate there Monday with a group of people. Robbie took great care of us.  Friendly service and we never waited for anything. All the food was done as requested and generally tasted good.  Will definitely be back to this location more frequently knowing that they're training their staff well."}
{"text":"Have always searched for an Outback when staying in a new location.  However, after dinner the other night I may have to change that option.  Both of us ordered the special Sirloin mine was suppose to be medium hers was med rare. Both came rare also it came in slices 5 slices 1/4\" thick and tougher than shoe leather.  Don't know what was going on in the kitchen but the cut slices were with the grain and not against it which would have made it more palette able.  Long story short we left and went down the road.  However I have to give kudos to our waiter who still got a nice tip for his service and the manager for his help over this. Sad to say this was my last visit to Outback they used to be #1 in my travel book  now they are out completely don't know if they were bought out or what but the quality is down at the several I have been to in many states."}
{"text":"1st time at this location and It past my expectations! The service was superb and the food was great! I had the wings, and they were as good as I remembered from the 90's! I definitely be back! Wifey's food was also great so no complaints here, she had the surf & turf great job Outback!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night.  A little slow getting started but it was Friday night at 7pm and the waiter was sincerely apologetic for the delay.    Bread was hot and fresh and house salad with blue cheese was simple but excellent!   The filet and mashed potatoes were good but the all you can eat shrimp was great!!   Preferred the fried shrimp with cocktail but the scampi shrimp and buffalo sauce were also winners.   Needless to say we were stuffed and enjoyed our meal.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure I like this outback, did curbside tonight had to call three times kept getting hung up. Hope the food is good but not sure about the service.   Love outback as a chain we will be back to outback but not sure it will be this one!!"}
{"text":"I would say this place is just ok...I'm a Rib Lover and after getting the ribs from here I promise you if I come back here again I will avoid the Baby Backs.  But good service & friendly host."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! Last few yikes I've been though there's been a struggle with either the service or the food.    Tonight we were celebrating my birthday.  It was a party of 6 (my hubby, daughter, best friend and in-laws).  We didn't have a long wait and was given one of their large booths. We asked if we could transfer to a nearby table and were accommodated.  Michael was our server.  I think he may have been new because there were some struggles but he handled every single one.  Food was spot on too!  Kudos to the team tonight!"}
{"text":"The food is the same at any Outback. So really the only thing you can judge is service and contrary to other reviews the service was excellent. Prompt, full drinks and quick warm food. Jaclyn was my server."}
{"text":"I am happy to report a redemption story, thanks to great customer service from this location's manager!   Attempting to celebrate my aunt's birthday dinner, a ten person party of us came to Outback. There are many places in this town that we could go to celebrate a birthday, but my aunt is a franchise-fiend. In the past we have had positive experiences with Outback, so fine.   Long story short, we experienced one of the most confusing, slow and disappointing dinner services I have ever had. We arrived later in the evening since we had to accommodate everyone's schedule. Our family is rarely all together and we were easily the largest party in the restaurant, on a very quiet Saturday night.   As my husband and I were preparing to leave, I felt terrible for my aunt as I watched her look at her bill bewilderingly and shell out a large amount of money for an awful dinner and dinner experience.    I am not one to complain unless my service is WAY off of the mark and this event called for it. I spoke to the manager today and explained the situation. I let him know that we are willing to return, but we want a different experience than what we had.   When I arrived to meet with the manager this evening, I was concerned because the hostess returned to tell me that it would be 15-20 min. before he could meet with me, as they were \"really busy.\" Yeah, so am I. And we've already paid.   Instead, the manager was out to meet with me within 5 minutes. He quickly rectified the situation and we were able to receive gift certificates to have a redeux of my aunt's gathering.   Five stars for the manager's response to our circumstances."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the takeout service!  Our food was cold like it had been sitting for a while , I paid for it online then my friend picks it up and had to pay for it because it wasn't payed for!  Will never use there order online again!!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review because the manager, Danny, really went above and beyond to reach out to me, understand the events and ensure this would not happen again in the future. The level of customer service that Danny provided during our discussion is what I expect from Outback Steakhouse. Thanks Danny!"}
{"text":"Mediocre chain fast-food. Mashed potatoes were so salty, first bite into my crab cake was a shell. My Caesar salad was frozen and tasted terrible. Thankfully you can't mess up a steak. Peach Bellini was mediocre, barely any alcohol. Atmosphere at this location is just blah, and will hopefully be better once remodel is complete. Doubt we will come back to find out. Will go to BJs next time"}
{"text":"I have never been to Outback before but we had relieved $50 worth of gift cards to Outback for xmas & thought it might be fun to end my birthday weekend with a nice dinner. My boyfriend figured there would be a wait so when we were told it would be a 20 min wait for a table we were not surprised. We decided to head to the bar to wait for our table but within in 5 min the pager for our table was lighting up. The bartender was in the middle of filling our drink order but assured us they would not give our table away.  But they did.  However, the hostess profusely apologized & assured us we would have a table in minutes, which we did, so we weren't all that upset.  When we got our table,being my 1st time, we had to order the Blooming Onion. My boyfriend jokingly said \"If it's not perfect it's going back\". But when it came it WAS perfect! Very good. We ordered our dinner; my boyfriend got the sirloin & lobster(grilled) & I decided to get, from the special menu, the crab stuffed mushrooms (appetizer as an entree) & the classic wedge salad.  When dinner came I had not received the salad. I let them know & within minutes it came. Unfortunately, I forgot a wedge salad traditionally does come with bacon, which I don't care for so I sent it back. Although I had not specified that I had not wanted bacon when I ordered the waitress  took it back happily & courteously. With in minutes I had a replacement sans bacon.  Our meal was excellent the sirloin & lobster was grilled to perfection. The crab stuffed mushrooms & wedge salad also very good. In the middle of our meal the manager came to our table to apologize and comped part of our meal, even though we never complained. This to me shows the ultimate in customer service .  Things don't always go perfect, that's just life. But a company that not only pays attention to the customer experience but proactively accommodates when things don't go perfect gets five stars in my book. We are already making plans to go back!"}
{"text":"I like Outback.  Generally speaking, it serves a decent filet for a chain restaurant.  The Aussie cheese fries and the wings are consistently good.  That said, this particular Outback was a disappointment when it came to the steaks.  The spice coating was overpowering plus the meat tended to be on the overcooked side and dried out.    Still, in all fairness, the service was friendly and attentive---no complaints there."}
{"text":"I was not in the mood to make dinner and we were all craving something other than the usual so we decided to head into Outback Steakhouse. I've only been to Outback Steakhouse a handful of times and this was my first time at this place.   The waiting area was crowded...and it was a weeknight?  Ugh!  Waiting around for a table on weeknight when you have kids in tow is not fun.  So while we waited...or rather so I can put up with the wait, my husband walked over to the bar to order a cocktail.  Luckily the bartender mixed up a fabulous \"House\" Margarita on the rocks. Then we waited...and waited...and waited...for our table. So when we saw the hostess looking for \"someone\" we finally asked, \"Did you call our name yet?\"  And they said, \"Yes, just a minute ago.\"...Well, guess what? Our pager was not working. I have to say the greeter at the door was very friendly and apologetic for the wait but I was a bit annoyed.  Our waitress seemed a bit tired and not overly enthusiastic to be there, but she was pleasant.  I'm sure it had been a long night.  I overheard another waitress apologize to her table for the food taking too long.  I thought, \"Oh no!  Not good!\" How am I going to continue to keep these kids busy?  So the nice thing is that there are kids activity menus and crayons..and our iphones to keep them from complaining (the cocktail was to keep me from complaining).  We ordered and it took a while for the drinks and bread to come out.  However, the food did not take too long.  Portions are a bit small-but very tasty.  Macaroni and cheese fabulous, steak cooked to perfection, pork medallions very yummy, new Asian salmon very good, grilled shrimp small but tasty and kids meals which included a grilled cheese for my picky eater all good and kids steak medallions.  Kids loved the complimentary warm mini loaf of bread.  The waitress was nice enough to offer more if we wanted...of course the Peanut Gallery in unison said, \"More please!\"  We had a few kid leftovers but without the appetizer we had lots room to finish our meals.  I think for the value and taste it's not bad but the wait was just too long for a weeknight family outing, next time I'll just go to Chili's."}
{"text":"You have to try the grilled pineapple rita!! The hickory smoke salt makes the drink. Ryan T was my server tonight he was very friendly had great jokes and always check in on my date and me. Great service! I enjoy the filet and lobster tail. Thank you Ryan!"}
{"text":"What can you say...its a good mid-level steak chain...if you have seen the commercials, that pretty much covers it...its not The Palm or Capital Grill but its solid for a quick steak & potatoes and has locations just about everywhere."}
{"text":"Service is always great at this location. I love the Crab Avocado Stack and it keeps me and my family coming back. Still a fan!"}
{"text":"I really like Outback.  For the money, it is probably the best bet around for steak.  Of course it isn't exceptional like a great steakhouse, but for the price it gets the job done.  Plus their aussie cheese fries are great."}
{"text":"Blooming onion was a grease pit. The burger was over cooked and dry. It also had a tomato but instead of a nice red slice of tomato. The waiter acted like he could not be bothered with the complaint. It was difficult to get refills on drinks. The manager acted like he didn't care. Why has this chain not closed yet with its 19th ' menu. I will say the place was clean. Although I have seen cleaner bathrooms in a gas station."}
{"text":"Dinner was really good. Amber was amazing. She was prompt and always smiling all thru a very busy night."}
{"text":"I had a $25 gift card and finally decided to use it. I'd never been and hadn't heard much about it. We were sat promptly but they waitress didn't show up for a good 20 mins. Ordered the wings, they came \"dry-rub\" style ...different but good. Took about 45 to get the 2 burgers we ordered. Mind you we didn't feel like burgers but with their 3 page menu (including app/drinks/deserts) there wasn't much of a choice. Definitely won't go back. What is it similar to? Think a 10 times downgraded version of Chili's ."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill, loved outback back in the day, now the food is blan and overpriced"}
{"text":"Outback is one of the good chains where you can actually enjoy a good meal. The decor has an emphasis on \"Australia\" I guess since I've never been there  there's usually a wait on the weekends, but everything runs smoothly, you can sip some complimentary lemonade from the pitcher at the front door or order wine from the bar. Food comes out consistently good and the servers are polite. The parking lot here is shared with carabbas so it may take a minute to find your spot."}
{"text":"Great place to go. As long as it's not too busy and loud.  The food is always great. The ribs are smashing! Blooming onion for appetizer. Oh yeah! I really like the crab legs and the Maui Maui too. Only complaint. One little loaf a bread the size of a Betty Crocker microwave oven toy doesn't work with a ton of family or friends.  Other then that, skip rush hour with snowbirds , then it's fantastic !"}
{"text":"We came here after my grandma's funeral with 15 of us. We made a reservation which I highly recommend doing. Our waitress was very on top of things and had help from the other servers.  We ordered the lobster shrimp spicy appetizer (can't remember the name) when it came out the serving size seemed pretty small... Without us saying anything they brought out a second one for free.  For there being a large group of us they got our food pretty quick and she even remembered who ordered what.  The food was really good. I could eat the asparagus all day. Everyone's steaks were cooked how they ordered them and they were quick to refill drinks. With it being a sad occasion it was nice that we didn't have to worry about our service at dinner.  If you can get Richard as your server do! He is the best!"}
{"text":"Love this location. Have been here several times and will continue to come back. The food is phenomenal and the service is outstanding.   Will be sure to visit for more than special Occasions."}
{"text":"We was there around 2 pm. It was good time to have late lunch coz No many people inside of restaurants  It was easy to park the car too Our waiter recommended lobster and steak for $16  It's come with soup or salad  They made my steak perfectly and lobster was good size too We was really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Valerie was my server tonight and she did an awesome job. The food came out exactly the way I wanted it and with perfect speed of service. I never even had to wonder about if I needed something before she was there to ask if I needed anything else. Her recommendations were also perfect for my dining experience. I definitely recommend this Outback to anyone"}
{"text":"They undercooked both our steaks but more than made up for it. Everything was amazing and I didn't realize outback was that good lol"}
{"text":"Talk about a deal! Their Wednesday 9.99 special is amazing! We have Gone a few times with great fast service! Makes date night enjoyable and affordable!"}
{"text":"My third favorite steakhouse. They have the best blooming onion and green vegetable selections with brocolli, string beans, and asparagus. Texas Roadhouse edges them in the steak department. Outback also had the better mushrooms. Delfrisco's has the best steak with a steak called the Wygul but it is pricey. The front entrance position is a little weird to me. That's just my 2 cent."}
{"text":"The bread is always great and the server was excellent, especially when we had a birthday girl in our party and wanted to surprise her with a dessert. But, the reason I did not give 5 stars was because the first time I had the garlic butter filet medallions it was perfectly medium rare, but this last time, it was medium well."}
{"text":"This will probably be the last time we go to this location. The customer service was awful. Our waiter moved at the pace of a snail. First we waited about 10 minutes to even be greeted at our table and to have our drink orders taken. Took so long that we already knew what we wanted for our meal by the time our waiter came to us. Food came out good, everything tasted great. We did have to wait on refills for a while and when we asked for more Bloomin Onion sauce, that took longer than it should have. We were done with our meal and finally about 15 min later, the waiter asked if we needed any boxes. Waited another 10 minutes for 2 boxes. He came out with 1 box. He said, Oops, forgot the other box. We asked him for the check too. Another 5 minutes later, he came back with the box and our check. We were ready to pay for our check, but had to wait another 15 min for him to pick it up. Finally we asked another waiter to take our check. The whole time while we were waiting, we saw a group of waitresses chatting in a circle, not doing anything or helping. Frustrating experience."}
{"text":"We went to Outback today to celebrate my daughter's birthday with a nice steak dinner. We were seated right away but then the wait staff and the manager on duty completely ignored us. We were never even acknowleged,  no one said hi or offered us any water or anything. After15 minutes we got up to leave. We informed the manager on our way out, he offered to take care of us right now but we left. We went to Longhorn Steak house down the road and staff, food and drinks were great there. Don't waste your time with Outback,  go straight to Longhorn. It's worth it"}
{"text":"Always good and regularly go for dinner.... they recently changed their procedures so no walk in around the bar area.... the best part was it was quiet (without screaming kids) and could just drop in.... without the wait.   No more.    So no more outback!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come to Outback for special occasions. Each time we go we are never disappointed and we leave with left overs! Tonight we checked in online so we are on the wait list. We come in and walk straight to our table. Matthew our waiter was quick to greet us and set up our stay at Outback. He got our drinks quickly and helped with our menu choices. Within ten minutes maybe less we were brought our appetizer Calamari. Ohh yes the food was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Our main dishes were brought within ten minutes or so from the appetizer. My wife went with medium rare burger and asparagus grilled with butter. I had pork porterhouse with garlic mash potatoes (which I get every time I go because they are so good) with steamed veggies.  The burger was mouth watering as juices were released into our mouth with each bite. You know a burger is good if you can eat it plain and taste the grill and simple flavors of salt and pepper. My Porterhouse pork was off the hook!! It was so juicy on the inside. Easy to cut and chew with again simple grill flavors with salt and pepper. I did not dress this beautiful piece of meat with anything as it was fantastic naked!! The garlic mash potatoes were awesome as was the steamed veggies.  Thank you Outback and Matthew for providing a \"go to\" restaurant that does not disappoint. Everything was so good for a \"chain\" restaurant that I can now recommend it to others, which is quite a nice change! Prices justify great food, awesome service and left overs. We will be back again for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service & food at its best, love the wings! Steak was cooked the way we ordered it, cocktail  was delicious, overall a good experience for dinner."}
{"text":"Always good food, great service . I always bring my boys here for lunch it's their favorite."}
{"text":"When we arrived we asked to be seated in a booth.  The hostess told us she didn't know how to use the new system and had no idea where anyone would be seated.  One of the servers, I assume, came out to help her and despite asking AGAIN for a booth we were put in the middle of the restaurant in the back.  I asked again and the best he would give us a table by the window.  Our waiter was pleasant and we ordered the filet mignon medium well with baked potato and salads.  Our salads were limp and swimming in dressing.  Our dinner came out and the stead was well done almost to the point of being burnt.  It didn't look like any filet mignon I had eaten.  We told the waitress our meat was extremely over cooked and she said she would have to take our plates to the manager for him to look and decide of it was cooked wrong.  REALLY the manager is going to let me know if my charred meat was over cooked?!!  She wouldn't let us keep the potato as the whole meal had to be returned.  We didn't have time for the nonsense as we were on our way to see a show so we just left.  The baked bread was the best part of the meal.  I would never go back to this location, from start to finish it was a disaster!"}
{"text":"I have only been inside this Outback twice, and on the last visit the service left a bit to be desired. Based on those two experiences, I'd rate this Outback a 3 stars at best.   The food at Outback is consistently ok. Nothing amazing, but good enough and affordable for what you get. I never have issues with my steak not being cooked properly, nor the quality of the meat served.   It is the service here that has been lackluster for me.. examples of what I mean: having to ask for the complimentary bread, having the server forget what sides I ordered with my steak, longer than should be necessary waits for drink refills.    I am a huge fan of the Curbside to Go service though! I can order my dinner from my computer, drive to Outback in my pajamas, and within just a couple minutes a friendly employee will bring my order out to me while I relax in my car.   I have utilized this take out service a few times now, the website makes it very easy to get your order precisely how you want it. And being able to sit on my couch and eat a steak I didn't cook, while in my pajamas is wonderful."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for lunch with mom. First time ever at this location. It was right around noon, and the place was about 1/3 full. That is to say, two sections were completely packed full of people and the rest of the restaurant was deserted. The host says to us, \"Okay, I'm gonna tell you what I told the lady over there,\" as he points to lady sitting down waiting. \"It may not look like we've busy, but we've only got two servers and, as you can see, their sections are completely full. So, it's like a 15 minute wait.\" I get what he was saying, that each of the two servers had over their capacity of tables, but the place was nowhere near \"busy\". My mom questions him, \"I mean, it's lunch time...there's barely anyone in here...why do you only have two servers...yada yada.\" He proceeds to tell us that there are two servers on their way in, but it would still be about 10 or 15 minutes. His excuse: they are never usually busy for lunch. Hmmm. Not comforting.   I ask, \"Can't we just sit in a booth and get a drink at least?\" He finally says, \"Oh yeah, you can sit in the bar area and the bartender can get your food for you.\" Ingenious idea, Outbacker!   So, we proceed to get a booth in the bar, since apparently there's no wait time in the bar area (on the other side of the wall is the dining area, where there is still a 10-15 minute wait still). There are two other groups sitting in booths in the bar area, and it appears they are almost done. I go up to the bar to order my mom and I drinks. The bartender is counting money from the register, never looks up, finishes, walks to the back room. I was the only person at the bar. Nice. So, I go sit back down. A few minutes later, he comes out, gives both groups their checks and starts to walk away. I stop him and ask if we can order drinks. He says he'll be right back. He doesn't come right back. He doesn't come back at all.   Instead, a few minutes later, a friendly waitress named Mattie comes over out of nowhere and takes our drink and food order. Thank goodness! I got the Chicken Tacos, which came with Aussie Fries (nothing special folks, french fries with salt and pepper). My mom got the Fish Tacos. For the price, you get a decent amount of food. Too much in fact, but I won't complain about that. We each got three tacos, with sauce on the side. We swapped one taco each, which made me glad I got the chicken because I wasn't impressed with the fish taco at all. My tacos were good, nothing spectacular. The chicken was seasoned well and the pico de gallo salsa was refreshing. The aioli sauce was good too. The big problem with the tacos is that there were huge chunks of iceberg lettuce on the bottom, like the hard pieces from the inside of a head of lettuce. Obviously, those all got chucked off to the side.   Overall, the service from our waitress was fine. She was super friendly and efficient. On top of bringing us refills, napkins, etc. My mom ordered coffee later on and she never charged us. Not sure if this was by accident or not. Of course, we didn't argue. 1 star for food being edible and 1 star for Mattie. Will probably not return."}
{"text":"At the Casino Royale on second level. Nice little Outback and great service. I set at bar immediately and could not have had better service or food. My prime rib was huge and amazing! It was honestly the best prime I have ever had at an Outback. Beer was cold and while prices tad higher , they were not bad. Mushroom portion was gigantic. Seriously I would split the 12 oz prime rib dinner with mushrooms on side with someone. It was too much food for one. I really enjoyed this visit and will go again."}
{"text":"The service at this particular Outback is consistently bad. I don't think I've ever gotten a steak that wasn't overcooked here...I've also never received a single apology for it. Go to a different location."}
{"text":"We were staying at the motel across the road because of an airport layover.  This is the only place within walking distance.  I'm glad it was.  Bitchen customer service, great food in contrast to California outback locations. Tim is awesome."}
{"text":"OK...I don't want to sound like an Outback groupie, but when the product is good, well, go for it! i was really happy to see that there was an Outback where I am for the evening, so I wandered in for a quick bite. My usuals...coconut shrimp and the onion soup were on my mind. I sat in a booth at the bar and was quickly greeted by Alyssa. She came right over with water and a menu. After placing my order, she was just as fast getting the food to me.  She was attentive and helpful, keeping an eye out for my possibly empty wine glass! What more can a customer ask for in addition to the tasty food??!! Proactive service set the bar high!   Many thanks!"}
{"text":"So, the food was awesome. Always is! However our service last night was awful!  Our waitress took 10-15 minutes to take our drink order. 20 minutes later we got them and placed our order with a waitress who was rushing us and making us feel super uncomfortable. Not sure if she had too many tables or what the deal was. Our salads arrived 45 minutes after we ordered. When I reminded our waitress she said they were coming up. Clearly she forgot to put any of our food in. After we got our salads, our main course arrived 1 minute after :/ The server was always rushed and kept muttering things about the cooks or other servers under her breath everytime she walked by. \"Cooks need to knock that shit off\", atfer she would leave a table.  PROFESSIONAL!   The poor people at the table behind us sat down and didnt get greeted by our waitress until 30 minutes after they sat down. I don't know whats going on with this place, but I was in the restaurant business for 8 years...the servers need more training. Plain and Simple.   Ill sit at the bar next time around."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour and a half for our salads.  Food came out after another hour and it was lukewarm at best.  Owner comped meal but even that couldn't save the evening"}
{"text":"Food is always good. You can always count on consistent quality and food and service here.  The wait isn't as bad as it used to be. Things seem to be running much more smoothly than in past years"}
{"text":"I ordered the House Sirloin medium rare. As I started to eat it, I realized it was only rare. I informed my server, Leah, of this and she immediately took it back to the kitchen to have it prepared the way I ordered it. After a few minutes, Tony the Manager delivered my steak with an additional baked potato. I consider this to be excellent customer service! They automatically compensated me for my inconvenience. Plus, both Leah and Tony were friendly and genuinely interested that my wife and I had a pleasant dining experience.  If that weren't enough, after we paid the bill, we realized we had an unused gift card. Both Leah and Tony treated this as if it were no problem. They were both as nice as could be and handled it quickly."}
{"text":"Came back again today excellent service from corin tried the Philly cheesesteak and unfortunately came out a little dry actually it was a lot dry so I sent it back the manager came out with a chicken sandwich said was very friendly and even took it off my bill which was nice definitely be back  Back today 4/22/18 and TRISTIAN was a great server.  On it.   Sold.  Lie he guy. Food was amazing"}
{"text":"Good service and tasty food but dirty restrooms.  Gross. I told the manager and they finally cleaned it up"}
{"text":"We went here last night for my mothers birthday. We went at 5 and were seated right away. As it was in Surprise, I was shocked that we were seated so promptly because it was prime dining time. They also were able to set up for the 2 kids, so that was nice. Everything seemed to start out fine. The service was good and our server was pleasant and able to get the food to the kiddos fast.  I just wish the food was better. This was one of the worst meals I have had in a long time. First off, my mom and I ordered margaritas. We should have just ordered lime juice. There was no alcohol in it. My mom even ordered a double and could not taste it. Since I had the baby, I rarely drink and am a cheap date after 1 drink. Even after ordering 2 margaritas, I felt no buzz. It was sad for my one night with cocktails in a long time.  My husband and my mom both ordered steak and lobster. The lobster was so chewy and tasteless. The meat was grizzly and had no flavor or the promised rub. I had mahi mahi and it was so rubbery and flavorless. The toppings on it added nothing.  It was so disappointing. We have not been to an outback in many years. I am not sure if the quality has gone downhill in the overall chain or just this location but I will not be back for such mediocre food."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and this location has gone downhill. Just had a horrible meal. Ordered a Blooming Onion and it was over cooked and very greasy. Their special was steak and lobster which sounded good. When it came the lobster tail were spoiled. Sent them back and got similar ammonia smelling rotting lobster. Manager did not like hearing the food was bad. Avoid this location. Try Lone Star or Texas Roadhouse instead."}
{"text":"This place is highly over-rated.  The blooming onion was undercooked.  My partner's filet was extremely fatty and only 1/2 of it was edible.   This is my second try at this place and we won't be back.  One thing is consistent, it's not good."}
{"text":"I have always been an Outback fan. For a chain restaurant, Outback does a really good job. I typically sit at the bar and the bar staff is ALWAYS friendly and accommodating. Last week I decided to take out. I ordered salmon, broccoli and a sweet potato. The salmon and broccoli were very good - they were cooked the right way and seasoned well. The sweet potato however was so overcooked it was as if they had kept it in the oven for several months ;-) Just kidding but the po-ta-to was killed to be sure. A minor detail but worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Most of the time this location is spot on with their steaks....however,  tonight was sub par. I can say that our server noticed and the manager on duty was awesome.  They didn't charge us for my hubby's undercooked steak. Plus, they were right on top of everything! We were so going to just pay our check,  tip well and not visit there for a while. But, service and hospitality mean way more to us than just getting a cook on a steak right! Thumbs up to the people working here and we hope the corporate offices notice that the bottom line isn't as important as the people looking for a good meal and dining experience!  Thanks Daniel for being on the ball! Didn't catch the name of the lady who was MOD....but thumbs up to her too!"}
{"text":"Thanks Tanner you made a bad experience really good! We appreciate your attentiveness to us despite our dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"I had the pork tenderloin, it was kinda salty. The garlic mashed potatoes were pretty decent. The green beans were very rubbery!! The server was pretty cocky but my grandparents like it here so I go! My grandma raves the Wedge but blue cheese isn't really my thing."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a very good experience. The lettuce wedge salad is excellent and the burger was done to perfection. The service was very attentive at the bar. A good place to watch a game, have a drink, and eats."}
{"text":"We got \"Jason\" as our server. Very good server. Attentive without hovering, got the orders right and was on the ball. Excellent server.  The food was awesome, as always. Best French onion soup anywhere, awesome steaks and great sides (love the mac & cheese!). Only minor complaint is the drinks are a little small resulting in multiples orders... or maybe I'm just an alcoholic.   All in all this place is utterly reliable. I prefer the old Outback design, they are building these new ones in a single big dining room, I like the old divided rooms more because they are quieter and a little more comfortable, but the food still rocks.   With Outback you can be sure you're going to get good food at a good price with good service. Unlike other chain-type places that have turned into absolute catastrophic toilets (Applebee's) Outback has kept up with standards and I always look forward to eating there."}
{"text":"I stopped by for my birthday dinner last week and well everything was only OK. I hardly ever drink but ordered the Wallaby Darned drink and it was very tasty, probably the highlight of my meal. Very peachy with an almost blended texture. I had the Outback Special which was a six ounce steak with two side choices. Not a bad deal for 9.99. The steak was made just the way I wanted it and it was what you would expect from an Outback.  Not a bad birthday dinner but not WOW either, very mellow and just my style.    Side-note: the ladies room was wicked gross, so maybe \"go\" before you go."}
{"text":"Its outback. If you been to one then you know what your getting. The food was good and the people were very nice. If you looking for a good steak and are not sure where to go then this is a safe bet."}
{"text":"First of all we had a waitress/server named Sam.  She was outgoing, fun and attentive.  Great kids menu with: Grilled cheese Chicken Fingers Cheese burgers Mac and cheese Sirloin medallions Chicken grilled Ribs  The adult menu offers several steaks, chicken, lamb and seafood.  I am a fan of Outback.  Always a good meal at a good price!"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  We went w/some of our friends who were regulars and sat at the bar. The service was so so."}
{"text":"We had an amazing steak dinner our 1st night in Vegas overlooking the Mirage. This will now become our \"1st night\" place to eat for future trips!!"}
{"text":"The salad served to our table had a huge bug crawling around inside of it.  After notifying our waiter of the discovery, the manger came to our table and apologized saying they were having \"lettuce issues\".  The manager said the meal would be comped because it ruined our dining experience.  We were very appreciative of her concern and thought all was well, but...  When the meal was complete, the waiter dropped off our bill.  Shockingly the manager only comped the cost of the salad."}
{"text":"Outback is one of the places my husband and I love coming to, to grab a bite to eat. Whenever I'm craving a margarita and something to nibble on, Outback is a great place to come. WIth happy hour, the margarita drinks are only about three dollars. The steak dinner is really yummy. While your waiting on your drinks and dinner they put out a plate of warm bread and butter. One of our favorite appetizers is the blooming onion, scrumptious! My husband usually devours the sauce! We've gotten the cheeseburgers also which are equally amazing! Always great service and awesome attitudes there! TV's to watch sports."}
{"text":"This place is a shithouse.  Nastiest Outback I've ever been to and I've eaten at Outback all over the country.  Literally!  To include San Diego, Atlanta, Pensacola, Memphis, Dallas, Las Vegas, Henderson, Mobile, and more.  It was a year ago but the place was nasty.  We were served food on dirty nasty used unwashed plates, and YES I'm SURE! It started with the salad plates.  The waitress was nothing to write home about and just blamed the kitchen.  The manager bought our food and offered for us to come back on him again, NO thanks!                N E V E R!  Two of the people I was with are on my facebook page, They'll comment when they see it."}
{"text":"What a joke, the ribs and chicken were tiny.. Rib bones were 2 inches long and chicken breast was smaller than a golfball.. Bloomin onion was about half the size of a regular one and I got half way through my California chicken sandwich and only had bun left..disappointing meal"}
{"text":"I live in the area so this particular location is my closest.For most part this particular  location  is alright by far not the greatest and  by not the worst either. Food is ok it just depends on who's cooking that night sometimes it excellent and then theres times where is just ok or a time or to where its just un- tolerable. Service again is hit and miss theres times where its way above and beyond then theres times where its good. Then theres that time or two where its just horrible they don't get the order right never come back around or your just plain out ignored. But overall this location is alright. If your in the area stop in and give it a try."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the blooming onion which was fantastic! The dipping sauce was great too. I ordered the porterhouse and smashed potatoes. My steak was just ok. A little fatty. My potatoes were just ok also. I was disappointed in my meal. It was pretty good but not very good. I wanted very good. I also ordered the Aussie sangria? ( I think) Whatever it was, it was very good. My server was a very nice young man. I really wanted to give 4 stars, but I can't because of my steak and potatoes."}
{"text":"A steakhouse should know how to cook a steak medium rare. It came out well done. No attempt to resolve the issue by the waitstaff when we complained."}
{"text":"Great service, food was great and served piping hot.  The hubbs was really happy with his steak and shrimp, my salad was a little wilted:( but still good, and the blooming onion was great. We arent much for restaurant chains, so this visit was solely based on the fact that we had a gift card but it was overall a great experience."}
{"text":"The location is very nice and casual. It was very clean and comfortable. We were only the 2nd guests inside the restaurant. We sat in the bar dining area and were the only ones there. The bartender/waitress was friendly. Our order took an oddly long to come out being we were only one of two guests there. I ordered the two lobster tails. They had a strong fishy odor but tasted okay. I got a side of loaded mashed potatoes and the skillet Mac and cheese...definitely not worth the premium price for them. My potatoes were luke warm, damn near puréed and barely had \"loaded\" toppings on them. My Mac and cheese was also cooled. Neither of our food was hot. Our waitress went ghost on us several times for simple things like more water and some lemons. My $50 meal felt more like $25."}
{"text":"We visit this location about every 6 weeks. We've had Justin as our server Twice now and his service lacks everything a server should do. He has NO personality, he purposely avoided eye contact so I had to flag him down several times for Items such as refills and another piece of bread, which is one of the reasons we love Outback.  He NEVER once asked how our meal was or even checked back. Towards the end he said if we needed desert we could order it through the Ipad on the table and even pay the bill. Absolutely NO customer interaction resulting in a very bad experience. If I bring back my wife and 5 kids we definitely will make a point to NOT sit anywhere around this server.  For the record, our 1st experience was pretty bad but I thought Justin was having a bad day but now after this visit, he's just a bad server. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Somehow we were miraculously seated right away on Labor Day.  Our server, TJ promptly greeted us and got us our waters and my ice tea.  Our orders were taken and the hot bread arrived.  Salads followed shortly afterwards.  TJ was on fire! Our meal arrived after a short wait I ordered the filet with a grilled lobster tail.  everything was cooked as requested.  Tea refilled!  This was a positive experience thanks to the fact TJ was attentive and our meal was cooked appropriately"}
{"text":"To me Outback Steakhouse is on par with Applebee's or TGIFriday's - nothing special.  The food is okay, the atmosphere is okay, the service is okay.   A friend of mine loves this place so the boyfriend and I went there for dinner. We all ordered steak. I ordered the outback special - a 6 oz steak with your choice of two sides - I chose fries and veggies. You get all this for $10. And guess what? It tastes like a $10 steak. I guess I've been spoiled at places like Mastro's and Morton's because this steak was not even in the same galaxy as steaks from those places. But it was $10 so I wasn't expecting it to be the best steak I've ever had either. Honestly, for a cheap piece of meat it was pretty okay. In retrospect I with I would have shelled out a few more bucks, maybe I would have gotten something a little better.  All in all, Outback isn't horrible, it's just not great. It's a chain and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The food is always fresh and comes out right away. Customer service is great and everyone from the managers to the hostesses is inviting and friendly. Love the decor, and setting in the restaurant. They also did a great job with the outside sitting areas! Oh! Big plus... met Kevin Harvick!!! Thank you for the complimentary blooming onion. And yes we do watch Nascar!"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment!  This place was to say the least stingy with there portions and have never been to an outback that gave me 3 little cucumber bits in my salad.  That was considered extra cucumbers so I ask for more like enough to cover my whole little salad and I got the dirty looks.  Plus the salad itself was big enough for a 2 year old and that was my meal.  I order the house salad as a meal all the time and I get enough for 3 people.  My husband meal was big enough for a 4 year old...what is it with this particular outback and there small portion sizes.  I was not impressed and next time I visit Vegas this place will not be on my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"First timer at this location.. was seated right away no wait for a weekend. I had the steak and coconut shrimp. Very good! For my sides I had the veggie, mash potatoes. The bread was very soft and warm. The waiter was awesome :)"}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, the best Outback Steakhouse in the city. That's not an opinion. They serve PRIME cuts. Don't be fooled by the semi-dingy casino that it's in, Casino Royale. This Outback serves PRIME STEAKS. None of the neighborhood Outback's do. Their Prime Filet in on par with any $40+ filets from Prime Steakhouses in the city (but sides and salad are included here instead of high end places that are usually served a-la-carte, which is a nice little bonus -- their Wedge Salad for $1 extra is EXCELLENT ENT. And personally, my favorite thing about this location is that they are open until 1am every night. Hands down, far and away, THE best steak that you can get in the city after about 10 or 11pm at night. The bar staff is great as well. Excellent service (I only sit at the bar but I'm sure the other servers are great as well)!"}
{"text":"Last time We ate at Outback we had a horrible experience.we never wanted to come back. 3 years later decided to try it out again. Thank goodness we did. steaks and prime rib are much more tastier that we didnt have to add any sauce. The most important part of outback are the bartenders!!! Crystal and Sean are always on point. Gave us great suggestions on what to order and went out of there way to also let us know the offers they had without us asking. Superb service and we have been back every week now. And only back because of the wonderful service at the bar (food is a plus). Great job management!"}
{"text":"Super slow service this meal. Our app came out fast and we dug right in, and then it just stopped. After finishing our bloomin onion we waited for ten minutes for our salads to come out. I think the table near ours got our salads because I heard them tell their waiter that the dressings were wrong.  After the salads it was another 7 or 8 minutes until our food arrived. The food was good and cooked right. I have no complaints against the food. It was just the service. It was about 4:30 when we arrived, so not so much into the dinner rush for that to be the excuse. We probably won't be back to this particular one."}
{"text":"This is a good Outback. They are always busy. The steaks are cooked good. Can't beat a bloomin onion. There's plenty of parking. I suggest doing the call ahead seating on the weekend."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner at the Outback Restaurant. I had the prime rib and the fresh green beans were really fresh and cooked perfectly. My prime rib was also cooked perfectly. My husband had steak and it was also done perfect. We enjoyed a piece of cheesecake for dessert-nice change it was crestless."}
{"text":"Good steak, great sides, excellent value.  Terrible server (forgot lots, very slow) and even at a table far from the entrance we were freezing on a cold winter day.  Won't be the best steak you ever had, but you couldn't make this meal at home for less money.  (Manager: you need to get those inner double-doors adjusted.  They close SOOOOOOOO slowly, the blast of cold they let in every time someone comes or goes is terrible.)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our visit to the restaurant.  Usually when we come here, the service is good, however today it was barely mediocre.  There were very few tables that had customers, and basically the restaurant was empty.  We had to wait 10 minutes for someone to seat us, because the hostess was away from the desk socializing with other employees.  We then waited another 15 minutes for our server to come to our table.  We had a 2 year old and 4 year old in our party, and had to request kids menus.  After 10 minutes we were told by our server there were none, however one magically appeared for a much older child at the table next to us after we ordered.  We had to request silverware when our salad was served.  The food was good, but the service left a bad taste in our mouths.  We are very disappointed in our experience at Outback, and will think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"I work at an Outback in Westminster, CA and was in Vegas with some coworkers when we decided to check out what Vegas's Outback had to offer. To say we were disappointed would be a huge understatement. The food was great, just what we're used to, but the service was awful. Or at least our server was. Joshua seemed to have write us off immediately. We hadn't even ordered drinks and he already seemed to hate us. He was completely rude and unattentive throughout our meal. We all work in a restaraunt and were willing to understand that everyone has rough nights but then another one of his tables were seated right next to us and were quickly greeted with a smile and friendly conversation. To put it simply, we were confused. In the end, he didn't get the best tip and we concluded that he had discriminated against us because of our age range. He was too quick to assume that we were just young kids drunk in Vegas. We knew we were right when we saw the surprise and regret on his face when we informed him that we all work at Outback. Anyways, if you're planning on going here and are seated with Joshua, I suggest you request another server."}
{"text":"Food not up to par and same with service. Wife had filet which was fatty.  I had sirloin with unlimited shrimp.  Took forever to get reapplied.  Asked for water...never came.  Is Ouback going down hill?  Used to love this place."}
{"text":"Service and food was outstanding tonight. I was thoroughly impressed with our waitress, the speed in which our food was served, to just how good it was. Really had an excellent dinner."}
{"text":"We decided, that since First Friday was lame, we would go grab a nice steak at Outback. Let me just say that the ONLY reason this review is 4 stars and not 1 is because of Jennifer, the manager who was on duty. My husband and I walked into the restaurant at around 8:50pm. We were seated immediately. Within 2 minutes our server was at the table taking drink orders. She brought out drinks ASAP and then took our order. Our entire order. We ordered 1 appetizer and our main courses all at once. 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out. Another 20 for our main course. At this point, it was 9:35pm. The restaurant closes at 10pm. When our server finally brought out meal I asked to speak to the manager. Jennifer can over to our table. All I had to say was \"50 minutes\". The place was dead. There was no reason for our order to have taken FIFTY MINUTES!! But Jennifer was awesome. She comped our entire meal. It's refreshing when a manger sees that her team dropped the ball and made no excuses. Thank you. Jennifer is a keeper. The food was good. Good enough to to warrant a return trip. I got the flat iron steak and shrimp. The steak was grilled to perfection. The shrimp was a little overdone. The salad that came with the meal was non-descript. Iceberg lettuce with some tomatoes, cucumber, and shredded cheese with the dressing kind of dumped in the middle. Hubby got the French dip. Meh. Nothing to write home about on that one. No. Here it's about the steak. And that was worth returning for."}
{"text":"No complaints. Foods delicious. Staff is so friendly and very attentive. We went on a Sunday evening of course there was a wait time but it went pretty quickly. When we got sat our waitress was awesome and remained very attentive to our needs although being crazy busy. Food was hot and soooo good. Will be returning!!"}
{"text":"I don't really like outback any more but this location was great. Fast. Good service and the food was surprisingly good. I would definitely recommend this location but I'm still skeptical of other locations."}
{"text":"I wrote a previous review about how they made up for their mistakes by comping some food. This is my 4th time being hear and it's the 4th time they've messed up my order. Severely disappointed since I love outback and how close this new one is."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go for steakhouse this is probably one of the best.   The management here is really proactive and concerned about making sure you have a good experience. I had an issue with the cook on my steak. Garrett emailed me the next day and I was taken care of on my next visit.  The food and the sides it's always cook fresh. Unlike Longhorn where the vegetables and some other things are pretty prepared prior to serving.  Overall is just a great value for the money if you're looking for a decent steak."}
{"text":"Our appetizers were good except our mac n cheese things were cold inside and fries over salty (part our fault) but overall great atmosphere! Manager was great and also was waiter!! Will come back in future!"}
{"text":"Server Morgan H was/is awesome! Came out to dinner with the hubbs, I was starving and our service was orchestrated in away which helped to control my hunger. Ribeye steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection. But excellent services makes everything taste sweeter."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location for years. Unfortunately in recent years the quality of food has not been  the same. Victoria fillet is never done right , cheese fries inedible with tons of salt. We stopped visiting this place. Also , they increased their prices a lot."}
{"text":"My client wanted to meet here for lunch yesterday. I seated myself in a bar area booth so I could watchout for him.  I ordered the salad and a half of prime rib sandwich. Our waiter mixed up my customer's salad by giving him a Ceasar's instead of a green salad.  My sandwich and salad were tasty and the ice tea hit the spot too.    This Outback is actually a great place to meet a client - the booth was  private, not loud and we had a productive sale meeting."}
{"text":"Cool laid back environment. Med. rare PrimRib broccoli and mashed potato's. A glass of Cabernet and some water. Thirty dollars on the tab but a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Outback food is fairly consistent.... Not bad for a Sunday night takeout....however they consistently FAIL to give us everything we order.  This was our last takeout night from them....  Shame....matching what's in the bag doesn't seem to be that difficult to me."}
{"text":"I am an Outback lover.  I hit up an Outback at least once a month, usually for lunch.  Those darn Bloomin' Onions have me addicted!  Even with my love of Outback, it can't save this particular location for me.  This location just stinks!    I went here with a girlfriend to celebrate her birthday.  This location is near her work and where she picked to go.  We went in for lunch during the week.  We walked in and it was almost empty, even though it was 12pm.  The host stand was staffed with a guy that resembled a robot.  He was just on auto-pilot and was there to do his job and nothing more.  He wasn't rude, but he wasn't friendly either. He was just there to collect a paycheck and nothing more.  A smile or a hello would have been nice, that's all I'm saying.  We were then seated at a table and waited several minutes before our server acknowledged us, even though there were only 2 other tables in the whole section.  Our server was friendly but ditzy.  He did bring out drinks out shortly after and then took our order.  We didn't see him again until we were half way though the meal. He did bring us out refills at this point, which was nice since we had been out of drinks for almost the whole meal by then.  Again he was super friendly, just an awful server.  Now for the food.  We order the new Barrier Reef Trio with the coconut shrimp, crab avocado stack, and ahi tuna and a steak.  The seafood trio is definitely an appetizer, unless you have a small appetite.  Luckily we had also ordered soup and salad as well, otherwise my friend would have starved.  The seafood was pretty good though except the coconut shrimp were about 5 seconds away from being burnt.    The steak I ordered medium rare came out medium well.  Ugh, who even eats medium well steak?  Anyway, the steak was overcooked but my friend had to get back to work and we didn't have the time to send it back.  Since I was just going to eat it, I asked the other server (since I couldn't find ours) and the food runner if they could grab some blue cheese dressing (sounds weird but it goes so well with steak!).  They kept telling me ok, but no blue cheese ever came out.  I gave up and just ate the steak because of the lack of time.  I had also ordered the garlic mashed potatoes.  Even these were wrong.  They were so full of lumpy, half cooked potatoes.  I love potatoes, but not undercooked ones.  I am really not a complainer, but this whole experience was just bad.  I still love Outback, but I won't come back to this location, unless I absolutely have too.  So you can see the food was ugh, the service was blah, and the overall experience was just mediocre at best.  You have been warned about this location!"}
{"text":"So...  Tonight I had a fantastic sirloin. Now I know what you're thinking, OutBack is not a foodie kinda place. When it was tonight. I really like the house salad. It's simple, iceberg, an onion slice, cucumber and a tomato or two. The steamed broccoli was just as I like it. I added shrimp on the barbie. I enjoyed tequila on the cheep and the wife finally tied Tito's an tonic.   Service was spot on!  For a 3 star kinda place they earned a solid four stars tonight.  For someone who eats out 3x5 I was a happy camper!"}
{"text":"So when you get a taste for something and you think of it until you can taste it and it taste just like you've been imagining that is what my experience was today! So of course managed to get there before the dinner rush even though their was alot of people it wasn't any wait for a table at all. Seated right away, after we picked a table I realize the air is blowing right on us and knowing from experience that this would make for a uncomfortable dinner so I asked for a another table which was fine, other than the fact that I wore a shorter than I normally wear shirt. No midriff just enough for me to be pulling it down every few minutes....    So as considerate of a person that  I am I went to the front and asked to be reseated one more time In a booth/table seat, I'm sure other guest were wonder if a game of musical tables had started and they weren't invited! (they'll thank me later ) It's not like I would have enjoyed someone else's posterior crack during my entire meal why should anyone else!  I usually get an ice tea, I opted to get the flavor added to it which in this case was pomegranate.  I ordered the filet mignon with the all you can eat shrimp, and a dinner salad. The salad was green and the steak was cooked to my liking and the only thing that I was expecting to kick a little more was the cocktail sauce, they call it Volcano sauce...not so much but still good over all.  I saved the best for last, our server Kent. Well I can only say that he was a rockstar! Thanks for making my visit at Outback very enjoyable!!!"}
{"text":"Usually Im embarrassed to admit i frequent chain restaurants. I had a gift card here - for the record. Aside from personal shame, my steak was exceptional! Better than my dry ass steak at Smokeys!"}
{"text":"Outback my foot. More like out in the backyard. I have serious doubts of their connection to Australia. I didn't hear a single Aussie accent. Nobody even bid me a \"g'day mate.\" For shame. You know they don't even serve kangaroo meat here? What kind of a place is this? Would it be so much to ask for some didgeridoo music? Even Rolf Harris or AC/DC would be appropriate. Something other than the kitsch of a few photos of the Australian Outback and cutesy restroom signs (i.e. Sheilas). Shake my head.  All kidding aside, my dinner tonight was pretty good. I was brought a small loaf of complimentary bread and whipped butter. That was quite good and though I wanted to save half I was un able to do so. It was gone before I realized I had eaten it all. I was also brought a complimentary Bloomin' Onion. Not that it is free for everyone all the time. Outback currently has a promotion where they offer a free Bloomin' Onion on the Monday after Kevin Harvick finishes in the top 10 during the most recent NASCAR race. This promotion is why I came in in the first place. For my meal I ordered chicken tacos with grilled asparagus. It was all pretty good.   There were a few issues with the food despite the overall goodness of it. The asparagus was not properly trimmed of the most fibrous portion of the stalks. I did that myself. I understand this is a restaurant and time wise it is not really feasible to snap each stalk individually so I'll look past this. My Bloomin' Onion seemed both over cooked and under cooked simultaneously. It was dark and nearly burned on the outter peddles but nearly raw in the core. That did not stop me from eating about half and saving the rest for later.  At last, I was done with my meal and my bill came. This is where my evening went down hill. I ordered an iced tea and was given a refill. I was charged for two drinks. Apparently there are no free refills here. Irritating of you ask me. Then I saw the $1 charge for upgrading to the asparagus. My tacos were supposed to come with fries. I was told, and I quote, \"I know the menu says it comes with fries but really you can order any of these sides. The grilled asparagus is really good.\" I was led to believe I had an option of sides. I didn't realize I would be charged extra. I feel decieved. Dinner should not be a deceptive venture. Not cool guys. Not cool."}
{"text":"Food was terrible ! Service was worse . No wonder the restaurant was empty . It took 45 minutes to get our food .. Yet there were only 3 other tables being serviced. My steak was rare and well done all at the same time ?!? If that wasn't bad enough my side order of parmesan rice was nothing more than a thinly disguised scoop of rice a roni . We still have $15 left on a gift card that I'm more than happy to give away to anyone who wants it ."}
{"text":"My last experience at a different location of Outback was not the greatest but I decided I would give this location a shot while in the area a few days ago. This location has a much more modern vibe and seems to have gotten an Outback upgrade in comparison to some of the other nearby locations.  The restaurant was busy but we were seated right away. Our waitress was great and had a good sense of humor which is always an added benefit. I ordered my usual, a 6oz sirloin cooked medium with diablo sauce and green beans. The steak was cooked nicely and it was not the best cut of meat I have ever had but it was not bad. The green beans are always amazing. My fiancé had ribs and he thought they were delicious. I also ordered blue moon with a shot of peach schnapps and my beer was nice and cold and on happy hour so I was happy.   Overall good experience. I would probably chose this location over the nearby location on Chandler Blvd. When I am craving a moderately priced steak I might be back."}
{"text":"Last night our experience at this Outback location did not live up to our previous visits. It took about ten minutes to be greeted after sitting down. This was not to bad but we were right on the cut off of happy hour so I wanted to make sure that we got our drink order in on time. I ended up getting my drink order in two minutes before the cut off so that was okay.  I ordered the new steak flight that they have as a current special. You can get two or three mini sirloins on top of potato cakes with different types of sauces. I got two mini sirloins one with diablo sauce and one with a peppercorn cream sauce. I have had the diablo sauce in the past and I knew that I really liked it. My fiancé got a 8oz sirloin with a baked potato, his usual order. My fiancé also ordered a house salad to come out before our meal. It came out with no dressing and no side of dressing. It took five minutes to flag down our waitress to let her know we needed dressing. We got our steaks and as soon as they came out we could tell that they were not going to be good. We both asked for them to be cooked medium and they came out at least medium well if not well done. My first mini sirloin was just a big piece of fat and grizzle, I could not even cut into it. My fiancé's was not quite as bad but almost. We asked to send them back. My fiancé asked for a filet as a replacement and I just wanted a new order of the same thing that I got.  The manager Gabby did come out and apologize for the quality of the steaks. She was very understanding and told us that she would personally make sure that they came out right. The second time around when Gabby brought them back out they were cooked much better. She also stepped it up and brought a third mini sirloin with an option of three sauces to try on top. I thought that this was great customer service and she really did a great job trying to turn the situation around. We were there much longer than usual but it was not a big deal and Gabby did her best to make sure we were happy. The steaks were still not the best that we have had at Outback but I will give this location another shot because of the fantastic service we received in the end. Gabby also made corrections to our bill and made it right. Good job on turning the situation around. It was still only a three star night but I will give Outback a chance to earn the other two stars back."}
{"text":"The food was ok not so much special for the price I paid. Waitress was a little slow and didn't pay any attention to us at all.  I had to hunt her down to order and get drinks.   May not come back unless I crave something from their menu."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Outback. I know it's a chain, but they have an extensive menu with many options that I enjoy. I also enjoy their \"specials.\" This time's special was the 4 course meal: soup of the day, salad, steak/chicken, and dessert.  I got the clam chowder, Caesar salad, 6 oz. garlic butter steak, and carrot cake. The soup and salad came out pretty quickly. We were waiting quite a bit for our steaks. While waiting a manager suddenly came to our table and let us know that our steaks were overcooked and they were redoing them. We had no idea. The manager said that our dinners would be comped because it was their mistake.   The steaks were cooked perfectly to the temperature we wanted (medium).  Dinner was great. Honestly our server was awesome and the food was delicious. It wasn't the server's fault that our food came out slow. Other than the delay, the experience was great. I can always rely on Outback for a good meal.  Still no Blue Bell's Ice Cream. Apparently only Blue Bunny now. I'm disappointed. I could always depend on going to and Outback anywhere in the nation to get a scoop of Blue Bell's whenever I get homesick (I'm Texan and Blue Bell's is from Texas). Oh well."}
{"text":"One of the best Outback experience I've had.  The service was amazing and the place has more modern decor and even outdoor seating.  They recently moved to this location from the Green Valley / Sunset location which was a good move because it was hard to find being off the street.  The family decided they wanted steak, and we have a lot of history with Outback, so why not.  When our family goes to the outback we have 3 traditions: Bloomin Onion, Foster Draft and Steak. The bloomin Onion is worth the trip alone.  We were very lucky as we were seated in a booth patrolled by one of the best waiters I've known.  He was better than waiters I've had a 5 star places like Double Eagle.  He was informative but didn't talk too much, and he emphasized that we are there to relax and enjoy the food.  I feel like most of the waiters today see customers as burdens because they let how busy they are take over their attitude.  He did not give us that vibe at all.  The food was way better than I remember.  I had a salad, herb encrusted prime rib and a fully loaded baked potato.  All of it was excellent.  The salad was crisp and fresh, the prime rib was hot and tender and the baked potato was soft and packed with flavor.  We also treated ourselves to the Oreo mini-milkshake.  It was so good it will be added to the outback tradition as #4."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. Long story short, the best part of a $50+ meal (for two of us) was the bread. The free bread. Chicken, steak, mashed potatoes, shrimp, even the salad - waste of money. And then, to top that off, when we strapped a pair on to complain they took our names and phone numbers to \"put on the books\" for a discount next time. Nice job Outback. You must know there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"I had a nice ribeye steak with the French onion soup, fries and a bloomin onion. My wife had the filet mignon and lobster tail with the salad. The bloomin onion was free from a promotion. It was delicious. We both enjoyed everything possibly with the exception of the salad which was a little plain. The service was awesome. The atmosphere was very comfortable. I would recommend this Outback Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Best steaks in town! I wish they had earlier lunch hours. I would come more often if I could come at lunch :( hard to get a good steak in town at lunch time."}
{"text":"Slow service from start to finish unfortunately and mediocre food other than the desserts."}
{"text":"I got the pick 4 meal. Chicken tortilla soup was what I expected. I ordered a medium rare sirloin and it came out rare. I could barely cut through it, was also fatty. The parts that were edible tasted okay though. For dessert, pick the carrot cake. It's super moist and the icing is yummy. 2 stars for ending the meal positively with dessert. Won't order anything beyond appetizers or salad next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here this past week and I'm giving it five stars, not only because of the food but because of the service! Our waitress was Danielle (I'm pretty sure) and she was fantastic. She was always on top of our drinks and made sure everything came out in a timely manner, and also she's simply one of the nicest servers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Laura was our server tonight and she was amazing!!! We always love this Outback! Great service, food and overall place to eat!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for the first time a few days ago and was impressed until I found a long hair wrapped around my vegetables. Yikes!  I had ordered a grilled chicken breast with veggies and it was all great until I started eating my veggies. It was gross to say the least.  I was finished with my chicken, but didn't eat the veggies. It was kinda disappointing when my plate is passed along to at least 2 people who didn't notice something was wrong.  It's the cooks job to double check the plate and then it's 100% the waitresses job to make sure that your food is legit before it's brought to you. In my opinion failure to do so on the waitresses end leads me to believe that someone isn't paying close attention to their job duties... who knows.  I understand people make mistakes, but this incident just makes me not want to try this place ever again. For those of you who would come back after eating hairy food you'd be glad to know that the manager apologized and took my meal off the bill, which was decent of them to do. But in all honesty I still won't be making my way back here again anytime soon.  Thanks anyway Outback."}
{"text":"So disappointed, this is my first and last time at this location. Ordered the Bourbon Salmon and loaded baked potato. The bourbon sauce was cold teriyaki salt that made the salmon way too salty, so much so I'm sure it raised my blood pressure and the potato was dry. The sad part, while the restaurant was completely empty, the waiter didn't even bother to notice or ask why I hadn't eaten my food.  Get it together outback!!!"}
{"text":"In all fairness, this is not a review for the food, but rather, a review for service in the bar. I see that not a lot of people are happy with the quality of the food and I totally get that, but since I've never ordered food at this particular Outback, I'm compelled to give five stars for the booze experiences I've had here. We've never had bad service sitting at the bar. Big draft beers are $5 or $6, normally-priced. Football or baseball is on the flat screens and it's never too crowded to find a seat. In my experience, staff has always been friendly and attentive. Occasionally I will order a side salad but only because I love the blue cheese dressing. I like coming here for a mellow night, drink or two when I just want to get out of the house without any bells nor whistles."}
{"text":"Probably the best Outback I have ever been to! Prompt service. Food was served hot and tasty. Drinks never emptied. And prices weren't spiked despite being in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love steak but I am not going to this one ever again, the well done steak was burnt and hard. My wife took burger and the bun was not at all up to standard. Barely any lettuce onion or tomato in the burger.I bet McD's Dollar menu burger is way better than that.Prices were high as compared to other restaurants who are of the same standards."}
{"text":"I love me a Blooming Onion!   It has been a while since I went to an Outback. I'm glad I made this trip. The Outback was good. It was clean and the parking was convenient.  What made this trip worthwhile was the great service. If you go for lunch during the week, ask to sit in Earls section. Earl was the best server I've had in Vegas hands down. He was responsive, took care of my groups special dietary needs and he had a great attitude the whole time.  I had a Blooming Onion and a burger. Both were delicious. My wife had one of the best looking salads I've seen in a long time.  If you are in the neighborhood, stop in and ask for Earl. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Second time having lobster there...the best! Flavor was amazing, cooked perfect. Steamed broccoli was moist and tender. Loaded bloomin onion was awesome. Great service, the waitress was perfect even offered us to go cokes and the manager was very nice stopped by to talk."}
{"text":"Wow! Completely amazed with the service and the food at this restaurant!!! Not even sure where to start. We came here for lunch with our boys because we were passing through town & also sadly admit we were only stopping by because we had received a gift card to an Outback Steakhouse for Christmas, and there just isn't one close to where we live. However, I think we'll make it a point to come and visit more often just to eat here. We were seated immediately, and our waitress arrived to get our drinks and see if we wanted an appetizer. Drinks were delivered almost immediately, and the Loaded Cheese Fries\" appetizer wasn't far behind. We of coarse didn't know what we all wanted to order and she gave us more than enough time to make up our time as she kept checking back to see if we were ready to order, but never got impatient with us.  The side salads and soups that came with some of the meals came shortly after our order was taken. The Caesar salad had by my boyfriend was said to be good, and the soup had by my son (which we all ended up trying) was also delicious. A little \"snap\" to it, but taste and display of it was done well. Our food came promptly. Steak was cooked correctly and even came with the mushrooms that my boyfriend ordered for it after we had first ordered. I had the 1/2 rack of BBQ Ribs. Now I love my ribs and love to compare establishments ribs and I have to admit that these literally fell off the bone. The BBQ sauce was sweet, savory, but a little bite to it. Couldn't exactly put my finger on it, but they were so good I ate all of it. :) They were cooked just right. My son had the Chicken Tender basket. It was comparable to any other chicken tender basket. The Steak Quesadilla and Mac and Cheese that our other son had was also really good. I couldn't help myself but to try each of their meals to give an accurate review of this place. Our waitress was super friendly and kept our drinks full, and came back to the table to check on us to make sure we were still good.  What impressed us even more was that the manager came to our table and asked if everything was okay and if there was anything he could do to make our visit better. Totally impressive!!  We got our bill and asked for 2 boxes for all our food that we couldn't finish since we all were just too full. Boxes were brought and our waitress graciously checked us out. Absolutely nothing wrong with our visit, and I feel bad that after one other time at a different Outback that we had based an overall opinion on them. I am glad that this Outback is doing what they are doing because they have definitely made us a believer & will stop when we are back in town visiting. Worth every penny!! ** Our waitress, Abby M. (found on our receipt) you are a phenomenal waitress (I was once one too)! You do your job so well and diligently. I wish we had one of you at every restaurant we dine at. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I love outback for starters .... I just have a problem with folks being incapable of following instructions, my wife and I recently both had some surgeries and utilized the curbside for 3 months or so.. EVERY AND I MEAN EVERY SINGLE STEAK WAS WELL DONE ( and I mean jerky) we ended up ordering our steaks RARE AS POSSIBLE .. in hopes it would be edible, we informed the managers many times to which \" well were really busy\" was uttered. The owner knows us by name and has given us about 10 free dinners because it's always OVER COOKED AND SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS NOT FOLLOWED.. at some point would a meat Thermometer be a SAVY  business decision for cutting loss of free meals.. in just spit balling here .. last night I had the worst steak of my life !!!!! YET IT JUST SEEMS OUTBACK DOES NOT CARE , I can't keep paying $64 for dinner and throwing it in the trash..."}
{"text":"2 stars because they are still open late night, but when I order kookaburra wings and request all flat pieces & you tell me I can't get all flat pieces I am instantly annoyed. Server told me the wings are already proportioned......well re proportion them give me all flat pieces. Never again"}
{"text":"5 Star for service  2 stars for food  = 3 stars   So the mother in law calls and says she has a $50 gift card to Outback and why don't the hubs and I meet her for dinner.   I've never been. Its free dinner. We go.   Our waiter was super friendly, like beyond friendly...we were kinda making fun of how friendly he was (not to his face). He was super on top of everything.   I ordered the New York strip, my go to steak. I asked for it medium to medium well, I like to have some pink. Not only did my steak not have any pink it but it was a bit grey in color :( wah wah. No amount of A-1 sauce could make it edible. Four bites and I was done. I did eat most of my baked potato, it was decent. The green beans tasted frozen.   This was also the first time that I witnessed my husband NOT finish a steak, in fact his was about half eaten. This never ever happens. My mother in law ordered the tilapia and said it was good.   The little breads they bring you before your meal are very very little, one small loaf barely gave the 3 of us a piece, but it was tasty and our server brought us an extra loaf so that was cool.   Will I go back? No. Even if its free? No."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give one star. The food is terrible I ordered salmon salad the salad was made of brown iceberg lettuce and the salmon was full of salt  was horrible, the bread has a flat dull taste, the Mac n cheese was so spicy and salty, the chicken my friend had was tough, the waiter was horrible and he spoke sooooo loud you could hear him miles away.   The blueberry martini was like medicine and the peach Bellini - both tasted like no alcohol was added.  I sent back the martini. Also blooming onion again tastes like salt and was just gross as is the entire restaurant, I WILL NEVER GO THEIR.  WASTE OF TIME N MONEY GO TO LONESTAR ITS GREAT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Last night, Sept 14th 2016, my husband and I arrived for dinner for our 10 year anniversary  I order the Alice Springs chicken,  I ate 2 bites and ran outside and puked behind my truck, my husband ordered a steak, 70% of the steak was full of gristle un able to eat, the blooming onion GROSS, I couldn't believe it , we love their bread and blooming onion, but not this time, terrible food, we will never eat there again and that breaks our hearts because we have been going there for our anniversary every year for 10 years and now we can't, today my husband and myself has been puking all night and day, very disappointed. The manager gave us our entire meal free, we didn't pay a cent. Still not going back."}
{"text":"The food is below par. I asked for the best steak available and it was horrible. It's not as good as I remember from 7+ years ago. There are too many other local places that are better."}
{"text":"Will never go again. Went to dinner my grandmother offered to pay and request the AARP discount . The server asked to see her card and my grandmother forgot it the server refused the discount. Asked to speak with manager, who also refused the discount. I told her my grandmother is 98!!! She said it didn't matter. I think she could of done it out of courtesy."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food and service.our steaks we're cooked exactly like we asked for. Server was very attentive. The wings we ordered were breaded, different, but very good. We will get them again. Nate was our server, he anticipated our needs for refills on both endless shrimp and drinks. We didn't think we needed a dessert but his suggestion for a chocolate thunder convinced us we still had a little more room. A visit by the manager to our table was appreciated and we shared the story of our perfect evening with her. Definitely coming back with the family."}
{"text":"Always courteous, food is consistent. I typically get the same thing every time chicken on the  Barbie. I realize it's not the best, but the price is more reasonable, and so are my expectations. They have found their space and they do it well."}
{"text":"Since our little sisters had never eaten at Outback and I have some fond memories of Outback in Seattle, LA, and Vegas, we took the two little ones here.  However, the steaks were mediocre at best and dessert was probably its only saving grace.  At least, the Chocolate Thunder from Down Under was welll worth it.  It was this still warm chocolate brownie (maybe microwaved to be warm?) with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream on top (see picture)."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Outback Steakhouse in about 3 years. I got a gift card for Outback recently so my wife and me decided to go last Wednesday. We went around 6:30pm and it was crowded. The parking lot was packed and took awhile to park. That was the only problem all night. We had to wait about 5mins then we were seated. We were seated to a booth were the seat on my side was sticky. That wasn't that big of a deal though. Are wait tress was friendly and easy going, she checked up on use then us. We ordered are drinks, I got tea and vodka drink. The drinks got to use pretty good. Then we ordered are food. We both got are food at a decent time. I got the Bloom in Burger and it was so good. So we had no problems and were very satisfied with are meals. Hopefully I will be able eat at Outback again soon."}
{"text":"4 for $15.   They have upgrades too. A friend ordered a MW steak. They used a thinner cut of meat and she didn't eat it because it was fatty and bad. The manager took it off the bill. My steak was M and cooked correctly. I will be back."}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal Samantha C. Was our server! My drink wasn't low once! My appetizer was out fast my bread was on the table as soon as our drinks were !  Orders taken promptly! My steak was cooked incorrectly and I had a new one in minutes of letting her know! If only everywhere I went had servers like her!"}
{"text":"I did Outback take out at this location and was very disappointed. The bake potatoes were like they were cooked the day before. We had ribs and steak. The steak tasted ok, but was very tuff. The Ribs had very little flavor. I guess it's been a while sense I have been to Outback, but when did you have to start paying extra for a salad with your steak?The only good thing about the the experience was the person that brought out the food. He was very courteous and even asked if I would like anything while I waited. I feel like I just threw away $60."}
{"text":"It's an outback. Very tasty but nothing amazing. Staff is really nice and fast. Overall, solid 4stars"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for a quick soup and salad lunch. Service was slow, and we were sat by the door so we could hear the hostesses gossiping. They were remodeling so the atmosphere was not the usual. I got a Caesar salad and the French onion soup. The soup was good but the Caesar was drowning in dressing. Some folks like that I suppose. This is our second try at this location."}
{"text":"Well, I spoke with corporate and it was awesome that they tried to reconcile the wreck of the to-go service and order we received however.. the meal was $142.32 and they're idea of reconciling was sending us a $20 gift card.   Unfortunately, that was a sad attempt at regaining business from us, and I don't think at this point we'll be back."}
{"text":"Outback is still a good place to go for a nice steak dinner. Came in one evening with the family to avail of the 'free steak' promo they mailed out recently. We had the finger lickin' (shhh, don't tell the Colonel) bloomin' onion appetizer  to start. I ordered the rib-eye which was seasoned (Outback style) and cooked perfectly. The rest ordered the 8 oz. sirloin combo offered by the promo (gratis), and while our server was excellent and management was nice to allow 2 people in our party to use their voucher and even tipped that one can opt for a different steak instead and they'll just discount it's price from the voucher meal's value, wife and mom still opted to try the steak offered as-is. Disappointingly, the 'free' steak was nothing to write home about: it was dry, and barely passable for a steakhouse steak. Sad in a way, since Outback was touting this promotion to introduce would-be patrons to their new wood-fired steaks, and despite it being a free meal, they should have placed the extra effort in ensuring it's quality. Overall, a good experience but a promotional let down."}
{"text":"We came here around 10pm on a Friday night. Our server, Bobby, was very attentive and kept bringing us refills of the delicious pumpernickel bread that Outback always provides complimentary during meals.   Neither my mom nor I ordered steak- that's blasphemy at a steakhouse, I know! We both ordered the Sweet Chook O' Mine (grilled chicken sandwich) with fries. We agreed it was one of the tastiest chicken sandwiches ever. It was very juicy and was covered with Swiss cheese and bacon. We also each ordered salads - I had the House salad for $2.99 and she ordered the Signature Chopped Salad for $3.99.   The reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the luster of Outback has just dwindled over the years - and for valid reasons. This place was pretty dead for a Friday night. I used to visit Outback all the time when I was a kid. The Aussie Cheese fries appetizer used to be HUGE - now it is much smaller and the price has gone up. The same goes for the Chocolate Thunder from Down Under dessert. It used to be a humongous dessert to share. Now it is a lot smaller and is much more expensive. I glanced at the dessert menu and it seemed that most were $6.99 - I know they aren't huge slices of cake either. There are much trendier and better options in Dilworth to go to if you want a nice dinner, so it doesn't surprise me that this place never seems to be that crowded."}
{"text":"Went to Outback for mine and my husband's anniversary for a quick meal during the week. We sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait. The service was amazing. The 2 bar tenders were wonderful and you could tell they really loved their jobs. The food is always great and came in a good amount of time. This is really the best place to get a quality steak at a decent price. We are never disappointed by this Outback location."}
{"text":"My onion blossom was burnt and greasey. The walked around after the end of the horribly prepared meal and asked was everything alright with a smirk on its face. Never will I return to this place. Always a bad experience, only visited twice. The first time I used the restroom and there was not hot water. How in the hell are they sanitizing after using the restroom?!?!   Forget eating here again, it's not worth taking a chance on my health."}
{"text":"I've actually given a bad review to the same location before but 2 years later I assumed management had changed their ways, and they did.  I picked a busy Saturday evening, Memorial Day weekend. Now the good news.  I was able to get a seat at the bar immediately as I was alone. The bartender greeted me immediately and when I was indecisive he offered me two beer samples according to my answers to his questions. Excellent start.  Another bartender, Sarah, took my meal order and graciously was able to substitute on the 4-course special so I got exactly what I wanted for a little discount. And then the timing began. Just 5 minutes later my salad and warm bread landed in front of me. 12 minutes after that my steak was there, and cooked to perfection. The sweet potato was so hot I had to let it cool. The mushrooms, well what can I say? Outback mushrooms are the bomb! And the people. There was great chatter among all the guests at the bar which added to the environment. No sad or sullen faces among the guests or the servers, unlike my dismal last visit.  Sitting at the bar other people waiting on tables will join you for a beer or drink, and I observed none of them were there over 10 minutes before they were seated. This was a nice change from the last time I reviewed them; 1000% improvement! Great service, really good food, and I will be back more often, with friends!  Good job getting it together Outback! I knew you could."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and had such an enjoyable dinner. Out sever was KAT and she kept us smiling all night. Such a bubbly energetic personality! Service was perfect will be back just to see her (:"}
{"text":"Had a ribeye. It may have been 1/3 inch thick at best. Marbled apparently means and exceptionally meaty slab of fat. It was cooked rare perfectly, but the quality of meat for next to $20 was absurd."}
{"text":"Very disappointing trip to Outback tonight.  I normally LOVE their food. Tonight I ordered my usual, Victoria Filet.  When they brought it to me, they said \"Here's your Outback Special\".  I said \" I ordered the Victoria filet\".  She said, Oh yeah, that's what it is.  It definitely was not!!  Tough & thin!!  Not to mention they raised their prices since we were there a week ago.  If I am going to pay 20.00 for a filet, I expect a filet, not a sirloin that I could have got for 10.00.  So disappointing.  We were only offered a dessert for compensation.  We never eat dessert, so we declined.  No other compensation was given for poor food!!!"}
{"text":"Went to eat on a Saturday night since we had a gift card  Had to wait about 25 minutes and was then seated.  It had been a while since I had been at outback and they changed the menu quite a bit  It's obvious that they are trying to cater more towards the steakhouse aspect of their name and getting away from entrees.  I really liked their queensland chicken and shrimp but it's no longer offered on the menu  We ordered he bloomin' onion as an appetizer as my wife and I have always been a fan and it had been a while since we had it.  when it came out, we were pretty disappointed.  It was obvious they cut back on the size of the onion as it was considerable smaller than we had remembered.  Additionally, it was extremely greasy and over cooked.  We ate some of it and had to stop because of how much grease was on it.   For our meal, I decided to get the alice springs chicken and my wife got the chicken and ribs combination.  My chicken breast was disappointingly small and about half the size of a normal chicken breast you get at the store.  Additionally, there were barely a handful of fries with the meal.  The chicken was very overdone and dry.  There was also a very heavy \"woodfire\" taste that almost seemed artifical.  My wife's meal was also disappointing.  There were only 3 ribs.  They were moderately sized and slightly overdone as well.  The chicken breast was unimpressive as well as it appeared to be a cutlet rather than a chicken breast.  Her chicken was also very dry and had a very heavy \"woodfire\" taste that seemed artifical as well.  She ordered a baked potato as her side and that was the best part of her meal.    Service was somewhat unattentive as we had to wait for drink refills which did not help with our disappointment with the entire meal.  Luckily we had a gift card otherwise I would have been even more upset with having to pay for the entire meal.  All in all, not very impressed and will probably be a long time, if ever, that we go back.  There are better choices for steakhouses in town with better food for comparable prices."}
{"text":"Our server Taisha B. was absolutely fantastic! Very on the ball.  She was so sweet; she learned that my husband is currently fighting an advanced staged colon cancer and did something special for us. Your kindness will not be forgotten! The food was great too!"}
{"text":"Had the wings here for the first time and it was amazing. The house salad was great like always. Except I tried the new filet and shrimp dish with mash potatoes as the side and was not impressed with it at all. The filet was bland and the mash potatoes had some raw pieces in it."}
{"text":"The service is what makes this outstanding. We always ask for Wendy. Her customer service is above and beyond. Salmon, crab cakes, and salad are great.  However once again it's the outstanding service. Will go back again and again"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there for lunch today and I have to say the service was wonderful. Greg our server did an amazing job. Our food was delicious and fresh. We ordered the cheese fries, my daughter got a kids chicken tender meal and fruit and I got the soup and salad and also tried the onion petals(first time) I loved them!!! Everything was great! Thank you"}
{"text":"Outback has always been one of my favorite restaurants, and this still rings true today! They have the most DELICIOUS salmon ever, and they are always extremely friendly at this location. They are very accommodating for my low carb lifestyle- offering many delicious protein options."}
{"text":"They were late to open and the blonde girl was really grouchy :( not the most welcoming.  She was the seating person.  The service though was awesome and the food was great so it all worked out :)) had lobster and steak special.  Matt was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Bread came out hard as a board and ordered chicken bites that came out with no sauce and not looking at all like the photo :(( Jodi h was the server and seemed to really know her speeches and tell you how your steak was going to be cooked but seemed to really not care.  I told her that it was the worst experience I had ever had she said oh sorry about that and walked away.  My husband is diabetic and orders a diet coke.  Drank it down and Jodi came and said would you like another soda? I could see asking that if there were no refills but why would you even ask we had not even had our entrees yet.  He said yes, 10 minutes later she returned with a soda that was not diet.  I called her over and explained it wasn't diet she argued with us and after saying just bring us another one please.  The bread came out where you couldn't even cut it.  When she came back to the table after we waived her down again she said oh looks like it is over toasted.  We the  didn't get the bread or the diet coke till after the meal had come.  I have to take many of vitamins and drank all of my water but no, never got another refill and even she came to the tale seen my water empty and saw me reach over the table to drink my husbands water between her removing dirty plates she still ever brought any more water.  :((.  Very very disappointed and won't be back :("}
{"text":"I love their blooming onions and chicken strips. The two times that I have visited I have had excellent customer service. My server offered my fiancé great food suggestions and everything was delicious.   If you're in the mood for steak & yummy blooming onions I would recommend here.  You can't go wrong eating at Outback."}
{"text":"Great steaks for the price. Always consistent. Half wedge salad is good without the red wine sauce. You can order additional oz only on the prime rib. Depending what outback you're at. The cost can range from $1 to $2."}
{"text":"Actually we never ate here; walked in for the first time in many years using the side door (which is for pick up orders, i guess).  The hostess was untrained and stared at us as though we did something wrong....a hello, may i help you.....or let me lead you to the front of the house..would have been nice......instead we had to ask her for directions so that we could maneuver our way around.  Walked through a dark, smelly bar where the dangerous linoleum had buckled very noticeably, I suspect a lot of moisture went underneath the fake wood linoleum floor, then there were all kinds of youngish cooks/wait staff having conversations, one following another out into the parking lot because i guess there issues take precedence over any customers.  First and last impression, it smelled funky and we left.....no point in even sitting down to eat here, some of these places need complete overhaul and scrubbing and update including serious, proper management......or let it go by by the way of Chi - Chi's."}
{"text":"It was particularly amazing tonight great service food was perfect fresh and hot and tasty. The owner came over to check on us. New owner which explains the drastic improvement.  If you haven't been here in a while give it a new try."}
{"text":"We had a group of 5 it took 1 hr for us to be seated we asked why so long and their response was it's hard to get a table for 5 ready.  Finally 55 minutes later we get seated then we encounter the rudest  waitress ever, she was short with us, kept forgetting the sweetener for the tea, when we gave her our order she kept correcting us of how to say it was sharp n rolled her eyes at us. So we get our meal n the mash potatoes were cold, our meal was served piece meal we ordered shrooms with our steak n they came way later we kept asking for our shrooms and she said oh they are being heated...bad bad service several of our friends experieced bad service so they have not been back n neither will I."}
{"text":"Well gone are the days a couple people could stop by the bar, have drinks, appetizers and watch a game.  The seats at the bar are first come but always filled and now the booths are reserved.  Bad decision so now I will take my/our business elsewhere.  Btw or appetizers and drinks are usually a lot more than a families dinner"}
{"text":"Had the $15.99  4 course, steak special.  It was sooo  good. Salad, tortilla soup, 6 ounce steak and mmmmm cheese cake.  Delicious,  such a great deal."}
{"text":"Service was fine! House salads are extremely small! The crab avocado stack is very bland tasting. The chips served with the stack are thin so they break trying to eat the stack. So, pull out the fork and spoon it onto your chips. Not my go to place as a rule. My big thing today was the 45 minute wait when I saw a minimum of five tops. Then as I got ready to leave I found out I was wrong! It was a whole section; minimum of 10 tops not being used and no manager to be found (usually can spot them running around. Hasn't ever been a great experience, but not bad enough to not try again."}
{"text":"Our waiter smelled horrible! It wasn't even that busy where I could understand him having B.O. We orded soup and mac and cheese for our dinner. Im not a big fan of the steaks from here. Its hit or miss and id rather not risk a miss and end up with a steak that isnt tender. We could tell right away that our waiter had an attitude after we ordered. We werent very hungry and i was craving the mac and cheese. It is a kids dish but i would order it if they raised the price and made it a dish on the menu. Its so good when they dont make it watery, which they did this time. We had to wait almost 10 minutes after we ordered for our bread and for my drink. After we got our food our waiter never Checked on us. He walked by a dozen times but no refills and no more bread. There was also a small fly buzzing around and a Tiny gnat on our table. When we got our check there was a charge for 2 drinks we did not order! I was furious at that point. When I told the waiter he didn't even seem surprised but rather almost annoyed! I get that our bill was not going to be huge but it doesn't mean our service has to be so bad. Whenever I split a dish or order small items as my entree I always leave a good tip. The bill usually comes out to about $20 like this time and normally I would have tipped $5-6 if the service was good or even decent. I just can't believe he thought he could add onto our bill and get away with it!"}
{"text":"Food: Soup was cold and had to be warmed up again. Victoria's filet med well was flavorless and on the dry side . I'm not even sure if it was a filet cut because all of the filets I've eaten have been thick.  I've had sirloins thicker than what I got today. It looked nothing like the filets on their pictures. Hardly tender. The mac and cheese was so dried out. There was literally no sauce on the bottom of the bowel. It was horrible The cheesecake was flavorless.  My co worker found a hair in her steak. They offered to make another one but we didn't have time so they gave her a gift card for $20 to come back and took her steak off the bill, just her steak though not her whole meal.   The waitress was spaced out. Slow on the refills. No personality. Almost standoffish."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent affordable steak, this is the place. Good food and service. I always get a medium cooked steak and I haven't had to send it back for being under or over cooked like some other places I have gone to."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a good steak so we stopped here on a Friday night after shopping at Ikea. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated with no wait...it had been difficult to find an available parking space so we assumed it was packed. The restaurant was indeed fairly full so we must've just hit it right.  Our waitress was very attentive at first. She was quick to take our drink order and then for our food. She refilled drinks quite frequently but our actual meal seemed to take an extra long time. Thank goodness my husband had his cellphone games to keep him occupied.  We ordered the onion petals as an appetizer. Basically it was a bloomin' onion already disassembled...not what we were expecting based on onion petals we've had at other restaurants but they were fine. I had the French onion soup and it was very cheesy but not flavorful. The side salad with mustard vinegarette was the highlight of the meal. I'd never had that dressing before but it was excellent.   Next came our salt with a side of steak. Yes, you're reading that right. I have never, ever eaten a steak that was so overpowered and basically ruined by the seasoning. I didn't say anything while I was eating because I wondered if it was just me and finally my husband commented about the saltiness of his steak, too. I've eaten at Outback's before and never was this an issue.  When it came time to pay our waitress was busy with other tables, so I took the opportunity to pay using the Outback app. Much to my excitement it had a $5 coupon showing that I could use. I tried about 6 times (unsuccessfully) to apply it before just paying without it. That was a fitting end to this disappointment of a night."}
{"text":"Went out for a date night with my boyfriend and the server was great was very nice and friendly. Once we had put in our order for the food it took a while to come out and it was pretty much cold for the most part and very dry as if it had been sitting out for some time which really sucked since it was our first time"}
{"text":"Always a good meal with great service. On rare occasion of a problem, always handled professionally."}
{"text":"Pretty good steak house. Our waiter was friendly and joked around with us. Food was good and came out quick. Dig this place!"}
{"text":"Loved the Mahi - mahi it was awesome!  Would definitely go back for the great service and great menu items! Five stars from me!"}
{"text":"I am giving it three to be fair because it is a chain and, just like Ponderosa, we cannot compare this to upscale dining. That is a different race. My friend had a Groupon and works over here so we went. I had a light beer and wings and they were barely edible. But who am I to judge. My friend got a steak dish and reported it was okay. This is one of those places for out of towners and older folks who don't like to wander off the bland path of life. If you are these people, enjoy yourselves. Personally, I will never be back, free or not. Oh, great KID FRIENDLY place!!! This is where you can safely bring your children. Here."}
{"text":"What's the point of making a reservation when you are waiting as long as people without reservations? On top of that, the table that can sit your party has been empty since you walk in and the host finally seats you at one of those tables? Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"We were here for Sunday dinner. We were seated promptly. The service was great. I ordered filet with shrimp. The steak was cooked perfectly, the shrimp was delicious and the garlic mashed potatoes are to cry for. I will return."}
{"text":"What ever happened to the Outback that we once knew. Drinks are good, great salad, but the steaks are very average or less. Haven't had a great steak in a number of years. Still go, but have switched to coconut shrimp instead."}
{"text":"Actually gave it another chance. Went back to have a hamburger and fried mushrooms. The mushrooms are great. But the hamburgers...well I have had a lot better... tasteless, the lettuce on it had brown spots, there was hardly any onion on it."}
{"text":"This location is closed!  I don't know why I didn't call ahead to check, but there's nothing on the interwebs that indicated it was closed, so we drive there from our hotel on the strip, only to turn around and end up at a Denny's..."}
{"text":"Second time trying to eat here and not getting served. There was no hostess to greet us and we stood there for almost 10 minutes before the bartender noticed us and looked away.  Service here is non-existent. Don't come here for lunch. Each time I came between noon and one. Not a single person working there acknowledged us."}
{"text":"The wife and I started with the blooming onion.  The breading had a lot of flavor and the dipping sauce was very good, but the whole thing was very greasy.   Next we had the French onion soup and 2 salads.  The soup was average.  The salads were great though. I had the wedge salad.  The bleu cheese dressing and the balsamic vinaigrette complemented each other very well.  One of the best wedge salads I have had.  The wife ordered the classic bleu salad, with bleu cheese vin, candied pecans, wonton strips, very good.   For entrees, my wife ordered the wood fire grilled filet with mushroom Madeira sauce and a baked potato. Her filet was undercooked, but the sauce made up for it.  I ordered the alice springs chicken with a baked sweet potato.  The sweet potato was great, loved the butter and the brown sugar.  Same with the chicken.  I didn't know pouring honey mustard dressing over it would actually enhance the flavor.   Overall better meal than I was expecting."}
{"text":"I've only eaten Here once.  I love prime rib but this was the Worse prime rib ever.  Not just bloody but cold on the inside. Customer service bad,  although they, lack lu sterly, offered to take it back and cook it longer but I had lost my appetite, I did eat part of my husband's dinner which tasted okay,  we paid and left,  haven't been back since. ........ i guess could've been an isolated incident. ......Not impressed.  No complaints at the Flagstaff location however."}
{"text":"Went there with my fiancé for the New Year's Eve diner the restaurant was great. The servers were friendly the food was good the drinks were awesome. We ordered the stuffed mushroom my boo loved it and keep in mind he is not into mushrooms. We had such an awesome that we ordered more for takeout"}
{"text":"Without any hesitation, I can honestly tell you the meal my family and I had here was bar far one of the best on the strip. I know the Vegas Strip boasts some of the finest, swankiest, trendiest restaurants in the city. In my honest opinion, they fail in comparison to the meal, service, and camaraderie we had here.  The restaurant is located on the MGM block nestled just above the strip in the CocaCola world building. There is elevator access up and back down. We were seated near the window, allowing for a perfect view of Las Vegas Blvd. the view was as entertaining as the meal was delicious.   I had the Alice Springs chicken that was cooked to a buttery melt in your mouth level of perfection. It was tender and juicy, full of flavor and topped with cheese and mushroom. I opted for the baked potato as my side, it was not as good as the chicken but still delicious. My dinner companions each had the 14oz ribeye. I'm told, well I know, I snuck a piece, the steaks where cooked in butter searing in added flavor. They were thick, juicy, and seasoned to perfection. They were tender and packed with flavor. They opted for the lump CrabCake add on, this too, was magnificent. The crabcake was flaky and moist allowing full flavor.  Our server, Dave, was one of the kindest souls I've ever encountered. Our cups were never empty, we were checked on in a manner that allowed for privacy but still making sure our needs were met. It was a pleasure to meet Dave and have this meal experience."}
{"text":"Was met at the door with attitude. When asked to speak to the manager, Micheal he was so rude to my wife and I that we left. You should never tell a customer \"we are done\"and dismiss them. I under stand outback isn't a Wolfgang signature restaurant but damn! Oh bye the way I'm writing this post from a booth of the black angus up the street. Thanks for nothing, you lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"What happened to you Outback!? We have been frequenting you for years and the last several times we have been there - were very disappointing!  Food served cold, steaks not cooked to order, and one time we had a very rude Server, (female). Goodbye Outback."}
{"text":"I've visited this location over 100 times - and 37 times in the last 12 months, so I'm well qualified to comment on the food here.  My orders are always \"take-away\", and I've only dined in twice at this location- - - so this review is about the food and take away service.  Most of the time, food is prepared consistently well.  That's one thing I really like - the consistency of the food prep (portion size, ingredients).  We visit other restaurants where the same entree is prepared differently every day of the week.  With this Outback, I can be pretty certain that I'm going to like whatever I liked the last time I ordered it - - because it'll be the same.  However - food prep has intermittently been not as expected.  In fact, on my last two visits I returned home with an under-cooked steak, and a very hard, partially raw potato. This sort of thing happens maybe once in every 8-10 visits.  It's disappointing when it happens because we don't find it until we're at home having dinner - - - so it's not like I can send it back to the kitchen or ask for a replacement.  One suggestion I have for Outback would be to make it easier  for take-away customers to get a problem like this addressed (and then actually address it).  For example - if I come in next time and tell you that our last order's potato was near raw - then comp me the price of a side.  The take out person should be able to do this without having to track down a manager on a busy evening. If I have to fill out an online complaint, or wait to talk with two to three different people on site.....it's just not worth it to me - - it's too frustrating (especially if the reply is \"sorry\").   Our orders are usually correct (correct items, sides, condiments, and special requests).  There's no excuse for getting this wrong - - and again: it's completely frustrating to arrive home to discover something is missing or wrong.  There are one or two \"regular\" people at curbside who accurately take my order and check it before I leave.  But when someone \"new\" (or not a regular) is at curbside, I've learned to unpack and review every item for completeness before I leave.  There is often an error (I'd estimate half the time if it's someone \"new\") - - so I highly recommend checking your order before leaving.  Pricing is mid-range - - - you can get some good discounts using Outback's email and Dine-Rewards programs. We enjoy the food (or we wouldn't be coming back so often) - - and overall it's a fair value."}
{"text":"Just left outback on mcclintock and southern.  Our waiter was Mason, and he was fabulous.  He was right there to offer refills, offered perfect suggestions on food and drinks..the meal was perfect in every way..definitely a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Been going to this Outback since I was little. It's like a childhood memory for me. The staff is always nice and the food is always delicious! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Mother's Day of all days, was when we went here. It wasn't too bad, they said it was going to be a 10 min wait, but I called BS and we waited anyway. We waited about 30 mins, not too bad considering it'd be a pain to go else where and wait 1 hour. As we were waiting outside, a nice lady handed us a coupon for a FREE bloomin onion! She was so sweet, I guess they gave her so many coupons that she had extra left over lol.  The Eats: His: T-Bone, Fully Loaded Potato, Veggies, Michelob Ultra The Kid: 6oz Steak, Mashed Potatoes, Veggies Mine: 9oz Steak, Mashed Potatoes, Veggies 2-Coors Lights  Personally, the steaks are way over seasoned but the quality of the meat isn't all that bad, isn't awesome, but isn't horrible. Cooked just the way that I'm used to, Med-Rare, and the veggies is where the meal fell short of that 5-star rating. Over cooked, which is hard for me to comprehend when I know in these kitchens, pre-portion the Veggies and either nuke them or flash 'em in some boiling water... Kinda mushy, even the snap peas, wth. The bloomin onion is pretty consistent, no complaints, yum!  The service was great! I feel so bad that I don't remember his name, but he was nice enough to let us know about the 2for1 drink special, the Mother's Day special and everything. He checked up on us often and refills were taken care of without us having to request it.  Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back unless we have a gift card or something... Don't get me wrong, it was a great experience and not having it for awhile made it taste so much better but there are so many other better steak restaurants out there for a lot less."}
{"text":"First time ever trying Outback after a chef friend told me that their ribeye is \"really not bad and actually pretty good.\" Well shucks, it was actually better than a few high end places I've tried.   The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare, and seasoned just right. You gotta get the onion blossom--we screwed up by getting a small portion and it was not enough for three.   I'll be back for sure to get that ribeye plus a large onion blossom."}
{"text":"I have been to this Outback two times in the past 2 years. My most recent experience was much better than the first, which would explain why it took me so long to even try it again! Really, I was dragged here by my in-laws, who love the surf and turf special they currently have. You can get a lobster tail, a sirloin, and a baked potato for $9.99. It's a good price for some decent food. Unfortunately, we splurged on the giant onion blossom and the artichoke appetizer.   The onion blossom was really good - I must have been craving fried onions cuz oooh baby, they were good. They were a little greasy, especially near the end, but I had my fill. The artichoke appetizer was good as well. Everyone thought it would be flat bread but this was tortilla thin. Still, not bad. Then came the meal. My steak was ordered medium rare but came more medium-well. The taste wasn't bad, but I've had better steaks at home. The lobster was pretty good and the baked potato was meh. I didn't eat it all, but who needs all those extra carbs?   Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience. I'm not a big fan of franchise dining, but my in-laws chose the place. I probably won't go back on my own volition, but if the in-laws wanted to, I wouldn't say no."}
{"text":"I grew up with Sizzler, this is the new generation to me. It's dependable and consistent. And thank God the coconut shrimp is always on the menu. We had a Victoria filet, cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. We ordered a salad with ahi as the protein, perfectly matched and dressed. Our waiter John is fabulous. Attentive, personable and engaging. The manager even stopped by to check on everyone. They do it right here!"}
{"text":"Walked out after waiting for over 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were seated.    The manager walked by twice and did not bother to stop."}
{"text":"Went in around 3 PM for lunch and was greeted by a nearly-empty place, which was pretty relaxing after dodging the noisy crowds on the Las Vegas strip. Service was prompt and friendly, food was delicious--I ordered a burger and fries,,YUM,,,I would certainly revisit this place next time while in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you are disabled they don't want you here. I came in just before noon and requested a table. They said none we're available because of a party and the other section was closed. They said only a booth. I told them I am disabled and physically unable to sit at a booth. They didn't care. There were people seated at a booth in the \"closed\" section. I asked to sit there and they refused, so we left."}
{"text":"Tonight was a grand slam at your Madison, Wi East location.  Usually the service and food are great but tonight it was stellar! The owner helped me with an order issue and made the visit one of the best Resturant visits I've had in a while.  Enjoyed it much and we will be back.   I recommend you come eat here.....  Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"We came here for a little steak dinner and noticed the place was already packed. The wait was small and we were given those little devices that vibrate when they're ready for you.  We were seated and Justin was out server, he was very nice and made great suggestions. When I asked for more butter for the bread bc I had a mini Paula Deen (Santiago) he laughed and brought more out. Our food took little to no time and Santiagos kids' steak medallions were cooked perfectly. I ordered the Outback sirloin 8oz medium with a loaded baked potato. My steak was more well done, so when I let him know, and apologized for being a little bastard he had no problems replacing it. I told him sorry bc I inhaled the baked potato and to not worry about that, he was ever so kind to bring a new one.  The manager even came out to apologize and offered a little desert for my sleeping child. My new steak came out and it was indeed perfect!  This place is inexpensive, but the servers and staff really make it a great place to eat!  YAY!"}
{"text":"The service and food was outstanding.  Manager, Laura, and Bar Tender, Betty Boop are very friendly.  Food was served exactly as ordered and was delicious ! !"}
{"text":"After waiting over an hour for our food, and hearing almost every excuse in the book, I had the pleasure of meeting the world's most horrible manager... With an even worse attitude problem.   You couldn't pay me to go back to this place. I am too angry and disgusted to even go into the details. You're better off going to McDonald's."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone else says about this location these chefs know how to cook a steak.  The wait staff will never bring you crap either.  Every time I go here it is so busy but the wait is worth it for a well seasoned medium rare steak. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Outback Steakhouse is OK, and I am never really disappointed when I go there for a steak. However, I don't set my expectations very high. I like their blooming onion as an appetizer. Their service is average to above-average, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Do not go here!!!! Went here Sunday for my younger sisters birthday and my ENTIRE family got awful food poisoning. We all got different meals but all suffered the same violent symptoms. Will not be returning and will be making sure to let family and friends to stay away as well."}
{"text":"Speedy and kind service. My mother all time favorite for lunch! Yummy food! Affordable priced and nice atmosphere. The Cobb salad was so scrumptious.. that I'm at work wishing I was digging  into their salads. It was so fresh. Mouth watering steak. Spot on. Will be returning, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Group of 10 and very good service. Good price on most of the food items that come with 2 sides."}
{"text":"We had a group of 7 for dinner. We were told there would be a 20-30 minute wait but we were seated within 10 minutes.   We were all impressed with the taste and size of our individual meals. From steak to lobster tail to mac n cheese, we were all pleased. None of us were able to completely clear our plates.   The server was very attentive right up until time to pay. It took a long time to get the bill. But that was my only complaint."}
{"text":"Why is Gilbert the capital of chain restaurants? I try to stay away from them and go to locally owned, but there are so few in Gilbert outside of the downtown area. Anyway, was in a hurry and hungry so we took a chance on Outback. Simply confirmed my opinion of chain restaurants. Food was not well prepared (celery was frozen and look like it had been through a garbage disposal, fries were limp and greasy). Obvious flaws that no one in the kitchen caught or cared to correct. Everything is over salted, apparently to hide the lack of flavor. Just glad I didn't order anything from the higher priced side of the menu. I do complement the waiter, who was good to check in with us and brought replacement food, but it just galls me to pay those prices and have a kitchen operating with no adult supervision. Hire good management and pay them a fair wage to do what they are supposed to do, i.e. manage."}
{"text":"Don't ask me why I keep frequenting chain restaurants -- I must be a glutton for punishment.  So, I've been to this Outback a few times before, I used to order the prime rib, but it had come out so fatty the past few times that I stopped ordering it.  Last night, I met a couple friends here and this time I ordered the Outback Special Sirloin with the lobster and mushroom topping (an extra $3.95)  for the more \"indulgent steak experience,\" as stated on the menu.    So the appetizer and salad came out fine, no problems thus far.  Then the steak came out.  It was cooked fine, but they forgot to include the lobster and mushroom topping for the more indulgent steak experience.  I told my server nicely that they had forgotten the topping and he assured me that it would be right out. The steak was decent and cooked correctly, however I was disappointed because the lobster and mushroom topping came out 10 minutes after my steak, which was cold by now and the \"topping\"  wasn't really a lobster topping with mushrooms, it was more of a lobster bisque with mushrooms.  If I had known it was going to be so disappointing, I wouldn't have bothered to wait for it while my steak got cold.  It would have been nice if the server apologized and took the \"topping\" off my bill (yes, it was just $3.95 but it's the principle of the matter), or offered a free dessert, but there was no accountability.  I don't expect to have another indulgent steak experience at Outback anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the small Pedals appetizer and I was so excited for this because I've always wanted to try a bloomin' onion. The actual bloomin' onion is just toooo big for one person. Even the small app was just too much for one person.   I also got the volcano shrimp which I thought was absolutely delicious. If I ever went back, which I highly doubt, I'd totally get this again.   My friend ordered Mac and Cheese and chicken tenders. She said they were delicious but that the fries were not worth it.   Our waitress was very kind and attentive. She brought me a refill of my soda because she simply noticed that I was out.   I has one of their mixed drinks; can't remember what it was called but if it wasn't so expensive, I would have ordered another one.   We definitely enjoyed our experience here. Food came out promptly despite them being fairly busy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this location about a year and a half ago for the first time. We expected a long wait because it was on a Saturday night. When we sat down, our waiter promptly took our drink order but it took about 15-20 minutes for him to return with the drinks. We let it slide. But then he got two tables seated near us and was more concerned about their food and drinks. It about 30 minutes to receive our food and another 10 for our check. We swore we wouldn't go back for a long time due to the inadequate service.   Now, this past weekend (January 6th, 2017), we returned because we were give a gift card for Christmas. We were hesitant to go but decided to give it another shot. The wait staff this time around was phenomenal. Even though they ran out ribs, which my boyfriend ordered, the substituted another entree and gave him a free beer. That's a win in my book.   Our opinions about Outback Steakhouse have definitely changed since this experience.   Keep it up, Outback."}
{"text":"Went to Outback for dinner. There's usually a wait, the staff says 40 minutes, but it was closer to 20. Food & service was great as always.  Our server, Mike was very professional & personable. We didn't have to wait long for anything. Mike was on the job."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and during happy hour, which is everyday.  They started us with a piece of bread and butter, which was ok.  The bread could've been warmer.  I had the 6 oz steak and shrimp with veggies and mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked as I ordered it and the spices were just right with a hint of chile.  The mashed potatoes were also flavorful but not garlicky as described on the menu.  There veggies included broccoli, carrots and squash and I got 3 shrimp which were also a little spicy and good, but a bit hard.  The grill flavors were awesome and I think that's I liked the meal.  Hubby got the fish with crab stuffing which was delicious and had a butter melt with like mushroom topping and veggies.  Kids got the grilled chicken with Fries, and the chicken was really flavorful.    Only downer is that they offer only one side with some of the meals and no salad or soup is included.  On our trip we did try a wedge salad which was okay for size but never had this wedge type salad before and we tried the house soup with was creamy potatoe which was also flavorful with a few chunks of potatoe.  The mixed drinks were really good but weren't told one of them wasn't in the happy hour special-now we know!  The waitress was nice and came over to our table enough and also thanked us for dining with them, very nice."}
{"text":"Checked in yesterday at the Outback , when I did they had different pricing then they had on Yelp, the service was excellent and they had no problem giving me the price . Food was good!"}
{"text":"Urgent!!! Avoid this restaurant, I made the mistake of giving their take out another try. The last time, when I arrived at home, I discovered that the order was wrong. The one entree they got right was raw lamb. Gave them another try today, they got the order right but we asked for no chives in the soup and it was full of them. The Caesar salad had brown lettuce, the baked potato was days old and so salty on the inside, it was not edible. Finally, my chicken was overlooked and sand paper dry. I called the manager, told him of my experience but he believes that his food is consistent, yeah consistently BAD. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, the filet mignon was very tough and salty and hard to chew. I've eaten at Outback many times and I was really disappointed. Brought my dad and daughter and none of us were happy. I think they may have changed their policy. The lobster tail was so tiny and the meat was so salty and tough to chew.  Sad because I feel like I lost one of my fav places"}
{"text":"Went here today while passing through town with my sister. We both ordered burgers and fries and they were great! I would order them again. But it was a terrible experience because of the lack of service. There were plenty of servers for the amount of people there, but our food came out slowly, especially for two orders of exactly the same thing. No reason for two burgers and fries to take twenty minutes with so few people in the place. That's the kitchen's fault, too. Then it took a while to get our bill, and then another long while for her to pick up the gift card I was using. I never got a receipt because the waitress didn't come back! Pretty ridiculous. Hopefully another outback location has better service."}
{"text":"The crab cake was tepid at best.   The $4 bar drinks made an impact The new black salt rim 'rita looks nice but I was told \"wouldn't order it again\"  The steak and lobster is still worth showing up for.  The wedge salad has a sweetness to the blue cheese dressing. Nice portion size for the salad and the cherry tomatoes are plentiful.   New management abound.  I will say what I don't care for at any Outback (and this is a corporate thing):  THEIR COUPONS end too quickly."}
{"text":"Don't usually waste time leaving bad reviews. Had to in this case. Sat at the bar to grab a quick bit with the wife. 3pm on a Saturday 1 other at the bar .. saw 2 other couples in the whole restaurant. Waited 5 min while watching the bartender stack dishes.. told us would be there in a minute. I ordered a large beer .. wife a water with lemon. Other than taking our food order never saw her again until the bill was given to us. Service sucked!!! Food??? Was worse. $10 for 2 skewers of shrimp that looked dry .. tasted dry., looked a week old.. burnt and tasted like plastic and this shrimp was small!!! Wife orders ahi tuna.. no flavor that was sitting on top of a weak excuse for coleslaw. Outback bread should be renamed outhouse bread! I know it's complimentary but it was stale.. microwaved tasteless glob of flour! Back to the service .,or lack of! Could of used a second beer to force the crappy food down.. but she never returned until we finished. Price wise it is over priced crappy food. Ordered  wings to go for my daughter.. bartender said they had BBQ wings .. great. Should of checked them before leaving .. got to our hotel room and it was cold fried wings with a small side of BBQ sauce .. no ranch which she asked if I wanted., and did want. Only up side was the restaurant is in the parking lot of our hotel. so I could walk back and get more BBQ sauce ( when asked upon returning the bartender said we do have BBQ wings.. suggested I put another cup of BBQ sauce on the wings and close the lid of the container and shake them then heat them up) how did she know they were cold? .. got the  ranch dressing they forgot.. and complain to the manager., who really didn't seem to care. Should of went to Burger King and stop by 7-11 for a six pack. That would of been a better idea.. better food..,better beer .. and better service!"}
{"text":"There was a shard of glass literally in our dessert and my brother bit into it.  I'm not even sure how that got through.... But never again would I step foot in here. But!!! Loved my server she was great. Very cool and collected."}
{"text":"We walked in on sunday night and it wasnt busy as it was closer to 7 and past dinner rush. The host was a complete rude girl. Well it took 10 minutes to be seated in a near empty restaurant. Server (emily) came and did a great job. Very personable and helpful. I give the host 0 stars and server 5 stars. Now comes the food. We ordered the blooming onion and it was awesome. Very nice appetizer. Then we ordered our steaks. Wife got a sirloin steak medium rare and i got the same thing but medium well. Steaks were nice but it took like 30 minutes. The house salad was old and so not fresh. The sweet potato was awful. My baked potato was great. All in all it was 3 stars. Could he better but it was average this time"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a party of nine.  We did a call-ahead and they had the table ready when we arrived.  We have eaten there a couple times before and had good meals.  Our waitress, Megan, was excellent.  She handled our big group as if it was a party of two. The manager came over a couple times too to approve a couple coupons.  I had the prime rib which  I was reluctant to order but it was cooked perfectly.  The cut was large and I took half home.  A couple others had the filet mignon which also was very good.  Even though it is a chain, Outback puts out a good product and good service at a reasonable price.  This location in particular has a good reputation.  Will definitely return when I want a piece of meat."}
{"text":"Definitely below par on all levels. Very disappointed as we are big outbacks fans. No wood fire, food was bland however the service was good."}
{"text":"I havent been to an Outback in a really long time, but we got a gift card for Christmas and were excited to go. The wait staff seemed kind of kerfuffled, kind of like they were getting slammed  except they werent. It was about 1/3 full. We almost got a greeting but then the two ladies at the front had some staffing issues to discuss while we waited. I remember Outback as a pretty nice place (again I havent been in a LONG time, nor have I ever been to this one). The kind of place you would take a date and get fresh pepper ground on your salad. I wouldnt take a date here. The menus were old and worn, the disposable salt and pepper grinders were cloudy and almost empty. My husband ordered pork ribs and chicken, which were good, but he traded the fries that came with it for a salad and the waiter asked if he wanted it with dinner or before. He chose before so his ribs and chicken came on a plate all lonely. Not even a parsley sprig. I had the Cobb Salad which was the exact same Cobb Salad I got the last time I ordered one at Dennys. Wouldnt go back,  would go to Dennys instead where my expectations would be lower."}
{"text":"Overall: 1 star.  The customer service from the manager was terrible.  Service: 1 star.  I ordered take-out on Dec 11 2015.  I picked it up and they forgot to include an appetizer.  This is annoying, but it happens sometimes with take-out.  I called and they said they would remake it.  I drove back to pick it up, and the manager was very snarky and said, \"Are you sure it wasn't in the bag?\"  That's just a stupid thing to say to a customer who drove all the way back.  They gave me a slide of cheesecake as a sorry, so that was nice.  Food: 3 stars.  Ribs were decent.  The blooming onion is disgusting; I can't believe this is popular.  Cheesecake was not freshly made, but it was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"They are always a good chain to get a good steak at but now with their steak trio and cake pop trio I am in heaven!"}
{"text":"2nd Time coming to this location. 1st Time during a yelp event.  Sat at the bar cause it was packed!! Service was on-par! Our bartender /server was awesome, so polite & attentive. She was busy but didn't act like it!   Food was awesome, from the drinks to the food. I got 2 of the $5 dollar fun cocktails. And hubby got a Large beer.   Food was perfect & hot! It's a busy location so be prepared to wait but!! Sit at the bar if you don't want to wait, quick great service!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best, the manager ended up getting more stuff for our table than the actual server. Food tasted great though, everything came out perfect, and had an overall good experience with then."}
{"text":"Wow! That is literally all I can say. We've been coming to this location the past 4 or 5 years and have a plethora of servers - from good to bad.  Tonight, we had the best experience at a restaurant ever. From the server, Robert, to the manager Brian/Bryan, they absolutely knocked it out of the park.   To start, Robert was very kind upon greeting us - he had a great upbeat attitude. After going over beer options with us (Robert, great job on describing the beers), we had our salads within minutes. Shortly after, he checked in to ensure everything was okay. To follow-up that, he let us know an approximate ETA of those sweet, delicious steaks.   Food was killer! Great job to the cooks in the back. My girlfriend and I are in food coma's. Steak were juicy, bloody, and just the way we wanted.   Shortly after our meal, Bryan/Brian the manager, came to check in on us to ensure everything was satisfactory. We informed him how great our experience with Robert was, and he seemed incredibly appreciative of the kind feedback. He chatted with us, asking where we were from and showed a genuine interest in us. After, he wished us a happy holidays and to take care.   I'm sure I've been rambling on for a while, but the crew here deserves high praises. It felt extremely home-ey, we felt welcomed, and we felt valued as a customer.   Keep it up Bryan/Brian and Robert! We hope to see you two when we're visiting Vegas next."}
{"text":"I've been pleased with my experiences at this outback. With many steak options and sides it's a comfy restaurant based on an Australia theme. They even had blokes and Sheila on the bathroom doors. Pretty original if you ask me, I really enjoyed the food and ambiance and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this Outback was now open for lunch.  I cannot get enough of Outbacks salad.  Not that it is anything spectacular by any means.  It's just usually fresh and well chilled.  Service is so          S L O W         Like seriously slow... The first time I came I chopped it up to being newly opened for lunch and still figuring out staffing but nope!  I've been here 3 times and it sucks.  I order the endless soup and salad with barely enough time to eat even the salad.  -love soupless in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great place with amazing steak. Kids beg is to go here and service is always good. I hate the wait though. This is the main gripe I have with outback because they usually have more then enough tables to seat you in."}
{"text":"My only complaint with OUTBACK ever is the fact that you have to wait so long to sit down.  It always seems there are many tables open, so why can't they just sit everyone.  Any steak I have ever had is amazing cooked perfect (med-rare).  My kids beg me to go to outback, they love the Macaroni and I have to admit, its not half bad.    The desserts are amazing too - anything they have will tickle your taste buds."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day lunch, was told the wait was 15 min with my reservation, ended up being 30 min and required me going to remind the host that we were still waiting. She was quite irritated that I even asked, but got us seated finally.   Michelle was our server, she was super nice and super fast. Our bloomin onion came out burnt to a crisp and I felt bad but I had her take it back. She genuinely felt terrible about it even though it wasn't her fault she was so apologetic about it. The manager Mike, came by right away and offered us another bloomin onion but I declined. He insisted on comping us a dessert, which we took him up on.  On probably one of their busiest days of the year, we still had an ok experience at outback minus the wait time and irritated hostess.    Don't quote a time that you can't keep a promise on within reason because the people that have to wait twice as long as you quote will be more upset than those you've already told will be a long wait."}
{"text":"I love Outback! The best place to go to grab a good meal ranging from seafood to steak. Lots of fun and tasty appetizers (blooming onion and coconut shrimp) as well as yummy libations and desserts!   I'm from Texas so I'm a big fan of med rare juicy steaks. Sometimes, this Outback doesn't always have the most tender cuts which can kind of put a damper on the meal if you are going for steak. However, most of the times it's very tasty and all other menu items are good and great place for family dinners and even a nice night out."}
{"text":"We lived very close to this restaurant and have eaten there many times over the last decade. It tends to be very, very busy at peak times, we generally tried to avoid those times, but if you arrive at 6 pm on Saturday don't be surprised to wait on a table. That said, we found the food well prepared and tasty. Service was always good,  servers very friendly. I often ordered the prime rib or a ribeye, and the steaks were always cooked as I requested. They do tend to use a fair amount of butter on everything it seems, so if you are watching calories be sure to ask if they can omit it.  Overall, I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We love Outback. I'd say in the 10-12 years we've eaten there, it's been consistantly wonderful. Except for the last few times we've eaten at this location. We did call ahead seating, which is always a plus. We had a party of 8 for my birthday celebration. The waitress was accommodating, but the food was lackluster-very unusual. Our knives weren't clean either. In a steak oriented restaurant, I think the knives should shine! Our cheese fries came out and were chewy, like they'd sat under a heat lamp for a while. And the blooming onion looked as if it had been found under the sea. What an unusually tiny onion. We took the appetizers as is, voiced our opinion and ate them because we were so hungry.  The odd thing with out entrees was, our waitress tried to explain to us that a party of 8 had to have their order split in two. Therefore, half of the table got their food a good 5-8 minutes before the other half. Really? That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. And mind you, this location wasn't busy. I assumed that they must be short staffed in the kitchen. That's still a dumb thing to do. The waitress was very attentive and we spent a lot of money tonight, and we tipped well. But I think unless we're desperate, we'll just go to our home Outback, located in Matthews. We only came here to help our parents not have to travel as far. Please Outback, stop screwing with a good thing. Stop messing with the menu and start incentivizing (sp?) employees to stay."}
{"text":"Outback is always reliably sufficient, but suffers on all levels from a feeling of outdated corporate oversight. Most notable for me are the disappointingly archaic beer and scotch offerrings, as well as the lovelessly prepared food. The chain serves meat - they don't seem to really care about the rest."}
{"text":"Most disappointing meal ever!  Ordered steak and shrimp combo. Steak was ordered medium but came to table cold and way over done. It was sent back and replaced by another that was just slightly better. I accepted it as the other people in our party were almost finished with their meal when my replacement arrived at the table. The shrimp (4) were pitifully small and also over cooked. This Outback location is not my favorite and I will not eat there again.  I've been to this location three times and it has been disappointing each time. I will not go back. The Cactus location is so much better!"}
{"text":"I'm always very hesitant to go to chain restaurants part of corporate conglomerates, because too often you find that service is sub par and quality is lacking in every aspect. However, I was extremely and pleasantly surprised with my experience here today.  We walk in, and the place is packed at 5:30. We opt for the bar and the friendly hostesses point us in the right direction. Within a minute of sitting down at a high top, our server, Kent, dropped by to let us know he was gonna be right with us. He returned shortly and took our drink orders, remembering to ask if my boyfriend wanted sweetener for his iced tea since most people don't ask. He showed up with our drinks and brought fresh bread and took our order.   We ordered the snack blooming onion, caprese and snack quesadilla. Although we only ordered 15 dollars of food, Kent didn't seem to mind or have the typical \"these people aren't ordering a lot so I'm gonna get stiffed\" attitude. All the food was pretty decent, surprisingly the quesadilla was the best part. Furthermore, the food came out really quickly which was nice.  Kent checked up on us regularly offering more bread when empty, and promptly refilled drinks before they were even half empty. He was quick and efficient, which was perfect because we were in a time crunch. He was able to drop and run the check within 5 minutes or less. You could tell he was definitely doing figure 8s around his section. What really blew me away was when we were completely cashed out, he offered to grab to go cups for our drinks. Small touch, but extremely thoughtful.  Lastly, I haven't been in this place in years. The new renovation is just darling. The inside has lots of open space with quirky and modern touches, such as a wine box branded with \"blooming onions\" on it filled with a box of huge white onions.   Perhaps we just got lucky, but we are definitely adding this place to our rotation of restaurants to stop by in. Kent did a superb job, and I hope he is recognized by his superiors for his hospitality."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Never ate at any Outback before this was pretty good i must say.  The var n drinks were a triumph. But thats not tge story here.  I went with a leaner cut the filet. Willing to sacrifice a little flavor  for the health of it. But no sacrifice would occur here. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Juices well retained with all the flavor and tendernesss to melt in your mouth. I ate it more quickly than most entrees and found my self wishing i had ordered the higher ounce cut The blooming onion was better than ever and sauce supplied  was capital Yummy.  Service at the bar where we sat was excellent and the place had a friendly atmosphere. Always a bonus when the GM cones by to ask you about your visit.  I will have no reservations about visiting another  Outback especially if its as well run as this one"}
{"text":"We were seated in an empty section during a slow afternoon and waited 15 minutes without any acknowledgement. Have the screens on the tables replaced friendly waitstaff? We decided to leave rather than find out."}
{"text":"Location is right off the freeway and easy to find. Plenty of parking for the establishment. We were greeted by the receptionist and sat down quickly. Our server who appeared to be not only new at Outback but also new to becoming a server. We sat at our table for almost 15 minutes before the server greeted us. I understand the delay if the establishment was busy,tonigjt however was not one of those nights. Our party of 3 ordered a glass of milk, glass of unsweetened iced tea and a long Island ice tea. The milk and regular ice tea showed up fairly quickly but the adult beverage took another 15 minutes without any offer of water while I waited. I asked for a glass of water while I waited which also took awhile to arrive. When the server arrived with my water he said he was pushing the bartender to make my drink and that the bartender was \"chatty cathy\" and that's why my drink was so late. Our food shows up and immediately there are issues. The kid's meal burger was put in as an adult burger and came with fixings that most 8 year old will not eat. The steaks my wife and ordered were just absolutely nasty! If you are going to spend $25 on each steak you would want it cooked correctly and actually receive what you paid for. Honestly we feel like we were given a low end steak when we are paying for a much better cut. Needless to say we sent the steaks back and asked to speak with management. The manager was nice and corrected the issue and that's why I'm giving this location 2 stars instead of one. Personally we should of went up another exit to Texas Roadhouse instead. Needless to say we won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Outback steakhouse in probably about 4 or 5 years but I wanted something different so I decided to stop by.  Our waitress seemed a little busy so it took a bit of time in between her visits but she was so nice and friendly that it made up for it.  I ordered the 10 oz Ribeye and to my amazement it was actually cooked correctly!  It is one of my biggest pet peeves to go to a restaurant, order a steak medium rare and then get it medium well.  If you're not going to cook it right, don't ask!  Moving on though....the Aussie fries and clam chowder were both really good too surprisingly.  I don't usually expect to get good clam chowder at a steakhouse.  The bill was less than I was expecting too which is always a nice surprise.  I will definately be venturing back before another 5 years passes!"}
{"text":"Horrible service upon arrival. 6 open tables and we were told it would be a 30 min wait because the hostesses said they didn't want to overwhelm their servers.  The three hostesses then went on to tell us the restaurant was so very busy and we didn't understand,  even though we were staring at a restaurant with several empty tables.  The hostesses were rude and condescending.  One hostess then went on to say our patronage as year round Arizonans didn't matter. No thank you Outback, we'll never visit again. Oh and we easily spend over $1,000 every year."}
{"text":"I've usually had good experiences here. First, the food was good, hot and warm.  Our issue was with the service: 1) The server didn't greet us until 15 minutes after we were seated 2) They saw we were with a baby, so should have realized we probably didn't want to be sitting around all night. 3) Bloomin' onion was good, but delivered with no plates. 4) We were quite parched. Being it was 115 degrees out and we didn't get refills on any of our drinks for 30 minutes. 5) The food came, but took so long someone in our party had to leave. We'd been there for an hour by the time the food was delivered. 6) The waiter seemed completely oblivious to the fact we'd eaten all the coursed and no dirty plates had been cleaned off our table.  7) The 2 bussers hadn't noticed the mess on our table either  I have lots of choices in this area of where to eat, looks like I'll be frequenting other places from now on."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Go at your own risk. Food was ok but not enough to make up for the slow service, waitress keeps forgetting to bring us ketchup, plates, etc. the only fastest time she ever came was to bring the check and take our payment. Worst time ever at outback."}
{"text":"This Steak House is amazing. One of the best restaurants ever! There steak is fine cut and absolutely delicious. There soup is creamy and warm to the heart. There fries are fried to perfection and salad to live for. Out back is a great place to host dinner birthday parties with the whole family. Never disappoints. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Our family love the steaks and the potato soup here. The quality of the food is usually great until this evening when we went for dinner. I'm not sure what happened but ours steaks were cold when they arrived and 3 out of 4 steaks were over cooked. The 11 oz sirloin for my husband was the only one perfect while my 6 oz sirloin and my son and step son's 8 oz sirloins were medium well (we ordered the medium rare). We ate them any way because we weren't about to order new steaks. Our waiter apologized about the steaks but it wasn't his fault. The bread that you share at the table was still good and blooming onion is always another favorite."}
{"text":"I have been here for over an hour. We had two families come in after us order eat pay then leave. The food runner served me cold steak. He didn't know what steak was cooked to what temp. Didn't get offered one refill the hour and half I have been here. I don't understand how any of this is okay with management. They should be embarrassed. Also got served cold sides."}
{"text":"Haven't been there in years and now I know why. I had a coupon and had about 45 min for lunch. From the time I sat down until we got our lunch was 30 minutes. It was a hamburger and a piece of fish. It's not like they were busy at all.  Now to the food..... the hamburger was all bun. A 10 dollar burger should at the very least be as good as the local fast food joint.  It wasn't.  The fish was a piece of fish and a few veggies for 12.99. No sauce, no nothing, and it was highly spiced and undercooked in the thicker sections. Outback has out lived its time.  I remember when it was a nice restaurant, now it's a glorified Dennys. No, wait, I had a nice piece of fish, 2 sides and a salad at Denny's in under 20 min for about 10 bucks.  So I guess Dennys is a glorified outback."}
{"text":"My son and I went here tonight and everything was perfect!!! They were very busy but we had made reservations so we were seated within 5 minutes. Our server, Michelle, was the bomb. She made sure we had everything we needed and our drinks were always refilled. The manager came by to ask us how everything was as well. The food was DELICIOUS, my steak was cooked exactly as I ordered and Michelle made sure my son got a birthday sundae and song even though I just mentioned in passing that tomorrow is his birthday - will definitely be back. So pleased!!!"}
{"text":"I can only stress this so much. If there is one thing I look for when I go out to eat at any restaurant, its cleanliness. This restaurant is by far the cleanest place I've been too yet. Service could have used a bit of work, however after dealing with a table of 15 I understood the guys tiredness and all. I had no issues with being seated, given my drinks in a timely fashion, and my food was fresh and hot when I received it, definitely wasn't sitting under a heat lamp. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and the management still took the time to ask me how everything was, regardless if I had a complaint or not; which I didn't. I will more than likely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"I love this place great customer service, friendly, and good atmosphere.The manager tonight took good care of us, he was awesome. Food is always fresh and tasty...."}
{"text":"Once again great service at outback ! I tried a different location and service was great My steak had to be cooked more but it came out great in the end The manager made a special trip over to me to apologize as well as the server Eric couldn't have been more accommodating ! Customer service is very consistent with each location !"}
{"text":"Again another great experience at outback ! Food was wonderful ! Wendy was our waitress and was amazing ! Very informative with our order ! What an accent to your company Thank you all"}
{"text":"Good food but less than average service. Our server forgot a few things that we needed. Then with a to go order, she gave us a box, no bag to carry it out. We had to ask. But finally, our bill came without any questions about coffee or dessert. I guess she figured we ate enough."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's a chain, so it's not a swanky dark wood and red leather kind of a place. Have I ever had a bad meal there or bad service? Nope quite the opposite, everything I have had there has been good, no we are not talking Del Frescos, but we are not talking their prices either, so there you have it. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"If I could leave less than one star I would.  The server was rude to start with, then we received a grease pit of a blooming onion. And to finish a still mooing steak on not plate but two. I will not be back here."}
{"text":"Horrible service, owner, floor manager greeted and talked to every other table except ours and the asian dude. Never got my caesar salad which i really really was looking forward too. Server tried to bring it after my entree was done smh, like yeah im good on that. Used to love outback but since its basically a Applebee's now with crap service I'll pass. Go somewhere else for the money!"}
{"text":"I was just here with my family for my stepdads birthday and while the food was really good, we had asked about three times to come out and surprise him (as soon as I walked in and twice towards the end) and nobody did. As someone who works in food at the casinos, it wasn't even busy so why they failed to come out confuses me. We regularly come to this place because they're usually on top of their game but not this time."}
{"text":"Came here last week for a date with my wife due to gift cards we had for YEARS lol and Outback didn't disappoint! We both ordered sirloin steaks with baked potato, broccoli and side salad. The steak was cooked medium just as I had requested and the potato was very flavorful. The broccoli was easy to eat and not hard/chewy like you get at other places. The bread they gave before the meals was also pretty good compared to other restaurants. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful.  I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the best steak place around, but it's definitely not a bad option."}
{"text":"11 months ago we had an amazing experience at this establishment. Since then, we've had poor experiences. We visited on Monday evening. Seated right away. The server was very down to business and rushed. Robotic almost. I can let that go. What I can't get over is the quality of the food now. The side salad I paid extra for was very small and consisted of iceberg lettuce, 2 halves of a cherry tomato, 3 croutons, several petals of onion and drenched in dressing. It's not the same as it used to be at all. I remember how great they used to look and portioned perfectly. I also ordered the shrimp. It was as expected. The server felt it was necessary to keep taking the bread plates we were using without asking. We tested her with the last plate and sure enough, she took it with some of my food still on it. I had to ask for it back. Nothing about our experience was extraordinary. It's gone way down since the great experience 11 months ago. I think we'll skip over this place and see what else is out there."}
{"text":"Christmas dinner with the family.  Great food and the service was excellent.  Ribeye was perfectly cooked to medium.  Porterhouse was huge as my parent shared the 32 Oz. My wife said her filet minon was perfect as well.  Delicious"}
{"text":"Came here after a long vegas night, we were so hungry!   You get to ride the elevator inside the coke bottle to get here, it's pretty cool!  It wasn't very busy, we were seated right away and ordered. We ordered a burger and bacon cheese fries.   Everything came quick and was pretty good- just the usually greasy fast food type of food.   It wasn't very flavorful but I feel like I would respect anything crazy from this place.  Good service, alright food and reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I had the sirloin and shrimp. Sirloin was well seasoned. Shrimp was a little overcooked. Mac and cheese was Velveeta. Picture looked better. The waitress was either overworked and or just plain inattentive. We waited for our order to be taken and had to wait for utensils even after our food arrived. We had to flag someone down to get. Maybe it was just one of those days for her."}
{"text":"This time we ordered to go, curbside pick up.  Food was ready in 15 minutes as promised. I highly recommend the curbside pick us as it's super convenient,  everything is delivered right to your vehicle. Our order was complete, I would suggest to try the coconut shrimp, it's delicious."}
{"text":"This time we didn't get jaded by a poor meal by a celebrity chef owned restaurant.  We used some of our Casino Royale Players Comp Credits for a meal at the Outback and I got one of the best meals I had in Las Vegas. The pork chops were cooked perfectly medium with pink in the middle.  Seasoned good.  I wasn't shy about grabbing the bones with my hands and getting all that meat off the bones.  Just another solid performance by the Outback kitchen."}
{"text":"We came for the endless shrimp promo they had with the steak... First off...yes it starts off at $15.99 but that's not the \"endless\" part. Just a 5-6oz steak with 1 side and 1 order of shrimp is $15.99 but anyways the commercial got us to go.  The service we received was excellent. Our server always came to check on us, asked 2-3x if we needed anything, and made sure our glasses we never empty. The service was 5 star. The food was just a 3 star.   Blooming Onion 4/5  This ever disappoints. Great appetizer to share with a table...who doesn't like onions rings in a flower!? LOL   Crab Cakes 4/5  Tender crab meat and lots of it. Seasoned well. Nice dipping sauce too.    Ribs/chicken dinner with mac and cheese and side salad 3/5  The ribs were tender but lacked bbq sauce or dry rub seasoning. The chicken was very bland and has to use my side bbq and ask for extra to give it flavor between my chicken and ribs. The salad was just that...a side salad with ranch dressing. I can say they do have great ranch dressing! The mac and cheese was ok but NOT cheesy...it's mac and cheese....WHERE'S THE CHEESE?!?!   Steak w/ endless shrimp and lobster 3/5  My boyfriend said the steak was good but he asked for medium rare and got a medium steak instead. The crispy shrimp you can tell was frozen or prepared off site that they just just fry them there. The garlic shrimp was just poured over with the garlic sauce and very oily. The lobster was the only thing (my boyfriend said) was 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat at the Scottsdale 101, we were looking for a particular restaurant, but couldn't find it. I think it was Capital Grill. Later on I found the website and it's a bit pricey for casual dining. Outback was packed at 6:30. We waited about 20 minutes and found some seating in the bar area. My wife and I had the prime rib, medium rare and my daughter had the chick sandwich. Chris, our waiter, was average. My side of cesear salad had a hint of too much salt. It could have been in the cheese. My wife had the 8  oz and I had th 12 oz prime rib. It was cooked to perfection, but my prime rib was unevenly cut and had a lot of fat. But all in all, it was a nice dinner."}
{"text":"We stopped off for dinner. My wife wanted a steak, but when she saw the prime rib on the menu, it quickly changed her mind.  We tried the Crab Cakes with Dijonnaise slaw which had a lot of stuffing around them which deaden the taste of the crab. You could see pieces of crab here and there, but probably not enough to spend $11.  The 8 oz prime rib was seasoned and cooked nicely, except when they brought mine out, it was missing the sauteed mushrooms. Why would you bring a meal out that wasn't complete?? My wife had her prime rib with house salad. They have a happy hour which DOES NOT include the appetitzers, only the alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"Horrors upon horrors. We have gone probably 4 times and it's gotten worse every time. I really am pretty patient and try to be understanding but the last time was very bad. My wife ordered shrimp and they brought her dish out 10 minutes after everyone else. And her shrimp were raw. Literally - they were translucent. I know for a fact it takes about a minute to cook shrimp so I don't understand how that can happen if they are 10 minutes late to bringing it. Never will we go again"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight and it was an overall excellent experience. I believe our server's name was Donny. He was very friendly and attentive. My husband's ribeye was perfectly cooked and seasoned and my steak salad was delicious. The manager also came by to make sure everything was okay. Thank you, Outback!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised by our visit to Outback tonight.  Out management team is in town for a meeting and we decided to grab a quick dinner.  Our waitress Trista was very attentive to our needs.  Our drinks never went empty.  Our food was cooked perfectly.  My only complaint is our table was very close to a table on both sides of us so it became a little to cozy."}
{"text":"I've found myself at this Outback twice now for lunch during the work week. I was leery both times since I'm a steak fanatic and typically favor local restaurants. For a chain steakhouse this place is pretty decent.   This location is near many businesses so they are great at accommodating a lunch hour. Seating was prompt and the waitress was quick to get orders taken. The food is pretty quick and check out is efficient with no problem in getting split checks.   I'm currently counting calories so I studied the menu well the day before eating here. Outback posts their nutrition facts on their website for those that are interested. I found out that Victoria's 6 ounce filet with mixed vegetables and asparagus would fell within the calorie range I had allotted for lunch. The only downside is that the filet isn't an item on the lunch menu so my meal was more expensive than what I would normally spend for a quick weekday lunch. I didn't see anything on the lunch menu that I recognized as a low calorie option from the website.   The Victoria's filet was pretty tasty and it was prepared as requested. The seasoning was pretty good, but probably high in sodium. The veggie sides were very good for vegetables. The size of the meal was satisfying without being a heavy meal. My coworker ordered Ahi Tuna as an appetizer and insisted that I try it. I thought the pepper crust was nice, but I'm not sure I would order it for myself. He also ordered the steak tacos which were chock-full of steak and looked delicious. The steaks are a good lunch value from the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Watching the World Series, while enjoying steak, shrimp and beer.  The endless shrimp deal is amazing...such a good deal."}
{"text":"My gf & I went on a double date here. We went about an hour before closing & we had Jeff as our server.  The service by Jeff was excellent. A few things he did was:  1) Make sure our fries were fresh & crispy 2) Have all sauces, napkins, condiments, etc. available to us w/o us having to ask 3) Replaced our bread w/o us having to ask 4) Refilled our drinks & never let them get low 5) Humor (not dry or sarcastic but genuine 6) Not rush us even though they were closing soon 7) Talked/met with us at eye level, not overpowering us  We ordered the 12 oz Outback special (medium rare) with fries & mashed potatoes. Food was great & the steak was delicious enough without having to add extra sauces."}
{"text":"Best sirloin I've ever had at any outback. We paid more because we were obviously in vegas. But cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. Both my husband and I ordered the same meal plus the blooming onion. We paid about $70 with the tip. Great atmosphere clean. Very friendly staff. I'd go again any time I was in vegas."}
{"text":"Great service, \"okay\" food. Came in on a Friday night, place was pretty busy. My girlfriend and I got seated within 15 minutes, then were brought drinks right away. Ordered the loaded bloomin onion for an app. Came out very quickly, but was very greasy. Made it through about half of it and couldn't do the rest. Ordered the chicken and ribs, chicken was good, but ribs had very little meat on the bone and were pretty dry. Girlfriends parm chicken was good. Steaks also seemed overpriced, almost $15 for a 6oz. Service was fast, but the food was okay at best. We had a gift card and still almost paid double what we would have at Texas roadhouse, who has better food I think. Not sure the food here is worth the prices, but the customer service is good. Not a \"bad\" experience, but we will Probably go elsewhere next time honestly."}
{"text":"This visit was on January 21, 2017.  Had the filet and lobster tail with the garlic mashed potatoes.  Excellent!  Done to perfection, juicy and tender.  The margaritas that came in a mason jar were especially good.  The others in our party enjoyed their sirloins and sides. Server was attentive and took time to answer our questions.  I'll definitely be back when I am visiting my friends in Mentor."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday tonight! With call ahead seating we had a table for 10 waiting for us when we arrived on a Sat. Night! Richard was great! The owner/ manager was extremely helpful! What a superb experience!! We will be back for other special occasions....oh and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight at this outback location.  First I got my side salad which I usually enjoy but this salad was not appealing . The lettuce was very brown and black and the croutons were very stale . Everything seem very old even thr bread which was ice cold each time. My meal arrived with many things missing off my baked potatoes. I was looking forward to having a great meal but I didn't get this tonight . And the manager suppose to have came to our table but never came I only gave this visit two stars because the waiter was nice . Don't come to this location of you are hungry and want a good meal"}
{"text":"What can I say. I love their steaks. And their Seared Ahi Tuna. And their grilled asparagus.  And their wedge salad. It can get pricey compared to higher end restaurants, but I always walk away happy.  And stuffed. And with leftovers. And I'm out."}
{"text":"This is our go to when we are craving steak! They have great customer service, fresh bread and quick service! Our steaks are always delicious. We are very satisfied with this steakhouse! It's usually pretty busy during the weekend but the wait is never too long."}
{"text":"I am giving four stars for service!!!! Personally my med rare steak was dry and sad!! But the server made up for it! I wish I could remember his name! He was amazing! Even when my daughter wanted xtra A-1 and he brought her soup bowl! So fitting, she used it all!"}
{"text":"This was better then any I have been to, thanks to our server Jeff! Not only was he helpful, but he was very friendly, attentive , and understood our party's needs. My friend is gluten free and for her specifically he brought her fruit instead of bread. He was easy to talk to and just a great server overall. I do not live in Vegas but whenever I do return , we will come to outback and be requesting Jeff. Thank you for your great service. The hostesses this night were also very friendly and understanding . I thank this outback for their outstanding service !"}
{"text":"Our party of 8 was seated in the \"bar\".  Which was right next to the entrance and not even near the bar.  We were moved because my 10 yr old daughter was with us and thus, could not sit in the bar area.  Fine...whatever.   Not a big deal.  It was done quickly and smoothly.   The server was courteous,  but not really good at his job.  It took a while to take our orders,  and bring drinks.  Maybe the mostly empty bar was slowing down his service.   After finally deciding to take our orders (Yes we had out menus down for quite some time) food arrived.   Not all at once.  Again,  maybe the kitchen's fault.  However we were starving after having been at the races all day.  Many items were forgotten.   The food was really good though. My steak was a perfect medium, others were on the rare/bloody side, which was not how it was ordered.  But we Wolfed it down anyway.  Not great, but we didn't get sick either..."}
{"text":"The service was fine, but the double burger I got was raw in the middle. I went straight back there and they kindly remade the burger but then forgot the onion and dill pickle. I doubt I would go back."}
{"text":"Love the kooka wings! I wish they would bring back the spicy new egland clam chowder! I can just eat appetizers and be happy!. I am a sucker for prime rib, and love getting it blackend! This location is so much better than Rock Hill, it is less busy most of the time"}
{"text":"My husband and I have never been to an Outback Steakhouse so we decided to try it out. The blooming onion was delicious. I've often gotten raw deep-fried onion products from other restaurants but this was cooked perfectly. The food great and the service was just as good. The only issue we encountered was the wait between when we ordered and when the food arrived. They were pretty busy so I'll assume it was due to a busy kitchen."}
{"text":"The bread was cold and tasteless. The butter was cold and hard. Both of these things were supposed to be warm and soft.  The steak was pretty ok, but way too much garlic in the sauce.   The servers were quick about getting refills, but not so much on taking the glasses, which meant we had way too many glasses on the table.  Our server was very friendly and pleasant.  Overall, pretty ok. Nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Ordered two Steak Quesadillas to go while passing through town, IT WAS DISGUSTING!!! Numerous hard and fatty pieces of meat that looked like other customers table scraps, and extremely greasy! Both orders went right in the garbage in our hotel room.  Be aware!!! Took advantage of the take out customers! Worst Outback I'v ever eaten in!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this is more of a 1.5 star review BUT I'm rounding down because my service was THE WORST service I have ever experienced in my entire life, and I am a former server so I am understanding but there was no excuse for how bad Tony (and he never introduced himself I got his name off of our receipt), our server, was on Friday 1/23/15 (and yes I used the date hoping management will see this) in the area around the bar. If I were rating solely on food alone, I'd be giving Outback a 3. I don't typically like chain restaurants but, honestly, both my dining companion and I enjoyed our meals. However, as I stated already, service was atrocious and that left me with enough of an impression that I will never, ever return to this location.  We were seated around 7:50pm at our table. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait but it was actually only 20 which was nice. We began to peruse the menu and I noticed a female server that was servicing the table caddy-corner to ours. I expected she was our server but after she walked by our table multiple times in the first 10 minutes we were there, I went out on a limb and guessed she was not to be our server. I also noticed a male that was servicing the table behind us. He was making small talk with them after bringing out their entrees. He then left their table and again, I went out on a limb and guessed he was not our server either. We easily had been sitting there for 20 minutes with open menus when finally, after making additional small talk with the table behind us, guess who comes over?? Tony-who obviously knew we were there and failed to even greet us within 20 minutes. His greeting, when he made his way over, wasn't even \"Hi, my name is ______, sorry about the wait.\" It was \"What do you want to drink? Are you ready to order?\" We ordered 2 beers and we did put in an appetizer at the time, but I was still debating what I wanted so he said he'd be \"right back\" with our drinks. ANOTHER 15 minutes passed (after more additional small talk with the table behind us) before he came back with our beers, bread, and our appetizer. No apology this time either. Our appetizer was firecracker grilled shrimp served with crostini, tomatoes, and a spinach dip sauce. It was actually very tasty. By the time he delivered the appetizer, we were ready to order. I ordered the firecracker salmon with mixed veggies and my companion ordered the prime rib. Our entrees came out rather quickly, but we had empty drinks for quite some time and never saw Tony until he brought out our meals. To continue the atrocious service, he was trying to push us out of there when we weren't even halfway done with our entrees! He came back when we were about halfway through and said, verbatim (and not even asking us how everything was), \"You guys don't want anything crazy like dessert do you?\" Before either of us could get \"no\" out, he was dropping our check and walked away. We never saw him again and just paid cash and left it on the table. I realize that one goes to a restaurant for the food, however, although the food we had was acceptable, the manner in which we were treated was horrendously rude, unacceptable, and, frankly, the manager at this location should be embarrassed that such atrocious service was given to a paying guest. It is because of this terrible service that, although the food was decent, I will never allow myself or anyone I am with to spend money in this particular Outback ever again."}
{"text":"06/07/18 Update. Things have changed for the better. Great waiter, excellent soup and salad, very good steak. Mine was very good but just a little over done. My wife was very happy with hers. It won't take another year+ to return, perhaps within the month."}
{"text":"Came here last night to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  It's been awhile since have been here and we were very disappointed.  We used to say they had better seafood than Red Lobster and Joe's Crab Shack.  I had two lobster tails and they were very fishy smelling and tasting.  The potato soup doesn't seem the same either.  The blooming onion was either soggy or under cooked...we did get some coconut shrimp, they were awesome...too bad it was an add on.  It will be a while before we attempt this location again, if ever...disappointed"}
{"text":"Cameron K was great! He knew all of the specials and was quick! Everything was good, loved the food! We had a great time and will be back!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst experience we've had at a restaurant in a long, long time.   It started off pretty well. We had just finished up picking pumpkins and were pretty hungry for an early dinner and decided on Outback because we know they're a family friendly place. As soon as we sat down, Husband ordered our son a cheeseburger and explained we'd like that FIRST THING to cut down on fussy baby times. And you know we had to have that onion blossom and some beers. We were in a good mood.  A little bit later and we've decided what we'd like to eat, but our server disappeared. When he came back, he had our onion blossom (extra crispy, as requested!) and said he'd be back with some bread and butter. Excuse me, where's the cheeseburger? And could we get some silverware and napkins? Oh yes, I'll be right back. Time passes and we were all lucky that the kiddo was entertaining himself by flinging around the kid's menu. When his burger comes out, we were relieved. And by the time we realized we still haven't ordered our OWN meals yet, the server was gone again. Finally, we were able to grab him and insist that we'd like to order. This was the moment that we probably should have just been happy that the baby was eating, asked for our bill, paid, and left.   Instead, I ordered a bowl of tortilla soup and he ordered a chicken sandwich. And then we waited. And waited. Our beers were empty. The baby was done sitting. WE were done sitting. Our good mood had dissipated.   The boys went out front to get out some energy. I asked about our food, which our sever apologized for the wait and said would be right out. But it wasn't. A runner finally brought out the chicken sandwich to me. Did you also have a soup?, I asked. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh, maybe? I told him to box up the chicken sandwich when he ran away to check on the soup, as we could no longer eat there. He came back with soup and apologized. The bowl of clam chowder had a gross skin across the top that broke when I dipped my spoon in. Annoyed, but hungry, I took a bite. Why did I even order this? And then it dawned on me. I didn't. I ordered the tortilla soup. So I asked for the manager.   Guess what I did? Waited some more. The server even came by to apologize about how long the manager was taking to come by. My table neighbors even noticed the whole thing and took pity on me and told me how wrong the ordeal has been. When the manager finally swooped in, she introduced herself by saying to my empty beer bottle, \"Well, first I need to change that to a bottle and not a draft. What do you need.\" No smile. No solemnity. No understanding or care. She looked exasperated. Taken aback, I tried to explain my meal. She said she'd see what she could do and disappeared. When she came back, my tortilla soup was in a to go container and half of the meal was comped. Table neighbors shook their heads.   Way to ruin a fun day, Outback."}
{"text":"This was our first time here the staff was exceptional they were all friendly. The service was awesome and very prompt on refills for soda the food came out quick. The meal itself so delicious and my steak was seasoned and cooked perfect!!!! I will be back here me and my family. Thank you"}
{"text":"depends which location you go to but usually the steaks & lobster are great! the service is good and the place is always packed with a short wait.  however last time we went the wait was nearly an hour the food took forever coming out & we ordered medium rare steak & fried shrimp. after 40 minutes waiting for the food it was compltely raw & the shrimp was way overcooked. we simply told the manager & left. we did not pay & will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Awesome sirloin, beautiful restaurant!! Ate at the bar and both bartenders were friendly and attentive. I wish I could remember their names as they were very personable and told us their names and wrote it on a card in front of us . Anyway had a great meal with great service last night!!"}
{"text":"OMG we had the server from Chotchkie's. He called Rachel 'mylady' and faked an awful, horrible, epic fail Australian accent. Everything else was about as expected. Blah blah blah ... minor problems ... blah blah blah ... they fixed it. I think the one in Westlake is better."}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends there today and 4 of us had 1/2 ribeye sandwich melt with French onion soup for $8.99 and one of us had the outback burger for $8.99. The soup was great. Burg and 1/2 sandwich were tasty but minuscule, you are better off going to In and Out if you want a small tasty burger for less money. We have been going to Outback for 10 years +  and decided the bean counter/ portion control people have overdone it now, lots of other places to go, guess we will go elsewhere now. Service fine, restroom clean, etc. portions just tiny."}
{"text":"Wait time on a Friday was really good.  Unfortunately that's about all that's been good.   Family of 6, my wife being a vegetarian, we're used to being a complex order.   20 minutes after our reservation time we were seated by pleasant staff and our waitress got our drinks promptly.   Waited over 10 minutes for refills and no bread came out.  When it did, it was 1 small loaf for 6 people.   Then another 8+ for refills and 2nd bread.    Hopefully the food is worth it.  45 minutes later....  Shrimp was room temperature, all steaks were rare, ordered medium rare.  They tried to reheat the steak, which if you cut it open, loses a lot.  Jamie, the manager on duty had them cook new ones which came out perfect.   Aioli for each was 'broken' before it got to the table.   Vegetarian taco was woefully light on toppings.  The Pico di Gallo was weak.  They did include avocado, but that's ALL she could taste.   My fish taco had very good flavor, but the slaw was tasteless and the same issue with my Pico di Gallo.   Found hair in a shrimp skewer... They replaced it of course.   They did get the girls cheesecake as an apology.  That's appreciated.  My son opted for the chocolate milk shake which he found to be the best he's had (it's the only kind he gets)  Rough day for Outback, clearly.  Management is the only thing that will bring us back.  Update: Jamie did right by us.  She resolved our very poor experience to my satisfaction."}
{"text":"I need to update my review. Today I decided to speak with a manager and let them know about out experience. Billy invited us back this evening for a meal on him. I couldn't be more grateful. It was a much better experience than the night before and it was nice to know that the Outback cares enough to make it right. We have been going to this establishment for a while and we will keep going. Thanks Bully and the entire team who helped make our night enjoyable."}
{"text":"The one thing I truly love about Outback is the Curbside Takeaway. The app is super easy to order from and if you join their club, every fourth visit will be 50% off. Aside from that, the steaks are always good, as is most of the food they serve, but my dislike is that I usually end up missing something that I have specifically asked for, and asked again for at pickup. It gets annoying after it keeps happening. So they don't get nearly as much of my business as they used to."}
{"text":"Javon was an awesome server. Hella funny, super attentive, and did our special request without any hesitation. He made our dinner that much better. Thanks again! Everything was super good. My first time at outback was great. Give him the props and recognition he deserves."}
{"text":"Tried out the new LOADED Blooming onion last night . Wow really good. Had some wings and Mac and Cheese as well . All were real good and our Waiter was Great!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at this location. The first time they got my order wrong but quickly corrected it. Last night the service and food were great! They were slammed! They had a server bringing out samples of the onion petals and chicken fingers to all of us who were waiting. I thought that was a nice gesture! Luckily we didn't wait long since we did the call ahead seating. Nice location."}
{"text":"There are casino's in LV area with good steak houses with better deals $$ & better decore.  However, it's pretty good here"}
{"text":"Our waiter tried, although he seemed totally fake. That was the highlight. Oh and our water glasses were filled frequently.  If you're looking for any sense of refinement, it's missing here. Leftover food on the table from whomever sat there last. Dishes were greasy, not the food. The actual plates. They don't want to take your dirty silverware for the next course.  Food is mediocre at best. The were constantly sweeping the floor by our table the whole meal, I hope no dirt or dust flew up. Just gross.  It's been 8-10 years since I've been to an Outback. I hope never to return."}
{"text":"Our server was great. This has no reflection on him. I forget his name but he had long hair in a pony tail & was awesome.  The food: my caesar salad had little to NO dressing & my steak wasn't seared on the outside - it was BURNT. The blooming onion was burnt as well & the \"volcano shrimp\" we're meh.  My advice: Fire or reprimand the cook. He clearly doesn't care about the food he serves & the poor servers .."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and have never been let down. The wait can be long for dinner especially on the weekends, so don't come ravenous or you will be tempted to run to the drive thru nearby. The service we've had was always friendly and followed with a manager's check in. I usually shkoff down the filet with lobster and I must say for a local's spot, their filet is pretty good and the lobster is not an oversized shrimp but a decent sized lobster tail that rivals any nice steakhouse in my opinion. For under $30, I sometimes wonder why we bother going to the strip for steak a la cart when you get all the fixings here at Outback with your meal. Plus you don't have to dress to impress here, atmosphere is casual and you come to eat."}
{"text":"We were traveling and chose what we thought was a good staple for quality food near our hotel.  Terrible mistake!  This location is incredibly poorly managed.  That explains why other restaurants were packed and they were less than half full.  The hostess was awkward, loud, and intrusive to our meal, disorganized and frazzled at her job.  We asked for a booth, she said there were none and we counted 9 empty.  We were finally seated in the bar.  She stopped by our table numerous times and asked us personal questions trying to make small talk.  At first, fine- by stop 3, annoying. Our food was cold and appetizers arrived 2 min before our meal (yes, literally).  The staff sat huddled around the bar & the servers disappeared outside - ours was gone over 15 min, not once, but twice.  We got refills at the bar ourselves.  The manager was present but did nothing. I would love to give them a great review, but here's an honest one.  I would definitely recommend skipping this location - simply not worth it."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain restaurant and no need for a review, however this location there is one to give . First off friendly warm welcome, fast service, and our server was phenomenal. She went above and beyond my expectations. Daniella I believe, anyway food was great, service top notch. Thank you for that outback!"}
{"text":"Wow! Today is one of my highlights of BAD SERVICE.  Arrives at about 7:55  Get our table within 5 min - great.  We wait about 10 min ( restaurant is 1/3 empty) We place our orders right away  12 min later - .......nothing....nada..... I asks another server to call the manager Someone show up - says he's the owner I told him: we are waiting over 20 min to get water..... He offer to change our server - and we say \"sure\" It's never happen - we still have the same one  At about 8:30 I asks for silvers and napkins.... Good arrives at about 8:45 ( the food is always good here - when they follow the requests as how to make your steak) As I order fish - and it's all you can eat, I ordered my refill right away.  It's 9:01 - I'm still waiting for my refills.... Fish arrive - no French fries tho....\"it will be here soon\".....  Enough is enough We ask the check -  The manager respect his promise and took care of the bill.  We come here to eat, to have good time and ready to pay.  This visit is a big disappointment for us"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We were seated within about 2 min,  but then took forever after that. We waited 20 min just for our server to come over and get our drinks order. I was trying to order our food while he was taking our drinks order and he put up his finger to stop me and told me he would be back. It took him 15 min to come get our food order, and then 50 min to get our food. The food was really good and he brought our to go boxes and check when we were finished with our food. He took the check but never returned with the change. We paid in cash and waited about 10 min for him to come back and he was no where to be found. We packed up my 2 year old and new born and were walking out the door and I saw our waiter at the bar eating.   This was our first time going to an outback and will definitely go back for the food but to a different location."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was definitely better than expected. The steak was cooked to the perfect temperature and the salad was good."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife tonight the service was great the food was awesome the server Justin was great on time with drinks and or food looking forward to our next trip"}
{"text":"We ate at this location the other night and it was great. The restaurant was clean and the staff was organized and friendly. Our waitress was awesome! If you go to this location you have to sit at one of Linda's tables. She is the best waitress I've had in a very long time.  The food was delicious.  Arrived at the table in a timely manner as we were on a time limit.  Show tickets after dinner.  It was a really nice dinner out and I appreciate the excellent service!"}
{"text":"UPDATE  My sister and I went back for dinner last night and it was a much better experience. Our server greeted us immediately and service was good throughout. Owner came and greeted us at the end of the meal and was asking about our previous experience. While the service was much better this time I honestly cant update to a 5 star review but I appreciate the service we recieved this time and it did help    Very disappointed. My sister and I were going to catch a 2pm movie and stopped here for lunch. We were seated right away and the dining room was not busy. There was one large table that was already well into their meal as well as about 3 tables of 2 including us. We were sat and given menus and then we waited. And waited. And waited for 20 min. Nobody ever stopped at our table or even acknowledged our presence. My sister even pushed the call server button on the kiosk which sat there and blinked for about 10 min with still no sign of a server or anything. Finally after sitting for 20 min with nothing someone finally stopped at the table and took a drink order and said that \"Dana\" would soon be by to take our order. Sorry Dana but 20 min on a minimally busy Sunday afternoon is a little unacceptable. We thanked the man that finally talked to us and informed him we would be going elsewhere. That was really a let down."}
{"text":"The server was very nice but it ends there. The food was terrible. The foods were dripping with grease, the prime rib was more fat than meat and the sweets were sickeningly sweet. Cannot recommend. They refunded part of our meal, to their credit. Great service; terrible food."}
{"text":"All around bad experience. Arrived a few minutes after 5pm today-told the wait was around a half hour, we waited over an hour. We were sat in outside corner of restaurant, our booth was freezing even the actual seat was cold. I am usually on the warm side but, had to keep my large down jacket the whole time. Took forever to place order, got the complimentary pumpernickel bread-I was starving and still could not eat more than one piece, as it was lousy. Got our salad but, we had to just stare at them for about 10 minutes waiting for silverware. Drinks not refilled no one who worked there seemed to care about most customers wearing coats during their meal. Asked for Manager-Rich, said he would check on heat and take 20 whole % off our bill. No dishes ever cleared, waiter finally brings check and - of coarse no $ taken off. Had to wait again for this to be addressed . Spent 2 and a 1/2 hours (freezing) with no apps or dessert."}
{"text":"Good Steak. Makes the vegans mad. Jokes aside though, it usually has pretty decent service and decent steak. It's different each time, but overall it's good stuff. Service is alright, not the best, but I can deal with that. Very clean and tidy, so I'll be back in the future for sure."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good (as it usually is at Outback) but the service was okay. I got take out from here for lunch one afternoon cause it was conveniently located by my hotel and I know they have curbside pickup. I placed an order over the phone and the girl I spoke to put me on hold and then the call hung up, so I had to call and reorder which wasn't a big deal, but she wasn't able to tell me what the total price would be for some reason. She also wasn't able to answer several questions I had (what kind of salad option do I have, what dressings, etc.). I got to the curbside pickup and no one came out to bring my food but I wasn't sure if that's normally how it works (I have only done this one other time at a different location and they immediately came outside). I waited like 4-5 minutes because once again, I wasn't sure. I walked into the side entrance where the \"take out door\" was and no one was even inside this little room for take out orders. I ended up walking into the restaurant from the back and up to the front where I had to ask for my order. I was told they'd bring it out even though no one was around the curbside take out. I ended up waiting in their take out order room and eventually got my to go order but the overall process was just very confusing and unorganized and the staff wasn't very helpful."}
{"text":"Can someone hook me up with a time machine so I can travel back to 1997 when Outback was good!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, the service was a bit slow and had to keep asking for the beverages to be filled. The staff was very friendly, outgoing, and happy. Would have given more stars if the service was up to par like the food."}
{"text":"Manager needs a personality, otherwise food is overpriced crap. This place was good once, not so much anymore. I wish these chains would get it together and stop wondering why business is so slow."}
{"text":"When we arrived the hostess prompted us to sit at the first table in the bar area (near the front door/ host podium) As its 40 degrees outside tonight I was a little annoyed that the two hostesses working propped the front doors open to bring in all of the outside cushions from the chairs and let the guests inside or near the door freeze. This was not pressing enough to get done at 8:30pm when the restaurant doesn't close until 10pm."}
{"text":"We are frequent patrons of this restaurant. The food is always excellent. Cameron K, our waiter, was awesome and made sure we got our best discounts. He is the most pleasant waiter we have ever had at this restaurant. Highly recommend this Outback."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here.  I stopped in the Saturday before Christmas to buy a gift card to be sent out of state.  This was a flawless process and the staff was more than helpful.  The gift card was mailed  and the packaging was tampered with in transit and the gift card never arrived at its destination.  So I took the receipt back to this location and explained the situation.  They said they could look it up and cancel the gift card.    I sat down at the bar ordered a beer in the process.  About 10 minutes later, the staff member came out and said it was all taken care of.  They cancelled the gift card and used the money to put it on another one.    It wasn't a hassle like I thought it would be but I still enjoyed the beer and the friendly staff.   Thanks Outback!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here countless of times already. The most recent one was when I celebrated my birthday. I ordered the New York steak. It was good. However, my son's plate was little. He ordered strips and the serving was little. We felt that we got robbed for what he got. The waiter was nice enough to give me a free ice cream with candle on my birthday. I hope they would improve the quality of their service and food. Last year was better."}
{"text":"My husband, baby and I went to dinner tonight. We don't eat out much these days since I can't have dairy, baby has an intolerance to it. I'm very shy and hate to be a bother. Our waitress was so warm and welcoming! I told her of my allergens and she spoke to the kitchen staff to figure out what I could safely eat!! Both our dinners were delicious! I didn't feel like I was missing out for once! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"What a great time! Our server Danielle was awesome and the food was amazing.... will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"Sheryl was hands down, without a doubt the greatest! The best and most personable wait staff I've ever experienced! Will recommend Outback and that incredible, kind and attentive Sheryl to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to outback, I expect the same thing and get the same thing, which is what I want. This time, I finally got to a newly opened outback and Marcus was my server. He was awesome. He anticipated our needs, was warm and welcoming and was ready when we were. Very personable and competent.  He added to the great food and gave great service. Awwsome work Marcus, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi was delicious! Served with lemon sauce, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, grilled asparagus on the side. A nice meal. Bread was fresh and good. Blooming onion was tasty but way too greasy resulted in upset stomache."}
{"text":"For a chain, this is an AMAZING place to eat. I was shocked at the great prices. I really enjoyed my time here. Not the best salad but for typical American Cuisine this is pretty good. Enjoyed my sirloin, had a much better taste than anticipated. Had it with the portobello mushrooms and garlic. Amazing french onion soup!"}
{"text":"Had one of there famous onions I haven't had in nearly 16 years. Started to eat it, it didn't look that tasty, and of course it was horrible. It totally destroyed my appetite. Yukk! Thanks for destroying that old childhood memory. I did get a refund."}
{"text":"Don't mean to sound like a total fatty BUT I've had a few things off their menu lol I have tried they're delicious mashed potatoes and they we delicious. The chicken strips and chicken salads are the best along with their pulled pork. The burgers are also great with a thick and juicy patty. The steak they serve could use some help but everything else is great even the chardonnay. Ooooh Oooh how can I forget about their desserts the cheesecake and brownies are delish!"}
{"text":"Can this \"steakhouse\" ever cook a steak as it was ordered? I'm not sure I've ever gotten a steak from this restaurant that was cooked correctly the first time. Also, I know for a fact that I'm not the only person with this issue. My dad and uncle both ordered their steaks medium well and they came out medium rare. I ordered medium and mine was welllllllll done, and it was so small and flat it looked like a hamburger paddy from Wendy's! This same visit 3 out of 4 of the tables around ours sent their steaks back for not being cooked as ordered. I keep trying to give this place a shot, but it seems to keep disappointing."}
{"text":"I have never really thought of going to lunch at Outback before, but I was close by and thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I did. The food was delicious and reasonable priced. Fred was my server, he could not have nicer, and more professional. All in all a very pleasant experience. Thank you Fred!!!"}
{"text":"I love Outback!! It's a little pricier for casual dining but totally worth it because my steak always comes with 2 sides. My favorite is the Victoria Cut or Prime Rib (Outback style). I never leave Outback hungry and always have leftovers for my dogs when I get home (they love that too). Their food servers are always friendly and always come back to ask if we need anything. Hosts are always friendly too; they always open the door for us."}
{"text":"While it's the same experience at any Outback you go to across the country, the Gastonia location is always packed out. It's not located in the most popular area of town (past the mall), but it still manages to get oodles & oodles of people every night.  Gastonia is a franchise lovin' city, so you would expect this place to be busy, but not like it always is. The parking lot is always packed so you need to get here out of a peak hour time to grab a seat pretty quickly. If you do this, then you can get seated for a great meal without having to wait too long.  The food here is pretty good & you'll pay a hefty price for everything. I like the salmon, but everything I've had here has been good. They also have a take out service so you can eat some Outback in the comfort of your own home.  Outback is really a good place to eat if you're looking for a hearty meal full of meat, especially red meat. It is pricey though so I wouldn't suggest going here too often. But remember that this location is always packed, so try & miss the peak dinner hour when you visit."}
{"text":"It depends...  If its busy, you are going to wait a looong time, and your steak will be cooked wrong:  Rare =  The Prom Scene from \"Carrie\" Medium Rare =  Still mooing Medium = Shoe leather Medium Well = Beef Jerky Well = I've never ordered well done, but I just assume they literally bring you a charcoal briquette on a plate.   If they're not busy, they do pretty good, and you can actually get a decent medium rare cook on your steak. They tend to cook on the well side, but that is the rule I think for all Outbacks.   Do's and Dont's:  *Don't get cheese on your veggies. It's disgusting. *Don't get \"Bloom Petals.\" This is just the stuff that falls off the other Bloomin' Onions that other people ordered. Just get the full Bloom, ya cheapskate!  *DO try the \"Steakhouse Philly.\" They use shredded rib-eye, and no sh*t, it is one of the best Philly's you will get outside of Philly. The secret is they top it off with the Mac n' Cheese rue.  *DO get one of the better cuts, like the NY Strip or Rib Eye. They will cook it better. *DO sit at the bar if there is space available. There's usually a game on the TV, the bartenders are attentive, and it's a nicer atmosphere than the regular dining area."}
{"text":"Went to Outback this afternoon with my mother. It was 3pm, the restaurant was slow so I thought we'd be in and out. Was greeted by the hostess but we sat at the bar. We sit at the bar, waiting at least 5-10 minutes, wasn't served or even approached! Multiple waiters walking around and I assume a manager because she sat at a small booth with a computer nothing being said. We stood up to walk out and the bartender said, \"Hello.\" We kindly said hi and started to approach the door. She said I'm sorry I was getting food. I've worked in the restaurant industry and if my bartender wasn't there, a server or manager would have approached the guests and got them at least water! But no, nothing said or even greeted. I'm sorry to the bartender that lost out on a good tip."}
{"text":"I have to say I have not eaten at an outback for a longtime, and I was impressed with our server Javon. He did was a model sever and was there before we could ask for anything! He advised of of all our choices and made some great recommendations for a large group.  We started with the cheese fries and I give them five stars.  They were hot and very tasty.  Everyone ordered steaks (Ribeye medium, Filet medium, and a Porterhouse medium), I loved my Ribeye and everyone else at the table were very happy with their steaks and the taste.  The seasoning was right on the mark and added just the right flavor for a nice hot steak.  This is my second night in Vegas for a conference, and I have to say, so far I have had nothing but amazing experiences during my travel.  if come to this OutBack, ask to be seated in Javon section, and I hope you have a great experience like we did."}
{"text":"2 stars out of 5 - not more.  Outback is usually the money worth you spend. It's a budget steakhouse with a limited variety of steaks - and it's not surprising. This outback seems to be the same - or not?  My Ribeye was good but not extraordinary. The aussie fries had too much salt and the A1 steak sauce couldn't make it better.  A table for four is too small and toiletts need service.  Fast service, fast steaks and fast leaving."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak and mashed potatoes everything was on point!! My wife loved her bbq chicken on the Barbie with a loaded baked potato which she loved & took our daughter with us this time to Vegas and she order the Joey steak off the kids menu which is about a 5 ounce steak with fries and they cooked her steak perfect she said and she ate it all.   Our server & service was awesome! For appetizer we had the mac & cheese bite...omg if you like cheese....these are amazing!!!!   One more great thing to add, they keep it very cool in here which is a great break from the heat for me.  May want to keep this in mind if you get cold easy sitting down for dinner, my wife was happy she had a small light jacket around her waist to throw on, but again she gets cold easy."}
{"text":"Normally i am not a fan of the outback steakhouse. I would rather just grill my own but me and the wife had a gift card to use. Now I have to be honest we used it for the lunch menu and it was surprisingly good EXCEPT that we did carry out and when i called they said 20 min. I got there to wait an additional 45. Reminded me again that service is a huge part of this industry and if you waste a customers time they will not return!"}
{"text":"A very good experience eating at this Outback! They give you fresh bread no charge (like they all do) but they don't charge you to get more. The food came out super fast at times and was on point. The customer service is good nothing crazy!  Be careful not to come at prime hours! This place can get packed very quick. They have a terrible set-up in the front where everybody is standing up by the doors, blocking the exits if there is no seating available to wait.   They have seats outside to wait, but during winter this wasn't a option way too cold. Overall good place to eat dinner and relax with some friends!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Great service, great spot & great food. Had the grilled chicken w swiss n bacon. Omg delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Often have run out of the cut of steak I order.  Roadside service is a huge joke.  It would get much more business from me otherwise."}
{"text":"Placed an online order for curbside takeout tonight.  The time to pick it up said 7:27. The food finally got to my car at 8:15.  On  top of having to wait so long,  when I got home,  the food was cold and looked like it had been sitting for a while.  Normally I'm not one to complain,  but when you spend good money on your dinner,  you expect it to be good."}
{"text":"Wowww Awesome experience....all started with spectacular server (prompt & friendly) Cali. Also Matt was super cool and helpful. The bartender Chris was a consummate pro. I looked for Kim \"Hollywood\" to let the top dog know their entire staff was Great ! I had the surf and turf and both were cooked to perfection & I'm a fussy Manhattanite and Cape Codder so, I know my steaks and Lobster !  Thanks so much for my experience. Great Food / Great Value. I will send friends, relatives and I'll be back soon myself. Highly recommend this Outback near Gilbert Rd. & wish 6 stars were available - they earned it :-)"}
{"text":"Went to Outback on Black Friday, not the best of ideas in the first place. Sat at the bar with a very nice bartender. She was attentive, but that was the only good thing. The steak was way over done and over salted, the soup was over salted as well. The overall experience was not good and I will not be coming back to this Outback."}
{"text":"The new location looks nice. I went with my wife on a Wednesday night, it was busy, not packed, but busy. The waitress who we had was sub-par.   We wife went to the bathroom...I perused the menu...my wife returned and I went to the bathroom, about 7-8 minutes passed before we were even greeted with a \"I'm your waitress I'll be right with you.\" We subsequently ordered drinks and an appetizer. The appetizer came out first. Before the drinks, before the bread...  The food was fine. I mean its a chain steakhouse. I got exactly what I expected I would get. I'm not going to complain about quality here, food was par for the course.  My drinks (a water and a soft drink) each remained empty for about 75% of my visit. I got one offer for a refill.    Then we got the bill. I'm not sure when the soft drinks jumped up to $3.50 a piece, but that was a little absurd.   My wife and I used to eat about once a month at Texas Roadhouse, which was located in the same shopping center as this Outback before it shut down after a slip and fall lawsuit. Our order is always the same, the house special, a six ounce steak with two sides. My wife gets one, I get one. We pay about $25 at Texas Roadhouse. Our bill here for the same two specials was $39. Between the increased drink prices and the higher steak prices...I miss Texas Roadhouse. They are miles above this place in both value and service."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you are in a large group. You have been warned! I came here on 3/11 with a group of 8 to celebrate a friends birthday. We all ordered basic steak dishes with no special instructions other than how we wanted it cooked. Our order was placed at 6:30 and we had to ask for the bread because by this point, it hadn't been offered to us yet. Our salads finally arrived a half hour later and they weren't even brought out by our waitress.... by this point we were all starving! At 7:15, half of our table was served their food, the rest of us were told our food \"was on it's way\". The rest of us didn't receive our meals until 7:30, a WHOLE hour after we originally ordered and the other half of our table was finished eating by this point. We asked the waitress if it's common for orders to take an hour and her lame excuse was \" We have to split the orders in half for large tables, otherwise it confuses our cooks\". We spoke to the night manager that was walking around and expressed our dissatisfaction and all she could say was \"I'm really sorry about that, how about 2 desserts for your table to share\". 2 desserts for 8 people????!!!! So we ended up getting a couple ice cream sundaes for the kids to share. I'm a germaphobe and was not impressed by this unhygienic offer, but whatever.  Just for the record, my husband and I came here for lunch on Valentines day and didn't experience any problems during that visit."}
{"text":"Went out with a few friends on Friday night ordered the claim chowder soup  it taste like it was sitting in the soup warmer all night . Not fresh at all my friend ordered the salmon medium and it came out well done. I will not be returning to this location new to hire better cooks and servers."}
{"text":"In a town where it seems you need to take out a mortgage to get a good meal, this restaurant is a breath of fresh air.  The atmosphere is typical of almost every Outback restaurant, but  the food (steak) is above average for this chain and the service is prompt and attentive. Want a good steak, don't spend a lot - come hear and you will enjoy your visit and have money to go back home with.  Also, very convenient to the rental car center (and outlet stores)"}
{"text":"Want a great steak for a very reasonable price?  Outback is the place!  We dine at an Outback on the average of once a month or so and have never failed yet to receive a great dinner, served in a most reasonable amount of time, at a clean well decorated facility all at a great price. Outback even offers an AARP discount making their already low fares even better. I would not hesitate to recommend Outback Steakhouse to all my friends"}
{"text":"Streaks are delicious, Salads are superb, Great Service. My favorite steak house in and around the valley of the sun. Watch out cause they open at 4 so dont come for an early lunch. Highly recomend the Crab and streak combinations. Also the Grilled Prime rib is great. Fun festive and much more affordable than out back used to be back in the 90s."}
{"text":"I use the take away service at this Outback and I live closer to a different Outback. (See my bad review of that place!) THIS Outback does it right! Salmon was cooked to perfection! The Chopped Blue Cheese Salad was fresh as well as my veggies! Service was quick and the girl super friendly! I will continue to drive out of my way for better food and service! Kudos THIS Outback!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I use this Outback due to it's proximity to my home for curbside take away. Probably not any longer. Tonight I ordered Salmon, veggies and blue cheese chopped salad. The fish was dry and over cooked, the veggies were undercooked, the lettuce was 20% brown, the dressing was as thick as jello and there wasn't one slice of Lemon to be found. Boo this place! The one on 54th street is so much better!"}
{"text":"Wow I haven't been to Outback for many years!  Like 8-10 years!! Don't know why not, maybe because I do not usually eat at full chain restaurants and trying to eat at more locally owned restaurants or trying different foods?? Well all I can say is I kick my self for driving by Outback for this many years. For Christmas I received a gift card so now I had no reason not to go.   We were promptly seated and had a very nice server. We skipped any appetizers and went into  the open flamed seared sirloin with the shrimp on the barbie.  (our new years resolution was to share more at certain places, to cut calories and save money since we are always TOO full to finish, and doggie bags suck)  We added some coconut shrimp too. We started our dinner off with a split Caesar salad.   The salad was very good. Surprised me coming from a chain. lol.  Had a lot of flavor. By the time dinner came I was really looking forward to it. We had cut the steak in half (it was 11oz and my wife can only do 3-4oz so it was perfect split)  and shared the shrimp and had our 2 sides of garlic mash potatoes  and French fries (my idea) and had ourselves a meal!  The meal was very good! Steak was asked for medium, and was perfect. Shrimp was great, not my favorite was the coconut shrimp. The sides were great. Even just sharing I was too full to even LOOK, at a desert menu.    Also we added our meal with sharing the margarita trio. 3 samples margarita which were really good. I liked the mango one the best.   Overall we had a wonderful dinner here at outback. Price wasn't  to bad either for steak. With or without the gift cards ill be back!"}
{"text":"Is it really necessary to review a chain restaurant, aren't they all the same?  They should be, they should all be like this Outback on the South Strip.  The menu is familiar, the prices standard, the difference is in the level of service.  Conveniently located for both tourists and locals, this familar steak house has something for everyone.  I found my favorite steak, perfectly cooked, and that tasty ranch dressing the is better at Outback than anywhere else.  More importantly, the staff was very friendly and efficient.  The manager/owner came by our table at least once just to see if everything was perfect.  Despite the busy crowd, we felt the service, food, and atmosphere were top notch."}
{"text":"Steak was dry, plate was Un appetizing.  Sizes were very small.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My Wife and I had a wonderful experience at this location. I ordered the 22 oz bone in Ribeye with Caesar salad and fries. The ribeye was perfectly marbled for a ribeye, not too much fat and cooked to medium. For a $25 steak I could not have been happier.    Our Server was attentive, prompt and very professional.   My wife had the French dip steak sandwich which was cooked perfectly.   After bad experiences at other locations we will drive the extra 15-20 minutes to come back and visit this one for sure."}
{"text":"The food and service has always been good here, i live close to this location so it is my go to spot for short notice dinners. I have nothing negative to say about this place."}
{"text":"We came with a very large group of people and the service was excellent. There was about 30 people all together and that is challenging for any restaurant, especially at 1:00PM on Sunday afternoon, over Labor Day Weekend. They handled it impeccably! The food was okay. I was actually quite impressed with the Ahi Tuna appetizer. The tuna tasted good, seared perfectly and the cabbage salad it was served with was delicious. It had a nice spicy dressing that paired perfectly with the tuna. If you find yourself at Outback,  I highly recommend the Ahi Tuna appetizer. My husband had the Salmon, he had the lunch portion and loaded mashed potatoes. He said the salmon was okay. It looked a little dry, but I didn't taste it. The mashed potatoes and the 'loaded\" part are separate. They bring you a little cup of toppings, sour cream, shredded cheese and not sure what else, and then you add them to the potatoes yourself. This seemed a bit strange to me, but oh well....... I had the Large Cobb Salad. It was okay, nothing spectacular, but not bad. Everything was fresh and crispy just like a salad should be. Ranch dressing wasn't very good, I would suggest trying a different salad dressing.  The service was so impressive though, that I would highly recommend them if you have a large party or group. Prices are very reasonable and they can keep up with the demand."}
{"text":"This location is open for lunch and what great specials they have.  I love their ranch salad so i get the half prime rib dip sandwich and salad for $10.  The bread is always hot and fresh while you wait for your meal.  I used to go to outback all the time for dinner since their steaks are a pretty good value and always consistent.  The atmosphere is always nice and service is always good."}
{"text":"I come to this Outback once a week and they always have great service. I ask for Adam the bartender every time. He's literally one of the best servers I've ever had. He's super quick, friendly and always accurate. The moment we walk into the restaurant he's already putting our regular order in and by the time we get to our table he's got our drinks. Makes all the difference. Very talented bartender and the best at his job. And even if I might be in the mood for something else I will still always say Outback because I know what great service Adam is going to provide."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I always get the filet which was amazing. I should have gotten what I'm used to. I wanted to try something different and got the 20oz porterhouse medium rare. My meat came out a bit too cooked and extremely chewy. Server offered to remake mine but I declined since I waited a long time for service and I was starving. Host sat me down and no service for 10 mins. Table next to us came 8 mins after us got serviced first. Drink took a long time to get to our table as well. It's as if we were forgotten. The only moment when I got someone to check on us is when I popped my phone out and went on yelp."}
{"text":"What happened to this Outback Steakhouse restaurant? I really liked eating at Outback, but this particular restaurant the rib eye that I ordered was too salty and I askeed for medium rare and I got medium instead! The salad was not very fresh, had a lot of brown lettuce in it. As for the bread (which is one of my favorite) lacked taste even with the butter! Service was so so, our waiter was certainly not very attentive. I hope it just was a bad moment for dinner there! And one last thing, bathroom was filthy and needed attention! This place needs better management!!"}
{"text":"What a bad experience this place is way to corporate and needs to be shown what customer service is  1st off sign up on website so we don't have to wait and then we get there wait 10 min to get up to obviously overwhelmed girl who gives me the same wait time as if i just walked in  Is Outback really that stupid to set up website pay millions of dollars for it and then its not used properly how about stop wasting money on shit none of your employees know how to use and train them or pay a decent wage so you don't have to take people who can't hack it"}
{"text":"The service here was excellent! The wait staff were super attentive and knowledgeable of the menu items. My friend's steak was over-cooked and the owner himself came out and apologized and even brought him the replacement entree, potatoes and all. Even gave him a card for a free bloomin' onion as a token of apology, though it was not asked for. Very nice place."}
{"text":"About 12 patrons were waiting to be seated. My husband and I ate in the bar.  A bar mishap with water spilled all over the bar twice was quickly handled with a verbal apology and complimentary dessert. Accidents happen. We enjoyed tilapia with crab meat and fresh vegetables and ny strip with crispy French fries."}
{"text":"Went to the outback back in March when in Vegas this is the one on the south end  of the strip very good food and the service was excellent our waiter was great A bit on the expensive sidewe had steak of course it's the outback right would most definitely here again"}
{"text":"Yes we went to dinner at the outback I had ribs And my wife had fillet mignon.  Hers came with a potato soup that was excellent had a side of blooming onion that was okay would most definitely go back and eat here again The waiter was Jaydon"}
{"text":"Dinner was wonderful, great service. Hostess was very curt. I had the strawberry gingerbeer which was good, my husband had the strawberry margarita which he said needed alcohol."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place no stars. Ordered $100+ worth of take out and we were very dissatisfied with the food. Everything was overseasoned (tons of pepper & salt) my kids would not touch it. Steaks not cooked properly, medium was rare, well was medium, etc...had to recook the meat myself. It was just gross. Everything was horrible. Total waste of money!!!"}
{"text":"Jordan did an excellent job of making sure our meals were exactly as ordered... delicious, as always! My fiancé and I live in the neighborhood and dine here often.  Thank you Jordan and see you soon!"}
{"text":"went in for dinner Friday night.  We were immediately told no salads were available because of a lettuce recall.  Uhhhh ok.  I ordered the 8oz ribeye w baked potato and green beans, Auntie ordered a burger and dad and gram both some sort of steak w loaded potatoes.  We also got the Blooming Onion to share.   W the exception of the extremely greasy blooming onion, everything was superb including our lil cute waitress.  I can't remember her name.  She's was so little and expecting her 2nd bundle of joy soon!  She made sure everything was ok wout being over the top annoying! Would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight bc I wanted steak but wanted it fast so I can get back to watch my Oregon Ducks & Outback is 5 minutes away. We were seated right away. Jennifer was awesome. If the review was for her it wld be 10 stars. We ordered the ribeye and the steak & unlimited shrimp. She was on top of making sure the shrimp was rolling right out. Ed never had to wait.  My ribeye was pretty flavorless and had a nice size amt of fat in the middle. Like maybe a tablespoon amt. it was pretty gross and disappointing. The bread wasn't hot. Was kinda just barely warm. I haven't been in awhile & it'll prob be awhile before I go again."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work so I go to many Outback's because they a very consistent or so I thought. The one in Mentor was very disappointing to say the least. Most every other Outback I've been to is a sold three star so don't let this one review make you think that they are all two starts. They had the B team working the night me and my girlfriend went to the Mentor location. First we had to wait for a table and the place was only half full then our server let us know from the start that she would be spending a lot of time with another table because she knew them so if we needed anything not to be afraid to get her attention. Then she brought out the wrong appetizer which she did comp us for. She brought my girlfriend coke when she ordered diet coke. The server was very nice just not on her game. The food was not that good when we received it. My steak was over cooked but with all the other trouble we had I didn't say anything. My girlfriend was not impressed with her chicken, it was over done."}
{"text":"So I'm staying at the hotel and I order outback due to complete desperation. I don't understand how my food could show up cold when I'm literally 100 feet away. The steak tacos consists of 3 to 4 pieces of steak that are so over cooked you can barely eat them.  My sweet potato was cold and unable to melt the butter. And I found some weird plastic thing in my mac & cheese. Overall a poor experience I should've just ordered pizza."}
{"text":"We were excited about coming to Outback. We used the app to be put on the list ahead of time. We got the 4 course meal which was a good deal. Now comes the bad part, service was not at all good. I had forks to eat my soup, 3 out of steaks were not cooked correctly. We had to ask 3 times for steak sauce. But it was a Saturday night but still the service has a lot to be desired. But I love the Outback so we will more then likely come back. 2 stars for $83 spent, no thanks."}
{"text":"Keep coming back to this wonderful restaurant in Frazer, for steaks, for clam chowder, as well as for the blooming onion. Like their specials, their bread, their desserts. When our son finishes his school nearby, we will be definitely missing this place ..."}
{"text":"The customer service was good however the quality of food was not matching. One would think that Outback Steakhouse is known for their mouth-watering steaks, however they were very dry. I had the sirloin and my sister medallions. I was less than impressed with the sirloin. This is surprising that there was a lack of flavor and juiciness being that I ordered the steak medium well."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined here for a late lunch on 4/10/16. Nativity was the best server ever! Very friendly, knew the menu well, offered us some great suggestions. She made me an awesome classic mojito that was not too sweet, perfect! My friend and I shared the Seared Peppered Ahi tuna appetizer, mmm mmm!!!! I enjoyed the Grilled salmon 10oz as my entree, with a plain baked potato on the side. They also have a 7oz portion option, but beware, the ounces listed on the menu is the weight of the fish UNcooked... hence the reason I got the 10 oz.   The Australian theme always makes me giggle - you can't really call any of the menu \"authentic\" Australian anything other than the clever marketing.  Where's the grilled kangaroo?!? LOL   Prices are reasonable, selection is pretty good and they have a lot of different healthy fish options on the entree menu."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I accidentally stumbled across this place and glad we did. We were starving after a night of car shopping and this place was closing in 20 minutes. I am a fan of Outback so I was happy they were open.   We sat at the bar and had a nice meal. he ordered the Diablo Sirloin with a baked sweet potato and he cleaned his place. I had Ahi tuna salad with the viniagrette on the side. The only thing I don't care for on the salad is the lettuce is not always that great. The tuna was fantastic and well seasoned. Decent prices and good service."}
{"text":"Before enjoying the night in Vegas we wanted a nice steak at a decent price so we made reservations for 8:30pm. We were a large party and they accommodated us very well. We were a party of 11. Our waiter was always on point and looked like Vince Vaughn the actor. We ordered the blooming onion to star things off with some beers. We then placed our orders. I had the bone in ribeye medium with a baked potato and a house salad with ranch dressing. Steak was cooked to perfection and was very tasty and just melted in your mouth. Baked potatoes with everything on it are always good and the salad was very fresh and crisp. This was a good dinner to start a night of drinking in sin city."}
{"text":"Bad service, steak not cooked to order and Caesar salad was not good either. Only thing  was lobster was decent. Couldn't even get a refill on water! Won't go back!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to an Outback restaurant in years so decided to give it a try.  The waiter was nice, prompt and polite. That was the good.  The bad; took a LONG time to get our food and when it came out we were missing several items. My husband ordered steak and lobster with garlic mashed potatoes.  The steak was tender but tasted off and the lobster was tiny and the mashed potatoes were missing. I ordered the chicken sandwich and the bun was crunchy and the fried were missing.  My daughter had the mac and cheese and loved it.  My son ordered a kids burger and the bun was so hard he couldn't eat it.  Seriously, the bun was hard as heck and crumbled when you pinched it.  The manager came to the table to see how everything was and I showed him the bun.  He was profusely apologetic and offered to take that off the bill and buy us dessert as well.  We ordered two skillet apple pies and a chocolate thunder.  It took 15 minutes for them to bring it and when it came, it was 1 skillet apple pie and 1 chocolate thunder.  So even the apology desserts were wrong!"}
{"text":"This location is slower than usual.  I came in on New Years day and clearly most of the staff had a real fund new years because they were dragging and hung over.  The place had to be understaffed by about 20-25%.  The wait was longer than ever, it was at least an hour and that was after assuring us 45 minutes was the maximum it would take.  There were plenty of people sneezing and coughing in the waiting area to keep us company.  This isn't Outback's fault, but longer wait times in the incubation chamber don't make for a positive experience.  The Outback chain has made some notable changes.  Pepper, pepper, pepper, salt.  The dishes I have eaten previously had the maximum amount of pepper kick that can be considered edible.  I love pepper and even I thought they had a bit too much, this didn't stop me from eating every little bit.  I am a man of extremes, normal people I reckon would be turned off.  The salt really stays with you, it is a strong kick in the tongue.  Not so much pow as it is blammo!  The appetizer with the shrimp, the non-coconut ones, was way too salty.  I ate the bread as a bravado to show my fortitude to the ladies at the table.  In hindsight it was a foolish campaign of sadistic gastronomy.  Ever had a way too salty tomato?  Now is your chance.  The shrimp by comparison were merely too peppery, but not nearly as overwhelming as the toast and tomatoes.  I had a bowl of soup - the clam chowder.  I love clam chowder.  This wasn't Manhattan style disgusting clam water, it was the cream based and edible variety of soup.  Surprise - this soup was 1/2 pepper.  I still loved it, but it was less enjoyable as a result of all the pepper.  I wasn't inedible where it was, but you could certainly see the path to making it impossible to eat.  The ribeye - this was the least over salted and over peppered food I had.  I would actually assert it had the right amount of salt, even though too much pepper.  The problem is with all that pepper I can't be sure if it muted some of the salt.  The portion was large and cooked reasonably well.  The quality of the cut was of the minimum I wouldn't complain about.  It had some fat on the edges but lacked as much marbling as I would have liked.  It was also cooked unevenly - there were thinner parts and they were overcooked.  At a steakhouse I expect you to figure out a way to either cut the steak so it doesn't have overcooked parts, of cut it haphazardly and find some divine way to cook the steak so that the cut isn't a problem.  I was eating with a new person so I couldn't be all out Dave on the first encounter, this was dispositive.  What was perfect?  The free bread was perfect.  It wasn't salty or peppery."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour and if you sit at the bar, you not only get faster service but you get to have some friendly conversation with the bartendar.  There are some really good items you can get in the bar area during happy hour which are enough to fill your belly while you drink some drink.  The food here is very good 98% of the time and it is a place I like to come to every so often.  For a chain type place, they really know how to keep you coming back and I have always had a pretty decent experience here.    I recommend Outback and if you have not been for a while, it may be time to revisit and if you can, sit at the bar, you should have a good time."}
{"text":"I can't complain about my food as it was prepared the way I requested and everything I had tasted good.  Our server was extremely busy but did his best to make sure we had everything we needed.  The two stars are because of quality control in the kitchen, not sure what was going on inside there??  We had a part of 8 and on one plate, she got her chicken she ordered, her potato and veggies, however, the paper receipt showing what was ordered buried under her chicken is not something that was ordered.  How does a paper receipt end up on a plate buried under food???  That was just an attention to detail issue that is becoming more and more of a problem with restaurants.  In the end, they did make her a new plate and did offer to give me a military discount, but why not honor military, active and retired 365 days a year?      Outback has gone down hill over the years and they try hard but still fail from time to time.  If they focused more on the business model being about the customer and customer support (from Corporate) they may enjoy a little more success.  Managers and servers trying their hardest but still having their hands tied does not allow the managers to do everything they would like to show customers come first.  It is what it is which is sad.  I only go here when I'm with people who suggest this chain otherwise I won't go, too many issues."}
{"text":"We celebrated a 16 yr old birthday last night here. The waiter was  incredibly nice and accommodating. I think his name was Paul, bald red sideburns. As a group on a special diet and food allergies he was very  understanding and kind. Not to mention  several separate  Checks that were accurate thank you, Paul and Happy Birthday Hailee!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for chains usually, but my boyfriend's daughter was craving a baked potato...so we ended up at Outback. I am happy to see they have a smaller snack size of the Bloomin' Onion, as the regular size is too much unless you have a small group. We split that and the chicken tender platter. Everything was good, but not out of this world. Our server was amazing though and was very attentive the entire time!"}
{"text":"Worst Outback in the United States!! Ordered a 16 oz. prime rib. It came 10 Oz. of fat and took for f*uckin ever!! The last time I was here the lady acted like she wanted a noose for a tip so she could hang herself. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Brian was our server and was very helpful and nice on a busy weekend. Glad to have someone that was this way on a busy weekend with the drag race in town."}
{"text":"Outback ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Cameron was an all-star. He was extremely attentive and a pleasant server. The food was also superb. I got the filet and lobster tail and scarfed it down within minutes ."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write a review, but I feel that I have to do thi so that the management  will be made aware of our experience at their establishment.  We celebrated our son's 21st birthday at Outback.  Our waiter wasn't very nice from the get go...he was sort of rude to us because we couldn't pick our choices...It was our first time for us to patronize them at this location.  My daughter felt the bad vibe from him as well.  Once we ordered, our waiter wasn't around so he couldn't check up on u. By the way, forgot the lobster tail we ordered until we waived him down to ask if it was coming...had he checked up on us more often, we would've let him know sooner...the service he gave and his attitude was poor and he made us feel like our business wasn't appreciated.   The manager came by and apologized for the delay of the lobster tail,  which was nice of him, but we still think that the overall experience wasn't up to par.  There were four of us for dinner that night and we don't feel like coming back again.  I don't know if this waiter was inexperienced or if he was having an off day, but we certainly didn't feel very welcome.  The food was good, but in order for the overall experience to be up to par, I feel that this waiter should've paid closer attention to customers needs and kept his line of communications open with us."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch right as they opened. The service was great. Our waiter checked in frequently and our drinks were always filled. Of course they weren't busy at all, but he did a great job.   The onion was perfect. My salad was uninspiring, but it's a side salad. At least the lettuce was fresh. I had the shrimp. It was a little too oily for me. But the flavor was good. My daughter had the sirloin, and it was perfect. One of the best steaks from a chain we've had in a long time.   Overall, good experience. It was my daughter's birthday. So the waiter went out of his way to thank her for choosing to have lunch here. We will totally come back."}
{"text":"I've given this place several chances and every time I order deliver they always get my order wrong. It's also very cold. I have ordered my steak different ways and it's always made well-done but almost burnt. I am never eating at this place again."}
{"text":"Full disclosure- I worked at Outback Steakhouse for a few years (in AZ & CO) in college and am still fond of this chain.   Outback has done a terrific job updating with the times and giving more value options! They even have new menu items for food and beverage. Still, nothing beats a Blooming Onion, am I right?   This particular restaurant has undergone a face lift and gone are the cheesy Australian decorations and signs, but what is left is a classier version of the \"No Rules, Just Right\" attitude.   If it's still the same- Outback has a small freezer for only 2 things: bread and ice cream. That means everything is fresh and cooked to order. They cook on a flat grill so they can sear in the juices of the meat. I'm biased- but favorite menu items are still Coconut Shrimp, NY Strip, the Prime Rib (get it seasoned & seared on the grill), and Grilled Salmon.  Beverages? Wash it down with a custom Wallaby Darned."}
{"text":"This was our first time!  After an unpleasant experience at another local restaurant we walked out of and walked into Outback and were so glad we did, the staff was excellent!  Our waitress was very pleasant, the food was amazing!  Prime rib was tasty and hot, I think our food stayed hot until we finished!  The atmosphere was nice too!  Thank you Outback for making all the difference to our weekend get away to Phoenix you can be my family and I will return!"}
{"text":"Home of the ever famous blooming onion! My boyfriend and I stopped by here for lunch since we had received some promotional gift cards during the holidays. This location was pretty nice and not too overcrowded. We were easily were able to sit down at the bar. The service was quick and friendly, no complaints there.  Food wise we had to go with a blooming onion to start, obviously a must. I can't say I remember them being so big, but it's definitely more than enough for four people or more to share. I also had the Caesar salad and French onion soup combo. Both tasted pretty average tasting, but good.   A nice standard restaurant chain for lunches, dinners or just your occasion blooming onion craving."}
{"text":"Quick with the reservation and the Ahi-tuna sesame salad was fresh, delicious and perfect in every way. Everyone was friendly, clean classy place!!"}
{"text":"Ate there on Friday Dec 1 2017.  My wife and I both ordered steaks.  They were prompt with the salads and drinks.  Then we waited 30 minutes to get our steaks.  Asked one of the busboys to find our waiter, where is our food? When the steaks came the were barely warm.  He asked if I'd like another.  I don't have that kind of time to wait again.  The manager came by comp'd our food and said he be back with his card for us to return on him. Never saw him after 20 minutes. Won't be back to this Outback."}
{"text":"I don't usually find myself at chain steak places like Outback but Mrs. And I had been given gift cards to a lot of chain places last christmas.  After our foray into suburbia and stumbled across this place for lunch and we entered.  The restaurant was short staffed and they admitted as much when we arrived. I thought that was nice instead of just leaving us to starve in the waiting area.  We still were seated in a reasonable amount of time.    My wife and I both got a steak and a side along with a little dessert.  I must admit to liking the place more than I expected.  They had their nutrition information pretty available and the food while not mind blowing was above my expectations.  The server was attentive, polite and prompt.  All in all, if you find yourself in the south hills you can do far worse then here."}
{"text":"Note: This review is strictly for the curbside take away. It's hit or miss with this restaurant on whether you will get the right order but most restaurants aren't perfect with their takeout accuracy.   However, most restaurants will accept liability when they make a mistake. This is not the case for the Westlake Outback. On this specific occasion, I placed an online order at 9:45pm and was sent an email confirmation, starting my order would be ready at 10:30. On the way to pickup my order, I get a call from the woman working the takeout \"window,\" rudely asking where I was and if I planned on picking up my order, since it's been ready since 10:05. (This is after I left a tip when I placed my order).  When I got to the restaurant, I explained that there was an error with the online ordering system, I showed them the email and I was told, in other words, that I was SOL.   Horrible service, good food. Would recommend anyone to either call in to place the order or just eat at the restaurant. Hopefully service improves since I do love Outback's menu.  Outback still gets 2 stars since the food is still good after sitting for nearly a half hour, and the service when I've sat down and eaten there is always top-notch."}
{"text":"Ate our valentines dinner here tonight and It was wonderful. I haven't been to outback in about 13 yrs and noting has changed. Still have the same great food. Only complaint was the Alice springs chicken seemed like they were skimpy on the mushrooms and cheese and the sauce wasn't as tasty as it was years back. My boyfriend had the steak and shrimp and he loved it!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with a large group last Saturday night.  I ordered a sirloin, grilled shrimp, and a salad.   When did outback start using so much salt the food is inedible?   I literally couldn't eat my dinner because it was so bitter tasting from the salt.  I told the waitress and she said they get a lot of complaints about the salt level of their food.    I told them I didn't want a replacement because everyone else was almost done by this time and instead of removing it from my check, the next thing I know the manager comes over with a \"lite seasoning\" replacement meal.   I didn't say anything because it was my birthday and we had great service through our dinner, but I couldn't eat that dinner either because life salt to them means salt encrusted.    I won't be going back to Outback because that level of salt can't be good for people.   It's a shame too because I used to love their steak and shrimp.  :("}
{"text":"We had an awesome date night for my birthday at this location! Our server was Cameron! He definitely attended to everything we needed! Very pleased with his service! We would specifically ask for him to be our server next time! Thanks outback for a good dinner! Thanks Cameron!"}
{"text":"Outback is outback.  I've never been a huge fan of this place, but I do love their wings.  They are dusted spice and remind me of the wings from Red Robin.  Probably one of the better things on the menu.    We went here for lunch a few weeks ago and were seated pretty quickly.  I ordered an iced tea, girlfriend ordered a Mr. Pibb and we put in for some wings and a salad.  That came out quickly.  Then our waitress seem to vanish for a while.  When asking for some sweetener I had to ask another waitress in which she had someone else deliver it to our table.  Honestly, I had asked her for two things two different times and both times she had different people deliverer it to us...  So I had to think.. Did we smell or something? Geez.   After about 20min, we finally ordered our prime rib (because they had it for lunch finally) and it came out pretty rare.  My girlfriend loves rare meat and I enjoy medium.  The prime rib was ok.. I wasn't a huge fan, but it was decent.   Will I be back?  Honestly, not at this location. Just wasnt an overall fan of the place."}
{"text":"Updating my review because our experience was so bad that I contacted corporate about it. I have not heard back from them, which is annoying but not the end of the world.  The real kicker? To send a complaint I had to register to receive emails from Outback. I have now received two promotion (aka junk) emails from them and no response to my original contact."}
{"text":"After a day at Cedar Point for my birthday, I knew dinner had to be Outback. I love the food here and have never had a bad trip. I wanted to be closer to my hotel once dinner was over, so I drove to Parma from Sandusky, and am I glad I did!  Ryan was my server and one of the best I've ever had. He cared about my gluten-free diet restrictions and that it was my birthday. He was funny and very good at his job. I ordered the Surf & Turf, two of my favorite things, filet mignon and lobster tail. Before dinner, I ordered a Key Lime Martini, and let me tell you it was to-die-for. I've never had such a delish drink in my life. It really tasted like a key lime pie. The steak was like butter, and cooked a perfect deep-pink medium rare. I got loaded mashed potatoes with and they were also divine. The salad starter with ranch, delicious! The meal was perfect and Ryan asked if I wanted him to sing to me. I said it was up to him and he said, \"No, you'd better tell me what you want.\" So I said yes, and he could make it very quick and quiet. We both laughed the whole time, and the gesture really made the day feel like a birthday. He brought me a complimentary sundae. I'd mentioned the gluten-free brownie (which was pretty much the whole reason why I went to Outback). I don't know of any other restaurant that has a gluten free brownie. When the brownie was missing, I asked about it and realized he wanted to bring me something complimentary. He asked if I wanted him to go get the brownie...I said no so I wouldn't hurt his feelings...but I wish I'd gotten the brownie lol. He even added a candle to the sundae. I'd asked if he had one, explaining I'm very superstitious about the birthday wish (and it has to be with the candle and on the actual day). He said, \"Of course I have a candle.\" He was really funny and went the extra mile to make my day special. I had a woman across the way at a booth say Happy Birthday, and she said it was too bad I was alone. I told her how much I love to get away for a few days solo. I tried to explain how important I feel it is for everyone to do so. You are on your own agenda the whole time. Eat, sleep, drink, go exactly where YOU want. You can hear yourself think. She seemed to understand. Her wish for me made the day more special too.  Love this place and hope to someday return. Thanks again, Ryan, for making my birthday one to remember!"}
{"text":"Do not go here!  The cheese fries were super salty and cold and the chicken sandwich was completely tasteless, no mayo or sauce at all.  My hubby ordered a Coors Light when we sat down, after 25 minutes we asked the waitress where his beer was and she said the tap ran out, so she brought him a bottle. All in all just an awful experience."}
{"text":"We both loved it!  Orange marmalade dipping sauce and ahi tuna was my favorite, the homemade chocolate sauce is to die for. My boyfriend loved the secret 19 spices on his steak."}
{"text":"We ate here for a friends birthday and we showed up just before closing and they did not once ever push us to leave because they are closed.  Even our food came out perfect!  The server we had Lorenzo Garcia was nice, funny and always made sure we had everything we wanted!  I love Outback and we do eat here very often but this experience on this day was outstanding and something that should be told to all!  Thank you for a great birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers to celebrate. We were seated promptly and our server, Ashley, was very nice. I ordered the prime rib and was not disappointed! Very juicy and tasty. My only complaint would be that I had to ask for a soda refill and more bread. We were a party of nine so the bread went quick!"}
{"text":"We came here for an early birthday dinner. We actually meant to go across the street to Joe's Crab Shack, but they were closed. So this was not a scheduled visit. It was a Friday at 7 o'clock, so they were pretty busy, but we were seated pretty quickly as in they were working really hard and quick to get the tables bused so that was nice.       Our waiter was really nice but you could tell he was busy and running around a lot. Took some time to get our drinks and the bread was only served with a teeny tiny amount of butter... so small it barely covered half the loaf! One of the girl's working there brought out our appetizer (the Aussie signature platter which included bloomin' onions petals, macaroni and cheese bites and Aussie cheese fries, $12.49) Everything on the plate was pretty good. We LOVED the mac n cheese bites, but the issue with them was that the girl had accidentally dropped them before they were delivered, which is fine, accidents happen. But it took awhile to get them replaced, we even asked our waiter about them and he had no idea and had to go check on them. But, hey, they were worth it because they were tasty.      For our entrees we ordered two 6 oz filet mignons ($22.99 each) with asparagus, mashed potatoes and two macaroni and cheeses, and an order of a 12 oz prime rib ($22.99) with loaded mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad. They arrived but they had forgot one of the macaroni and cheeses and the loaded mashed potatoes (they came regular) and both of these were an extra $1.00 each to order. But that was an easy fix and they were pretty quick with getting them to us. The steaks were super yummy but, a a tad pricey for the sizes. The sides were good, all expect for the salad because the dressing did taste a little off and the macaroni and cheese is super dry, not creamy at all (not worth the extra dollar).      Overall, it was a pretty okay experience. The employees were very polite and tried to do the best they could with being so busy. The only reason I'm leaning more toward a three than a four is because there were a bunch of long wait times (They might have been understaffed?) and the mistakes on the orders. Other than that, we'd come back again."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Blooming onion not cooked right steaks not cooked as ordered green beans were like eating wood chips and everything was so salty it was barely edible. Will never eat at an Outback again!"}
{"text":"We chose to do curbside for 6 people and all were special orders no mayo no blah blah... we placed the order online. Showed up parked waited a couple mins waiter came brought us our order, he was very polite as well. Got home food was hot and CORRECT! We were a little scared expecting mistakes cause let's face it even when you sit down inside and have a large group it's easy to have a mistake but that was not the case. Ordering was easy, we were given complimentary bread, utensils, and everything was packed nicely. I'd definitely use curbside again."}
{"text":"The worst. Avoid, unless you're cool with a 2 hour lunch where you have to constantly remind the server of what you just requested (steak sauce!!!) 10 minutes ago. Steak was over cooked by far, salad had a giant glob of dressing, and the bathroom was less nice than the one at the Cancun airport."}
{"text":"VERY dissapointed.  Ordered curb side service and asked that the veggies NOT be microwaved.  I ordered while i pulled into the parkinglot.  Immediately they came out and asked for me to pay. I sat for 20 min.  They brought my order and i went home.    I got home and found my broccoli RAW. NOT COOKED AT ALL.  I sat in the parking lot wiaiting for the food..... and they KNEW it.....    I called and was told they were confused with my order.  I said why didnt you come out and ask..... no response.  They said they didnt have a steamer tray.  I said \"Im stanging over my stove with a little water in my pan steming it ... you could do this....no answer..  THEY USE A MICROWAVE ON THEIER FOOD...... MICROWAVES CHANGE THE MOLEULAR STRUCTURE OF THE FOOD AND OUR BODIES DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS FOOD.... why pay money for good food when it is then ruined by a microwaave......."}
{"text":"Ribeye was cooked perfectly and lobster tail was also dont nicely. Veggies and mashers were also good. Drinks were a bit slow with service but overall it was pretty good for a chain."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience at Outback. We use to love going to the Outback but after our experience tonight, never again! The food was awful. Even the house salad tasted like fish. We were never asked how we wanted out meat cooked so I guess the default is very WELL done. I don't know if they changed their recipes when they changed their menus but it was a way overpriced Applebee's. Yuck."}
{"text":"This is a highly consistent and reliable chain Steakhouse. The service has been consistently good and the staff are very familiar with menu items and drinks. The Steak is choice not prime but moderately priced and prepared as ordered. We really like the Coconut Shrimp appetizer with an orange marmalade dipping sauce. The chicken, pasta and ribs, particularly Prime Rib are all very good. You need to call ahead on weekends to avoid a long wait. I am surprised by the Consensus three star rating. That is not fair, this place is clearly above average for chain steakhouses."}
{"text":"We love outback. This is one of the worst. Waitress was slow. To the point other customers in her area left without food. Unfortunately we didn't take their hint. When the food arrived my husbands and daughters noodles in the chicken pasta we cold. Not warm. Cold. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this location. Service was bad and we were there at noon on a Sunday so it wasn't busy. Several items we ordered were not brought out and we had to ask for them. My brother wanted his steak mid-rare, unfortunately, it was raw and had to be sent back. It was somewhat odd that they just re-fired the same steak which my brother had already completely cut it half.  Other than the service, the food was what you could expect from any Outback Steakhouse. Unfortunately, the quality of the service was poor which negatively impacted the overall experience.   My favorites from Outback is always the baked sweet potato. I normally avoid excessive amounts of butter/sugar if possible, but when it comes to the baked sweet potato, bring on the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at an Outback Steakhouse and I must say it wasn't that good of an experience. We made reservations but still had to wait. Once we were escorted to our table they still had dirty dishes on it from previous customers. The table wasn't wiped, it was sticky. Our waiter had a great personality but wasn't a very good server. He didn't ask how I wanted my steak cooked. Instead we had to ask him if I could have it medium well, when he assumed and wrote down I wanted medium rare. I don't think it was that great of an experience.  The only good thing about it was the food and dinner combo."}
{"text":"Got suckered in to the \"all you can eat shrimp\" promo. Grocery store quality steak, under cooked baked potato, and tiny over cooked shrimp that were the texture of jerky. When we got home my wife said, \"let's never go there again.\" I agree. There are too many good places to eat in this area to eat franchise crap. At least we had a gift card to use. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Came here as a last minute dinner, was seated immediately. Mathew B was our server and he was exceptional with his service. Totally on top of what was needed and even brought water with our cocktails without us asking..... one of the things I look for in service. Food was hot and delicious and he made it that much better. Will be coming back. Thanks Matt"}
{"text":"It's been years since I ate at an Outback. I had a coupon so I figured let's try them out again!   They are currently offering a 4 course meal starting at $14.99. The meal includes salad, soup, entree and dessert. It was such a good deal I couldn't pass it up!   I chose the Caesar salad, upgraded to the French onion soup ($1 more), had the 6 oz. top sirloin with raspberry cheesecake as dessert.   In general, everything was good. The salad was cool and refreshing, the soup had beefy onion flavor, and the sirloin was cooked nicely at medium rare. At 6 oz the steak is a bit small but the rest of the courses made up for it. I didn't get to the cheesecake but I was able to get a to go container to eat it for later. For the price I paid I was pretty satisfied.   Service was warm and friendly. I think one of the managers was here tonight too and he was also providing excellent service and even held the door open for us when we left.   If I'm in the mood for a steak that won't break the bank this is a good choice.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"Awful! I dont know why we havent learned our lesson on this place except this is the only steak house for miles near us. Steaks never correct temp, incorrect order-literally bringing us food from someone elses table, soggy bloomin onion, spoiled cheese on broccoli, absent servers. Just a terrible place and we finally decided this would be the last time we give them our money. ( I would have told the manager how bad it was but of course no manager was available)"}
{"text":"Our wine glasses came out still wet with lipstick marks on both glasses. We sent them back and the server obviously just wiped them off because you could still see the smudge on both glasses. Our steaks arrived well done when we ordered them medium and medium rare. And to top it all off a small bug scurried across the table right before our correct steaks arrived. We will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food was good, what you know you will get at Outback, but Bambi our waitress was one of the best servers I have had!!! She was absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Stopped there for dinner. Was able to get a table right away. Server was good. Drinks okay, but a little on the high side.  Food came out hot and steak cooked just right. Salad fresh, soup very good and hot. Noise level was actually lower than expected. All the staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Went tonight they nailed it! Everything perfect. So glad they've got it back to its original glory. Happy to have my outback back again. :)"}
{"text":"Came in at 7:30pm on a Saturday. Expected the wait. We were surprisingly sat at a table a little after 8pm. We then ordered in a timely fashion and were not served our first course of soups until 9:15pm. By this time the restaurant had cleared out and the waitstaff including our inattentive waitress sat chatting at the hostess station until we brought to their attention how long our wait was. She was unapologetic. When the food arrived you could tell it had sat under the warmer for a long time.  Steaks were over cooked. Very disappointing service and no manager to be found to help the situation. Won't be back. Too many other options in Madison with better experience."}
{"text":"Do not go here for lunch. We just went here and it took over an hour and a half before we got our entrees. By this point we were full bc the courses were brought out so far apart. We spoke with the Manager who was very nice and understanding about our complaint. At this point I was not mad but what happened next is what put me over. I walked off without my entree which I put in a to go container bc by the time I got it I was too full to eat. It was my entire untouched entree. Before I even got in my car I realized I left it on the table. We went back to get it and they had already thrown it away. This all occurred during the lunch hour--they were not busy at all. I don't understand why they couldn't have set my container aside for a few minutes to make sure I didn't return for it. I'm beyond mad."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today at Outback. The food was fabulous and the service was exemplary!!!. When we mentioned we had specific diet needs the manager (Christina) came over and said she could have anything made as long as they had the ingredients. We eat out several times a week and I can't remember the last time we had such good service. The only negative is the price point of their steaks."}
{"text":"This Outback has better atmosphere than most, and was a good option to eat steak on LV Blvd for a good price. Our service was a little slow, but not bad. Our food was decent, and it was low-maintenance compared to other steakhouses nearby. My coconut shrimp were actually really good.  All in all, it was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon to get the steak & crab special.  We were seated right away, we had a stellar waitress, the food arrived at a great pace, she never let us run out of sweet tea, the steaks were both cooked perfectly, the crabs were tasty & easy to crack, she brought all of the correct items without being asked.  This visit was textbook perfect from beginning to end.  This is how it should be, thanks Outback!"}
{"text":"In a pinch and only in the direst circumstance we eat at chain restaurants.  It's really important to keep the money in the hands of small business people as much as possible.  Our country will look exactly the same city to city without our local restaurants.  It's a part of our local culture and heritage and we would be poorer without them.    The food at Outback is consistent and good.  I had a perfectly cooked chicken breast with veggies and a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  You have to be careful with the menu as the calories are really terrifically high all over the place.  The veggies were really carefully prepared as well and still had plenty of bite and life left in them too.  The value is good.  We've been there 5 or 6 times in the past 8 years or so and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm already a huge fan of Outback. I believe they serve a great piece of steak. The choice tonight was rib eye.. One bone in, (which is all they had left), and one without. Both delicious, but the bone in was divine. Like always dessert first which the photos will show. The bloomin onion is superb, and the salads though not as perfect as they use to be, still very good. We were so full from the bloomin onion, that we got to go boxes as the rest of the food arrived. the server was a doll, so polite, wonderful smile. He was so courteous,I wouldn't want anyone else. Dinner was divine... You should try the rib eye, oh my goodness. What i could eat there, melted in my mouth. I finished the rest cold it was so good. and we had a 15% off your entire order coupon that they sent out.. perfect."}
{"text":"great service great place to eat highly recommented"}
{"text":"5 star service !!!!!!!! I love this restaurant! The steak is moist and delicious as well as the other food! My waitress was wonderful!! Unfortunately, her name escapes me!"}
{"text":"The Blooming onion is always great BUT salmon was dry, water got empty, the server forgot the bread, the table behind us asked for a new server & the sever was not friendly at all!  This place was managed very poorly & dirty."}
{"text":"Best steaks ever! I come to this location all the time! My steak is always cooked perfect and service is always spectacular."}
{"text":"This place is just sad.  We visited here for lunch with a gift card in hand. We sat down during the lunch hour even though it seemed like it was mid afternoon based on the amount of people eating there.  We ordered a blooming onion...one of my favs. ......and along with that we ordered chicken tacos and salads for the main course.  After 20 mins or so the onion came out and we dug in.  It was hot and good.  After the onion we expected our salads but after 30 more mins we still had no salads and only a waiter that floated by with a silly look on his face that murmured something about our food coming out soon.  Another 10 mins and now we are at an hour and 15 mins for lunch.....it's a good thing it was my day off.....my lunch mate was angry and wouldn't wait any longer.  After alerting the manager we received our meal which had just came up in the kitchen in to go bags and we were told lunch was on them even though we didn't have time to eat it in the restaurant.  The manager was very apologetic for the waiter as she should have been because he was strange and wasn't very good at his job.  Even later when I did get to sit down and eat the food it wasn't very good.  I guess we will try again sometime so we can actually use the gift card"}
{"text":"Outback Steakhouse is one of the best darn steakhouses I have been to. This establishment is a boon to any community and people should be proud that they have chosen to be a part their town. The steak taste like chicken tikka and mutton curry mixed with aloo gopi. Larry and Pedro are my favorite waiters. Especially since they're both multi lingual and have an IQ of 150+. I love how they can explain everything about the steak including if it was grass fed or gluten free or free from salmonella. Being a vegetarian all my life I couldn't believe what I have been missing out on. I have heard they're coming out with the vegan steak that taste like hummus. Larry explained the new recipe very well as he was part of the team that developed it and kariappala was one of the most important ingredients. Thank you so much Outback."}
{"text":"The food was great, nothing new. The steaks were cooked perfectly, thank goodness. The servers were very attentive and polite. The restaurant and restrooms were clean. It was a little better than expected for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I normally do not review big chains such as Outback but they did an exceptional job on Sunday.  We wanted sushi but every sushi spot was either closed or didn't open until 5. We just wanted a light meal since we had purchased steaks to grill in the evening. Low and behold we end up at Outback's bar for apps. I ordered a side salad and we split the cheese fries. The fries were pretty killer. They were layered with ooey gooey cheese and perfectly cooked bacon.   What really sets outback apart is the service. Adam our bartender was fabulous! When we mentioned we were on the hunt for sushi he brought out a complimentary sampling of their seared tuna rare and it was shockingly delicious ( I may have to get that on a salad next time). Adam made the visit great, he asked us questions, shook our hands, and did a great job with recommendations (i.e order your cheese fries layered...you will never encounter a spare fry sans cheese). I must say overall he was one of the best bartenders I've had in Charlotte and he deserves to be recognized!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a good reputation but, I am not impressed by this location. Their \"Pink Lemonade\" is anything but lemonade as there are no lemons in this mixture. The taste was watery and had no lemony flavor whatsoever. I don't know what brand of Blue Cheese Dressing this restaurant buys but, they would do better if they purchased Marie's or Farmhouse brands as they both have much better flavor than what I was served. My steak was cooked correctly but, again, had little taste in my opinion. Don't plan to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Two words, Lindsay S; she made my visit spectacular. She has amazing customer service and is always there whenever you need her or when you are even thinking about it! The restaurant industry needs more people like her! Thank you Lindsay!"}
{"text":"The steak was tough, three of us ordered steak and could not even eat it. The steak was tough. I don't even know what else to say.   Service is good, can't complain about that. Just wasn't  happy with this meal"}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp is my favorite.  Everyone here is always so hospitable, I've never had an issue so far about the service.  We will try the Great Barrier trio today a good way to taste something different, it comes with sashimi- style ahi tuna , coconut shrimp and a mini crab & avocado stack w/ tortilla chips (sounds delicious). Always a good ambiance. Lunch time prices are very reasonable and never crowded.  So the trio was pretty good.  It was the first time and it was good, I've never had ahi tuna so I have nothing to compare it to.  Until we meet again!!!"}
{"text":"So far, it's 15 minutes post-arrival, and we had to send the bread plates back because they had crusted on food.   Second set of plates looked just as unsanitary.  It makes me really scared for the entrees!  Absolutely no sign of a manager, which makes it obviously a problem with management, not staff.  Update: table next to us also complained about plates with food residue....see it's not just me.  Final thoughts: The entrees came on what appears to be clean plates; tasty ribeye sandwich...hoping the aoli isn't rancid. One diner never received her side-dish...not a complete fail, but a warranted one-to-two star experience, maximum."}
{"text":"Went for dinner a few nights ago. I go because its close to home and usually a pretty good steak.   The night started off as a total disaster. Walking up to the front door, we had to walk through a cloud of cigarette smoke. This was pretty gross. There was about 6-8 people standing right by the front door smoking. I almost lost my appetite.  Once we got in, the hostess, who was very kind, had piercings in her face. A ring in her lip and something in her nose. Again, pretty gross. This is the first person you see when you walk in the door and to see all that metal in her head made me lose my appetite.   My wife was starved so we decided to stay, against my better judgement.  The waitress came to the table to introduce herself and she too had metal in her face. A loop nose ring. Gross  At that point, I could not take it. We walked out. Funny, no one asked why we were leaving, just if we were leaving.  Most likely, I will  not be returning here. The food is usually good. But seeing these people in the food service industry with all that metal in the heads and faces just really grosses my out."}
{"text":"I had the prime rib 8oz. It was mediocre. I expect a little fat but with my cut it consumed the whole cut. Probably got 4oz of eatable steak. I also got the loaded baked potato. It was very small. I was still hungry when finished my meal. So I got the 4 Pc cocnut shrimp. Didn't look good or really taste good. Was happy with bread. I don't see myself returning. The bartender was very nice. I give 5 stars for service."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Justin, provided excellent service. The steaks ordered were done just right. The sides and desserts were pleasing to the palate. The whole family enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Arrived around 8:30 or 9:00pm (not the huge dinner rush) and sat at the bar to have a drink while we waited for a table. I ordered a pitcher of Sangria b/c the price was much better than a single glass. The picture does NOT match the size of the pitcher that you receive. It was more like a small carafe.   We got to our table and ordered our food. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. We waited for over 30 minutes before we had to ask the manager, Abbie, whether they had forgotten our appetizer. Our appetizer was spinach dip - doesn't take long to make. When we asked the manager, she apologized, and efficiently got our appetizer out from the kitchen. Then we took a bite of the spinach dip and almost choked on the amount of salt that was on the tortilla chips. We couldn't finish it because the chips were so salty. We didn't want to complain again, so we simply waited of our main dish.  We waited, and waited, ..... (you see where this is going, right?)  Eventually, our food came to our table and the main dish I chose was their steak special. I have to say, the steak was cooked properly, which was a great sign. The broccoli on the side, however, was also doused with salt. I wasn't able to finish the broccoli either. My date ordered the bacon cheeseburger (I know, at a steak restaurant, what the heck?!) and he said it was also really delicious. The fries that came with it, however, looked like the scrap fries that get left behind in the fryer. Even the manager noticed when she came back to check on us and she demanded that we get more fries from the kitchen.  By the time we finished and paid our bill we had been there for nearly 2 hours. That's just 2 people eating dinner - 2 hours! Way too long for me.  I give 1 star for the wait time, but I give 1 more star for the manager because she made an effort to keep us from never returning and she recognized our wait time and the lackluster food without us having to prompt her - aside from the first time. We may be back to give it another go, but if it weren't for Abbie, it would have been out of the question."}
{"text":"My sister and I came were hungry and all we wanted was to just go inside, sit down and have lunch. As we walked in, we noticed it wasn't busy at all, there were maybe 3-4 tables being occupied and yet there was no up front to seat us. Finally after 10 minutes of waiting someone comes up and seats us down, that person who sat us down was also our server - who btw, never even greeted us. After 10 minutes he comes back and asks us what we'd like to drink, my sister wanted a midori sour, he looks at her with attitude and asks, what kind? First of all, my sister doesn't really drink and doesn't know anything so she was confused and didn't understand why he asked \"what kind\" of midori sour she wanted. So he sighs really loud and says hold on let me go see what that is. At this point, we definitely didn't like the way he was treating us or his attitude for that matter. After another ten minutes he comes back and was like \"I don't know what you mean by midori sour but this is what the bartender gave me\" and he puts it down on our table and just leaves without even asking if we were ready to order or not. She tried the drink and definitely did not know what she drank, I tried it myself and spat it out instantly, it was definitely not midori sour. What I don't understand is, every single bar I've ever been to, knows exactly what a midori sour is and what really confused me, is the fact that he came to our table and still gave us a drink when he said he didn't know what a midori sour was! When he came back, we told him to take it back because this isn't what we wanted and FINALLY, he asked for our order. Forty minutes later, our food finally comes out. A half hour for just appetizers??? Are you kidding me? And on top of that our waiter just dumped our dishes down on the table and left, didn't even ask if we needed anything.  At this point, we were pissed off and flagged down a different waiter and asked for to-go boxes because of how badly our service was, he apologized. But we still wanted to leave anyways because unfortunately, our waiter was still a douche. Now I remember why I just stick to carry out, because the many times I've dined-in the service was crap!"}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as they were year's ago. Steak was tuff and the shrimp was probably the size and quality of salad shrimp. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes to be seated. Ordered steaks. Not very good. Tough and chewy. Salad and bread were the best part of the meal. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We were very excited to eat here because it was the last night of our 2 week summer vacation and we don't have Outback Steakhouse back home in Hawaii. We were sat instantly and maybe half the restaurant was filled.  First off I want to say that I was not impressed by the service.  I don't want to believe it, but Im pretty sure our server (Marquise) forgot about us half the time we were there.  It took almost 15 minutes just to get water onto our table after sitting, and note that they didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink...We had to ask them ourselves. Apart from that, our server didn't check up on us, we were out of water majority of the time. Maybe it was because we were in a corner, but that is still no excuse.   Our food took a long time to come out, there was a couple who sat maybe 20 minutes after us and they got their food before us... However I really did enjoy the food. My boyfriend and I halved a meal and it was more than enough to fill the both of us up. Its just a bummer that my first time here wasn't up to par with my expectations.."}
{"text":"It's your standard chain, with your standard chain food. Gotta love that they offer room service with the participating hotel next door. If you have no car, and you are staying in Monroeville...this is a great bet. Loved that everyone was going superbowl crazy.    Stay away from the peanut butter cake-it's massive and KINDA good."}
{"text":"Well we were excited to have a nite out get some protein in our diet. We ordered a appetizer fine then ordered our dinner with soup and salad. That's fine two bites later our entree was served ok... What do we do? Shove the hot entree in? Our let the soup get cold as well? What happened to dining out? Taking our time to be served? In baby steps?"}
{"text":"Outback was very nice about our bad experience and gave us a gift card for our next visit. For our second try, service was very cordial as was the hostess. Unfortunately they messed up our steaks again. My filet wasn't a great cut, as it had some fat running through it, and they cooked my steak MR and my wife's smaller one M. They apologized and gave us dessert, which was nice...but all we really want is a well prepared meal, served as we ordered it."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the consistency of Outback.  Blue cheese wedge is the best, love the fried mushrooms and lately we've been sitting at the bar and get the best service from the bartenders..  Ate here on V-day and had a great meal and service!"}
{"text":"Very upset! Monday night last week Ribs were fantastic. Tuesday night last week Ribs were fantastic still, BUT CLEARLY SMALLER!! I ordered full slab on both days.  My mother ordered Prime Rib medium rear. Waitress said let me see if we have any medium rear left. WTF is that? Then when we asked for Horse Radish sauce for prime rib, same waitress said we're out of it.  Like I said, I was very upset with the service and cheapness of ripping us off."}
{"text":"Normally I like outback but both the food and service at this location were extremely off point. All our food felt like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long, it could have been that every time our water came back to see us he smelled like cig smoke.   Would be hard to come back to this one. Theres another Outback close by, I'd probably say go there."}
{"text":"Decided to stop and have lunch at outback and got starred down and frown at by 3 gay goods that made me laugh. Lord bless tgem lol. Now my bartender is the shit he's funny, witty,  and super outgoing. If your in Las Vegas on the strip stop by and have a grilled lobster tail and fire grill shrimps."}
{"text":"I am not much of a carnivore, but I was craving a steak and had not been to an Outback in YEARS... so on \"date night\" I convinced my honey to take me there before a movie.  We went online an and got on the wait list so we didn't have to wait when we got there.  It said the wait was 20-35 minutes at that time, I indicated that we would be there in 45.  We arrived right on time and we still had to wait 15 or so minutes.  Not a huge big deal, 15 is better than 45 especially on a Sat night at a place like that.  BUT that is the point of the online wait list right?  So you don't have to wait?  I got my steak craving satisfied and had a nummy baked potato and salad. The food was average for a chain restaurant, it was what I expected nothing less... nothing more!  However, the service was AWESOME, so they my 4 stars.  Not only was our server great, so was everyone else who walked by with a smile and always asking if we are good, offering to refill drinks and removing empty plates right away.  I love good service!"}
{"text":"Typically you can't go wrong with Outback.  Occassionally the staff isn't that great, but the last few times the waitstaff was on their game."}
{"text":"How could I have missed reviewing Outback?  Certainly been to this particular location many a times.  Probably missed doing a review cuz it's a chain.  However, chains deserve a review, too, especially if they are a worthy option.  This one is.    I wanted to review after this particular visit because something had changed for the better.  I always had ordered the steak medallions and each and every visit the option changed (for the worse).  Well, this time, it was for the better, as if they finally got their act together.   Here's the thing.  The option used to offer steak medallions on or off a skewer (can't remember)  with veggies including onion over a bed of rice.  Then you picked two other sides.  The entrée filled your plate and was eye-appealing, not to mention plenty of food.  This was an excellent dish.  Then, they tinkered with a good thing.  They started offering the same entrée but the bed of rice was replaced with a piddly-ass bare minimum splay (aka \"garnish\") of rice, leaving almost an entire white plate barren -- not eye-catching.  The next step was to do away with rice altogether (why?) and you still had two options to select from, but again, they left the eye-appealing nature of the dish something less than desirable as there was always still too much bare plate for the delivery because usually at least one of the side dishes was served in a separate container.  Now, they changed up the medallions to be garlic-basted (can't go wrong there).  And, though I do miss the veggies, the steak is delivered on 2 skewers and the 2 sides are on the same plate and fill it -- no bare spots.  Very eye-appealing and tasty to boot.  Why, oh why, was this dish so difficult to execute for Outback?  Sigh... And why is rice not an option?  And why don't they still serve veggies with the skewers?  Sigh...  Still, they seem to have figured out how to execute a fine dish both in taste, quantity, and presentation.  Yay.  Everything else about Outback, you most likely already know -- warm bread, huge steak knives, wally-be-darned brain freeze drink, bloomin' onion.    Is it worth the trip?  Absolutely, but, because others think so, too, expect a small (or long wait) depending on when you visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner last night. We got there and where told it would be about 11minuites to be seated. It took 4. Our Waiter (Cameron) was there at the table very quickly. He got our drink order and my Wife ask if they had Prime Rib. Cameron said it was running short. He took our order and was back quickly. They where out of Medium Rare Primerib. He brought us menus again and we started over. In a few minutes he was back with a piece of the oven roasted Fillet. We sampled it and decided to go with that. Cameron was on top of the Ice Tea and service was amazing. The manager stopped by to check on things and I expressed how great Cameron was doing. The manager comped our desert and gave me his card. He said call ahead and they would save some Prime Rib in the future for us. This is the best experience I have ever had at any chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Just my favorite place for getting meat! Prime ribs, lamb chops are the best around the area!"}
{"text":"Two separate experiences: Food Quality good (for price) but service was slow. Next time the service was attentive but the food quality poor: leathery and VERY THIN filet mignonette steak (not like pictures!) and shrimp was salty and poor quality. Potato cake was a hit!   Managers make things right. Needs Proper staffing, better quality steaks and seafood. Our kiddo loved the chicken strips. Ok, I may be spoiled from all of the other mid-level steakhouses. I'm really pulling for you, Outback! Thanks for making the effort.  UPDATE: last experience was perfect (service,quality,prompt)."}
{"text":"Odd food experience with this place. I tend to avoid chains in general and follow the Yelp reviews but was out with my parents (who are in the senior citizen category of life, and they wanted to go because you got a free blooming onion when you ordered an entree (or maybe two, I don't know), and my mother had a coupon for $4 off when you order two entrees. So, we went, and not a fun eating experience, and here is why.  First, the blooming onion, and I realize it was free, was half cooked. About half of it was not edible. I haven't had one before but my mother noted that they were usually much better. I was like 'it's free, who cares?\" - but it was indicative of other events in the dining experience.  Second, parents wanted to split an  entree and salad and were specific on the salad (no croutons, extra cucumber), ended up getting a split salad with croutons and without the cucumber addition - the waiter came over and even noted that they seemed to have gotten the wrong salad (who knows, maybe someone else split a salad)? Then the entrees we ordered came out later than at least one other table, even though they had come in at least 10 to 15 minutes later. I had a steak salad and my parents split a cheeseburger so not sure why the orders ended up, well, out of order.  Finally, even though my parents had noted they were doing the blooming onion and the coupon, when the waiter (Brian) brought the bill, he said the manager would not allow my parents to do both the free blooming onion and the coupon for $4 off. Now, I understand the idea but my parents had been quite open in their intentions before ordering. I ended up speaking to the manager (Lorenzo), who initially said he could not put both in the system and I had to point out that my parents had openly noted they were doing both and that would have been the time to explain how things  work, not when the meal was over.  Okay, I don't want to paint a broad brush on Outback, I've eaten at other locations in the past and have been more than fine with the experience, and they look like, as others have pointed out, that they do make some great drinks. In addition, my steak salad was quite good. I would happily have it again. Hey, I'd even go back and eat at the bar. I'm just saying that this specific experience was not a good one. Who knows, I may find myself at the bar, having one of those interesting cocktails and end with a much better review."}
{"text":"Very good chain lunch spot, it's always easy to get in and out from this location for lunch.  The service has always been pretty good, very attentive to your meal and drinks.    Our server always made sure we had enough bread, probably brought 2-3 loafs for our party.  The steak was decent, nothing too crazy.  It's consistent.  Flavors are ok, but I still need some steak sauce on the side to accompany it usually.  But the the service and speed is what makes this place for the lunch rush."}
{"text":"There are some things we normally love about Outback.   We've been to quite a few Outbacks and there are some things we normally love about them.   Usually we visit for dinner and usually we order the ribeye.   We visited this Outback during lunch.  There were three of us.  We put in our appetizer order for the onion ring petals.  It was just an appetizer but we had a long wait for that appetizer.  Eventually a comment was made to the hostess that we were concerned since it'd already been a long wait that we'd be getting our lunch on top of the appetizer.  We didn't.  Eventually, the onion petals arrived.    The potato soup served at our table was delicious.  It was ordered by two in our party.  One was a bowl and one was a cup.  Besides that two of us ordered the 1/2 ribeye melt.  We had expected au jus with it I think because we thought it was a french dip type sandwich.   It wasn't but the waiter brought us au jus anyway.  The au jus was very watered down and very cool -- not good with little flavor.  The sandwich was tough and just not that good either.    Timing turned out okay.  Waiter was also okay but when he brought the ticket he tried to spark a conversation with us while we were involved in our own conversation.  First it was about our plans for the day and then our plans for Easter.  I thought he'd never leave to go back to the kitchen.  That was awkward and we didn't like it.  It just didn't sit right.   We noticed on our bill that he had deducted the onion petals.  We still weren't thrilled with this Outback and doubt we would return here."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Outback is the best place to come to get a good quality steak at a low price.    The service can be really spotty, but today we had the best I've ever had there!!!  Most of the reviews have complained about the service, but if you ask for Bobby you won't have that problem.  Each table gets a loaf of delicious bread and whipped butter to start the meal.  The bread is unlimited so ask for more if you run out.     I always order the exact same thing because it's always really good.  I get the 6oz sirloin medium rare, with a house salad, and broccoli.  I recommend getting the dressing on the side.  The salads are brought out before the meal and are always sooo yummy!  Outback publishes all of their nutritional content online, which is a plus for me.  Outback has curbside pickup, which I normally do.  They do a good job packaging the food and they even bring it out to your car.    As a tip, join the dine rewards program for coupons and on every fourth visit you get half off."}
{"text":"We were beyond disappointed.  This is a restaurant we frequent often. Tonight we came to celebrate a special occasion.  The Hostess was pleasant but unfortunately our Server was horrendous!  He walks up to the table,  my Boyfriend says \"hey man how are you doing? \" . The Server, didn't get his name, responds with one word \"tired\". He asked what we wanted to drink so we ordered a water with lemon and an iced tea with sweetner. He comes back moments later with a water,  no lemon and an iced tea,  no sweetner.  His demeanor was less than interested in helping us.  No smile,  no positivity,  he couldn't even get our drink order correct.  I must say my Boyfriend and I have been talking all week about how excited we were to come to Outback for our celebratory dinner.  We took over an hour getting ready.  Told our friends and family we were coming here. We needles to say left the restaurant disappointed,  hungry and feeling extremely undervalued as loyal customers."}
{"text":"We happened to be passing thru Concord decided to stop at Outback to eat dinner. The parking is horrible but finally found a space. The wait was only 15 minutes not bad.  We were seated and were served samples of cheesecake while waiting on our wait staff. When staff finally arrived, we were ready to complete our order. We ordered an ahi tuna regular size for the appetizer. We received it before we had our drinks, silverware, or app plates. The ahi tuna was wonderful after we received our silverware, app plates, and drinks. Two of us had 10 oz ribeyes, and one of us had 6 oz sirloin. 1/10 Oz was to be cooked rare, the second 10 oz was to be cooked medium, and the six ounce sirloin was to be medium well. The only temp that was right on the steaks was the rare. The sirloin was a cross between medium and well done. The 10 oz ribeye was midwell. We did not complain. But because of this I was only able to give them a three-star. It was not completely bad but considering the prices should have been better."}
{"text":"Went with two friends for appetizers after a movie.  Service was great.  Food was eh.  The Alice Springs chicken quesadilla was good but something I felt you could get anywhere.  Besides chicken and cheese, it had mushrooms and bacon with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  The Kookaburra wings not so good.  Dry.  The Blueberry martini was tasty but lacking in alcohol and I'm a lightweight these days when it comes to alcohol."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite to eat before the Holiday weekend, had a great time! My son and I enjoyed a nice meal together, with great service and good food. I ordered the pasta with chicken and it unfortunately was different from what I remember, so I am not sure if they changed their recipe or if my taste buds have changed. It was a little dry and not as flavorful and spicy as last time, but it was decent. My son of course had the chicken fingers and french fries, he was a happy camper! Their baked potato soup and bread is very good, I was told by my 5 yr old we have to go back every day just so he can eat the bread lol! Will definitely try some of the fan favorites next time and look forward to another interaction with the polite and smiling staff. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"First, on the location: Concord Mills is not necessarily my favorite place, but it seems I am there with some regularity. Usually it is to see a movie, and we tend to get there early on a weekend (often Saturday), as that's both when it's cheapest, and when there are the fewest crowds. Sneaking into the back, and then out again, you don't typically have to deal with many people. It's nice.  What does this have to do with the Outback? Well, nothing, really, but it means that I don't actually experience the mall itself, except to say that I don't like the place, because I know it can get packed, especially around the holidays. We even go so far as to avoid it. Knowing this, it means that seeing construction a while back meant it would be worse. I mean how do you make parking worse? Take some away, and that is what they did, with the Outback and the Bonefish.  Still, it's not so bad, really, if you park elsewhere and walk over to the appropriate exit (number 2, I think, no reference intended).  On the place itself: It's an Outback, of the newer variety. Very open and spacious, much like many other fast casual, and not dark and dingy like it used to be back in the day. Service is speedy and on this point it's a good place to grab a bite.  The menu hasn't changed a whole lot, though it has been updated a bit. You can get your steaks and your shrimp on the barbie and of course, your blooming onion. Oddly enough, they (along with most other locations) really have an issue with this. It's either perfect, or it's burnt to a crisp. I'm sure it's not simply, but it would be nice to see some consistency here."}
{"text":"Had this review been written thirty years ago, the rating may have been better. Then again, it might have been impressive indeed, being the the interwebs themselves didn't really exist in any appreciable form.  Nonetheless, Outback isn't what it once was - but are any of us? The good news is that you generally don't find the lines that used to congregate outside of the Outback. The bad news is that the inside hasn't changed much. Probably because most people have moved on from the shrimp on the barbie to the casual steakhouse concept (there are so many, I have to assume that is the problem).  On the plus side, the Outback isn't bad - it just isn't what it was. The setting is nice enough, and the food is nice enough. Service is even solid. But there are so many better choices that it isn't really worth the effort on most nights. Now Outback seems to realize this that you might be able to score a gift card or other coupon, and in that case, it might be worthwhile.  The bad part is that, as has been mentioned elsewhere, their portions are going down, while their competitors are increasing their portion sizes. that isn't good. Also the blooming onion has lost it's luster. It's oily and nasty. Maybe it always has been, but now we have moved on as well. The Outback needs to be out back. Near the dumpster."}
{"text":"I was on a short time frame due to an appointment,  and my waitress accommodated my needs, in a timely manner. I was very pleasantly surprised. The food was very well prepared, and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite steakhouse in Pgh!  My husband took me to dinner this afternoon. It was Mother's Day and the place was packed with lines of hungry, patient patrons in line way beyond the entrance. We chose to sit at the bar in order to avoid the wait.  My dinner was absolute perfection. I ordered the 6oz strip with garlic butter on top, the steamed broccoli and a baked sweet potato. My steak was melt-in-your mouth perfect.  The broccoli was tender and bursting with flavor. The sweet potato was also out of this world. Our waitress, Sharon L.  was extremely efficient. She had a great personality, checking on us often. Our service was prompt. We did not have to wait very long for anything. This was amazing because of how extremely busy it was today.  Awesome food, awesome service on probably the busiest day of the year!  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Jason  was awesome! The atmosphere was fun. We went on a Sunday so of course football was on."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as always but what made this a great dinner was the phenomenal customer service we received from Justin. He was upbeat and polite. He was on top of everything drinks, food, cleanup. Top notch service. He was so friendly I will requesting him again on our next visit."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and had a positive experience. We sat near the bar and had great service. We got the soup and salad combo. Salad was fresh and crispy. I got the clam chowder soup and it was really good. It was so good I got another bowl of it. My friend got the french onion soup and she really liked it. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We have always had a nice experience at this Outback Steakhouse and today was no different. The restaurant itself is clean and nicely maintained. The staff that works here is friendly and efficient. Our server today was not only friendly, but right on top of everything, keeping drinks refilled and checking in on us occasionally. Our food came out to the table exactly as ordered and in a reasonable amount of time. It was cooked well and everyone enjoyed their dish. It was a nice time!"}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant experience at this Outback, which frankly we've come to expect from any Outback.  They do a good job. Our party of five was immediately seated at 6:30 on a Saturday and our server was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and efficient.  He kept our drinks refilled without having to be asked or reminded and all orders came out perfectly. The food was really good and we always appreciate the variety on the Outback menu.  This particular restaurant was clean and well maintained. All in all, another positive experience and a great location."}
{"text":"We tried the click through seating and that seemed to work very well.  Our server was awesome and patient with our party of 7 and the need for two checks.  She was attentive and very efficient.  The food came out in a timely manner and all orders were correct.  Yahoo!  Great experience tonight, which I appreciated since we were celebrating a birthday."}
{"text":"I'm on a Outback kick.  I can't help it.  We ended up here one evening by chance and I love their steak and loaded mashed potato.  The service is good, the food is good, it's not too crowded.  Like I say, I'm on a kick."}
{"text":"I used the online ordering and Cameron was very knowledgeable and a Rock Star with his helpfulness. He pointed directions to the take out door and who the server would be tonight. Food terrific and timing on the order great. I appreciate all the help."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of Outback in the past, but lately I find myself dining here quite a bit. Perhaps they worked on in their menu more since, but I do find the food more flavorful now. This particular location on Stephanie has really good service and the food quality is consistent.  Our server tonight, Justin, was friendly and patient. I never felt rushed and enjoyed my dinner in a relaxed environment. The center cut sirloin was surprisingly juicy and tender. I prefer my steak medium rare and I think with this particular cut, it benefited by not being dried out. The green beans was buttery and the sweet potato was a fluffy orange cloud. I think they grill the sweet potato though because the outside skin looks like it has grilled marks. Tasty nonetheless. I opted not to have everything on it-meaning you could add brown sugar and butter on top, so I had it plain. Honestly, it was naturally sweet so I'm glad I didn't sugar it up. The 22 ounce rib eye is a really good choice too. I recommend getting the steaks Outback style, so they sear it in the flat top versus just wood grilled. I find it more flavorful and seals in the juices.  Served with a side of creamy horseradish sauce is a plus for me as the creamy style is not so strong. You have the option of raw horseradish sauce, but I'm not brave enough for that. The broccoli cheese is a premium side so there was a dollar up charge. It has a garlic butter sauce on it too which was tasty.   I've had the loaded potato soup there as well and I would get it again. Their famous onion blossom can be good, but is generally a tad too greasy for me. The ice cream dessert with a brownie in it was delicious and enough to share for two. Overall, I have had consistent service here  and the food has been pretty good. Sometimes things can change for the better. Glad I gave Outback another try."}
{"text":"We visit this location often with family as this is one of their favorite restaurants. Fortunately, the restaurant offers reservations, however, there's almost always a wait for the table. I'm not sure how efficient this system is as we've waited upwards of 30 minutes for a table WITH a reservation, but I suppose that's better than without one. This is typically the case during holidays like Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc. There are large waiting areas inside and outside, but as expected, they become very crowded on those really busy days.  Everyone in the family loves steak and that is the primary reason we love visiting Outback. Their steaks are fantastic and reasonably priced. I usually order the Bone-in Natural Ribeye (approx. 20-22oz.), medium rare. It's wood-fire grilled over oak and seasoned well. It's a really nice cut with decent marbling and it is ALWAYS cooked perfectly. For $29.49, it comes with a type of potato and side; I like their Loaded Baked Potato or Aussie Fries and Steamed Broccoli.  For Starters, I really like their Bloomin' Onion (of course) and Gold Coast Coconut Shrimp. We've also tried a few of their other dishes like the Steakhouse Philly, Perfectly Grilled Salmon, Steakhouse Mac and Cheese, and Blue Cheese Wedge Salad. Everything is decent, though I did not like the salmon; it was terribly dry and unpleasant enough to not finish. Since the food doesn't always seem to fare, we stick to the steaks now. I am always very satisfied with my Bone-in Ribeye!

{"text":"I'm not usually one to review the chains, but this Outback is so far off the norm, I feel obligated to warn others. Run! Hide! You have tastier options!  While the servers here are pleasant and quick, the kitchen is not so efficient, and the managers seem to back up their cooks instead of listening to customers. Here are my three experiences:  Visit one. Ordered the mahi mahi, which appeared thick and succulent on menu photo. Received thin, dry piece that smelled of ammonia and rot. Sent it back, manager told me she was sorry I didn't like the fish. It's not that I didn't like it, it was BAD.   Visit two. Hubby ordered the coconut shrimp, his longtime fave at Outbacks throughout the country. Lo, these lived up to the name, shrimp. They were half the size they were elsewhere. Entree was fine. Ordered a salad, baked potato, and steamed broccoli, because I am a wild hog. Had to ask for broccoli several times before it came out, cold. Ate it anyway.   Visit three. Coconut shrimp again, and these looked bigger! Yay! Boo. Same tiny shrimp, bigger breading. Boo hiss.  Ordered a rare NY strip, with salad, baked potato, and broccoli. Received a medium steak, with salad and potato. No broccoli. Waiter came to check and knew before I told him that steak was overcooked. Offered to let me keep potato, but then he would've had to carry steak in his hands. Or teeth. Reminded him about broccoli.   Manager returned with new steak, rare, but so tough and filled with gristle, I was stunned. Broccoli, hot. Yum. Tater, hot. Yum, until I discovered a huge rotted spot inside. When he came back to check on the replacement dinner, I showed him how hard the steak was to cut, but said I would eat it anyway...my husband was already done with his dinner. Showed him the potato, and he said it was just a piece of skin.   Um, no. This girl knows rotten when she sees it. He gave in and brought me a new potato, but seemed clearly miffed that I was so picky.   I am not a whiner, really. But when things are rotten, or are not properly cooked, I do send them back. At this Outback, the managers seemed irked with customers who exercise that right. Sad, really, because it is just as easy to exercise my right to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good chain and easy if u want a quick meal.   This location has good parking and good service. Overall good experience"}
{"text":"Best prime rib in town!!! Amazing service. I've been coming here for years - since they were located on Sunset - and I've never been disappointed. You might want to come a little early on Friday and Saturday nights... they REALLY get slammed, but it's worth it since their food is amazing. I'm usually not a big fan of chain restaurants, but this is a total exception. I'd give it six stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Actually a very good place to eat. Steak was perfect.  Mash potato was the shit... No lie I can probably survive off of it. Will eat here again.  Kind of expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"the food was standard, nothing special,  went for lunch,  Server was very lacking , did not introduce self, never checked back regarding meal, did not clean up dishes or refill drinks in a timely manner.  Probably will not go to this location again."}
{"text":"What a great place!  We placed a reservation online. They called to confirm and told me how excited they were to see us. After a great meal we had a small setback.  Our sons car wouldn't start. Several servers offered to let us use their jumper cables and get him working.  It didn't start and while working out a solution another staff member offered to call AAA to have my sons car towed. Then after delays she even stayed until after midnight to make sure we were taken care of.  I love this place!  Their whole staff just made my family feel welcomed and cared for. Heather was our super hero!  She deserves a promotion and pay raise. It's people like her that help any business grow!"}
{"text":"I must say after this bad review we have been back to Outback and they have been super kind and welcoming of our kids and us. The food is consistently delicious and we even signed up their reward points. It is one of our favorites"}
{"text":"Called for a $100 takeaway order and was told if I couldn't be there 15 minutes prior to closing that they could not accommodate me. Really??? I work in a customer service environment and work late every night to take care of our customers. I'm so infuriated by this \"kid\" telling me I need to be there 15 minutes before they close because she wants to go home. Guess what? You are not the only steak house around and will never see another dollar of my hard earned money on your overpriced menu. Looking forward to ordering from  Longhorn restaurant in Fairview.  Ps. did call the mgr who said his employee was incorrect but offered no solution.  My employer would definitely have addressed a review of this nature and take action. Pss. My daughter works at a different location for you and I'm embarrassed for you and her while you paid her $2.85 per hour to work the takeaway window  go back to Australia"}
{"text":"Service is always special.  Only had one less than stellar experience, but my server was just having a bad day.  I don't take any stars away for service.  Only gripe is that sometimes, the steak quality is not consistent.  For example, at times the sirloin is stupendous and at other times, it is like chewing rubber and sinew."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Outback, but this location falls a little short. I ALWAYS sit at the bar because I'm on a business trip and I'm eating alone.  The bartenders here are not as attentive or professional as they could be.  Another thing about the bar here: No matter where I sit (at the bar), I can smell the cleaning solution in the glass-washing sink.  I don't want to smell cleaning fluids while I'm eating. The food is consistent with Outback standards - always pretty tasty. Overall - just OK."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our salads were not fresh so we send them back. Our steak was not the way we asked for it so it also went back. The manager came and made good on the deal by giving us a new steak and replacing our salad with fresh veggies. She also asked us to come back and give them another try. Although things were not perfect the first time they definitely made up for it with great customer service."}
{"text":"We were greeted and directed to our table. Our waiter was awesome. He began by apologizing for keeping us waiting a whole 5 minutes. My steak was under cooked. He took it back and the 2nd time it was perfect. I sincerely appreciate great customer service and that is exactly what we received tonight."}
{"text":"Damn fine NY Strip. Cooked to perfection, and great service too.  Fast, reasonably priced, and delicious. This is what I'm looking for in a steakhouse."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We went here around 5pm on a Monday evening. Walked in, told the host we at 4 people. She hands us a pager and tells us it'll be a few minutes meanwhile there's tables everywhere empty, only a couple other groups of people in the restaurant. We wait close to 20 minutes before the host comes and gets us.  Then we get to our table and we get greeted right away. After that it was just downhill. We ordered an appetizer, but they didn't give us silverware so we couldn't eat it. When we asked for silverware, the server said it was being rolled and when it was done we would have some. Meanwhile we stare at our appetizer for 15 minutes before being able to eat it. After that we ordered our food. 2 of us got chicken, and it was hard and cold. The other 2 got steak. Our entrees came out with nothing else on the plate, just the chicken or steak. We had to ask for the veggies that were supposed to come with it, and anything else we had ordered. Overall, this was a horrible experience and we will not be returning. We can get steak and people who actually want our business down the road."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Outback with the hope of getting a good steak dinner. She order the bone in rib-eye and I got the boneless rib-eye. Her's had good marbling and flavor, mine did not. I kept cutting slice after slice expecting to find some flavor and never found it. The only flavor came from the rub and the Marinade. If this was actually a rib-eye steak, it was the lowest quality I've ever had. Most likely, it wasn't even that. For $26 I would think they could have found a better quality than this. I've had better steaks at village inn!"}
{"text":"It had been a long while since we'd been to Outback so one weeknight recently craving steaks we returned.  The menu has changed (evolved?) since I was last there, more choices with steaks seasonings, expanded menu offerings, etc.  Frankly it was just confusing to me.  I just want the old Outback steak thank you.  Ordered the 8oz sirlion & shrimp w/ the famous house salad and grilled asparagus (new item) for sides.  Well, the steak was pretty good and cooked as requested .  The 3 little shrimp were somewhat bland and did not excite, salad was skimpy from what I recalled from the past, and the grilled asparagus was Ewwwwh.  Asparagus looked like it had been waiting for my order and then reheated or regrilled.  Did I mention that our waiter assured me this was a very popular item receiving many rave reviews?? - oh, and I got to pay $1 upcharge for this little vegetable gem.  Tough stalks and had a smoky taste that didn't work either - I was NOT impressed.  Crazy perhaps that I am ranting about a vegetable but I was really looking forward to this item and Outback really blew it.  Service was mostly efficient although the waiter bordered on being hovering and too familiar.  Out of my face please I am trying to eat here.    Overall I have to say this was a disappointing experience.  Outback is not cheap by any means.  There are plenty of other better places to go for steak.  Outback would do well to return to what made them famous in the first place (it's the food, stupid).  Based on this experience, it will be a long while before I decide to go back to Outback."}
{"text":"Crab and avocado was terrible. .. the avocado was brown. I ordered the filet medallions they were overcooked. Our server was unfriendly, took forever to refill drinks and never brought my side of ranch. We also got there at 915, they dont close until 1030 and felt very rushed to leave at 10 o'clock. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Went here with the hubby and normally we enjoy this place..but something changed. The food was not very good at all. I had the ribs..they lacked flavor and sauce. Hubby had the sirloin and it was stringy and blah..his words. The blooming onion was good but thats it. We wont be coming to Outback again.."}
{"text":"Introduction: We eat at Outback Steakhouse every Wednesday back in California.  We're thinking, I don't know, everything is so good here in Las Vegas, we don't need Outback. Let's be adventurous, however, I forgot about my Wednesday specials.  Got a friendly reminder email last night, so here we are. In case you're wondering, yes, we are  super glad we dropped by.  Customer: 5/5 Our server Mikaela, \"WOW\" talking about an amazing WOW service. Honestly, we've had great experiences, but Mikaela is in a whole different category.   I even heard our neighbor bragged about how amazing Mikaela's service was.  Clearly, this girl needs a raise.  You can totally see that she's an asset to both, Organization and the restaurant. I hope the General Manager holds on to this one. Good employees come and go. Great employees can happen when trained properly. Now brilliant employees like Mikaela, they only come once in awhile.   Quality: 5/5 Everything is so delicious, for some reasons, way better than the ones in California. Like I said, I am in big trouble, gaining weight is my concern, in case you're wondering what trouble I'm concerning about.  The steaks, onion pedals, desserts, strawberry lemonade, even the grilled onions were perfectly grilled.   Cleanliness: 5/5 Very clean and organized.  Price: 5/5 Great, especially Wednesday's, great promos.   Tips: They were super busy, so avoid during dinner hours. If you are from California, you may be use to a $9.99 special, in Las Vegas, it's $10.99, still worth it.  Even though the Ad states comes with Fries, you can substitute for a different side. Freakin generous.  See you next Wednesday Outback Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Outback has recently seen some changes to their menu but one thing that has not changed is the smell of the outside of this restaurant. Ever since high school, walking up to this restaurant it smells putrid. I don't know if it is one of the restaurants beside them that is the problem but I suggest that you park as close to the entrance as humanly possible in order to avoid the smell of the outside of the building. I prefer Texas Roadhouse to Outback but unfortunately some other members of my family prefer Outback so we take turns picking."}
{"text":"Went with a group of guys from work and had a great time. The food was good, and the service was as well."}
{"text":"Every time we go to this location the servers and staff are friendly, even the managers walk around asking how everything is. The food is always fantastic! We LOVE our prime rib and they always have delicious cuts, perfectly seasoned and cooked. The sides are wonderful too!! We'll continue to go here for our steak fix. MMMMMM!"}
{"text":"Pretty run on the mill outback. It is a chain so table turning is to be expected to an extent. We came at 6 on a Sunday night and the wait was fairly long. We went to the bar and easily found 2 empty seats. I think bar service is better at this location so it was no problem sitting there (and bonus no wait time!!) Food is decent. Ahi tuna is the best starter they have hands down. This is your right down the middle average restaurant. If I had the choice id go elsewhere, but overall not terrible."}
{"text":"Just love their steak. Always cooked just right, and love the seasonings. The Rib Eye is marbled just right, add that to a Cesare salad and their baked potato and you're home free. The better half had the Tilapia with lump crab, and just loved it. The Skinny Rita margarita is tasty, but the entire drink menu had expanded, as well as the beer selection. We didn't call ahead, but it appeared the new call ahead seating is well received."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. You get a whole lot of food in addition to your steak entree. Much cheaper alternative than an upscale al a carte steak place."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. Combined with the usual Outback mediocre food, this made for a very unpleasant evening. The server was careless and slow (despite not being busy at all). Additionally, We've waited for the check (after giving out a credit card) for 35 minutes. When we complained about the wait she became rude and short. We have asked for the manager who never showed up. We will NEVER go back to this location and will find other choices for this chain altogether when we have the chance. Very disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"Had a service problem at this site last Saturday.   Spoke with store manager on sunday, he assured me he would be sending out some gift cards on monday because of the problems,  of course I have yet to receive them.  The manager NEVER sent them out yet.  Not surprised, now I see why there are customer service issues at that site"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and will never come back. The last visit the entire meal took 2 1/2 hrs, so much so I asked for the breakfast menu, Horrible service but food was just ok."}
{"text":"The steak was cooked awesome! Shrimp over cooked and the bread stale-ish. Our drinks were a tad watered down but our service was excellent."}
{"text":"My steak was good her 6 ounce was burnt. Sent back 25 minutes later it came back under cooked. Potatoes were not done and bread tasted stale. Manager oppoligized and took her dinner off and gave me 20 dollars for next time. So I'm ok with that. We've been there many times and this was the worst"}
{"text":"Ok I admit it.  I didn't want to go here.  The only reason I went was because we had a $50 gift card burning a hole in my pocket.  That said, I was pleasantly surprised.  Blooming onion was good, or so I am told.  I don't eat deep fried onion.  Each of us had different entries and everyone nearly licked their plates.  Now this was after a long day of riding but still that says alot.  I had a pork chop with vegies (instead of potatoes) and it was very good.  The wine list isn't large but I found one I liked.  The Captain's Mai Tai is delish if you throw the Captain overboard.  Skipped dessert so can't address that but everyone at the table was happy."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my family on our way back home from wis dells. The server was really nice. Only positive thing for this place! But the food? The most important part?  Meh. My dad got the ribeye steak with veggies and mashed potato. The steak was meh...I can make better steak at home to be honest and the veggies were underdone. Too tough especially the carrot. Mashed potato was just okay too. Overall it was overpriced for what it was. My mom got the springs chicken? It was decent. I got the double burger. The onion in the burger wasn't peeled completely I had to dig out the peel before eating. If I'm paying 12$ for a burger and fries I expect it to at least not have onion peel in it. I always go to neighborhood fastfood place for burgers at home and I pay less than $10 for the same thing. It tastes better and no onion peel.  My brother got a mac and cheese and ice cream from the children's menu. It was good according to him. So I guess it's the only good food from this place. Overall I'm disappointed. It was my first experience at outback steakhouse and I don't think I will be back unless I'm starving and there's no food nearby."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here today and the service was absolutely terrible. They were not busy yet we had to wait for a long time for the food and for refills. We had to get the managers attention to get our check. Food was good but it felt like the d team was working today."}
{"text":"Had lunch here after getting back from CA. Me and my mom were starving so she had the chicken salad and I had the crab cakes. Horrible. I use to love Outback but the chicken was so dry, my mom had to drench her salad in dressing. My crab cakes were so disgusting, I couldn't finish. They didn't even give me lemon, they were just too dry. The last few times I've been so disappointed with the quality of food, my waiter was very nice about it though because I think he knew I hated my lunch"}
{"text":"Man, the quality of Outback has really gone down since the last time I came here. I hope it was just an off night, but everything seemed to go wrong.  The menu was wrong on several occasions. My husband ordered the Sam Adams on draft. Says it should be a Boston Lager, but the Summer Ale came out. Apparently they were out of Boston Lager on tap but the server didn't tell us and didn't offer anything else. The chicken artichoke flatbread was delicious, but the menu says a \"sprinkling of parmesan cheese\". The thing was heavily covered in it. I would have asked for light cheese if I'd known it was more like a cheese crisp. I ordered the steak salad medium, it came out medium rare. Also, it didn't say that gorgonzola cheese crumbles came on it, otherwise I would have asked for those to be left off. So unfortunately I had to send it back. The manager was very polite and took the flatbread off our bill, but when he tried to explain that they were out of the Boston Lager beer and that's why we got the Summer Ale, I was a little annoyed. Okay that's fine, it would have just been nice to know that in the beginning. Don't give me excuses. All in all it was a very mediocre service and just not as good as I remember."}
{"text":"I used to really like Outback in NJ but I'm in NC now. I ordered 18.99 10oz ribeye medium. Haven't they figured out how to cook a steak by now? It was dry and well done plus it was small for the price.  My dad ordered a sirloin and it was so well done it was difficult to cut. I am afraid to send food back to the kitchen ever see the movie Waiting? I denied the managers offer to send it back. Disappointing. Will never return. Sad too I used to love Outback. I guess the CEO who makes a million dollars would rather put it in his pocket than pay for a decent chef. It's a real shame."}
{"text":"Great place for a tasty steak, baked potato and Caesar salad.  The wait staff were \"Johnny on the spot\". Kept the ice tea coming.  Will certainly go back in the near future when I am craving some red meat.  Thanks Outback!"}
{"text":"I like supporting local businesses, but sometimes I just want a cheap and delicious corporate steak.  Of the family-style chains in town, Outback Steakhouse is probably my favorite.  I'm a big fan of the $10 6-oz. steak meal, which is the right portion for me.  Ironically, the dish I love the most here is one of their specialty side salads (the one with candied pecans and bleu cheese).  Below, I've detailed some complaints, but these problems are rare incidents.  I'm usually very satisfied with my visits.  While I've mostly had good steaks here, the quality of cooking kind of varies (especially on busy nights).  For example, on a crowded Saturday night, my friends and I all got our steaks cooked to different degrees, though everyone ordered their meat medium-rare. Lesson:  avoid popular nights and go for quieter weekdays, if you can.    Before our meals arrive, my friends always want to share a Blooming Onion, Outback's delightfully salty snack that has proven deadly to one's cardiac health (no, seriously, there are always news stories about America's fatal attraction to the Blooming Onion).  Because of its popularity, the cooks usually keep an onion in the fryer (especially during dinner rush hour), so sometimes we get it within 30 seconds of placing our order.  Most of the onion is tasty, but 50% of the time, we receive an onion that is still partially raw...no fun.  On one occasion, my friends and I ordered a few alcoholic beverages.  I bought a peach-flavored cocktail and my friends all got 22-oz. beers (Sam Adams, I believe).  I openly admit that I am a lightweight (I usually get drunk off a 16-oz. beer), but I felt nothing from my cocktail, even on an empty stomach.  While I can understand the low alcoholic content of my girly drink, none of my friends got even slightly buzzed off their sizable beers.  Weird...and kind of unfortunate considering the $5 price on most drinks."}

{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and had the best waiter. His name was KC. He was a blast. If you go to this location, definitely ask for his section."}
{"text":"I've been back to this location a few times since my last review, and I am happy to say I have had excellent experiences since then. I have been happy with the service, food, and ambiance each time.  The most notable change for me has been the service. Everyone is so pleasant and helpful. Entree times don't overlap the apps and salads, drinks are refilled anytime one gets down to hallway, and there is never a shortage of pumpernickel bread.  The food has been consistent and good. Any time I need a good wood-fire grilled steak or pork chop with some shrimp or a lobster tail to accompany them, I know I can rely on this Outback.  I've got an early schedule most days so dinner comes earlier. There is always the occasional 10-20 min wait time, which I expected each time I get there a little later in the evenings. So it's always best to get here early. Even if you can't get in early, the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Outback Steakhouse I have been to in Las Vegas. My GF can eat at this establishment every night, that's how much she likes it. We started off with our usual Outback apps Seared Tuna, Coconut Shrimp, and Spinach/ Artichoke dip. All three were excellent. I really like that the Artichoke dip came out with these little Crustinis instead of Chips. I wasn't expecting to like some thing as cliche as Spinach/ Artichoke dip but surprisingly it was really good. Nice and creamy with healthy chunks of Artichoke in every bite. I liked the seared Tuna app so much I decided to order the seared Ahi Tuna entree and a side of grilled Scallops. The Tuna and the Scallops were cooked just right and the flavors were excellent too. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sorry this took so long Outback.  Our last visit went much better than our previous visits.  The server was very attentive and the appetizers were great.  The appetizers were so good that they overshadowed the main courses.  Appetizer night next time.  Anyways, a star bump up for the great service."}
{"text":"My family and I went to have dinner at outback steak house. It was my moms birthday  the service and our server was great. I even had one of my anniversary's there  we had the best time. My favorite is the filet mignon & loster tail.  Thank you"}
{"text":"So disappointed ! I have been coming here since 2006. Tonight I got the 1/2 rack ribs and chicken breast. I ordered a loaded baked potato . The potato was cold. The cheese never melted. I was given a 2nd one, same thing. Quality has been slipping for a while now. Guess I will be going to Longhorn Steakhouse in the future !  I have not seen the Manager in here for over a year !  Tonight I only see 2 employees that I know."}
{"text":"Dinner with the family is always a blast. Went to celebrate my aunts Birthday and the staff was super friendly from the moment we walked in and waited to be seated. Our waitress Ebony was really sweet and attentive, she checked on us regularly to make sure drinks were full or if anyone needed anything. Bread was fresh! Prices were reasonable. Steaks were perfectly pink! And the atmosphere was clean and comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised in Surprise"}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow, our drinks  weren't getting refilled promptly, the appetizer and salad plates were left on our table until the main course showed up, and then we still had to ask several different staff to bring the same item to our table. Wish we had picked some place else to eat dinner. The food itself was ok, I guess.   NOTE This was our second attempt to let Outback redeem themselves and once again they have failed. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Gone down hill from their glory days you won't need to wait long to get a table anymore. I don't think the filet is a tenderloin I think it is a filet imposter. Way too tough. This chain needs new life and updating the menu"}
{"text":"i have dined at this outback at least 6 times and this was my last. I know they are fairly new, but they really need to get their act together. If you are a dine rewards member the wait staff forgets to add you rewards. This has happened 3 times. The food normally is not cooked as ordered and the wait time is excessive. This outback is five minutes away, but I will drive to the Charlotte or Huntersville locations in the future. I feel the decor is dark and dreary unlike the other locations."}
{"text":"Hubby was hungry for steak, so we came here since it is above the hotel where we stayed.  We were seated after about a 20 minute wait.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  I had the prime rib which although good, was a little lacking in flavor.  I also had garlic mashed potatoes which was good but could use more garlic.  Hubby had a ribeye steak which he said was juicy and delicious and a baked potato which he also enjoyed.  Dinner also came with some big salads and delicious bread.  We had a lovely dinner experience here and would not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Went to checkout newly renovated restaurant. As usually everything was great,they have it down to a science cooking steak. Had a 20 percent off coupon that we forgot to give server. Realized on the way out. Went back in to see if they would take it. Manager on duty Sun 6/5 said no problem. We greatly appreciated it!"}
{"text":"Raw chicken Wings. Love when a employee tells me new kitchen staff. Manger tells me it was the lighting.  Pink & Rubberry Chicken has nothing to do with lighting. If we end up in hospital."}
{"text":"Had a lunch with my friends and family.   The dish is tasty and the price is a little bit expensive, but okay.  I like the steak but I tried the lamb this time. Not as good as I thought. Should stick to the steak. Their special steak is pretty good with the lobster and mushroom toppings."}
{"text":"Ariival, met by a sloth of a hostess, crumbs on floor infront of hostess stand, food score 93. Wait was 15 minutes or so, plenty of seating inside at 5:00 pm Seated-handed three diferent menu types, a little much to look at. Waitres did not have a smile, can't blame her. I order sirloin and grilled prawns. Steak was +A, I only got four prawns and they where puny. My son got a fillet which was good, but his bottom less prawns was so slow to refill that we had dessert before he could get a third helping.  My wife asked for an end cut prime rib and the cook substituted a seared prime rib enstead without telling her. They took it back and cleared it off the check. Over all, this was the woorst birthday meal in quit a while. So, blaEah, I wont be back for another decade."}
{"text":"I came here just before Christmas with family members from out of town. Great server who got our food out quickly. Excellent Alice Springs Chicken and Blooming Onions as always. The dessert options are excellent, especially since you can get a free one on your birthday that will feed the whole table."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service not so good. My husband ask for A1 when they brought his steak. Lady said I will be right back. Never came. Our waiter finally checked on us....told him about the A1. He said I will go get it now. Said I was busy that's why I haven't checked in. Husband told him forget the A1 I'm done now. Again said I'm sorry I just got busy. Manager came over and said first lady didn't hear you. Lie. She said I will be right back with it.   Side note.....ppl beside us loud and drunk.  Food good. Service lousy. Try a different Outback."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE OUTBACK!   Being from Canada, I always get super excited when visiting the Outback. The all you can eat bread is literally my favourite. The service I had tonight was outstanding. Our waiter TJ was very diligent and super outgoing. Our drinks were always full, the service was fast, and fresh. The couple sitting next to us were extremely happy about the service too, as we overheard them talking about how excellent the food and TJ was.  We started off with the bread (obviously), and ordered about ten more loafs after that... (It's an addiction, I know). We also had the blooming onion, which never disappoints! For the main entree I ordered the filet mignon & lobster. I've gotta say.. the lobster was the best I've had in YEARS. I am very pleased with the fast and friendly service and I look forward to coming back soon! We weren't looking to spend as much as we did but it was damn well worth it. :)"}
{"text":"I don't think anyone expects Outback Steakhouse to be comparable to real steakhouses - the food is generally overpriced, and the decor tries to basically be a fancier Applebees or Chili's. This location has a nice ambience and good decor - it does certainly seem like you're eating at an upscale steakhouse.   However, their steaks simply fall flat. It's really not TERRIBLE - the 6 ounce tenderloin is $13 and it's okay steak. The aussie fries are actually quite delicious, and the caesar salad side I got was pretty good too. I would love to give this a smack dab 2.5 average rating, but I boosted it to a 3 (maybe even a 3.5?) for the exceptional service we got.  They have a $8.99 unlimited shrimp (which is actually a FANTASTIC deal) thing going on right now, and it's delicious! It's literally unlimited shrimp - you can choose crispy (popcorn shrimp) or grilled (garlic herb shrimp) and they're both pretty darn good. I mean, for the fact that it's unlimited and fairly priced. Don't expect amazing shrimp, though, it's just really cool that it's unlimited!  Overall, Outback Steakhouse is not a place I would want to go to if I'm trying to find good steak, but it's really not a bad place if no one can make up their mind on where to go for some \"fancy\" food. I would give it a 3.5 star review if I could, but it certainly doesn't deserve 4 stars."}
{"text":"Outback's tagline should be: because sometimes you don't want to drop $100 on yourself for a steak dinner.  It's an Outback, you know the drill. They'll bring you warm bread to start your meal. I'll eat too much of it and then be full before my meal comes. I pretty much get the same thing here every time: blue cheese wedge,  medium rare ribeye, and a loaded baked potato. It always ends up being two meals for me. Again, the bread. Carbs, I love you.   For a chain, I think they do a good job with their product, especially considering the price point. I've always had great service at this location.   Don't feel like eating in public? You can order online and pickup curbside. They also do have a delivery option, check on their website to see if you're in their radius. You can also get special deals and offers by signing up for their rewards program."}
{"text":"One of the best cooked steaks I've ever tried! The meat is tender and fill of flavor! No wait in this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been to Outback several times. I was impressed that the GM Cindy had time to stop by and ask how everything was. The food and service was excellent. The fact that she took time out of her busy day was a big impression for me.   I will be back.  Tom"}
{"text":"I am posting this review because this location has repeatedly left out part of my order when doing take-out. I have had many instances at this location where they do not include all if my order in the bag.   I have called, spoken with management, and pointed this out on several occasions and they continue this practice.   Please be warned if you value getting what you pay for and appreciate a server delivering to you the meal you want and how you want it you will be disappointed at this outback."}
{"text":"Just had a meal a this outback steakhouse in Henderson 3 ed time same meal I loved 6oz steak with  shrimp your way with two sides and asked for the dinner menu. Just like every other Outback in town a 6 oz steak turned in to a 1 oz with the worse taste and the shrimp to cocktail shrimp with a bake potatoe not even done. I not sure if I well return another one bites the dust!!!!!"}
{"text":"My 2 sisters, son, & I were in the area running errands back in December 2015. My sister Debbie was craving some coconut cream pie, so we headed to Marie Callender's orig. But they were closed for renovations. Darn. It was around 4:30...so we decided to make it an early dinner & headed to Outback Steakhouse. Everyone likes Outback, right?  It was early enough that it wasn't too busy yet. So we were seated promptly in a booth. They had a combo meal thing w/so many courses...soup / salad + entree & dessert. The four of us all ordered it. But I had to be the lone wolf & order a different salad than everyone else...some kind of nut & berry salad? Why oh why do I do this stuff to myself?!   As I've stated in previous reviews for other places...I've been in the F & B biz for too many years to count! So I know what goes on in food & bev prep. Plus I'm strangely addicted to Tricia Kean's \"Dirty Dining\" segments on KTNV. Sooo...going out to eat ANYWHERE...can sometimes be a challenge for me. But Outback has always been solid. Good food / service. Plus I also  worked @ an Outback for like a week a million years ago)...and I know what sticklers they are for cleanliness & fresh food. Or at least how they used to be...  Service was good. Our apps were tasty. The four of us were laughing & drinking & gnoshing on our goodies. Salads came. Everyone dug in. Yum Yum. & then...I thought I saw little green legs in MY SALAD! I said a silent prayer that I wasn't seeing A BUG...but after a few turns of my fork...I REALIZED WHAT I WAS SEEING WAS INDEED A BUG! Tossed right there in my salad. Ugh! Just then our steak entrees were delivered by someone else. I whispered to my sister to the left of me in our booth what I had discovered. I was honestly not sure what to do...  My son wanted my leftover salad! The dining room had filled up considerably since our arrival. Again, I'm in the biz. Not the type to make a scene. But my enjoyment in the meal was completely gone. I should let it be known that the bug was the kind you see in gardens / on vegetables. Not a roach or anything like that. But clearly their prep is slipping or maybe the salad wasn't washed at all?   I informed our server as quietly as possible. She was horrified, naturally. Told my son there was mushrooms in the salad (because he hates mushrooms) to keep him from wanting my leftover salad. The manager came over to apologize & inform me they'd be taking my meal off the bill. All nice. Sh*t happens. & I didn't want to ruin anyone else's enjoyment. My sister Cheryl said she was fine staying. I managed to choke down a bite or two of my steak. But it was hard. All I kept thinking about was how I could have eaten that bug! Thank goodness for contact lenses & immune systems! lol...  We still tipped the server 20%+, but like usu I didn't do the after your meal survey. I'm not even 100% sure if they gave me one? Lol.   Again, I've been going to OS's for nearly 15 yrs. Always solid. This was just one bad experience after many, many enjoyable ones. At different locations. I'm reminded of a sign that's posted at my current place of employment....\"It can take years to earn a customers loyalty, but only seconds to lose it\". That's kind of how I feel about Outback Steakhouse now....or maybe just this particular Outback? I just know it used to be one of our immed go-to's. Now I shy away from it & we deliberately drive to some place else to have a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Food was below par. Waiter never came back by to get one refill for my wife's drink. Beef was over cooked.  Very slow and way over priced for what we received.  Will not be making this mistake again"}
{"text":"I came in for my birthday dinner. I haven't eaten at an Outback in a while and was craving the Ahi Tuna.  Sam took great care of me and even suggested a great wine to enjoy with my meal. Kerri, the manager, came by with cheesecake for my birthday dessert. I truly felt welcomed and special on my day! Thank you for the incredible experience!"}
{"text":"Above average location. Staff was friendly and attentive, food was solid and cooked as ordered. No wait when we arrived. Their 4 for $15 menu is great! Soup, Salad, Entree and dessert all for fifteen bucks is a DEAL! :O)"}
{"text":"Awesome french onion soup and ahi very warm service we would come back again and bring our friends and recommend to others"}
{"text":"I was jonesing for a steak, so I thought I give Outback a try.  I have been here a few times before for ribs and the food was good.  This time very disappointed. I ordered the  9 oz. Filet medium well.  I normally order Medium on steaks, but I went by their Doneness chart and medium looked too rare.  Well the filet came out Well done.  Completely brown not a hint of pink.  They apologized and had another steak prepared for me.  The second one was medium well +.  For a filet it was extremely thin.  Only 3/4\" thick.  I measured it.  Looking at the pictures others have posted and thinking I did not get the expensive filet, but rather sirloin or something.  The baked potato was dry.  The staff was great.  I like the place but would not go there again for a steak."}
{"text":"New location!!!  Came here around 9:45pm. Had the half order of ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and it was so good. The service was wonderful, ask for Lindsey B!!! She's a great waitress! My hubby had the Alice Springs chicken with fries and my sister had the ribeye steak that was great.   I'm coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Outbacks before but this one was awful. The whole place smelled like sewage which is obviously unappetizing. If I wasn't with friends I would have left when I first smelled it. So I stuck it out. The French onion soup was ok. My boyfriend ordered a burger and the fries were cold and stale. The burger wasn't the best either. He said it tasted thrown together, like the flavors weren't cohesive.   The service was mediocre. She dropped my spoon on the floor and took her time bringing me a new one. The same thing happened when my friend finished her drink. The waitress was nowhere to be found. Not one of my friends finished their food and I was so grossed out by the smell, I couldn't even finish my soup. In hindsight, I would have rather waited the 2 hours it would have taken for us to get a table at Melt."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times thinking the slow service and bad food have been a fluke. Unfortunately nothing seems to go well when we visit. Average wait time for a meal is 60 minutes. Steaks are never cooked correctly ( this is a \"steak place\" so this is expected), there is hair in the food etc. Such a bummer. Never had any issues at any other location."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken on the barbie and a margarita. The margarita had enough alcohol so that I could taste it, but wasn't too powerful to the point where it tasted like straight tequila. The chicken was great. The service was great too. Everything came out of the kitchen quickly. I'll be returning frequently."}
{"text":"Just to preface this, I'm typically a huge Outback fan. I've been going to one of their other locations for years, in particular Bell Road but last Friday was a first and last for me at the Mayo location. Yuck!!    Where to begin? So a former colleague and I, who no longer work in the same place, decided to dine here for lunch last Friday. I had never tried this spot, much less for lunch, so I figured it would be a great place to guinea pig for future outings, since we both still work in the area. What a mistake!   What happened? Saturday I came down with a horrific cold. I was practically bed-ridden for the first day and can't even remember the last time I had been so sick. By sheer coincidence, my former colleague ALSO took ill over the weekend, at the same time, with the same symptoms. The only thing we had in common was that we ate lunch at this restaurant the day before and there's no way that we both got sick with the same thing, at the same time, by pure chance, especially since we don't even work together anymore.  My suspicion? Someone working in the kitchen was sick with the same thing and, though they had no business working, they did so anyways and got two of their customers horribly sick. I suffered like a dog and it ruined my entire weekend, all because I trusted this place with my health. What a joke.  And no, the server and the manager were not sickly, and we were the first people to sit at our table after the restaurant opened for lunch, so I'm going to stick to my guns that it was someone who prepared our food. It's just absolutely disgusting that management would let a sicko work the kitchen and infect their customers with a really nasty strain of of the cold or flu or whatever the hell it was they passed on to us both. I am never, ever, setting foot in this location again. No excuse for it, absolutely disgusting. Avoid like the plague, literally!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since my original review, and I think an update is probably called for, especially based on last night's dining experience. I really hate to give them a poor review, but having eaten here on a more or less weekly basis for quite some time, it's hard not to notice a trend.   As far as service, that's probably the one element that has remained mostly consistent, but it's not without some occasional blips. The unfortunate thing is that, as of late anyway, these blips have becoming more frequent. Nothing dramatic, mostly just the inability to keep a drink refilled, or having to spend too long sitting at a table before a server shows up to take our drink and appetizer order. I can forgive that when they're busy, but when the restaurant is three quarters empty? Not so much.   The larger issue, as far as I'm concerned, is the consistency of the food. I have lost track of how many times I've gotten rubbery, under-cooked (but not raw) chicken, over-cooked (read: shoe leather) chicken and, my personal pet peeve, under-seasoned chicken that tastes like you're eating tofu. How hard is it to cook a chicken breast properly, really? What's more, perhaps even ironic, is that they've moved to this new 'classic' seasoning, which more or less means the chef dumps a half gallon of mouth-burning seasoning onto the chicken breast. And no, there's no consistency here either. Some days, when it is not-quite-over-seasoned, it is tolerable, other days it's like the chef wanted to set your mouth aflame. I have, no lie, had to leave food on the plate because it was burning my mouth so bad. I'm sorry but if your chicken breast regularly comes out spicier and more mouth burning than your 'volcano' hot sauce, you might be over-doing it just a tad. To wit, several servers even warned us that the seasoning was now \"more aggressive\" and that some folks were asking to have it the old way, or at least toned down. You think that might be a clue to management that something was amiss, but evidently not. So there you are, as the customer, left with the prospect of either taking it as-is and setting your mouth aflame, or asking for less seasoning and, in all likelihood, ending up with something that tastes like nothing (and is probably not cooked properly either). Having said all that, you can imagine that I now tend to avoid anything with chicken breast at this restaurant, which basically negates about half the menu items.   Finally, I would be remiss without mentioning the most recent addition at this place, which is the table-top \"Ziosk\" branded tablet systems. They have these things at each and every table, mounted on a pedestal, so there's no way to shove it behind a menu or out of the way and the glaring LED screens can be seen from every corner of the restaurant. To put it lightly, this shits all over the ambiance and the otherwise nice, subdued lighting in the place, and takes up space on an already over-crowded table (salt, pepper, drink/dessert menu, sweetener, bread board, etc.). What's worse, these things have, in addition to for-pay games, an option to order/pay on them. I'm not naive, and I get that businesses have to cut costs, but this table-top entertainment crap is ridiculous. Worse still, some servers refuse to bring the bill and instead direct you to pay using the device, which has a card reader on the side. Sorry kiddo, but if I need to run the card myself, and handle this obviously never-cleaned, germ-ridden and grimy thing, there goes your tip.   I sincerely hope they rid themselves of these hideous table-top devices, and that they do something about the (in)consistency of the food, especially the chicken. I really do like this place, but if you're going to shit all over the experience by going airport style with a dirty tablet at every table and over-priced, under-par food prep., I won't be a customer too much longer."}
{"text":"My server was great, very attentive even though she had several tables to serve I had the Diablo steak which is one of their new deals  I got the 6oz medium well with fries I also ordered a side salad with ranch I'm getting hungry typing this again... My steak was cooked brilliantly and everything else was yummy. The fries were super good which surprised me :) Wanted to see what their drink specials were like but was in a hurry It's a good location and the service is great Bar and bartenders seem very welcoming  I will return"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience after a rocky start last night. We were sat after a 20-minute wait but after at least 10 minutes, had not had a server come to the table even though servers were waiting on the nearby tables. When we saw a hostess seat another table, we told her we'd not been waited on. Almost immediately afterward, a server came out and apologized and took our drink order. We were fine with that (they were getting pretty busy), but then the manager came to the table and told us they were going to treat us to appetizers and dessert to make up for the wait! And the experience for the rest of the meal was terrific. Our server was great and the food was really good. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been in a Outback for a long time so decided to give it a try. The first thing we noticed was the decor was still from the 80's. Our waiter was friendly and the service was pretty good. The salads were crisp and the meal was hot and tasty. My wife's coconut shrimp were small but good. The chef suddenly appeared with a plate of large shrimp! The manager came by our table and apologized for the small order even though we had not complained. I would give it 5 stars but the  ambiance is lacking."}
{"text":"Out of all the excellent restaurants there are in Las Vegas, this particular Outback Steakhouse is my favorite. I eat here about once a week with my family and the steaks are grilled to perfection. Only once did I get a steak that had a vein of fat in it and it wasn't a big problem. The servers are really nice and the manager here cares about the customer and usually comes by to see how we like our meals. I'm very happy we found this place!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and cocktails.  Try the fruity martini and the Ahi appetizer, served with really good slaw,  beside the warm brown bread loaf, the vegetables are always fresh - steamed. The steak and seafood cooked to order. Safe for Peanut allergy a plus."}
{"text":"This was really disappointing. The only bright spot was Mike the bartender. Understaffed so half the tables were open but couldn't be seated causing an hour wait. Dirty women's bathroom with a clogged overflowing toilet. We sat at the bar got a cocktail and the blooming onion. Once the wait was done we moved to a table. The servers never brought us the bread that's supposed to come, with the butter. We ordered the filet lobster combo meal to share requesting filet medium rare. It came out super RARE so we asked to have it cooked more. They did not offer anything for the mistake and also did not bus our table throughout our dining. I would not go back here again."}
{"text":"Man these people are awesome! I've had the absolute BEST dinners here. Almost always get the Ribeye. Servers are the best, the bartenders are even bester!   And if it's not right, they fix it.   Great job Paradise Valley Outback!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here! Excellent service by Amber! Top notch all the way around. Menu is different here and NO coupons. FYI"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch. We got seated right away but the service after that was slow. The waitress didn't bring us any bread, she didn't even ask if my husband wanted refill on his drink. He left the empty glass in front of her face when she brought us the check but didn't bother to ask. We had some leftovers and she just took them without asking if we wanted to take them home.  Our choice for lunch combo came incomplete.    Will not go back again."}
{"text":"Our dinner was AWFUL!  We decided to order curbside and we both ordered Chicken on the Barbie.  I have never had a more dried out, rubbery piece of chicken (times 2).  It was such a disappointment.  We do not eat out often and was really looking forward to it.  I worked here years ago and the chicken NEVER looked like that.  A chicken breast at a fast food restaurant is jucier than that.  Just really disappointed with our $30 chicken!!! :("}
{"text":"To get the whole family together for an outing is usually somewhat of a fiasco. This person doesn't like spicy, that doesn't like ethnic...so we usually pick middle of the road, American type fare. An outing of just this type brought us to Outback recently. I'm giving this place four stars because the chicken quesadillas were really good and the waitress was kick ass. Dealing with us all at once is not easy task, and she did it with aplomb. Other than that it was a chain. Things were good, some things were very good, but nothing that made me think; \"We are so coming back here...tomorrow!\" There were some steaks on the table, of which I tasted them all- despite if people wanted to share or not- and I will say they were done well. I had a chicken dish that was good, but good as in I-may-stop-in-if-I'm-in-Monroeville-again way, but not enough to plan a trip to Monroeville for it. The BF continued to say it was good, with the caveat \"for a chain.\" The waitress Christy was AWE-Some! To be able to deal with my dad who just launches into his order when she says hello, the entire table asking weirdo questions, to not even flinching when I whipped out my coupon (give it up for $5 off!), she was a champ. Tip though, it's a super-hot spot for the older I-like-to-eat-at-5:30 crowd, so it gets busy early. I made the rookie mistake of thinking no one was going to be eating at that hour. So do the call ahead seating thing; they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional. Better service than most 5 star restaurant. Food was typical outback but was cook right.Will be back again and again even thou I pass up 3 other outback locations."}
{"text":"STELLAR service and FANTASTIC food.  It didn't matter that the place was packed, everything was ready in a timely manner and the service never faltered."}
{"text":"They are always accommodating with getting us in quick and getting our booth. Food is great but when did the portion sizes become so small? I ordered the chicken tender meal which was literally baby sized. I think a kids meal gives me more food. Portion size and price do not meet my standards."}
{"text":"We came in for the Wednesday special. Apparently there was a time frame which it doesn't state online but they wouldn't start our food until 3PM so we had to wait an extra 20 minutes to get the special price. Eye roll   I asked for a medium rare steak. Got a well done steak. I pressed the button for our server to come over. She never did until the very end.  Grilled asparagus still on the menu but they never have it .  Our receipt never printed."}
{"text":"Let me say that I gave 1 star only because you can't go negative stars. I would recommend that no one go to this establishment unless you want to risk food poisoning (Now I didn't get poisoned but that is only because I had to leave before I ate). I would say that this is all to blame on bad management because when I arrived the floor was very dirty, and the bathroom looked like it has not been cleaned since 1983. The silverware was dirty with food still on it and the service was mediocre at best. I would contribute all this to poor management. I went there on Wednesday March 28th at 7pm (that is so outback can fire the Manager) enjoy. The health inspector would need a raise after going here."}
{"text":"Always quality service and meal. One negative was the usually solid house salad, lettuce was Brown and very little salad dressing.  Server was very attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"Best food and service that I've had in awhile. My sever Corey I believe was attentive and very accommodating. I travel for my job alot and I enjoy eating at trusted establishments. Steak and Shrimp and everything was on point"}
{"text":"Always a please, i deviated from my usual \"outback special\" and decided to get the lobster tail and filet with a glass of cab.  I was super delighted, i eat at so many restaurants, and i ate here for my birthday.. that says a lot."}
{"text":"Never again, I mean NEVER again. The only reason this place received one star is because of the manager and waitress. They tried their best to be congenial and were both very pleasant.  Outback needs to know not everyone is a steak idiot. Every time I go there I am sorely disappointed and tonight was no exception. I keep going back hoping it will be different that I will be wowed, instead I am irritated. I'm a glutton for punishment ... no more.  I knew I was going to Outback for dinner and anticipated the Victoria's Filet Mignon all day. I ordered it medium are. I was hopeful, I mean, the salad was good. No bread was served. why is that? Why do they not have bread?  Anyhow, the steak arrived and I and my dinner partner had to question if it was a filet Mignon, it wasn't even a half inch thick, and when I cut it to check for tenderness, it was like shoe leather.  No Filet that I know needs that much work to cut. The waitress responded, \"It's six ounces that's why it's small.\"   I have never seen a filet that thin it was less than a half an inch. As you can see by my picture, I had to really tear it apart to cut it. Anyone who knows steaks knows it isn't a filet mignon. It was a filet, but I believe they ran out and the cook just cut the filet from the porterhouse.  Anyhow, I took a bite. ONE bite it was so spicy, I couldn't eat it. The delay heat. You know the kind, \"Good. Good.\" then ...\" WTH?\" mouth on fire I wanted to scream. My lips burned. There was so much pepper, it was so hot they could have burned out a virus with it.  When I complained, I was told it was the seasoning and did I want another steak with no seasoning. Now, why would I do that?  \"How about half seasoning?\" Why should I come to a steakhouse and not have a seasoned steak? Nowhere on the menu does it say, \"Hey, this steak is doused with pepper.\"  I have been at outback, and my chief complaint is they never know how to cook a steak medium rare. I have never had the seasoning so hot I couldn't eat it.  The woman in the booth behind me ... didn't eat hers, she told the manager it was too spicy.  A pathetic over a peppered piece of meat passed off as a filet mignon.  They comped my meal, of course, they did, I didn't eat it. I left Outback dissatisfied and hungry.  It never does any good to reach out to Outback, they don't get back to you .. AT ALL.  I have in the past actually reached out to compliment the wait staff .. I never heard a word.  Hey Outback, if you're gonna call yourself a steak house, learn how to cook a steak and for goodness sake, serve a filet mignon when one is ordered, not a tough piece of meat that you try to pass off as a filet mignon."}
{"text":"This place is horrible excuse for a steakhouse. We had to ask for every item we ordered. The appetizer took 25 minutes.  The salad another 15 had to ask for it. Ordered a baked potatoes with my dinner. They didn't bring is our with my pork chops. When they finally brought it. It wasn't cooked.   Asked for another one said they where out. Really a steakhouse that runs out of baked potatoes.   Going to stick with my go to for steak Texas Roadhouse they get it right all the time."}
{"text":"We come to this location about once every month or so and have never really been disappointed, until yesterday.  The service was very, very slow.  The waiter was nice enough, just rarely around.  The place was not busy, but there were excessive waits for food, refills and bread.  I ordered the filet & lobster, and I know this is The Outback, not a high priced steakhouse on the Strip, but the lobster tail was the smallest tail I have ever seen.  I have eaten shrimp larger than that tail, and it was cooked beyond well done.  The 9 oz filet also appeared a bit skimpy.  Hopefully this will not become a trend."}
{"text":"Our visit was 6-5. Started off bad.  Came here because the grills at out apartments are all having some work done on them.  All at the same time; morons.  I quietly thought maybe going to another location because my luck at this one isn't too good.  They are advertising free upgrades on the size of the Outback sirloin. Server knew nothing about it.  Jen and I both ordered the sirloin so I am curious to see if anyone brings it up or what the bill will look like.  Have to give the powers that be from Outback credit for coming up with a sampler finally. Like most samplers they lure you in with one or two things that are popular then make up for their cost by throwing a low cost space filler like cheese fries. If by old fries that were stale and barely had any bacon or cheese then that must be why they call them Aussie Fries.  Picture attached because although I knew the fries would hardly be touched by Jen or I, I still wanted to.show what I saw so you don't think I exaggerated. If you look closely you can almost see the cheese.  The Blooming onion petals were good.  The macaroni cheese bites were ok but the old school ones that TGIFS used to carry were the bomb and blew these away.  And FYI, if the plates you received were really hot, it sat in the window waiting too long and that's why whatever you ordered doesn't taste very good.  Jen's steak was over cooked.  I took two pictures; the first is when she first got it and it seems to be mid to mid well. The 2nd pic of her steak is after about 2 minutes and it was well done by then. Unless they changed their rules, Outback has always advised that they undercook slightly of your requested steak temp so it is usually a little rarer in most cases of what you are used to when requesting a specific steak temp.  Jen and I always order medium rare. Min was almost medium, and you can easily see Jen's was nowhere near medium rare.  She also stated that her coconut shrimp were nowhere near as good as Red Lobster.  You may think well that's a seafood restaurant. They are both chains so it doesn't really factor in the type, and they have shrimp in Australia too.  Her plate was super.hot to my touch, which is pretty hot after 21 years in restaurants, grabbing hot plates has my tolerance built up pretty high to heat. Our food simply sat in the window too long which means they either didn't time the items to come out at the right time, or they forgot something (most likely), or just aren't very good and have no pride in what they do (also a strong possibility).  Check is here. No discount for the sirloins and no mention of it from our server. Either she isn't good at her job or the management hasn't properly trained the staff.  I told Jen it's highly unlikely that the staff wasn't advised as rolling out new promotions is a pretty big deal that happens regularly in chain restaurants.  We never saw a manager even walking around our entire time here so maybe that's why.    I'm just done with this location.  $56.68 was our total.  I could have bought 5 filets from Costco for about $40 and they have never been anything less than tender and deliscious.  If and when I ever come back to Outback it won't be this location.  I just wanted a good steak and since I couldn't use the grills at my place, I used poor judgement in taking the convenient way and driving a few miles to Outback Steakhouse. I should have just ordered pizza."}
{"text":"Had a really good, quiet meal here tonight. Kenny was my server, he was awesome. Food tastes really good, especially for franchise strip food."}
{"text":"The worst customer service not provided by a \"so called manager\" Chrissy. The hostess is more of a manager than The rude, unprofessional Chrissy. Corporate OSI will have all my details."}
{"text":"Walked in and had to wait for the host to show up.  Got seated git drinks order, all fine no issues.  I ordered the Crab-topped Steak and my wife the Crab-stuffed Shrimp.  When the food arrived what I got was a steak that had a (frozen) crab cake placed on top and some sauce poured over it.  I ordered my steak medium and it arrived rare.  I promise you blood poured out when i cut it.  It was sent back and they made another this one arrived med-rare and I thought, screw it and said it was fine.  you could easily tell they had smashed the steak onto the grill with that flat iron thing, I do not know its name,  The one side of the steak was smooth.  My wife got shrimp that was rubbery and had a cut up crab cake placed on each shrimp.  Not worth our time and not worth our money.      She liked her sweet potato and my garlic Mashed potato was real good but.....   the manager came by and chatted with us and said we could come back and he would personally cook for me but I think I will not be going back.  We stopped going to this chain years ago because the quality of food had serious dropped.  we hoped that time had fixed this, but it had only made things worse."}
{"text":"OK I typically like this place however tonight we went in for the steak and unlimited shrimp.first off I have seen bigger hamburger patties then the steak I received.it was tough.my guests and I ordered two crunchy shrimp as well as one garlic.we got two garlics.no prob,then we ordered more crunchy for all three,didn't get that,again we got the garlic.when we asked the girl if we could get crunchy because that's what we ordered,she looked irritated and said,oh u want more...rude.took forever to get refills and check.63.00 plus for three very small steaks and wasted garlic shrimp....unlimited shrimp i might add,so if I wanted to order crunchy shrimp ten times that's my prerogative. Horrible,do not go in.we will not be back"}
{"text":"In the parking lot of the Outlet Mall.  Came here after a day of shopping.  Hamburgers were great!  Lemonade hit the spot.   Great food this afternoon."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Great views from near the Coke bottle across from NY NY.  We have eaten here several times in past LV visits. This time, rib eye & a filet for my wife with a blooming onion.  Blooming onion was good as usual. Steaks...very good taste but both were tough.  We didn't finish either. OB usually delivers a very good steak that melts in your mouth and is very tender.  Not this meal.  We were very disappointed.    We'll try again next year and hope for a more tantalizing meal."}
{"text":"Ordered a loaded blooming onion the table next to us looked awesome but ours barely had anything on it..: looked embarrassing we told the manager and she offered another one after we already had ate it.... Lady seriously do we look obese to you??? Didn't even offer to take off our bill... We paid for shitty appetizer makers me mad oh not to say the server Justin W had a little diva attitude... Let me brake it to you buddy... You are a server to serve me the customer which it doesn't say anything to give the customers diva attitude ... Bad staff bad has no clue manager! First time I had a problem here!!!"}
{"text":"Came on a busy night and they still got us a table within 5 minutes.  Service was very good (Jason was our waiter).  Was very prompt with refills and was very courteous.  Food was excellent.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss but food is always pretty great for the price.  It's not Flemings, or Ruth's Chris but it's damn good and much less pricey than those places. All the steaks are good and the pastas are always very tasty."}
{"text":"The worst outback I've ever been to.  This location always is horrible when it comes to service and food. Ive repeatedly had to send back steaks due to over cooking. The last time I gave this place a chance my drink tasted like straight mixer and my blooming onion was ridiculously greasy. Outback is usually a good chain but this location is horrible."}
{"text":"No Service...No Stars.  We would have had to interact with someone to at least give it a star.    We chose Outback because it was late on a Sunday evening....and most of Charlotte shuts the kitchens down by 9PM.  From the moment we walked in, the crowd was an odd mix.  The hostess staff seemed confused and clueless.   We were seated for about 5 minutes and passed by several waiters.   No one spoke to us. And no one seemed to be in the weeds.  There must have been 20 families with kids under 2 after 9 pm.  A few kept letting out blood curdling screams.   I looked at my friend and we decided that since we hadnt even  been greeted.....it would be OK to leave and Go next door to Monterrey for a quiet dinner.    On the way out, the host and the manager looked surprised that we were leaving.....and said....\"did we not get you service fast enough?\".    If you had to ask that question....then chances are you may know the answer.  #outbackfail"}
{"text":"My son graduated from HS and i decided to take him somewhere special. When i brought up the name Outback Steakhouse he was all over it! the people here were friendly and the food was great. we were served quickly and we were out in time to catch the movie we were going to see"}
{"text":"SO IMPRESSED! My meal was great and our server Bobby was so great and polite. I'm on keto WOE and I ordered wings (on the website it said they just had spices and sauce on them) come to find out they were breaded :( But he insisted to bring me some non-breaded ones! So sweet! They manager was so accommodating as well! I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"The servers here are atrocious. One server in particular, Bald headed Bill, he's 6 ft something and obviously bald and has the personality of Fester from Adams Family. We've made many complaints about this lurch and they seem to fall on deaf ears.   The service in general here is pretty bad.  From almost getting smacked in the forehead by the hostess (because they open the door for you) she didn't apologize or anything to the host up front being extremely rude as if we were interrupting them. The management team needs to clear house of these servers and bring in people who will have an appreciation for their job and take pride in the customer service they give and wear a smile on their face. Drive the few extra miles and go to the Outback on Sahara it's MUCH better!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Very friendly people and food taste great. Many things to choose from. Good beer and food great for kids also."}
{"text":"My daughter and I both ordered medium well sirloin steak. Hers was perfect, mine was rare. I showed the waitress, who completely agreed with me that the steak was undercooked. But guess what, that was it! No apology or anything. The service was slow and it wasn't even a weekend, thur night! I took my raw, inedible steak home and I guess I have to cook it my self! For $83.00 it was a terrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty! Had the Queensland Shrimp & Chicken Pasta. The pasta had a little kick to it. Ordered the wings & it came with ranch + blue cheese dressings. Service was great!"}
{"text":"This is the worst service I've ever had. My wife and I waited thirty minutes at our table just to get our side salads. Then an additional thirty minutes to get our main plates. We saw multiple couples get seated receive salads and main dishes, eat their meals, pay and leave before we got our food."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Tried three different drinks from the bar and they were all kind of weak. The restaurant remained busy the entire time we were there and the manager said it typically stays busy after 5pm. We stayed and talked for a couple of hours and our server continued to pleasantly check on us. I think her name was Steph. Very sweet server. Even the manager came by and spoke to us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Questa catena di ristoranti è un punto di riferimento per chi viaggia. Il menù è ricco e i piatti sono abbondanti e buonissimi. Il loro antipasto classico è la cipolla gigante fritta o \"bloomin onion\" e merita sicuramente un assaggio. Il filetto è semplicemente spettacolare! 11oz di carne morbida e succulenta servita con purè di patate o patatine fritte, accompagnate magari da una buona birra (Sam Adams e Blue Moon le mie favorite). Il personale è cordiale e sempre attento."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Outback but a bigger fan of its upscale restaurant Bonefish Grill.  This specific location is going a little downhill.  I've dined here about 8 times, half the time at the bar where I can comfortably say I did get better service.  I think all this location needs is someone to kick the manager in the ass regarding the small things:  1) Menu's were filthy 2) Silverware was dirty and not polished 3) Seats were not wiped down 4) Service was sub par 5) Lipstick on both glasses of wine I had  These things can be fixed with a little snap of the management whip.  Don't let laziness set in or customers less anal then me will start to notice.    As for the food, well its good, but not sure that its right in line with the prices.  Ahi Tuna appetizer is overly seasoned, steaks are good, crab seemed over/under steamed to me (dripping with water, not drained properly),  mashed potatoes were par, veggies need a little seasoning salt on them, and the desert was acceptable.  They have a tenderloin french dip that is terrific and I get that each time its available, but I do eat at the bar when I go for the dip.  This location gets really busy, so get there either really early or after the dinner rush.  I can't really recommend other restaurants in that area that compare except maybe the Brown Derby down the street (West on Mayfield)."}
{"text":"For years Outback was one of my favorite places to dine.  Their wings were the best, burgers were fantastic, steaks well seasoned and portion size was good.  About a year ago Outback rebranded their stores to a more upscale decor. They changed their menu and downsized their portions.  This store was clean, server was polite and food was mediocre. The wings were small over cooked and greasy the steak did not have much flavor the outside was char'd and cold on the inside. The prices have gone through the roof considering the downsized portion size. Overall, it was just OK, next time I have a urging for a real good steak...I'll look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is slow but friendly.  Took a while to get silverware, even after I got my food. Staff told me they were busy and we're short handed with dish washers.  Will not be returning so soon."}
{"text":"The service was very slow a family came in and sat down 5 minutes after us and got everything before us. None of the good was hot, warm at best. Even after sending soup back to heat,  not hot. I had fillet it was good but again only warm. For 5 people $113.00 was not worth the money."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner! Lindsey, the manager was fantastic. So was our server. We came in for a spontaneous celebration. They made sure everything was PERFECT! Really went out of their way for us. My wife and I will definitely be back!! Awesome job folks! Way to go!!!!"}
{"text":"It took me some time to write this but I didn't want to write a review while upset. Now I had some time to \"calm down\" here I am.   Shortly after it opened, I called in for a reservation. Dinner for 5:30pm  on a Saturday night. The person who I made my reservation was great. She placed me on hold and another person picked up and continued it. It was confirmed. Shortly after I received a text messaged confirming my wishes. 4 stars   I come in just shortly before my time (520pm) and was told it would take approximately 15-20 minutes for the wait. The staff was friendly the restaurant was busy and clean. 4 stars  A male server seated us. Friendly (maybe) but I know he's preoccupied. We was definitely a 10 and made sure our drinks were on the table but that was it. Through conversation he had with another server, and another guest(s), he was either dating or just broke up with. Sorry server I'm here for food and enjoy my time.   We placed our order and that's when things turned from happy to sad or should I say from happy to hulk. My princess who was celebrating her birthday ordered the Outback famous bloomin onions. Received it real quick (4stars) but when eating it discovered a hair follicle in it (1star). After getting the servers attention (he was too busy talking about his ex-girlfriend (server) we got another one.   We ordered another bread with butter but, somebody was preoccupied and forgot about the butter on several occasions. Yes it was a little busy and I gave him some latitude but really? It truly will get better.  The rest  of the order came out. Finally my order came out. Very good steak, great bake potato and the macaroni cheese was awesome. (4 stars) let's talk about my Mac and cheese when it finally came out I was 3/4 done with my food. Why did I eat most of my food before bringing it to the attention of the server.....cause he was busy talking about his ex-girlfriend who happened to be a server at the next table. Needless to say I was not happy. Yes I talked to a manager who attempted to do damage control but WTF.  My daughter got to pick her dessert but was told emphatically not to pick the chocolate cake. No explanation but that was it. My perception was them yelling at here. I almost lost it. If it was delivered a different way I would be happy. I'm going to spend almost $110 on the meal, who cares about another $10-$15 on dessert. Listen there are over 40 major hotel and casino's in 20 mile radius, over 300 restaurant that serve steak. Tell me why I should keep coming back from the experience I had.....Do Your Research, I've done mine.  As of 3/13/18, the manager reached out to me and sent me some gift cards. His customer service was 4 star service. I was still disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed. My friend had reserved a large party for after her wedding. We show up later than the rest of the guests but no biggie right? We walk up to to the area where everyone was seated and there was an empty table so me, my girlfriend , her sister , and three kids sit down at the empty table. A waiter greets us with \"you can't sit there\". Then he starts discussing something with his coworker.. they both confused and upset. Like me and my family had committed some kind of unspeakable thing. I'm so frustrated at this point I tell my friends by and me and the family walk down to the food court and eat subway. I can't say how the food was but after that I had lost my appetite."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience.  With only 6 tables seated in the entire restaurant, it took 40 minutes to get the food only to have both filets cold in the middle.  We sent them back and waited and waited.  Finished our sides and had the steak served, in essence, for dessert.  Unfortunately, these steaks were cold too!  Unbelievable.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Every now and then you need to throw caution to the wind and do something rash like visit an Outback Steakhouse for lunch.  Partially brainwashed by an endless stream of commercials during the Outback Bowl, partially suckered in by an offer of free coconut shrimp, I paid my first visit to this Aussie-themed chain for the first time in over a decade.  Expecting a flood of ravenous fellow Badger fans hoping to score the same coconut shrimp deal, I arrived at the restaurant ten minutes after they opened and grabbed a booth by the large U-shaped bar within four minutes of arriving.   The host seemed disinterested at best, barely making eye contact and grunting out a \"follow me\" as he trudged to my table.  The bar area features three, muted flat screen TVs, either showing the SportsCenter or college bowl games.  Physically, the restaurant is in good condition, with my booth showing little wear and tear.  However, the black ceiling panels, the dim lighting and the partially drawn shades gave the bar area a slightly gloomy feel, more reminiscent of a trip to the mines of Moria than a visit to the Outback.  Once seated, the pace of the meal slowed to a glacial crawl as the hoard of coconut shrimp-craving diners poured through the front door.  Thirty minutes after open, the hungry masses had occupied every table and bar seat.   That created a service bottleneck, as management unwisely decided that a single bartender could manage the both the bar during a busy lunch service and all the diners in the bar area (easily 30 people).  As a result, it took almost ten minutes for my harried server to make his way to my table.  No greeting, no explanation of the day's specials, just a brusque \"do you want anything to drink?\"   Watching the bar area fill to capacity, I elected to pass on a drink order and instead placed an order of the coconut shrimp and the Alice Springs Chicken Quesadilla (grilled chicken breast, sautéed mushrooms, bacon, melted jack and cheddar cheeses).  Twenty minutes later, my server does a drive-by delivery of the meal, literally dropping the plates on the table without a word, ignoring the empty water glass.    As for the food, the cheese quesadillas passed the eye test with just the right amount of browning, which gave each bite a little crunch.  The combination of flavors worked for me and the cook did an adequate job of evenly mixing the filling so I got all the ingredients in each bite.  Nothing earth shattering, but I'd order it again should I unwisely decide to brave a visit to Outback in the future.  As for the coconut shrimp, lukewarm is not a good serving temperature.  I would have sent it back, but alas, no check-in by the server to see how I'm enjoying my meal.  While I enjoyed the crunchy texture of the batter, the shrimp was chewy and waaaaaaaay too sweet.  The \"Creole\" dipping sauce tasted like Smuckers orange marmalade with absolutely no heat.  As a free dish, I could tolerate the multitude of flaws, but I'd be upset if I had to pay $9.29 for this train wreck of an appetizer.  Twenty minutes after I received my food, I almost needed to tackle my server as he sped by in order to request my check.  Five minutes later, he dropped the check off at my table, I paid cash to cover my tab and sped out the door, again ignored by the disinterested host.  While I am thankful that Outback cured me of my coconut shrimp addiction, the absolute lack of hospitality and mediocre food will keep me away at least for another ten years."}
{"text":"Aidan was awesome. Just ate at Outback in Tempe and the service was excellent. Aidan was very attentive. He read back our order and made sure our food was cooked the way we wanted it. The food was good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"They need to tell the chef how to cook a medium steak. My husband's steak was raw. Other than that the food was very good."}
{"text":"Every trip to Outback is a pleasant one. The food, beer, service, and atmosphere is always consistent. I'm very fond of this location because the Manager is very hands on and the bartender, Brian is the best! They make me feel very welcome. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First, they cooked the steak as I asked - rare. Good job but it isn't hard to toss a hunk of meat on a grill. I cannot say that it was any better than what I would have served at home. The house salad was a disgrace. It looked like it was made a week in advance, wilted, the sorriest looking salad I have ever been served. It also tasted wilted. None of it was fresh or anywhere near fresh. The dressing wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to write home about either. The whole salad was a disgrace that should not have been served. My husband was served a similar sorry looking and sorry tasting salad. The service sucked, as usual, as this place is known for. The waitress smiled but after serving the food, we never saw her again. We never go here unless we are coerced by friends and the group wants steak or, once, we were given a gift certificate."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: It is an Australian themed steakhouse. It is dim inside like most steakhouses but with boomerangs and bushman decorations scattered throughout. Other than the decor it is a dim mainly wood interior with plenty of booths.   Food: The cheese fries are delicious. The bloomin onion (pretty much onion rings but cut into the shape of a flower bloom and breaded) is a main stay of the appetizers but I have never been a big fan and I like onions. The house special steak is what I usually order because it is reasonably priced and still a good piece of meat with a house blend of spices. I hear the prime rib and chicken on the barbie are top notch as well but I have not had them personally. The house salad is also quite good. Oh I almost forgot soon after you are seated you will receive some sort of brown loaf of bread and some butter the bread is always fresh and tastes like heaven.  Drinks: Full bar with plenty of specials. The wallabedarned is pretty good and I believe they have 2 for 1 specials at happy hour.  Service: Usually good but one time I had a waitress that made my top 3 of all time. You know those servers that some how read your mind? I had one at the Outback once.  I would give it a five but their reduction in steak size and increase in prices during this recession has not gone unnoticed."}
{"text":"Went in for a birthday dinner and at 6pm they were out of rare prime rib and also out of mashed potatoes. Of course this was not told to is until after our order was in. Service was slow and I had to ask 3 times to have my water refilled. The manager, Dana, came to apologize and said it was unacceptable and she would be \"taking care of it\" however nothing changed... service remained slow and we did not get what we came in to order... to top it off when the bill came there was no accommodation of any sort."}
{"text":"Called today on my way home for call ahead seating.  Thought it would be nice to take my husband to dinner. If you call after 5 pm the hostess says you have to make your call ahead seating on an app. Guess she didn't understand that I can't possibly download an app while driving home.   Then I had to call 5 times to try and figure out the name of the app that's on the recording.  Gave up and called again asked her to spell the name of the app.  There are hostesses standing around and chatting do you want me to believe they can't take the reservation.   What Happen to customer service.   Who says I want another app on my phone.  Their website just says there's an error when trying to make a reservation    How about your website tell you about the stupid app.  Then when we are seated I was told I could order my app on their ziosk.    Isn't that the waitresses job.  Heck I could have ordered my entire meal on it.   Then someone other than your waitress brings your meal.  So why are we tipping the waitress sure isn't for good service she didn't really do anything. Spoke with manager.  Just for the same old bs. I hear what you are saying.   Your the manager try teaching them standards of good customer service.   Another millennial that thinks we run our lives on our  phones.   Use to be some one at the door to great you and say thank you on the way out.   Not so much anymore.  The food is good customer service need help."}
{"text":"Service was poor, food wasn't great. I would much rather go to Texas roadhouse for nearly that same price. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this Outback Location for dinner. The inside is like any other location and was clean. The hostess was very friendly and and pointed out there was self serve water while we waited. We had reservation and was seated a bit before our actual time which was nice. Our waitress was a bit over the top. She was trying way to hard to be friendly and prompted that she pretty much was like a fly that wouldn't leave. She took our drink order and then as soon as she placed our drinks asked what we wanted for our meals. We kindly said we needed a few more minutes to decide. I kid you not, she walked about 10 feet from us turned around and asked we where ready. This is how the whole night went.. She would not stop asking us if things where alright, if we needed anything and so on.. I mean yeah its nice not to have to want but there is a limit.. But in turn we never had to ask for any refills on our drinks.       Now our meals, they came out promptly and hot. But the portions have reduced a lot. Almost to the point I would say half the size as I remember them being. I ordered the chicken breast and all you can eat shrimp. The breast was a filet and still looked like it come off a Cornish game hen. As I looked around at everyone's plates it was pretty much the same story. I know cost of food goes up, but come on do not raise the prices and cut the size too.. i felt like I was in a old Wendy's commercial ( where's the beef ). The all you can eat shrimp helped my shock over the prices but the shrimp was buffet quality at best, and a bit tough.      Over all it was an ok dinner but i will not be running back anytime soon.."}
{"text":"We love the food here and find that this is one of the best chain restaurants to eat out if you have a food allergy because they pay attention and a manager stays with your ticket to make sure it's done correctly.  We can rarely get in unless we get in early (4pm ish) or late in the evening but they now have the online check in and call ahead seating so it's much more manageable.  Tonight the service was excellent. We've never had poor service at any Outback but it's always a nice surprise that the servers know their menu and make sure your food is perfect.  If you're in the market for a good meal at a great price with attentive service this is your place."}
{"text":"Came in for the Wednesday special they advertise only. Waited 30 mins to be told it ended over an hour ago. Still even advertised on their menus, not to mention the server was just plain rude about. I almost left when she came back and said she would do it for me today only. To be honest if that's your demeanor as a server your working the wrong job. Food was okay, as you can see service sucked even after they honored a special they ADVERTISE! We will probably not return based on the fact I'd never want to be served by that person again and the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Not worth value to money. Thought we ordered an onion blossom, got the onion strips, fried hard and spicy. Only one person in our party ate it. Ordered crab stuffed mushrooms, they only give you 4, so each one of us only got one. They were okay, stuffing was bland and mushy. One person ordered a NY strip, looked like an over cooked pot roast- sent it back only to get the same again. That dinner came with a salad and potato I believe. One person ordered a dip sandwich or similar, no complaints but no praises. I got the crab topped talapia, didn't eat it. Had the same unflavored mushy stuffing on it. Came with a potato and for $17 it would of been nice to get a salad or veggie too with it. For 4 people, $104. Could of gone across the street to Applebee's, have always had better luck there. Waited almost an hour to get our food 8pm on a Wednesday. Never again, ever. Oh, and one person in our party is a Chef, he thought it sucked. I'll go with his opinion."}
{"text":"3.5!!!  This was my first (possibly second) experience at Outback Steakhouse and they definitely exceeded my expectations. We went on a Friday night around 5PM and they had a full house! I never knew Outback was so popular. They gave us a beeper and we waited about 30 minutes.   I really like their booths, they are nice and spacious. Our server, Ryan, was attentive, friendly and fast. They start you off with warm bread that reminds me of the honey wheat bread at Cheesecake Factory. We ordered a few items, nothing stood out but everything was good. They currently have a steak and AYCE shrimp special that starts at $15.99.. My only complaint is that the fully loaded baked potato was overly salty so I will probably ask for no salt next time.   HOT TIP: There is a \"light bites\" menu that features some items starting at $4.. I suggest the Blooming Onion Petals (smaller portion of their famous Blooming Onion) and their Melon Chelada!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. It may have put them at a severe disadvantage that I had eaten at Longhorn recently.   Took the fam out for lunch. We started with the bloomin onion, it was no where near as good as I remembered from when I was younger but wasn't bad. Wife ordered the steak which didn't compare to longhorn and I actually grill steaks better at home. It wasn't terrible, just wasn't very good. I had the Alice Springs chicken wich had way too much sauce on it and unfortunately the chicken itself was very dry inside. Kids ate their mac n cheese and kids burger w/ no complaints. Wasn't necessarily expensive but your money could be better spent elsewhere for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and the service was fast and friendly.  The person I was with is a regular so the server already knew to bring her waters and bread right away.  Eat the bread while it's warm because it is soft and delicious, but once it cools down, it's hard as bricks.  I ordered the dinner special of 6 oz. sirloin with a side salad and a loaded baked potato, all for $9.99.  The steak came out the exact temp I asked for.  I'm not a big sirloin fan, but I love steaks in general and this one was particularly good.  They had a filet for $18.99, but that seemed a little excessive for lunch.    The service was fast and we never had to ask our server for anything.  It's a perfect lunch spot if you're feeling like you want a very affordable big meal!"}
{"text":"Went here with my mom for dinner. The rib steak bone in was good. The sides basic. Food gets 3 stars but the service provided by Cynthia was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I generally try and give positive reviews, but on this occasion I cannot as SO much was wrong. It started off in a promising manner with being greeted and sat. However, I needed the restroom and the smell in the general area, never mind in there was enough to make a skunk gag. it was absolutely diabolical, and so strong my friends could smell it on my clothes when I returned to the table.The 'fully loaded' (small) potato had 4 pieces of chive (small) and 6 bacon bits on it, with a wipe of butter. The steak (I had the large bone in) was a mediocre ok-ish offering.  The service was unresponsive and lacklustre; although the server was friendly enough when at the table. The automatic pay gadget broke mid process and had to be fixed. So, to summarize, wasted FAR too much time, was exposed to something NASTY and the food was lacklustre and VERY over priced for what was provided. NEVER going back. As an aside, I really didn't see much evidence of anything Australian outside of some wall hangings, seems like the entire Ozzy image (albeit fake) has been left by the wayside and it's just become another Dennys.. I would have said Applebees, but Applebees is much cheaper and nicer."}
{"text":"Oops! We caught this Outback serving reheated Coconut Shrimp tonight! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is normally pretty good, but this time it was horrible. Two of the 3 steaks were not cooked right one was sent back and came back still decently overcooked.  The service was not really that good.  Whoever was cooking today was not doing a good job at all overheard another table with the same problem.  Will not be coming back here anytime soon !!."}
{"text":"Lately we have been eating smaller meals, and since we enjoy the occasional Outback visit, we tried their Wednesday Walkabout, which for $9.95 gives you a 6 ou. Steak and potato with beer soft drink or tea.  The steak has always been tender and flavorful and we get French fries...perfectly crisp and seasoned. They are some great fries.  For those seeking a small (& reasonably quick) lunch we have never gone wrong with this. Service has always been good and the wait staff always been spot on with drink refills, something I am particularly picky over."}
{"text":"This is a good family place to bring the kids.  I like it for this and it is fun as well...  a.  Ambiance - In a street mall on Sunset between Mountain Vista and Green Valley Pkwy.  With all the other stores/ restaurants here, parking always seems to be a challenge, in and out is crowded, however, not overly busy.  Inside, the restaurant is very welcoming, has seating for a wide variety of party sizes.  4 stars.  b.  Service - From the moment you attempt to open the doors, and instead the staff opens them for you, to being seated and having a server, I found the Service here to be top notch and a reason to come back. They will treat you and your family like VIP clients.  I give them 5 star.  c.  Food -  We had the   Blooming Onion - not bad, gotta have one.  Chicken Rib Combo - Tasted good, way too much fries on this and not enough meat though.  3 star.  Sirloin and Lobster tail - Son ordered this and scarfed it down. Lobster easy to extract from the tail and the steak was tender. A bit expensive, however, pretty good.  4 star.  Mac N Cheese - My daughter had this and the consistency was very \"runny\" The sauce was not thick, more watery.  I give this 2 star.  needs improvement.  Ribeye - Served with Garlic Mash and String Bean.  The wife ordered this and I give it a solid 3.  Not too shabby, nothing to write home about.  Salmon and Vegetables - the salmon was pretty good, about 3-4 ounce service.  Yet, the vegetables were very typical and a bit bland.  The portion I thought was a bit spartan, however, I goes for being a healthy choice, it should be.  GK says check it out for a family affair.  Not shabby, especially if Olive Garden is fool and you are in the franchise, convenient and average type of food that I consider to be not bad at all."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed as far as Outbacks go. My bf and I were planning to go here a few weeks prior but believe it or not we got rained out! It was pouring cats & dogs so we just stayed where we were and had a few drinks. SO finally getting to dine after church I was excited and ordered my favorite salad...... or so I thought.   I ordered the Cobb salad. GROSS. I am a Cobb salad lover but I realized after getting this..this is a tweaked new menu..and the tweaking is uncalled for and should be discontinued as far as this salad option goes.   COBB: IT HAD ICEBURG. everyone who really likes salads will tell you that iceburg has no nutritional value.. and no flavor. I prefer romaine and butter lettuce if I had an option. Sadly I didnt ask and I should have. it had warm chicken (bad bad idea to get cold everything and throw in hot greasy chicken) just plain gross. it had tomatoes and maybe half an egg chopped up. a few pieces of fat (that was supposed to be bacon) and maybe 1/2 tsp of blue cheese crumbled. The whole salad sounded a 1000x better on the menu than the disgusting gross mess that was presented to me. Never again Outback. At least not that. And with LV having so many places to try.. I think it will be another few years before I go back. Just so disappointed.  SERVICE: It was early on a sunday afternoon (and this location is starting to be one of the 1st to open for lunch on sundays. The waitress was nice and attentive but she was like a car salesman constantly tryping to get us to order more and more and more and more. One appetizer for 2 people is enough. and To be honest I didnt even want that b/c i was so excited for my salad... glad he got it after all b/c even after the salad I left hungry which after a $45 bill you should never leave hungry.    APPETIZER: SHRIMP ON THE BARBIE. overratted and overrpriced. I'd much rather have had the ahi tuna one. almost $10 but way better tasting. still overrpriced but delish.. but looking @ the quality of the rest of the meal ... I've lost faith in this place and in Outback in LV altogether.  If you want steak try going to a casino and just asking for a \"steak special\" most places have it ... and its off the menu. lol."}
{"text":"I was really let down by this Outback experience which usually fails to disappoint me. In TX I used to go so often to my neighbordhood outback I had a plaque @ the edge of the table w/ my name on it, literally. Crazy, huh? (and I was only 19) .. . yeah.  This place however just blah.  Service: The waitress was very akward. AWKWARD. I dont know if she was brand new but she seemed almost afraid to talk to us and paused before ever doing anything. She took our plates w/out asking. However, the girl that brought us our food was more waitressy, however she still pushed my salad plate out of the way to put down my steak plate? really?   FOOD: the side caesar was good. had enough dressing but somehow had a funny aftertaste that was not characteristic of my fav side caesar.  We both ordered the Outback special 9 oz with grilled shrimp on the barbie. WOW the shrimp stole the show! Either it was just that good or the steak was just that bad. I had a lot of chewy parts and the steak had no flavor. I actually had to use A1 sauce. Now if you dotn knowt his already, people in TX use lots of seasoning b/c the meat should be able to STAND ON ITS OWN.. and not be downed w/ sauces. Not this steak.  Blah. I wouldnt order it again.  If I came bk here again, I'd def. not order steak! ."}
{"text":"I've always liked going Outback.  It's about 50/50 for how often we go to sit down vs. taking it curbside.  Both are consistently good.  I love the bloomin onion, I always get a salad with honey mustard dressing, and generally eat an embarassing amount of the bread and butter.  I crave it at odd hours of the day.  The service is always prompt and quick and you never have to spend a fortune for a dinner for two.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Usually have great experiences here, but last visit was not so great. The order took an extremely long time to come out and it was just prime rib in one order and the other order was the chicken sandwich. The first sandwich was  burnt, overcooked, and drowning in sauce. The prime rib was ordered  mid rare, but came out medium. When I alerted the server, she indicated that they had sold out of the mid rare. Rather than letting us know, they tried to slip medium on my plate. That's not gonna work. Manager got involved, offered another steak, it was poorly seasoned but cooked properly. Not a great experience, but manager, was willing to comp my meal. I'll be back again, but hope for better food next time."}
{"text":"The food here is actually very good. Obviously the steaks are gonna be expensive cuz it's steak. But I ordered a 6oz sirloin because I'm a broke ass college student, I got it medium rare and finally a restaurant that knows how to cook steak!! It was so beautiful! Not really a big fan of the bloomin onion but their Aussie fries are on point!! (Especially if you dip them with the ranch sauce they serve). You get free bread, boom done. This is not a place to go every day but maybe on special occasions like treat yo' self Day!!"}
{"text":"Sad and disappointing for a large chain restaurant. We had curbside pickup so we didn't notice the issues until we got back to our hotel. Bacon cheese fries had minimal bacon. Kids burgers were heavily seasoned, and they forgot the cheese. Coconut shrimp was over cooked. The potato soup looked watery. Just an all around disappointment.  McDonald's would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"Always consistently good.  There bartenders are great and never leave your glass empty.  They also are quick with food and anyway to accommodate!"}
{"text":"Outback (Surprise, AZ) was on point last night.  The wife and I each ordered the pick-your-own combos, going with the Filet Mignon for both.  The food was great.  The steak, ordered medium-rare, was very tender and good.  The salads, soups, and the desserts (cheesecake) were also tasty.  Really, I have no complaints about this visit.  However, I only gave 4 out of 5 stars because while the value and quality are there with the food, I think the service, presentation, and consistency could improve just a bit.  For presentation, I don't expect $$$$-restaurant plating, especially when only two items are on the plate, but perhaps something could be added for a little pizazz.  For service, checking on tables more often, asking if everything tastes good and is in fact good goes a long way.  Also, sometimes (though not last night's visit), the food comes out rather quickly, essentially rushing it to the table despite the previous course still being enjoyed.  It is up to the servers to check/time/put the order in (and knowing the kitchen) for proper timing.  Finally, for consistency, last night's quality of food was very good.  The steak was tender, juicy and delicious.  The mashed potatoes were soft and creamy.  And the cheesecake was soft.  Contrast this to the previous visit when the steak was tough and slightly over-seasoned (I had the sirloin), the mashed potatoes were stiff, and the cheesecake was firm and near-frozen.  But overall, we will be back to this location.  Outback still remains a good place for good food and value."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was okay. I asked for prime rib medium rare and got well done. Mushrooms were good. Blooming onions dark brown and kinda burnt. Sauteed mushrooms really good. Oh... Said that already.  Certainly seems like it'd probably be better than anything else in the area because there doesn't seem to be much around but I don't know that for sure  Deb liked the iceberg wedge salad and her Fillet want bad though done med rare vs the well done she requested."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday night & had the best service ever here. We waited only a short while (it helped we made a reservation). We ordered the fried calamari, filet mignon, NY strip steak & for dessert NY cheesecake. Our steaks were cooked perfectly. And I loved my baked sweet potato side & broccoli too. So fresh.   But the best part of it was the exceptional service we got from Moose. He gave us very personable & almost undivided attention, even in a busy restaurant (NFR was in town so place was super busy). Such great attitude & professionalism. I certainly hope he gets recognized for his service & that we have hun again as our server."}
{"text":"Walked around the Strip and got hungry. My feet was killing me. Decided to try this place out since it was nearby and thought why not? Food was expensive. I'd rather prefer Cheesecake Factory or Bj's. The complimentary bread was good. Blooming onion looks good. Burger was delicious and cheap. Salad was fresh."}
{"text":"Very fast service for an Outback restaurant! However, the prices are slightly higher than other Outbacks. I didn't even know that was legal in a franchise. But I guess anything goes in Vegas, eh?  The location is on the strip but it doesn't appear to ever be busy.  I would assume most people are judging that the service would be too slow for a quick meal. Definately not the case!"}
{"text":"Before last night, I hadn't been to any Outback Steakhouse in over 20 years.. After my experience here, I'm left wondering how could I let that happen??  Had a late dinner here, around 9 pm. The restaurant was still pretty packed- always a good sign! LA & I opted for the special, dinner for 2 for $46. The special included a Bloomin' Onion, 2 salads, 2 entrees from a select menu, & a slice of cheesecake. If all of this was ordered a la carte, the total would've ran right around $55 so it's a good deal I suppose.   The Bloomin' Onion was pretty greasy & salty & the salads we ordered (House & Caesar) were nothing to write home about but the entrees are where Outback came through!  LA ordered the 9 oz Outback Center-Cut Sirloin & I ordered the 7 oz Salmon. The steak was cooked to medium-well & served with broccoli. The salmon was cooked to my liking (very well done) & served with mixed vegetables. My only gripe is I wish the vegetables were a little less done so they'd be more crunchy but the meat was on point. The salmon was nicely charred, seasoned well, & flaky & wasn't undercooked/mushy in the middle (I hate hate hate when it is).  Now the steak.. I very rarely eat meat, besides fish, but I'll take a bite here & there once in awhile. I tried a piece & omg it made me question what the hell I've been eating the last 10 years. Even during my carnivore years I was never one to order steak at a restaurant, it just never appealed to me. This steak was tender & again, seasoned well, no A1 necessary! (For the record.. I love A1).   The cheesecake had the option of strawberry (or raspberry?) or chocolate sauce to go with it but I hate unnecessary sauces on desserts so we took it plain. I think desserts should stand on their own without any sauce decorations/distractions, or at least put that crap on the side. We were pretty full by that point so we took the cheesecake to go & I actually ate my half for breakfast this morning.. Ya sometimes I have the eating habits of a five year old, don't judge!  Our server kept our drinks filled & checked on us regularly. Overall it was a good experience & hopefully it won't take me another 20 years to come back!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why one day I was craving the steak here.  I went to another branch once back when I lived in California.  It was packed for a Monday night.. mostly snow birds.  We got tilapia, sirlon steak special, and a rib eye steak. Took the waitress a wihle to take our order, she brought us over bread that was super fresh and hot, very yummy.  Tilapia was a lot better than I expected, seemed like it would be overwhelming if i ate the whole thing though.  My friend said the sirlon was good.  As for my rib eye steak I ordered medium rare but it was well done.  I felt bad to bother them at such a busy time but I couldnt eat the well done steak it was way too dry.  They were nice and made me a new steak but it took forever.. both my boyfriend and roommate were done with their food when my new steak came out. The new one was juicier but didnt have much flavor.  Not a big fan of chain resturants.. they always cook my steak too much, just my luck I guess.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had the crab cake dinner. It was expelled by my lower body less than 15 minutes after I got home. DON'T EAT THE BAD SEAFOOD IN THIS PLACE!!!!  We were dumb enough to try again. I had the Tilapia topped with crab.  Terrible, Fish overcooked, dry. Crab was like eating cream of wheat.  Please, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Outback opened this location up in the mid-90s. The fact that me and my family have never stopped going back should say something.  Outback is, essentially, an American restaurant with an Australian theme - mostly represented by the names of items on the menu and pictures/items on the wall. Pretty much any standard American dine-in restaurant fare you can find here, but they have a few other surprised on the menu as well.  The atmosphere in here can get a bit crowded and noisy at times, but that's to be expected of a place like this. Wait times can be frustratingly long during peak hours - even calling ahead doesn't help much. Fortunately, outside the restaurant there are plenty of benches on which to wait, so you won't be left standing.   The staff are extremely friendly and courteous - these people really go above and beyond what I see at most restaurants of the type. They are good about taking requests if you want an item done a particular way, and are very good about correcting any mistakes they may have made. One night, we were in the restaurant and they were packaging up our leftovers (which we were just taking home to give to the dogs anyway), but they accidentally threw them out. Before long, a manager was at our table apologizing, and even gave us a free dessert as a way of making it up to us.  The food itself is some of the best this reviewer has ever had. There is a little bit of everything, and none of it bad. The potato soup here is to die for, easily some of the best I have ever had. The entrees fare just as well - try the Victoria's Filet with a horseradish crush, and you'll see what I mean.   The long wait times to get into the restaurant during peak hours and the fact that this location is not open for lunch are my only real complaints. If you want a dine-in restaurant with great food, look no further than Outback."}
{"text":"I am very glad to say that the filet Mignon is perfect, perfectly seasoned, cooked so good you can cut it with a fork. The rest of the food is very delicious as well. I am also very satisfied with the service. Well done to this Outback Steakhouse location. I have been to others that were not near this good. A+"}
{"text":"An hour wait when we arrived at 6:30 PM.    When we got seated our waiter greeted us right away. Joey was an excellent server. Very professional & checked in with us often throughout our dining experience. He kept on top of everything from start to finish. This is why I chose to add an additional star!   Meals are moderately priced. Many great appetizers to choose from ; the Aussie chain's signature, app. is the 'Bloomin' Onion. Entree selections vary from seasoned steaks, prime rib, chicken, seafood, to pasta. 2 side options are available.   We started with the wings -had them add the volcano sauce. They were average in flavor and a little to greasy for our liking.  Main meals- buffalo chicken sandwich, which my hubby added the rest of that volcano sauce to. It was probably the best meal! Our daughter had the 6oz sirloin and coconut shrimp. Steak was cooked perfectly! I had the pork chop & mashed potatoes. Came with a salad. Salad was tasty, mashed potatoes & pork were just average.   Again service was great, but I don't think we will be back anytime soon. Chain restaurants can loose their appeal over time & unfortunately this one has for us."}
{"text":"Did call ahead seating and they told me it was busy so I might have to wait, the wait was less than give minutes.  Our waiter Phil is a great waiter, haven't come across too many of those lately so it's a nice change!  We ordered a blooming onion and it was a bit small and without saying anything they brought us a second one!  Food was great, atmosphere was comfortable.  A nice dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Outback since the first time I went in.  My recent visit was less than stellar though.   First of all they were out of the beer I ordered.  I have as not that sure I wanted a beer anyway so it wasn't a big deal.  I just had water and my girl had a glass of wine.   Next we ordered the Bloomin' Onion which I have always loved and my girl too.  It came out quickly, but seemed a little over done.  Seemed slightly burned.  Regardless it as not so bad and I was hungry enough that I wasn't going to send it back.   I ordered a ribeye  with baked potato and a side salad and my girl just had a side salad. She was going to share the steak and potato with me, which was enough for me with the Bloomin' Onion, and didn't even finish all the onion.  They brought out a second plate and did not charge us a plate fee that some places do.  So I was pleased with that.  The steak was good but they didn't bring any butter for the potato.  We had asked for the fixins on the side because I only like butter and my girl likes it all.  So I had to wait for the butter.  The steak was fine though, I ordered it Medium because of Outbacks different interpretation of wellness.  I usually like MR but that is too rare for me at Outback.  Service was good as usual, just a couple hitches and I will he back."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Service is always fantastic. Jillian, CJ, and Randy are some of the best bartenders in Paradise Valley. Server Russell is super friendly, proficient, and professional. The management team has always been on point and accessible. I definitely recommend this particular Outback!!"}
{"text":"WOW!  What a terrible place to dine. Where to start. The awesome blossom was drenched in oil, which left it soggy and lifeless. My first plate of salmon burnt to a crisp and tge re-fire was just above sushi. Our waitress Karen, was basically non-existent. No bread, no drink refills and our billed was messed up. I would not recommend this place to another living soul."}
{"text":"Lavaughn was the man. Took excellent care of us and was genuinely interested in giving us a fantastic experience. The food was pretty good, I'd never been to an outback and didn't expect much but the 3 point blooming onion was exactly what I was hoping it would be. Thanks again, Lavaughn!"}
{"text":"Ribs are great just wish they gave you a lil more for the price and the salads were a lil bigger. And If you only like veggies for a side they don't have many choices, it's the basic melody."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner and salmon was raw.  They took my 1/4 piece of salmon and took to kitchen and microwaved it!!! Came back like rubber. Nothing taken off bill. Never asked is everything was better. We go here at least three times a month will not be back. Not to mention they are now adamant about using the Ziosk on the table. What the hell are waiters for?"}
{"text":"Always a good meal when we eat here. The service is always great and the atmosphere is chill."}
{"text":"Service was Excellent, salad, steaks, and a blooming onion were ordered and everything was WAY TOO SALTY! Drank 3 bottles of water after we left. I would have given it a five for overall except the salt issue really ruined the flavors."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was not busy at all on the Friday night we visited. The building is well-made and the interior is well-kept. The staff was friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my five dollar Margarita! It was very surprising to find such affordable drinks here on the menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Victoria filet mignon.  I haD the smaller portion I think a 6 ounce, he had a larger portion I think it was a 9 ounce. I ordered mine medium well he ordered his medium. They ended up not having the mashed potato side I had ordered so I ended up having to switch my side right before the food was delivered. Odd that did they did not have their popular mash potatoes at 6:30 PM on a Friday? I definitely should've ordered the larger size because it was a much thicker cut steak my boyfriends me it was put perfectly and a medium. Mine however was very thin and very overdone.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Our first time to the Outback for a family dinner, and it was great.  The food was excellent and the service outstanding.  Best baby-back ribs I have ever had!  Everyone was extremely pleased with the meal.  Best of the year for us!"}
{"text":"They are famous for steaks but really, they do no wrong. I got the pork chops and was a happy girl. The service was great and exactly what we needed after a long day at the convention."}
{"text":"We made a reservation on mother's day, but when we arrived, they didn't have it in their system. That was a bit frustrating, but we have never had issues before, so I'm going to choose to see it as an anomaly.   The wait to get a seat was nothing compared to the wait to eat. It took way. too. long. I know it's a holiday and so there were more people than usual, but I would think a chain restaurant would learn to brace for events like this. But I would guess this is not the norm for non-holiday events, so this review probably will only apply to you for those special days.   Bread & butter is a highlight. I ordered the salmon and it was delicious. I appreciate the fact that you can switch up sides with no additional charge.   You know what you will get when you go to a place like Outback, so that's a win.   I'm personally more of a fan of non-chain establishments, but this isn't a bad option for consistently good food."}
{"text":"This review applies only to this location as it is the only location I have been. Okay so I've been here three times, every time I have been disappointed. The first and second time the food was mediocre and overall very greasy! And not good greasy lol the kind if greasy you want to soak up with a napkin lol.  The third time was a joke! My friends, my fiancé and I went, I ordered a steak well done, emphasizing the \"well\" because rare makes me gag a little lol anyway we got our food about an hour later, my steak was beyond rare, but I tried to work with it since it was a busy night, I cut the edges off but in the end it was practically still alive so I sent it back.(while waiting for the waiter to take it I had cut the rare steak into about 4 pieces.) about 40 mins later- my friends had all finished their meal, I still had nothing to eat except the measly 4 shrimp they put on my plate and the waiter came back with the 4 cut up pieces I sent back except they were on a dessert plate and charcoal black! My friends and I all stared at the plate for a minute before we figured out that it was the steak I had sent back, I told him to take it off the check which he seemed upset about but did. I haven't been back since and I won't go back again lol."}
{"text":"Been here twice in a month! I truly wish I knew the servers name a few weeks ago! She was AMAZING. In her 50's short hair, just a great lady!  Food was spot on, timely, no complaints at all there!  The reason I could never give Outback 5 stars is the pricing is a bit overboard!  But with it being close by and service is good, I'll be back yet again"}
{"text":"Usually I have a good experience at this Outback, but Sunday night was a horror.O finally asked for the manager she never did come. Horrible service, finally just left. I will go back, but who ever is on watch. When  there will here about it.  Also bathroom was a pigstye."}
{"text":"Cheapest drinks on the strip probably !!! Food is consistently good with this chain. I love the Victoria filet mignon! Service was great!"}
{"text":"I like the Outback.  It may not have Ruth's Chris quality steaks but it also doesn't have Ruth's Chris prices.  The Outback has good tasting steaks (and pork, ribs, and fish) that most of us can afford.  Also the service is quite good as well.  So I recommend you go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I first went here to have dinner with a former teacher of mine and the service was average to say the least. We both ordered our entrees but shortchanged us with the salad, although we were both supposed to get a salad.  Anyway, the food was very large in portion but very good. My main criticism would be seasoning. I ordered the garlic chicken and I felt it was a bit lacking in flavor and no amount of pepper would correct this. The mashed potatoes and broccoli were a saving grace to the dish, since the saltiness and the buttery taste of the potatoes and the freshness of the broccoli compensated the lack of flavor in the chicken.  I would recommend going to this place but keep an eye on what you've ordered and don't e afraid to correct them for they are capable of error, sadly more often than expected."}
{"text":"Since I've been eating healthier I haven't been to Outback. I guess it's a place that thrives on sodium lovers?  The Mushrooms and Blooming Onion were so salty I couldn't eat them. The steak and lobster were good. I had the pecan wedge salad, lettuce was a little brownish, tasted meh.  We had to remind our server about things we had requested several times.  The person who had tried to deliver our apps tried to give us the wrong one, then made a face when we told her it wasn't ours.  Other than that it was ok. Probably stick with Applebee's ."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  I feel like they are serving dime store steaks and such.  This is not what I remember Outback being like at all.  The waitress was not very attentive either.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"Food was great hats off to the cooks and the Executive Chef. But have a issue right now while I'm here at the restaurant with my family. My waiter is still missing in action and refills are never attended. I been waiting for a check so we can leave while I still writing this post. Finally he shows. Thanks for the great food!!! My waiter is a nice guy and smiles but never here to build his tips. Sorry but I do speak my mind. Please don't take me wrong we are still coming to your place. Why is because this company has a great cooks, Great Job!!!   Jayson Wells 702-335-1035"}
{"text":"I creepily eat here probably once every two weeks.  What can I say... there cheese fries are fabulous, and their salads are yummy.   I also recommend getting the No Rules Pasta with no protein (vegetarian) and sub the normal sauce for the fuego sauce.  The sauce is spicy and absolutely perfect.   If you go in and there is a long wait, it is good to remember that the bar is first come, first serve.  I never wait longer than 5 minutes because I typically get a seat in the bar area.  They also do call ahead seating, a definite plus.  So if you are going on a busy, just give them a buzz as you are leaving the house.  The staff here and be hit or miss.  When they are good, they are GOOD and when they are bad.... let's just say I have a few that will not be my server again."}
{"text":"Do not order the Cobb salad here it's nothing but a pile of lettuce with a little bit of shredded cheese and three cherry tomatoes cut in half horrible! I've had better from Wendy's!"}
{"text":"Very average. Sent back the Salmon which was under cooked. Later it came back from the microwave still pretty raw. So no magic at this restaurant. But not terrible either."}
{"text":"I spent 70.00 and I would have had more satisfaction setting it on fire. We had so many issues during this meal that I don't have enough time to type them all. It was HORRIBLE. We got an apology but we should have been comped. These restaurants don't seem to understand the power of Internet blogs and reviews. Only go to eat ere if you like to be frustrated, unsatisfied and at the end... F***ed with no lube."}
{"text":"We were three for dinner on Monday evening.  We asked to sit outside and were seated right away.  The hostess did forget to come back with a table cloth and only left us napkins and utensils for two but that is the only negative I have.  Our waiter was personable and very efficient.  I had the teriyaki steak medallions which were wonderful and so tender I really didn't need a knife.  The other two both had the center cut sirloin which they said was done perfectly.  I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"It's an Outback, so the food is consistent with any other location you've been to. This is our regular location and we continue to go back. Some of our servers have been very friendly and helpful, others average. We've never actually had a bad server here, which is a plus. Only twice I've had problems, and one time it was fixed promptly, to my satisfaction, and the manager was apologetic and offered me some soup while I waited. But the other time the manager on duty (the short guy with a mustache) didn't want to assist me, so I have adjusted my rating from 4 to 3 stars and refuse to ever buy alcohol there ever again.   The problem (if you want to read on): Our server said domestic beers were $3, and then charged me $4 for a Shock Top, and refused to believe that a 'Belgian Wheat Beer' was made in St. Louis. By the time the manager arrived, I had pulled it up on my smartphone and he said it's a \"craft beer which is a dollar more.\" I reiterated that I was told \"domestic\" beers were $3, and to my surprise he continued to argue with me, and then sort of huffed off like a toddler to adjust my bill. And he must have gone for a smoke or to help someone else because it took more than 3 minutes to do this, and point-of-sale computers are not that slow."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar. My steak was cooked exactly medium rare but over seasoned. It had so much pepper on it that it made me cough...and I love spicy food. I was with a party of 5 but they only brought one loaf of bread; we had to ask for more. The bartender was friendly, but our server was an apparition."}
{"text":"There are Outbacks everywhere so I think everyone gets the gist of their theme; STEAK! And lots of it.  Also famous for their Australian background and bloomin onion.   We ate dinner here a few evenings ago.  The food pretty good.  The Bloomin' onion, which we ordered as an appetizer was amazing as it always is.  That sauce they serve it with should come on everything they make! I don't even know what's in it but man it is delicious.   I got the sesame salad with grilled chicken. It was a really good salad with large strips of red bell pepper, shredded carrots, cilantro and different sesame seeds through out.  The chicken was really well seasons and it was tossed in a sesame vinaigrette.  It was light, yet filling. The reason for me giving three stars over all was the service was quite a bit slow for how not busy it was and what we got.  We waited quite awhile for the appetizer and the person I was with got a steak quesadilla for dinner, we were in there for over an hour and a half. I will say as soon as you get there they bring unlimited bread and butter to your table to munch on! I"}
{"text":"Mike in the bar, is awesome!! He can multitask  makes a great margarita!!Staff is super friendly. The Parmesan crusted chicken is amazing"}
{"text":"The meal was tasty. Service was prompt and our waiter was courteous and attentive. I ordered the crab cake, mac and cheese, and salad. My salad was a little bitter because the core of the head of lettuce was used rather than only using the leaf itself."}
{"text":"We came in last night after going back and forth with a number of restaurant options. We were so glad that we decided to come in because we were not disappointed! Anthony was our waiter and he greeted us promptly and our drinks arrived within a timely manner. I ordered the 8oz prime rib with a side salad and mashed potatoes. My husband ordered the Kookaburra wings and fries, and my son had chicken tenders and fries. All of our food was presented timely and was correct. My husband requested volcano sauce but after tasting that bleu cheese dressing, he didn't even use the sauce. He ranted and raved about how fresh the bleu cheese was even though he typically doesn't even eat it! My prime rib was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. It was tender and the mashed potatoes had great flavor. From beginning to end, our experience was a pleasure and we'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We always get the same thing Victoria fillet with the baked potato and a house salad with blue cheese dressing. Can't go wrong with that meal. It is the closest thing we can find to Texas Roadhouse in Austin where we moved here from. Service is a bit slow due to how busy it is. Our Server/bartender Wendy was great. Very attentive. The food just took a long time to come out but Wendy made sure to keep bringing us that delicious brown bread and brought our salads out herself."}
{"text":"My Dad always have told me \"Don't go to a steakhouse and order a burger\". I should have listened to that advice. I was out shopping and call in an order to Outback. Cheeseburger and Fries. I got a $10 overcooked burger with no cheese on a hard bun with cold fries. I like Outback but I have to say that this location is hit or miss when it comes to the food. The young lady that was working carry out was a nice young lady but she needed some help."}
{"text":"I want to grade on the sirloin 6oz steak I got. It was honestly not what I expected. I got it medium rare, it was not so tender or soft to chew. Meat tasted ehhh like if it was frozen. My sides where fantastic by the way , I really enjoyed that. I got the macaroni, mashed potatoes , and a side of grilled shrimp! Yummy! I really enjoyed that. I just wasn't pleased with my sirloin sadly."}

{"text":"Ok, I've gone to outback just a couple of times. The last time was a couple years ago and the steak I had was pretty terrible and tasteless. So decided to try them again. This time service was pretty good. Drinks came before was done with the first. That's nice since drinks are 2.50. The steak tasted good. The texture not so good. Kindof gritty. The tortilla soup was nice, as well as the broccoli. Wife's seafood dish was decent. All said, I was expecting a little better quality food for the price. Did I mention our blooming onion was over cooked? They where nice enough to take it off the bill..."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar tonight on a Monday. The first thing I hear from the bartender is complaining she wants to go home. Okay moving on... waiting for her to take my drink order... waiting ... a food menu is tossed my way. Easily she pours my beer. I quickly decide what I want to eat.  My salad arrives. Thinking she would bring the standard bread I waited a minute. Nope no bread. Salads croutons taste soggy no crunchy (dressing was on side )  Meal arrives. Still no bread. Dang it I love outback bread and tonight could use the carbs.  I dive into my steak a potatoes. Potatoes cold and flavorless. Steak alright nothing special about it, a bit over cooked from my rare order. Half way though my meal I asked for break when she asked me how it was. She looked stunned like I had just dropped a bomb on her. Wow asking for the standard.  Tosses a curled up piece of paper on the bar top near me. Must be my tab. Suppose I don't want another beer or dessert... I wanted both, but cut my losses. Here for a few weeks on business won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"We are  in town for a soccer tournament. They stuck us in a corner booth that wasn't cleaned my foot is literally in some sticky stuff right now."}
{"text":"Swing and a miss tonight! We arrived and waited upfront with another couple that had been waiting for someone to seat them for over a minute. After we sat at our booth in the bar, a neighboring server came over to greet us. She returned a couple of minutes later with drinks and five minutes after that our server arrived. We ordered the NY Strip and Sirloin and Lobster tail special. Both steaks were overcooked, lobster tail was rubbery, baked potato tasted like it was microwaved. Server came by to check on us well after we got our food. I made her aware of all of the issues we were experiencing  and simply requested fresh fries with extra seasoning. She returned with the fries literally 45 seconds later. Surprise, Surprise the fries were not fresh. At the time we were in the restaurant there were only 5 other tables dining. The cherry on the sundae is the manager on duty comes over 15 minutes later. If this was our first experience at this location we would just not return but as we have dined here several times before. Tonight it seemed like our server was over worked and the manager just did not care. Not a compelling reason to return, especially when a new restaurant is opening next door!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive  Everyone knows outback but, as an allergy friendly place I found it very accomidating. The menu allergy won't blow you away but, any restaurant that at least makes an effort is okay by me.  I had the burger w/o the bun, veggies, potato, and a nice salad. They have dessert ice cream with sauce but, I didn't get it."}
{"text":"We have been frequent customers of this Outback, and are extremely disappointed after this evenings visit!!! While eating on a Saturday we understand it is busy, but the service and food tonight were unacceptable. After waiting to be acknowledged for about 5 minutes, we placed an order for drinks appetizers, and entrees. We received our drinks and appetizers without issue. When our entrees arrived, about 15 minutes later, is when the trouble began. I ordered a Cesar salad with shrimp and dressing on the side. When the salad arrived, the shrimp was still translucent and cold, obviously not cooked long enough. It took our waitress 10 minutes to return and check on us. When she finally did, I asked for the shrimp to be cooked more thoroughly. About 10 minutes later, a salad completely drenched in dressing arrives, with cooked shrimp. At this point, completely frustrated I ask for romaine lettuce with a side of Cesar dressing to put my cooked shrimp on. Finally 30 minutes after the original entree arrives, I received something close to an acceptable meal. Having worked in the service industry I was shocked that the manager did not offer an apology, nor was anything from our $70 meal comped. We would rather spend our money somewhere else...such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Good spot. Can't complain about prices for a good steak and great sides. Had a good time tonight with a group of 10- service was a little slow but no orders were messed up! Very good sides- recommend fries, Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, loaded potatoes. And steak, of course! Good place to go for young kids. Recommend going earlier so you can grab a seat, parking lot was packed!"}
{"text":"Where did outback go , my broccoli was mushy , my grilled pork chops could've substituted as a chew toy for my pitbulls, and my daughter's baby back ribs were baby got fat back . I won't waste my time or money here again especially since there are 2other steak house within  3miles"}
{"text":"After a long night of drinking, I was craving a steak.  Outback was the closest place to a steakhouse near me and since I've always had a good experience there, it was a sure win!  This location is a stand along building on the south side of Sunset avenue, in the same lot as Lee's Discount Liquor and Wildfire Lanes.  If you've been to an Outback before, you've been to them all.  It's filled with wooden panels, neon lights and seems to be very consistent with every Franchise.  I did appreciate the fact that there was a separate entrance to the Take out service, as I was in my PJs, however, the take out area was SUPER small.  There was already someone else waiting there and already seemed to be very packed.  Don't get me wrong though, the staff was super nice, super attentive and more than willing to help me out, however, thank goodness I called ahead.    For dinner, I got the 12 oz. Ribeye steak for $22.49.  One of my favorite cuts of meat, well marbleized, savory and full of flavor.  I ordered my steak medium rare and on the wood fire grill.  For the sides, you get 2 btw, I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and the steamed green beans.  The green beans were crunchy and fresh!  I can tell they were sauteed a little in oil.  The mashed potatoes were nice, not too creamy and wasn't garlicy at all.  In fact, I couldn't tell there was garlic, really.  The steak was seasoned very well.  I highly recommend having it done on the woodfire grill as you'll get a smokey flavor.  The inside was cooked to my liking, however, it seemed my steak was overly stringy.  Now I've had many Ribeyes in my days and have always had it medium rare.  This cut seemed very close to a Chuck eye, rather than a ribeye.  I'm sure it wasn't a chuck eye, but I don't necessarily think this cut was top notch.    This visit was just alright for me.  It wasn't a stand out in my book.  I've always stood behind Outback, so I know I'll be back.  Hopefully my next visit to this place offers a little more than this last time."}
{"text":"Just had a date night here and had the greatest service from Sydney S. We kind of came towards the end of the night and I felt really bad because my husband is a server and I know how he feels when people come at the last minute. However Sydney took very good care of us and didn't make us feel like we were rushed. She even encouraged us to get some dessert at 10 when they were supposed to be closed. So thank you Sydney!   In regards to the food, we ordered the sampler appetizer and it was alright. We always can't decide between the cheese fries and the blooming onions so it was nice to have a sample of both along with the Mac and cheese. For our entree we decided to share the ribeye and grilled shrimp with a side of baked potato and house salad. The grilled shrimp was my least favorite because It was salty. The ribeye was decent and flavored well. The baked potato wasn't anything too fancy and it had all the works on it. The salad was bigger than I remembered and I got full off of that. The mustard dressing was good and I liked that they don't drench the salad. This place is great if you're wanting steak and too lazy to cook it for yourself."}
{"text":"Very delicious Steak on the barbi I had with my lovely wife. Would recommend to all this establishment."}
{"text":"Update 10/2010:  This Outback has improved over the last year in terms of service, so I have updated my rating from three to four stars.  Their food is always consistent and delicious.  The music is also better - it's no longer straight pop and is a better variety of rock that appeals to more of the masses.  Outback menus are different based on the location, and while I was initially disappointed to see that my favorite dish (toowoomba pasta, with crawfish) is not available at this location, I have enjoyed their slightly similar version (the \"No Rules Pasta,\" with a choice of shrimp, scallops, or chicken in a parmesan cream sauce) as a good alternative.  My husband's steaks have always been cooked correctly to order.  The alcoholic drinks are VERY tasty, and the blueberry martini is quite good.  I am very pleased to see the improvements at this location and definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst Outback. I've used the take away service a few times and the results are always the same.... Food is never ready when quoted, my order was wrong and the food I did receive was cold. Do not waste your time and money at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had at any outback chain the manager was threatening to kick my ass and literally walked halfway to my hotel next-door and was cursing at me because I simply returned their steak that was over cooked  as hard as shoe leather it was a terrible experience terrible food cold vegetables I wouldn't  bring my dog to that place. Terrible management that guy should be fired on the spot the customers always right I would not advise that outback at all to anyone save your money !!!  Better off going to Taco Bell"}
{"text":"This location just opened. The place looks nice. The staff is friendly. We ordered the steak and all you can eat shrimp. We had the Victoria Fillet Mignon. They were both prepared nicely. The shrimp was more of \"all you can wait for\" shrimp. Only 1 plate(for each of us) came out during our meal. The crispy shrimp was nice, the other shrimp is drenched in a sauce that we didn't care for."}
{"text":"Never had the best customer service to begin... But last night we decided to go in for dinner and drinks. Sat down and waited about 25 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. No one even looked at us. Walked out and went to longhorn across the street. It's sad, we drive all the way up from casa grande for date night frequently but, we wont be going back there again."}
{"text":"Service started off slow and poor. Slowly improved through the meal. Food was exactly as expected and the same quality it has been for 15 years."}
{"text":"Service was great . Food was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised since I have not ate at an outback in many many years! Kubaburo Wings and steak were great!"}
{"text":"If you can't really afford to go to a high end, food snob, steak house and you're craving a steak, where do you go?  Yup, Outback.  We went early on a Saturday evening and our service was great.  Our drink orders were taken promptly and drinks were brought along with bread.  I had not eaten all day so I was hungry.  Our server suggesed some \"Aussie Fries\" as an appetizer.  Ok, I love fries, so sue me.  And these were covered with cheese and bacon!!!  OMG!  So yummy!  They have a good kids menu with many choices so my daughter loved it.  I ordered a special that they were having, a tuscan style steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The steak was juicy, tender, and cooked medium well with just a little pink in the middle.  It was great!  The potatoes were ok but the green beans were done to perfection, still a little crunchy.  All in all I enjoyed my dinner and so did my daughter.  Our server came back several times to check on us and took the time to talk to my daughter as well.  Will we be back?  You bet!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby. I went with some gift cards, and lowered expectations (chains usually underwhelm this local food partisan) to soften the blow, but in the end I was pretty happy. The martinis could have been bigger, but my lobster was better than expected. The lady's steak, a 'victoria filet', was perfect. The standout was the rare tuna app. Prices were high for what you get, and the ambiance and location sucked, but service was friendly and skilled.   Probably my favorite thing about dining at corporate chain hell restaurants is their renaming of standard dishes/drinks in line with the chain's theme. Outback's Bellini is called the 'Wallaby Darned'. Flair."}
{"text":"The service was good and the Manager was helpful, but the prime rib was really lousy. I used to love eating here and either the quality of the meat, way it is cooked, or both has gone from excellent to epic failure. The restaurant was completely empty at dinner time Memorial weekend as customers have caught on."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night. The text ahead app is awesome. Although it did seem like the seating was pretty quick in general. Ordered a glass of wine and a Huckleberry mooshine cocktail that was super tasty! I ordered a filet/lobster tail combo. The filet was awesome. ..the lobster tail was the was the only downer for the evening. Our server was nice and friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Growing up I loved outback. Everything from the delicious bread, blooming onion, and cooked to perfection steaks. Haven't been to one in years and I finally convinced my fiancé to go here with me. Let's just say that we will never be back to this location and I'll have a hard time getting her back to one in general. We walked in and was greeted by a very polite male hostess. His brief service was the best thing about this trip. The first issue we had was the female manager was belittling the male hostess in front of multiple customers because a waitress asked to have 7 tables and he obliged. There are better ways to handle that situation and she showed poor management skills. Next issue. Waiter was terrible. We ordered waters and he immediately walked away. I had to call him back to order the blooming onion.  Side note: I don't eat onions but because this was my fiancé's first time I thought it was only right to share it with her. After about 10min I had to ask for the brown bread. Usually that was the first thing you got as you sat down. The bread was nothing like I remember. Terrible. So far not looking good overall. The onion comes out and the 2 inner layers are golden brown as it should be then the rest of the onion is charcoal looking(picture below). Tasted exactly like charcoal. We didn't even eat half and pushed it to the end of the table. I ordered steak,asparagus,sweet potato. My fiancé ordered pasta with grilled chicken(picture below). My meal was good except I literally got 5 half pieces of asparagus. Steak was cooked well (only positive). My fiancé pasta dish was nothing special and lacked a lot of flavor. The chicken was burned on one side and rubbery. While the charcoaled blooming onion sits on the end of our table the manager walks by to do the \"table touching\" and as he is walking by, looks at the onion,says everything good? And before we even have time to respond he has already passed our table. Never stopped for a second. Management, the food, and overall service will keep us from ever going back here. We might try a different location but not for awhile. Thanks for disappointing Outback and how about putting management on the barbie'."}
{"text":"This place couldn't cook a steak if it was cooked for them.  It's a steak house. How do you under cook someone's steak??????  They are over priced over priced over priced and their food is ok at best.  The steaks are tough too.  The 3 of us that dined here would never go back.  We didn't enjoy anything about it and oddly enough when we told other people that we went here, they too said WHY?? The steak is not good there and tough.  Gee I guess we should've asked other's first before going."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day. We figured it would be busy so we came at 2:00 thinking there wouldn't be a crowd then. We were correct, it was not busy. However, even though the place was mostly empty, we still had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Maybe they should've scheduled more waitstaff for a holiday like this. After we got our table, I excused myself to use the restroom. I walked around to the other side of the restaurant where there were a lot of empty tables, but two tables seated. Next to those tables were waitstaff, completely blocking the pathways to the restrooms on both sides. I was left standing there with no way around either one of them. Perhaps some rearranging of the tables would be useful so customers who want to use the restroom aren't left standing there like idiots while they wait for a clear path. They took forever. The people in the tables looked at me like I was strange, the waitstaff never looked at me. Once back at my table, the waitress told me Happy Mother's Day. I am not a mom, it was awkward. She took our drink orders. When she left we noticed one of her long very blonde hairs was left on the table. We didn't complain, just removed it. When the bread came, I put my napkin on my lap. Moments later I felt cold, and then realized my dress was wet/damp. The napkin that I placed on my lap was wet. When our waitress took our order, I told her my napkin was wet and asked for a new one. She said it's because the silverware is wet sometimes when they roll it. I again asked her for a dry one. Even though she walked past our table many times and they still weren't busy yet, She never brought me a new one. I had to ask her again after our salads were brought out. When our main food came, a different wait staff delivered it. I don't like that because how is our waitress supposed to know if anything was wrong with our order? One of the baked potatoes was supposed to have the toppings on the side but it didn't. The guy who delivered it said he would get us a new one and he did. Our waitress never asked about the potato so I'm guessing she didn't know. She only checked on us once. My dads steak was supposed to be medium rare but it was still mooing. Definitely, not medium. The shrimp had no flavor other than the taste of a grill. And the pasta was spicy. Waitress said it had red pepper flakes in it. I couldn't see any but it would've be helpful for that to be on the menu description."}
{"text":"I get that Mother's Day is supposed to be busy but laaawwwwd, the service here is the worst. My family and I had a reservation for 6pm. It was 11 of us. We waited 35 minutes for our table to be ready. No big deal. So when we finally sit down, the waitress is extremely inpatient trying to get our drinks. We get our drinks and she never asks if we would like appetizers or anything. Unfortunately, I did not get her name because she never bothered to introduce herself. So anyway, when we finally get our food, maybe 5 minutes into eating, the waitress asks if we need to go boxes......are you kidding me????? WE JUST STARTED EATING. We obviously said no and she left visibly annoyed. She never came to check in on us. Never asked how our food was. Soooooo, literally 10 minutes later, SHE BRINGS THE CHECK. She was beyond the worst waitress I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"One reason people go to chains is they expect consistency. We arrived at 5pm on a Friday and the hostess explained we couldn't have one of the dozens of empty booths b/c they didn't have enough staff on. We chose a small high-top table and once the bread, salads, and appetizer showed up the waitress asked if we'd like to move to the booth behind us. I said, \"We were told we weren't allowed to.\" She said, \"That's weird.\" I agreed and we moved. They were out of the beer I ordered off the drink list. Also, my wife usually orders the mixed grill but we were told they no longer have vegetables or rice. So we decided to stay anyway and I got a prime rib that was 1/3 fat. I expect some fat, but I thought to myself, if I ordered the smaller cut would they have given me the same piece and just hacked of the all the fat? It was okay though. Fries were soggy. Wife liked her chicken entree and tuna appetizer but overall we were disappointed. The highlight of our meal was or waitress: attentive, polite, and professional. Her name was Jasmine. Great job Jasmine, maybe you should be the manager."}

{"text":"I used to like this place but the service seems to really lack and that food can be rather expensive."}
{"text":"I can't speak for their steaks, but Outback has some pretty good appetizers, drinks, pasta and shrimp dishes.  My favorites are the coconut shrimp and the boomerang shrimp.   And their dessert, cinnamon apple oblivion is soooo good. I haven't tried the others yet, but I saw a couple new ones on the menu last time I went."}
{"text":"Overall, this place was very good. Our service was decent, as well as the time it took to make the food. The food was good. Salads are nice (except the spicy onions). Soup is delicious. Steaks were excellent! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to eat in Vegas, but don't just take my word for it ."}
{"text":"I usually come here when I'm craving a cheap steak. They've got a great price on the 4 course meal choice at the moment and it includes soup, salad, an entree and dessert.   The alcoholic drinks are a bit overpriced and there isn't much to choose from. Also the service was absolutely terrible. I don't neccessarily think it was entirely the waitresses fault though. It was later in the evening and the place was empty, but any time someone came in they were sat into the section that our waitress was assigned to. Why dump all the customers on one waitress when the rest of the place is empty and the other waiters were just standing around. Piss poor planning in my opinion.   Despite doing all the footwork, she was very nice and checked on us when we could. Half the time we couldn't hear what she was saying due to the screaming child sitting behind us. That's great that you take your kid with you everywhere but it's 930 at night, put them the fuck to sleep!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this Outback Steakhouse to celebrate a late Valentine's Day dinner. We had a great time thanks to our server Cori! We ordered some drinks. I got the Gold Coast drink which was basically a house Margarita and let me tell you BEST DECISION EVER. It was the best margarita I ever had!! Then we had our soup appetizers and our entrees! I highly recommend the baked potato soup it's so delicious. We both got the bacon bourbon salmon. The toppings/bacon/flavor on it was delicious but the Salmon was alright (it is a steakhouse after all). Anyway then she recommended the \"Chocolate Thunder From Down Under\" which was some brownie ice cream and it was amazing. She checked on us often to make sure we were okay and was very attentive. Overall terrific service! If you're ever in the area, request Cori's section, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I almost always check my order before leaving any restaurant. Last night I didn't, and I was very disappointed. I ordered the (2) jumbo crab cakes to go. I got home to have a meal with my friends and there was only (1) crab cake that was falling apart. I was too far away to return the meal."}
{"text":"You know, I don't venture in to chain restaurants often, and even less often a chain steakhouse.  So how did I find myself at Outback Steakhouse?  It was a quick business trip to @Vegas.  I was treating for dinner and they asked for steak and convenient.  We were both staying at hotels well south of the strip so this limited the choices - nothing on the strip is convenient.  Didn't I see an Outback by the Outlet Mall?  Yes.  Weary business traveler settles for dinner...  I must say I have not been to an Outback in probably 6 years.  It was not as bad as I remember.  That would not make a great advertising slogan, by the way.  My 6 oz sirloin was fine.  The salad was fine.  The service was fine.  By fine I don't mean \"fine dining\" I mean \"ok dining\".  See you in another 6 years, Outback."}
{"text":"We went to this Outback a few months back when they had the sirloin special for under $20, don't remember exactly how much. It was the most horrible steak I've had. They would have received a minus 1 star at that time. I haven't been to outback in years and was extremely disappointed at this experience. I emailed the restaurant when I got home  and expressed my disappointment. The owner, Christina, reached out to me via a phone call. She explained the issues they were having and invited me to return and give them another chance. Well fast forward 3 or 4 months- my husband and I went for dinner tonight, Betty came out and met us she made sure we were taken care of. Hubby and I  both ordered the rib eye medium. Brian our waiter explained that they'll under cook their meat, so that medium rare is more rare. Our streaks came out perfect. We are so glad we gave the Outback on No. Rainbow another try. We are very happy with the food and the service amazing. Thank you for a great evening to our waiter Brian, Betty and Christina, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner with EARL it was fun and nothing like that sippy cup g eluded to. He took care of us and when we had an issue that was not even his to fix he got someone right on it. Earl da bomb"}
{"text":"Just up the road from us really like their take-out how you can pull up to the curb and they bring it up to you that's really convenient. Food is always good."}
{"text":"Umm, don't expect your server to supply you with your items you ask for, like water and A1 sauce, when requested. Better keep at it"}
{"text":"Great customer service!  Sat at the bar and was greeting immediately and had drink within a min or two.  Bartenders (Tiffany & Melanie) were very friendly and welcoming!  Food was excellent but the service was OUTSTANDING! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Apparently curb side take out doesn't mean they bring it to your car. Even though they advertise they do and all the signage states they do AND they alway have before... They didn't this time. So, eventually i went inside and  they told me they don't bring it to the car when they are busy. I guess I'm supposed to know when they are too busy. Total lack of courtesy and professionalism as well. Obviously it's a management issue."}
{"text":"Last time I came here with my family the service was so awful I told my husband I won't come back. It's been well over a year and the craving struck.  Luckily decided  to give it another go. Tara k was our waitress and was absolutely perfect. Everything was served timely and we were checked on often.  She had many tables and was very attentive and friendly to everyone. Our food was good too."}
{"text":"Restaurant is located in the second floor of the Best Western Hotel and parking was conveniently available free of charge from the Hotel. We came for lunch and the restaurant was not that crowded so it was nice. Service was good and quick. Had the Steakhouse Salad and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming here sporadically over the years and overall had good service.  I think it's safe to say that with my most recent visit with my in-laws, coming here is now going to be a tradition for us as we have been coming here for dinner during their visit every year for awhile now.  We've never had issues with our food thankfully.  Sometimes the fries can be really salty like my recent visit but was still edible.  I wish the Bloomin Onion wasn't always so salty either.  It is still a favorite among my family.  Service can range from mediocre to really good.  If really good service was consistent, I would've rated higher.  This isn't a bad choice for date night or dinner with the family."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhh.  Had blooming onions. It just didn't look appetizing in real life.  Ordered the appetizer trio with coconut shrimp. Crab avocado lump with tortilla chips, and ahi tuna. The shrimp was really bad. Puny shrimp overly deep fried with maybe a flake of coconut shaving on top? The other two were edible.   Steak was edible. Eh.  What I found surprising (amusing? Confusing?) Was that every time our glasses were about half full, someone would automatically give us a new glass of water or soda. So by the end of meal, there were like 9 glasses on the table for the four of us."}
{"text":"Great service from beginning to end! My steak was a perfect medium rare and hers was well done and still had a great taste!"}
{"text":"Outback S Strip hit a New Mark for me! WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!!! LIKE EVER!  In my life! Dirty seating, lethargic staff who was combative about every valid point brought to their attention! I asked for a new server so we could start fresh......... They honored our request but to no avail same shitty combative service..... They brought one of our party their appetizer wrong, then replaced it (so two trips to the table) and I still hadn't received my appetizer (the same soup btw) ..... I could go on but I'm over it! Stay away! Word to the wise!"}
{"text":"I can't blame the restaurant for having a screaming child a few tables away from us, so I would say the overall atmosphere is very nice but maybe a little crammed for space. My server was very nice and polite the whole time and the food came out hot and tasted good. I've only been to a few Outback Steakhouses and I felt this one was overall a good location. I would go back for sure"}
{"text":"This is our first time to one of these. Love it! The calamari & marinara sauce was so good! And the warm complimentary bread-omg. We had the buffalo sandwich & the 8oz steak.  Both really good. Only downside (which is why I gave it 4 stars; actually I would say its more 4 1/2) the steak was a bit too rare. But it was still good. Service is also great. It was ok priced for all that we got. Desert is a must!"}
{"text":"This was a good experience nothing bad to say. Service was excellent and we had one problem but they took care of it for us. We will be revisiting in the future. There pork porterhouse was very juice which isn't a bad thing and there garlic Mash potato were very good as well"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times, and every time it has been great, but the most recent time was exceptional. I came with a rather large group without a reservation knowing that it would probably be a little wait before we get seated but we were seated very quickly and our server Taylor was absolutely amazing. She got everything we needed and we had no issues with our (rather complicated) order - something that rarely happens when I go out with a group larger than 5ish people. This is definitely a great place for a dinner with family, friends, or nice date night."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and luckily due to their online reservation system (more like a call ahead) I only had to wait about 12 minutes whereas everyone else coming in had to wait a minimum of 30 at least that's what they were telling people. When you walk in there is someone with an iPad and they greet you as well as go ahead and check you in--very friendly faces as soon as you enter! The ambience is super nice which is probably due to the restaurant being so new.   Once we sat down our server Henny was super nice and on top of things. He explained the specials to us and showed us how to use their iPhone ap. The only downside was that after we ordered it took us almost half an hour to get our food which is probably due to it being a Saturday night at Concord Mills. We did the unlimited shrimp special and Henny made sure we never had to wait for our shrimp refills.   We ordered steaks and both were medium well but one was very pink but we didn't make a fuss since our server was so nice. Overall, pretty good experience and we will definitely go back if they continue the unlimited shrimp deal!"}
{"text":"Came here because this is a favorite restaurant chain of our friend whose birthday we were celebrating.   Of the six salads, three did not have Caesar dressing. We flagged the waiter who said that it was probably at the bottom of our salad. Then he went back and told us that he checked with the kitchen and that we were wrong but he brought dressing for us anyway.  Everything else was fine and we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"I tried to order takeout today. Called Outback, was put on hold for 5 minutes and then they hung up. Against my better judgment, I called again, waited on hold for 4 minutes, and then placed my order. They told me it would take 10 minutes. I got there 10 minutes later and waited in my car for another 10. The man next to me said he'd been waiting for 25 minutes!!!! An employee had been in and out of the building a few times and no one had helped him. I went inside the restaurant and everyone that I approached said they would help me in a minute.... no one asked me what I needed or what they could do for me. It was not busy in the restaurant at all - 1pm on a Saturday. I checked to make sure I had all the food I ordered and left. When I got home, I found out that none of the sauce we'd ordered was in the bag and the Aussie fries had no bacon on them... I like the food at Outback but this experience was very disappointing... 10 minutes just to place an order and another 40 to find someone and actually get my food....."}
{"text":"since i had been there once before and my steak was perfect i decided to go back and order a steak again, well, let me tell you, i ordered my steak really well done and it came raw so i sent it back then they brought it back burnt so i told them i couldnt eat it so the manager took it off the bill and said to please order something else i said no but since he insisted because he did not want me to go home hungry i ordered a $15 meal. i left my husband at the table and went to the bathroom when i came back he had paid the bill and to my surprise they charged me for the meal.Really. i complained to corporate and they apologized and sent us a certificate so since we never heard from the sahara managers, we went back to where we used to go to the outback on rainbow and lake mead which is further but everything was perfect as usual. the manager Betty was friendly and made sure that my meal was the way i wanted it.  thank you Betty."}
{"text":"I will preface with I am a vegetarian (I do not eat land or sea animals) and my boyfriend has been begging me to go here with him for over a year. Finally, last night, I decided to go. Our server (can't remember his name) was seriously so attentive to us and really tried to help me order something. Even on a Friday night he helped me come up with a vegetarian quesadilla. My boyfriend loved his steak and was happy we had such great service because he knows now we will be coming back more often :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff & consistently good food when it comes to preparing a steak.  Traditional restaurant where you get warm bread, a salad, your meal and a side with many good options. Tonight we enjoyed the unlimited option of shrimp to compliment my steak. They had fried shrimp and herb/garlic which came out pretty quick after making a request. The sirloin can be a tough piece of meat but I like it prepared medium and the price for an 8oz to me is great. I do like the Victoria cut but it's all about getting the biggest bang for our buck when 4 or more of us.  We had good success with the staff and bartenders for each of our visits but we look to sit in the bar area when it's available as we like the TVs and more social upbeat atmosphere!   Kids meal options are also reasonable and the mac & cheese is a hit (ain't no kraft)."}
{"text":"I had never been here before. But, I went to get a gift card for the holidays. The bartender and 1 of the waitresses were absolutely awesome.  After talking to them, I decided to get an order to go.  Delicious!  Best salad ever!  And, everything else was superb!  My husband loved his dinner.  We will be going here from now on.  :)"}
{"text":"Obviously you aren't going to get something that will outshine steakhouses on the Strip, but in terms of chain restaurants that have tasty food and are a relatively good value, Outback is more than okay by me.  I think the fact that there has been a wait the last two times I've been to Outback says a lot about how the average individual feels about them."}
{"text":"Had a good dinner tonight. I'm really liking there new menu with new items to try. I recommend the rid eye sandwich melt. It's very good. And it seems like the service has gotten a little better since our last visit here. Keep up the good work staff."}
{"text":"I still haven't gotten my main course, but I needed a knife for my French onion soup and the bartender didn't even think there was anything wrong with that...."}
{"text":"My husband and I attempted to eat there a few nights ago. We were seated along with  our (2) small dogs, one service and one regular pet. They have their own red wagon that they  sit in along with bowls and food. So..... There's no access to any food on the patio...in addition to being practically on the sidewalk.  The Hostess seats us-no problem, waitress arrives- seems mad cause she's ready to take our order...but we haven't been given menus,or  silverware,napkins or water. So she goes off to get menus...In the meantime the Manager walks by returning from an errand outside the place and pets the dogs.... Waitress comes back...with menus and takes our drink order...at that time I ask for a children's menu...as my  husband 81 year old mother enjoys when we bring her 'grilled cheese' back to her.....The next thing we know: 'Cody' a 'manager' shows up at our table...'Saying' we can't feed the dogs...and in fact they can't  even have water...he goes off on us...and then the yelling starts...we proceed to high tail in out of the place.... So...it's almost 9 o'clock at night, we waited over 15 mins, in that time we received menus and were yelled at my some low level 'manager'.... He doesn't stop there...he follows us out of the Outback Patio area...almost to our car...I had to tell him to please leave us alone....it was Extremely embarrassing as well as upsetting....Finally...the actual Manager who had walked by and pet our dogs shows up with another man Manager... Tried to soothe the situtation..... Offered us to come back and eat and/or did we want something to go?.... After being 'ran' off the property we didn't feel to comfortable returning...... Ever.... Reading reviews... It's not surprising that thery were pretty empty...apparent the food is 'marginal' as compared to other Outback's.... And Lastly, the  Main Manager, takes my email...says he's gonna contact me in regards to the 'situtation'.... It's been over 4 days...No Email.... It's too bad really, they have a wonderful patio, that has no Direct access to food/they could definitely draw pet owners by opening up that area... I realize the 'Health Department' oversee the guidelines to allow that, but they actually seem to be able to do that.... What our main issue was.... Why did 'Cody' have to come butt in and treat us the 'Way' he did...we went to eat NOT get YELLED at..... Some Customer Relations training for the staff is necessary.....ruined our otherwise perfect day!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ALWAYS make it a spot to eat dinner because the service is great and the food is fantastic! I have been to the Outback where I live but this place must put something special in the food because it is \"THE BOMB\"! I ordered the spare ribs and they were fall of the bone super.  The time before that I ordered the pasta and again, super.  Just go already! LOL We plan on going back again in May so we will probably stop there again."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I ate here a couple of weeks ago. The food was really good and fresh. Outback is one of my fav chain steak houses and this one had a really great staff!  I don't remember the girls name but we wrote a letter to her manager telling him how good her service was!!! I hope she won the contest amount the other servers!!!!!"}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I love coming here for one specific reason: CHICKEN. TORTILLA. SOUP. Their chicken tortilla soup is so perfectly cheesy and delicious. Sometimes, I'll find myself randomly craving that more than the steak!   The steak at Outback can either go one of two ways, perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way you want it, or tough and hard to eat. I usually get my steak cooked to medium rare and it's always perfect in my eyes. However, I've seen people complain to the restaurant about the meat being \"too tough\". Fortunately, I've only had great experiences here! The staff is usually very friendly and loves suggesting certain appetizers or things to compliment your steak.   Outback is a chain restaurant, and usually I don't care for anything belonging to a major chain, but this is my one exception. I suggest you try it out, and hopefully you'll have a great steak experience too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I at at this Outback last week with friends. The staff was wonderful and the food was great. We will be back to visit again."}
{"text":"If you sit by the bar you will smell smoke from the front doors being opened & smokers sitting in bar.Also, if you get water,it comes from bar area water tastes like Olives, awful.They put heavy salt on all their food,so you cannot eat it.  From their appetizers to meals all Real salty"}
{"text":"So I have been wanting to go Outback so today is the day I decide to go with a friend so we go to the one in Mentor.... Okay so here it is we go and sit down where the hostess sat us but my friend and I couldn't sit there perhaps a customer behind us had BO so bad so friend and I get up and went to hostess and asked if she would move our seats. Just had to throw that in so now we get our waitress and she was very nice we first order Cheese Fries and they came out OH MY GOD looked at my friend and said where are the French fries????  They were so small and usually they are real big like normal fries so when the waitress came back I asked if this was half order or full order and her reply was full I could not believe my eyes they were good but the portion was terrible   I have been going to the outback for years since they opened I was really upset seeing that you pay almost 11.00 dollars and I feel like I got ripped off.  Oh and no bacon on the cheese fries and no seasoning after I said please make sure seasoning is on fries. So the next thing was they are out of baked potatoes it was almost 4 o'clock I was like okay then when I ordered my salad I wanted the croutons and the waitress says she old out them so I am like okay just looked at friend and said how strange. Going forward I order the chopped salad I receive my salad which is my favorite comes out with no and mind you I know what comes on it no blue cheese and no pecans so I asked waitress if she would please bring me some which she did. The manager walks by us and I stop her and told everything that is going on.... How I was not happy and how I have been coming here for years and mentioned YELP if she knew what it was and she said Yes.. So I proceed to tell her how many people put negative feedback and how there portions or short and never been before and how I probably won't be back and so she apologized and I said maybe you need to talk to the district manager about this and she kept on saying sorry and she could tell that I am a Outback person because I surely know the menu. Bottom line I am not looking for anything free I am a waitress myself and it is the company I explained and told this needs to be fixed because of all the bad write ups is not going to keep you in business.  Okay so she told me she wants me to come back gave me 10 dollar gift card and free app the next time I come back which was nice but again didn't want anything just wanted to explain how upset I was about portions.  The manager and waitress were very nice. Will I go back because 10 gift card and free app not for a couple months maybe they will see this and all the messages on Yelp and  take us serious about there food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! The lobster melts in ur mouth and our server Justin was awesome and friendly"}
{"text":"I like Outback and this one is close to me.  Last time I was here, I found a shard of very sharp plastic or glass in my parfait cup.  The manger was VERY concerned and very nice about the situation.  She took care of it, and took care of my next visit.  Usually the steak and service is very good. I will go back."}
{"text":"Very good food and good service also!  One of the nicer locations I've been to.  The bread was warm and soft. The steak was a little chewy cooked at medium. Still would probably go back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it has always just been mediocre, service and the food.  Service is hit or miss.  And we all know that I'm not crazy about chains, but sometimes they are most convenient.    I came for Easter Sunday and did the call ahead seating, so I called about 40 minutes in advance for a party of two.  When we arrived, we were seated right away.  The server was new and a little slow, but there wasn't a rush or anything, so it was fine.  I am giving the four stars because this experience was the best one so far.  I had the steak and lobster and the steak was phenomenal.  I was extremely surprised at how wonderful it was.  It was a filet and cooked medium well (don't judge).  It melted in my mouth.  I loved everything about this last meal and would definitely give it a try again."}
{"text":"Went out for son's birthday last night.  Restaurant has a smell very dirty vinegar wash rags when you walk in.   Disappointed in service very slow to our table but helpful to another.   The salad is supposed to be a chopped salad (I love their salads) and the lettuce was overlooked in the chopping process.  Hope next visit is better.....have always loved this location and their food previously."}
{"text":"Very disappointed as a veteran to their Veterans Day menu, if you could call it that. They offered drinks and what they call the bloomin onion which is basically a deep fried onion ring dish. That was the extent of their Veteran's Day menu. If that was the approach that myself and my fellow veterans took to some of our conflicts, we would have been given 5 bullets and a slingshot. This is an example of corporate greed where they try to attract new customers by offering a Veterans Day menu with some complimentary dishes. This is a form of dishonest and self-serving false advertising. This veteran as extremely disappointed with Outback Steakhouse."}
{"text":"our server spenser was horrible, forgot 60% of what we had requested but its understandable because anyone can have a bad day. **all was well until it came time to pay. i received and egift card from work and wanted to use it. i have a screenshot of the egift on my phone. i showed it to my waiter and he asked if it was ok to keep the phone so that he could charge me. i had no issue with that until 20 minutes went by and spenser was no where to be seen with my damn phone.  i have credit cards, my families social security cards, and much more personal info on my phone. when spenser came back he said he wasnt able to process the card because once his manager arrived to view the card my phone had locked. wow 20 minutes with my phone in your hand and you were still not able to process the payment? that part got me a little pissed but what blew my mind to oblivion was when i unlocked my phone and my phone was in my email screen narrowed to one specific email with my grandmother. there is no reason why my phone would be on my email screen. i then asked him for a pen like i should have from the beginning and wrote down the  egift card info. i then asked the hostess to speak with the manager and advised of her of the situation. she said that for some reason my egift card hadnt worked. notice how the story changed?????? i dont know if she participated in whatever spenser did to my phone but it made weary as well. i told her that i needed spenser's name and last name because my credit cards were going to be watched extremely closely. she apologized and got him and he complied in giving me his last name. becareful and watch your credit reporta people! you mever know where your info will be stolen from! ill be calling corporate and their general manager tomorrow to make sure they review cameras!"}
{"text":"I didn't wait in any lines and got seated swiftly.  I requested a booth and got one quickly.   The waiter came over and I wanted a drink but non-alcoholic. He recommended a very delicious drink, and I enjoyed it, so thanks to him I got to try something new. I am not sure what it was called, but it was a fruity drink, with strawberries.   Bacon Cheese Burger sounded great, and it also tasted good. I am very pleased with the service here."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars I would give five. My wife and I really gave this place a chance with four visits. No more. Here's the readers digest version: wrong orders, fatty filet and wrong cook on steaks every time. This is a steak house right? Just poor management or ownership because it is bad from start to finish. Wrong orders, wrong prep, I could go on but I have better things to do. Last night was the same twenty minute wait then two sets of dirty silverware, heck one knife had food hanging off of it. The server brought our salads with no dressing so we sat there for five minutes with no dressing and dirty utensils. We got up and walked out. There is no way it was getting better.  End of story and last visit for us."}
{"text":"Went early (4:15) to avoid the Valentine dinner crowd and, although I counted 6 empty tables on my way to the restroom, we were told there was a 45 minute wait. So we went to the bar for some drinks and a bloomin' onion. Wait was about 25-30 minutes. Salt on the bloomin' onion was WAY heavy, as was the salt on my dinner of ahi tuna. Service was so-so, but our server appeared to have a bustling section of the restaurant. I wanted a bloomin' onion instead of roses this year, and though a little disappointing, I got what I asked for!"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday with a friend and decided to have the four course special for $14.99. I was not disappointed. I was totally full and my steak was awesome. My server,  Sydney, was on point the entire time  we were there and took really good care of our table. I'm not sure why the other stars are so low, but this is now my outback location from now on. My food was great and my drinks were awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had their $12.99 Wednesday/Sunday deal and it was so worth it! It was very good. My boyfriend also had a key lime pie martini and he really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"We are frequent outbackers, so frequent, some servers know us. Service and food is always good, just depends on what night you go, sometimes there is not enough severs. But love the food!"}
{"text":"Great food but sub standard service from an Outback.  Our waitress never came back after delivering our food to check our drinks and mine was gone no water either, WTF?  From Outback????, I would expect more service for sure as I know how they treat their customers.   Again the food was really good as always."}
{"text":"Best outback in Las Vegas..you guys should already know this place but if you don't I recommend the bone in rib eye with a blue cheese crust...decent price and good steak comparable to a overpriced steakhouse"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place!! Brennen and Kris (aka charlie) They have fun working together!  They reality care about you having a great dining experience. They Rembert our names. Family atmosphere! ! Best place for Lemon drop martini! !"}
{"text":"We come here a lot and we really enjoy our time here.  The food is always great and we love the atmosphere.  My wife had a steak and I had the ribeye steak.  We started with the ahi and the bloomin onion.  We loved the food and had great service from Jessa.  She's been our server before and always is friendly prompt and doesn't make mistakes.  We will definitely be back for more.   Thank you"}

{"text":"Slow serves and every time we wanted to ask for sauce or napkins or utensils the waitress walked away. Oh and you should have seen her face when we said we were splitting our meal. She completely changed from friendly to 'I might as well half-a** it since there won't be a huge tip'."}
{"text":"Really bad experience......all of the food was overcooked and it took forever to come out. Server was nice but not overly attentive. My kids ordered off the kids menu and this was the fruit they received. Outback has been on a downward spiral for some time now.....well, we will never come back! We never saw a manager the entire time we were there. Not sure what that managers were doing because they weren't talking to customers and they sure weren't making sure the food was correct out of the kitchen"}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant about 3:45 pm on a Sunday afternoon. Not busy so we were seated promptly. However, about 10 min passed and no server had come to our table. As I approached the hostess to inquire about a server, Lacy appeared and apologized for the delay. After getting our bread we had to wait for her to return again with plates. Appetizer was delivered by another server and by the time we saw Lacy again we needed more sauce. Next up, dinner was served and we did not see her again until she brought the check. Food was good and lacked in nothing. Just hope this helps for future patrons who like us are spending our hard earned money at establishments with exceptional service."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times as it's a good place for my parents and I to all agree on.  The service is friendly and personal.  They are great at recommending the right steak or cocktail to try.  The downside is that I have had to send steaks back for being overdone, and veggies for being underdone, after being specific on how I like it.  I don't know why this is, as the servers always listen and take good notes.  They always get it perfect the second time, but it makes the wait for the whole meal longer than it has to be.  I will say they are nice about honoring coupons, giving you the best possible deal.  I'll go back, but only when I'm not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I know it's a big chain. Whatever. Hey, I had a $25 gift card, and we needed nourishment prior to the Fu Manchu show at Altar Bar.  And Namaste, which is a bit closer to the city, didn't open until 5pm. This Outback opens at 4PM during the week.   For some reason I think this Outback used to be someone's house. I could be wrong about that. I don't believe it's been here all that long. To date, it's also the only Outback I've ever been to. My last visit was a few years ago.   I have push/pull feelings about Outback's fare, particularly when it comes to their Baby Back Ribs. Since I was craving ribs after attending the Heinz Field Rib Fest over the weekend, I was...in the mood.   Again push/pull. I honestly do prefer my ribs to be tender. They should dissolve on the palate in my opinion. The sauce can be tangy, sweet, spicy (I like them all), but it better be good.  And their sauce isn't one to complain about. It's a thick sauce that's tangy enough. The ribs strip off the bone with such ease I barely needed to use my fingers. However, they have the flavor and consistency of bacon or beef jerky. To me that wasn't a bad thing in itself, but it's not what I prefer, and I doubt most rib lovers prefer them this way either.   Other than that, the side dish of soft-bellied fries with crispy, seasoned armor went well with the capable ranch dressing. The house salad was ideal with Outback's own dressing; a mustard vinaigrette that was probably the best house dressing I've had in many moons. And they already dress the salad with it (it's on the bottom of the veggies), which is proper. Although, the waiter offered to serve it on the side in case I didn't like it and also offered to replace anything else that wasn't to my liking.  Outback gets an A+ for service fer sure.   My date (she got steak and coconut crusted shrimp) and I got The Sweet Adventure Sampler for dessert, which consists of a slice of their Classic Cheesecake (we got the raspberry sauce), a slice of the Carrot Cake, and a small version of Chocolate Thunder From Down Under, their take on the hot fudge brownie sundae, my fave rave sundae of them all. Ironically, I liked the cheesecake best as it was rather flawless. The Carrot Cake was good enough with its cream cheese icing but could have been a little more moist. The CTFD is made with Blue Bell ice cream and has the standard toppings with choco shavings added for good measure. It was ok, but like the carrot cake, the brownie could have been richer and was also a tad overnuked. These are minor complaints, however.   So yeah, 4 stars. I'm going to try their steaks the next time I come here, if I come back, and while I had a decent experience, I'm not absolutely dying to return. For a chain restaurant, they are pretty rock solid and have waitstaff that are quite good at what they do.   OH! I forgot about the lemonade. It's pretty darn tart yet refreshing.   What is it with me and lemonade lately?   OH! That pumpernickel bread rocks harder than AC/DC or Angel City (lesser known Aussie band). I dig how they serve it warm to you upon being seated with that whipped butter and that large Crocodile Dundee knife. It's so barbaric and so metal. \m/  Based on this location, Outback honestly doesn't suck or screw anything up."}
{"text":"We had one last gift card left to unload, and it was for Outback. We hadn't been to this one yet, so here we came.  After a 20 minute wait, the little pager thingy lit up and vibrated, and we were seated.   Yeah, Outback packs 'em in, and they deserve to be this busy. Damn me for saying that about a chain.  Kay almost ordered the Shrimp and Filet, but was thwarted by the most personable and honest server I've ever run across anywhere; Daniel H.   \"I wouldn't order it if I were you,\" he said with a sheepish look on his face. He then went on to say it tasted like roast beef. To prove his point, he even brought out a slice of it for us to sample ourselves. I kind of liked it as it tasted like prime rib to me, but I digress...  Kay ended up ordering the Outback Special & Crabcakes. I didn't get to taste her \"signature sirlion\" as they call it, but I thought her crabcakes were a notch above average.  I went with the Bloomin' Burger, which is a burger topped with petals from the famed Bloomin' Onion and that magnificent sauce they serve with it.  Let's face it, you get the petals to get the sauce. I got the burger to get the sauce and the crunchy onion petals, all of which worked well with the fresh ground magic that is the burger patty.   I've been told that one should never order a burger at a steakhouse. Whoever came up with that rule needs to try one of Outback's burgers.   Dan was so cool, he even let us get flexible with the sides. I am tired of fries, and that Dressed Baked Potato was callin' my name. I mean, have you ever seen the pictures?  Unlike many an online dater, DBP looks as good in person and tastes even better. Man had I been craving a big, obnoxious, dolled-up-to-the-nines spud, and this delivered with a smile, a dance, and a song, not to mention loads of sour cream, bacon bits, cheddar shavings, and chives.  Our app was the Ahi Tuna. It was almost Sashimi as they do cook it rare and serve it cold. Sashimi snobs might wanna give this a try. You get about 8 thin squares per order draped over a chunk of lettuce and two dipping sauces, a wasabi vinaigrette and a creamy ginger-soy. Call us n00bs or a poseurs or whatever, but we both liked this and never expected to find a dish like it at Outback.  Outback has a kickin' new dessert called The Strawberry Waffle Shortcake, something you think would have come straight out of the quaintest little diner you never heard of.   Four cloud-like homemade shortcake waffles are stacked atop one another. In between each layer is a gorgeous custard of some kind (they call it  'almond sweet cream') along with toasted almonds, strawberries of course, and this ridiculously good whipped dreamcream.  \"Hey Dan, is this whipped cream made in-house?\" I hadda ask.  Dan grins, pauses for a second, and nods his head.  \"I knew it!\"  Seriously though, I really wish more restaurants would make their own whipped cream. It's so much better than what comes out of a tub or aerosol can and really pushed this already incredible dessert, one that is probably Outback's best to date, into the ozone.   Outback's Down Under fare is truly Above Par. Kudos again to Dan, one of the best servers ever."}
{"text":"I love coming here especially around 11:30am - right before the lunch rush. Food is alway hot and the drink is always full. The staff is friendly and smiling. I love that every couple of months they change stuff in the menu and the lunch menu is always great prices and full of wonder. Come and get some good food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed - we are fairly new to the east valley and were pleased to find this restaurant close to our new home. We ordered our meal for \"take-away\" and they were not good.  My flat iron steak, ordered med rare, was well done and therefore very tough and my broccoli was over cooked and mushy.  Luckily my husband's T-bone, which was ordered med rare, was med well - so at least we had something to eat.  Guess we'll try another location or restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible. Very unfriendly and unconcerned. Server took 30 min to check on us/ask how are food was, meanwhile we were waiting for steak sauce and ketchup - basic condiments when you are served steak and french fries. Food was subpar. Steroid asparagus. Extremely salty French fries. Medium well steak was pink.   One positive thing I can say is that the shrimp was tasty."}
{"text":"Love the food love the atmosphere . Our server Giana was very attentive to our needs and offered up great service for a great experience !"}
{"text":"Great food, love the rid eye with onion ring ;) also the big bowl of chocolate dessert yum!"}
{"text":"I am staying at the Hampton inn that has the Outback Steakhouse attached to it. I called the restaurant to place an order to pick up. I wanted the sesame salad with ahi tuna on it apparently this item is discontinued so I ordered a house salad with ahi tuna on it. When I picked up my order it was $4 more than the salad that I was planning on ordering. The salad was mediocre. The tuna was delicious but not worth the money. If this meal was a better quality I wouldn't mind paying $17 for this meal but it was subpar. Basically what you expect from a chain restaurant"}
{"text":"We visit Outback frequently when we are home in California and tonight we visited this Outback inside the Casino Royal. The service was great and the food was even better..... We haven't had a great experience like this at an Outback in a very long time!! Thank you Scott and Theresa for the great service!! You were both so kind and attentive to our needs. We will come back during our next Vegas trip!!"}
{"text":"We went for an earlier dinner that was even before 4pm.  We were able to sit in the bar area to want sports on one of the televisions.  Service was great, server was polite.  Enjoyed coconut shrimp.  I missed the lunch special before 4pm. I ordered a large order.  But would have saved a few dollars with the lunch special soup & scrimp special.  Make sure you look at the menu it could have saved me a couple of dollars.  Food was very good and served hot."}
{"text":"You can usually expect good food and service at Outback and today was completely opposite. Came out for my moms birthday dinner and we didn't even care to mention it so we could leave even sooner.  Hopefully they correct their lack of service."}
{"text":"Everyone's food upon arrival was great. Very disappointed with the server/service. Everyone's food came out yet not my plate. They brought my soup and salad but how could you forget the entrée? Just slightly confused there."}
{"text":"Not very often a vegan goes to a steak house but sometimes when dealing with a large group of people, that's where you end up. While waiting for our table (my only complaint... our table was not ready until 45 minutes after our reservation), the owner was walking around offering samples and chatting with the waiting patrons. At that point, I mentioned my special diet needs and discussed options with him. I also alerted the waiter when it came time to place our orders. Neither the owner nor the waiter seemed annoyed by my special requests and went out of their way to make sure that I had an enjoyable meal of pasta and fresh veggies. Thank you for going above and beyond."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch, and were served by Dave who has been extremely outgoing and friendly the last 2 times we ate here. The food was good, but not exceptional on this visit. The 4 starts is for the extremely friendly greeting and service from start to finish.  No specific lunch menu was observed on this visit."}
{"text":"The service from everyone else, except our server Eileen was great. Food was ok. The prices semm to be much higher at this location, than off-strip locations."}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was subpar for the price. Both steaks were subpar in quality"}
{"text":"If I would give the server a million stars, I would. Basically everything went wrong, but he was really nice and made it suck less, so we land on a generous overall rating of 3 stars. This location sucks for two reasons, 1. they do not know how to cook a steak to medium, 2. the manager was rude when attempting to \"help\" fix the problem. There's also a very limited menu, the bathroom is absolutely horrifying - and I won't go into detail.. but they say a kitchen is as clean as the bathrooms, so that's unsettling. They had to re-do my steak 3x (and I promise you, I'm not \"that person\" ever) the first time they put the steak I cut into back on the grill, which restaurants should not do. My server told me they were bringing a new steak.. apparently mgmt was trying to cut costs, and corners. The second steak was supposed to me medium just like I initially ordered, and it was so rare that it was purple on the inside rather than some pink. I eventually got a well done steak, which I ate because i was starving and my colleagues who were out with me had already finished their meals."}
{"text":"Not a fan of chain restraunts, however my boyfriend's mom really wanted to come.  I enjoyed our server, although slow. And my steak salad was great if not for the poor quality of steak.   The worst part was the bathroom. On my way out I had to let the staff know how unacceptable the cleanliness ( specifically the smell) was.  I will NEVER go back unless all I want is the Bloomin' onion which never disappointes ( how can it...its fried onion!)"}
{"text":"On the rare occasion, it's an Outback kinda night. Honestly, I haven't been to an Outback since moving to Vegas (that would be over 3 years ago!), but when the craving hits for sweet potatoes and salads, and we don't feel like the measly effort it takes to do it ourselves, this is where we have historically headed. This location is in our hood, so it made the decision to Outback it even easier.   And, for an Outback, this was a 4-star location thanks to the wonderful service of Sean and 2-for-1 wine during happy hour! The sweet potato was perfect. Hey, it may be hard to mess up, but I've seen it happen, and the salads were served up on a cold plate (love that detail!). We couldn't resist trying out the steak and half rack of ribs for $14.99. When the \"half\" rack of ribs hit our table, and we questioned that 3 ribs qualified as a \"half,\" Sean did not hesitate to run back into the kitchen and fire up additional ribs. It was a finely tuned Outbackin' machine."}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door and promptly sat in a booth, my daughter is 8 months pregnant so she had enough Space to move around very important. The server to come by offer us drinks or appetizers  brought us warm grain bread delicious, we also ordered blooming onion  just a bit greasy but good. Crab cake was good  but was served at same time with the soup instead of individually , then our food came out pretty quick .  They didn't have asparagus available so we had the green beans which were done very nicely. Steaks were cooked to order. Service was good kept our drinks full."}
{"text":"Outback has always been my favorite restaurant in fact, it's where my husband and I had our first date.  Unfortunately, after last night we will never be back (not to this location at least, if we ever do go back). Over the last 6 months we have noticed a decline in patrons (used to be an hour plus wait to get in) and the service started getting pretty bad as the waiters and waitresses became upset that the restaurant was dead. That is expected, but my steak has been overcooked Every Single Time! we have come.  I even make it a point to order it under what I truly want (thinking that it will be what I want when it arrives) so I always try ordering medium rare and \"they\" (the waiter and my husband) always convince me to order medium assuring it would be cooked correctly and the waiters say they will \"see to it\" or \"tell the cook\"..  It Comes Out Well Done EVERY TIME!  I've been \"talking him into coming\" here for a year when he wanted to go to another place from the beginning Well, never again! I had to tell him \"you were right!\" For The Last Time!  No More overcooked and hard $25 Steaks for us! Outback,  we gave you too many chances.. If you don't want to go out of business, you should probably try to focus more on giving great experiences and better customer service, and less on rushing through food orders to get customers in and out as fast as possible! Good Bye.."}
{"text":"I loved my ribeye steak and sweet potato! Their curbside pickup is very friendly and efficient! Definitely worth the trip and cost!"}
{"text":"I did have a bad experience with the drive up about a year ago.   They did send me a gift certificate when I complained. My other experiences have been great and I have to tip my hat at the improvement."}
{"text":"Sampler was very good and we had a coupon from savy shopper and it was great ! 2 for 40 amazing deal with desert there new bread pudding is delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. This is the first time I tried this place for lunch. The bread is delicious. I had steak and thought it was a bit overpriced for 6 oz."}
{"text":"It's Outback Steakhouse, which are pretty much the same across the country. There is nothing exceptional about the food or menu at this location, but I am leaving a review because of the excellent service I receive every time I visit. They are always friendly and almost always get the order right, even on pick up orders.  One thing I will suggest is a simple phone tree that tells the hours and lets you select to order a pick up. It can sometimes take a while for them to transfer the call over."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because it was neither great nor awful.  This was my first time back to Outback, being probably 6 or 7 years since my last time.  I ordered the 8 oz. sirloin steak and was expecting a very good steak.  Like my wife tells me, either of us can cook a better steak at home.  There was nothing special about it and I had to put salt and pepper on it just to give it some taste.  My baked potato was good as was my side salad.  My wife ordered the fish tacos, which she liked with a side of a sweet potato.  We didn't want a full blooming onion so we ordered a plate of onion petals.  Not much comes on the small plate of onion petals.  But, they weren't great so I'm pleased we didn't spend extra on the full blooming onion."}
{"text":"We had lunch with friends at this outback, what a wonderful meal we had. All of us were more than pleased with what we ordered. We definitely are going back. I am a very picky person, when it comes to my food, more than happy with my meal."}
{"text":"Normally I would not have given five stars to an Outback. The food was OK. The service was excellent. Kelsey D was great."}
{"text":"Came here several weeks ago.  Service was great. Our server, Lindsey, was friendly and totally on it with our orders and suggestions of what was new and good on the menu.  We visited from Hawaii and she was wonderful in what people from Hawaii say \"talk story.\"    \"Talk story,\" basically means conversing, as we informed her that we were in the process of relocating.  It was nice to know about her and her decision to relocate as well.    The food and portions were huge as my bf and I couldn't finish our apps and entrees.  We ordered their new lobster/seafood bites, a smaller portion of the infamous onion bloom.  Both were good and fried to perfection without having that oily aftertaste.   I ordered the tilapia with pure lump crab meat and both the fish and crab was moist and cooked perfectly.  Although, dessert would have been nice we both were too stuffed to even attempt it.  I surely will be back here again as the food is good and service is top notch."}
{"text":"Waited 40 min after we realized they sat the whole rooms and even though there were people that came after us with no reservation they were all happily eating by the time they sat us.  30 min after seating us we ordered I received my \"rare prime rib\" more than well done thankfully I ordered it rare. Shout out to the chillies down the street I ordered chicken and steak fajitas waitress was amazing manager stopped by to check on us. Outback you should take your management team and stop by chilies and try to emulate their customer service skills"}
{"text":"I went to celebrate my birthday. I brought a gift card and told the wait staff I'd be using it. After ordering a soft drink my partner ordered tea. I got water to his tea. Next I ordered a filet and then received a sirloin strip. The server, not original waiter, even identified it as a sirloin steak. I requested the filet I'd ordered but was then schooled on what a filet really is. Frustrated and aggravated, I received my bill. Once the 25$ gift card was applied I still owed 25$ for my partners shrimp and tea meal. No alcohol beverages were ordered. Outrageous and truly insulting. If you want others to choose your meal choices for you and you like condescending conversation by your servers then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"It's no secret - Prime Rib is my favorite meal.  Period.  I've been to this Outback Steakhouse many times and haven't been disappointed.  I've had prime rib from other area restaurants and haven't had the consistency that Outback has given me.  Sure - they're a chain, but I find their consistency something I can rely on.    What consistency?  Well, I don't recall ever having a fatty cut of meat here.  All my orders have been great - no complaints.  The baked potatoes have been good as well.  I enjoy the bread on the side - always warm and tasty.  I haven't had service issues here.  Everything has been solid.  I know when I come here I'm going to get a great, satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Had the filet with lobster tail and shrimp. Yum! Just what you expect from an outback"}
{"text":"Very loud! Food okay. Not really worth it. Generous rating."}
{"text":"Just left this Outback after our very first visit. We normally go to the one on Las Vegas Blvd.  Let me start by saying the service started out good with a quick drink order and a Free Bloomin Onion Monday.   My husband decided to order the Sirloin and unlimited shrimp. - Steak ordered Medium  My 16 year old son also ordered the Sirloin and unlimited shrimp. - Steak ordered Medium Well  I ordered the 6 oz Filet and unlimited shrimp. - Steak ordered Medium  Food arrives at the table and I immediately cut into the center of my steak checking for a correctly cooked steak. My steak was cook medium well, not medium like I ordered.  Now, I asked the waiter before ordering how they cooked a medium steak and his response was to open their menu and show me a picture of a perfectly cooked medium steak.   My shrimp was extremely over cooked and I couldn't stomach eating another bite. Now if you've had over cooked shrimp, you know exactly what I'm talking about and how gross it can be!  My sons steak was a perfect medium well, which is what he had ordered. His shrimp was kind of edible.  My husband cut into his steak or should I say he tried, but it was extremely over cooked and the temp was more than WELL! Imagine a dry hard steak!  His shrimp was just okay. They took his steak away and said they would recook another one medium. He ate his shrimp and patiently waited for his new steak to arrive.   Finally it arrived and he cut into the steak to reveal a Medium Well steak, again not a Medium! He told the waiter he would just eat it since he had already waited long enough and was very hungry. He and my son ordered three more orders of shrimp.   The three additional orders of unlimited shrimp never came and we finished eating. The waiter came to inform us we would receive one free dessert for our troubles. My husband informed him they had not received the other three orders of shrimp and he said I'm sorry and walked away. 60 seconds later a lady brought the shrimp and I told her we were finished eating. I explained they had ordered that a long time ago. She responded with I'll bring you a to-go box. We said, no thank you.   The manager arrived at our table to let us know he decided to take my husbands steak off our bill and give us a dessert of our choice. We ordered and they brought the bill over.  My husband failed to look at the bill and paid. I asked if they had taken the Free Bloomin Onion off and he looked and said, no! The manager brought the dessert and my husband told him about the Bloomin Onion and he told my husband he would void the bill for the previous charge and recharge my husbands credit card.   We ate the dessert and left.   My overall opinion is this Outback needs better training, cooks and possibly new management! The food should have better quality control!   One thing I know, is food and how to cook it properly! This Outback lacks an experienced cook, the waiters attitudes are \"okaaay\" like what am I supposed to do and the management seems to be out of his element!   Good luck if you choose to eat at this location!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to an Outback in years but their new ad for Steak + Crab for $13.99 had been calling to me for awhile. Steak and crab under $15? Right up my alley!!!  Dinner started with a loaf of the brown bread I had such an obsession with in my childhood. It was way smaller than my husband or I could remember and sad looking. Husband tried it and said it has gone downhill. Bummer but I wasn't here to eat bread anways.. I was here for the freaking meat and crab!  6 oz sirloin + 1/2 lb of snow crab + potato (I subbed green beans) for $13.99. I was scared the sirloin would be tough or the crab legs would be brown and mushy like the ones at Hooters. Nope, it was all fabulous! The sirlon was way better than it should have been - arguably the best \"cheap\" restaurant steak I've had in my life. DUH, it doesn't compare to Cut or Carnevino, but it was an insane value for the price. The crab legs were of the \"good buffet\" level quality (ie M resort, not Rio ). Very pleased with them as well. Served prescored with melted butter..YUM. Green beans were delicious as well.   Sadly this amazing steak/crab combo is \"limited time only\". BOO. During it's limited time I might just become a frequent visitor to the Outback - a deal this good is too good to last !"}
{"text":"Usually we have had great dinners at Outback at this location, but tonight the steaks were terrible! I had a porterhouse and my wife had a filet. The service was spot on, but the steaks were sub par."}
{"text":"I needed specifically a steak (a la carte) and a cheesecake. I ordered online, for two separate occasions. Everything was perfect, exactly the way I wanted it.  My medium rare steak was perfect each time, and the food was ready on time as well."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Outback for as long as I can remember. The food is usually good and the service okay. However, today we had Miranda as our server and I have to say, she is by far the BEST service ever. The food was good as usual. The service was OUTSTANDING! We will ask for her every time from now on!"}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant...took 15 minutes after being seated for the waitress to even come to our table.  Another 15 minutes after taking our drink order to come back and get our lunch order. Daughter ordered the 6oz filet pretty sure she was served a sirloin but it was definitely NOT a filet. It was tough with gristle/fat on the edges.  Husband had the ribeye melt with fries. It was all way too salty, but the meat wasn't too bad.  The blooming onion was good and earned this review the one and only star.  I had the prime rib dip sandwich with fries. My first bite was a big glob of gristle and the other \"prime rib\" was SO overdone I couldn't even eat it. There was one piece that was completely burnt black and the waitress said it was an end piece when I pointed out to her that it was burnt. They should've throw it away, it was inedible. The entire lunch took an hour and a half.  The service was painfully slow.  The table next to us ordered a steak done medium and complained b/c his was served well done too.  This was a horrible experience-we will never be back."}
{"text":"It was super busy but there was still great service tonight and the caramel cookie for desert was so delicious!! All the staff was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"The service was nice, however the \"loaded baked potato\" was anything but loaded. It was kinda hird and dry. so dry I choked on it!"}
{"text":"I ordered a ribeye steak, wanting to try one of their new cuts. It came to me tasting like lighter fluid. I thought I was imagining things, but my husband took a bite and spit it out. The manager came to the table, when I returned the steak and requested a different cut. Turns out, if the cook puts a piece of meat on the grill  right after putting a piece of wood (for the wood-fired flavor) on the grill,  anything cooked in the first 5-7 minutes may have a chemical taste. (The manager shared that she had the same flavor experience from a piece of chicken from their grill the night before.) She then brought out a new steak that was supposed to be cooked \"medium\" and asked me to cut into it before she left the table. It was raw in the middle. She apologized profusely and said that they had checked it with a meat thermometer before bringing it out of the kitchen.  I requested that the third steak, that was brought out,  be boxed for me to take home, since my husband had finished his meal. My meal was comped and we received a free dessert. I appreciate the manager trying to make things right,  it don't  expect to be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon with my daughter and wife.  Place wasn't busy so we were seated immediately.  We got the pedals (mini version of blooming onion) and I ordered a watermelon drink.  Waitress came back and said they were out of that drink.  I got the redbull drink instead.  It was meh.  I ordered clam chowder and a philly.  Wife ordered salad, steak and mashed potato.  Kid ordered fries and a burger.  For desert we had Chocolate Thunder.   Overall, the food and service were ok.  I personally thought that they could use more lighting but it was overcast outside.  Here's a 33 second video about our visit:   https://youtu.be/83HKzYwWEzQ"}
{"text":"Told us a 35 minute wait then a couple comes in and the host told them 45 minute wait. 20 minutes later they were seated before us. Another 10 minute passes by and a different couple for seated before us. We went up to talk to the person in charge of the seating and they told us they probably called in. After 10 minutes later, another couple got seated and when they came in they were told 45 minutes. We told the host and they told us that they had been paging us but our pager wasn't working and we got seated right away. We ordered a water and a sprite and the waiter didn't come back with a sprite. As well as our food. They didn't give us the right food items."}
{"text":"This is an average chain restaurant. I was dining solo and ordered a Bud Light, NY strip steak with loaded baked potato. The potato was not very loaded and dry. The steak was small and a little gristly. The bill was $29. I'd probably give 2 stars based on the food. The atmosphere was decent. Nice lighting, friendly staff. I feel like I would have been just as satisfied stopping by Taco Bell drive through. Mediocre food at high prices."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it but Outback serves a damn good piece of meat for the money. I also enjoyed their blue cheese wedge side salad. The atmosphere is nice and dark and the service is pretty good too. As much as I like to slam chain restaurants I'll admit this one is pretty good."}
{"text":"Thursday night. Not busy at all. Took forever to get our entrees. Not servers fault. All kitchen. Service was decent. Food was cooked well and tasted good.  Just surprised at how long it took."}
{"text":"Went to the Outback the other night with my son. Son and I got there about 7 and it was crowded but not mobbed. We waited about 5 minutes to be seated which was not bad at all. Waitress came over and said she would be with us in a minute. She came back and took drink orders and brought hot bread. I ordered a 9oz sirloin with a salad and a baked potato and a french onion soup. The french onion soup and salad were good and the steak was cooked just right. The waitress was very friendly and service was very good. I would go back to this location again and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Friends wanted to get out of the house and do dinner and drinks. Of course, none of us had any clue what we were in the mood for but apparently Outback's commercials have been rolling thru our heads and I said - what about Outback and my buddy said: yeah don't they have that filet and tail thing going on? Yes. Yes they do. So we agreed to meet up. We live closer so we had time to grab a drink at the bar and my Maker's Manhattan wasn't bad but when my girl asked if they had any single malts the bartender (didn't catch his name) replied\" I'll have to check, I think we only have double malts...\" uh oh. strike one. Strike 2 came when we had to cash out at the bar before moving to our table - not a biggie.   Enough with the strikes: here's the hits. Server (again no name caught, my bad) was super friendly, even offering to throw the electronic menu/ad device on our table away for us as it eats up a fairly good chunk of real estate. We all laughed two minutes later when we asked for it back so we could peruse the wine list. Luckily, the trashing idea was just a joke, it got put right behind us, safe and sound.   So, long story short: we had a great time. We all ordered our steaks, strip, filets, and ribeye (bone-in, yeah) and added the tails. (If you've read any of my other reviews you know this particular foursome is rarely a cheap get together.) We skipped the bloomin' onion which worked out well for me because I got that giant ribeye. It was so big there was no room for my mashed which I think is why they never arrived. The tails, in comparison, were small 3oz maybe? but cooked nicely. Upon hearing about this mashed tater snafu during the check portion, our server marched off and returned with a good portion of them already boxed and bagged for us. They made excellent potato pancakes the next day.   We don't do chain restaurants very often but I've always been a fan of Outback's seasoning on their meats. I'm glad they had a few cuts they don't always offer (I'm not sure the bone-in ribeye or the porterhouse are always on the menu. Maybe it's just certain locations? or seasonal? I don't know but we had a good time. I could've given them 3 strikes all in all but our server was batting 1.000 that night so those homeruns outweighed all the negatives."}
{"text":"I agree with the other comments, I use to love this place years ago. It's just not that special anymore. The portions have gotten smaller and the prices have gone up. The food is STILL good. I picked up dinner tonight for the two of us. The 12oz sirloin was very tasty & cooked just right. The wife got the salmon. It was a little over done to the point of being dry. Her steamed veggies were nice and flavorful. I can't complain about the salads either, fresh and cold. Yum! This is still an \"every once in a while\" kind of place."}
{"text":"Today they had a fundraiser going on where they donated 100% of the proceeds to the Vegas strong campaign. It's amazing how Vegas has come together to pick up the broken pieces from that tragic event on October 1, 2017.    The food was also very good. I got the filet mignon made medium rare and it was exactly how I ordered it. I got the garlic topping on it which made it taste really extra yummy. I would recommend getting it again and I would definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"This place has it's pros and cons, but they are mostly cons.  Went here for a birthday lunch for my stepdad with some family. Started off by taking a bit too long, in my opinion, to be seated for a restaurant that was maybe filled a little over the 1/4 of it's capacity. Found out after being seated that they were understaffed on this particular day, which explained why the service was so slow throughout the whole meal. However, slow or not, their staff was extremely friendly and on point. We ordered some appetizers and drinks, and they were great. This place does have some good appetizers and I really like the bread they give you before your meal.   When the main courses came out, 2 out of the 7 meals were cold and had to be sent back, one of the meals was not cooked properly and was sent back as well. Now maybe my family was picky, but the table next to us sent their food back as well, and while we were leaving, I heard another table sending back one of their meals. Maybe this was a bad day for this place, but it was enough for me to deem Outback as the \"Walmart of steakhouses.\"  Like I said, if you just want some drinks and maybe some appetizers, this is a decent place for that, but if you want a great steak or meal, I suggest another restaurant."}
{"text":"After here after a very long drive yesterday and it was fantastic! We were seated quickly and the waitress Shelby came to talk with us right away! We was very patient with waiting for us to figure out what we wanted ( it was a long drive so we were tired and indecisive). She brought us lots of bread as we waited and was always there to refill our drinks before we asked! The food came rather quickly after ordering and it tasted amazing, that coupled with the outstanding service made dinner out great!!! Thanks shelby!"}
{"text":"I've been to better Outbacks in the ghetto's of Detroit.  Went once, ordered prime rib...ordered it med rare, it came out gray.  Server NEVER came back.  Wife finished meal, went to hostess stand and asked for manager.  Manager apologized, didn't take plate away.  Server came back and I asked her to get this plate out of my site.  She told me not to be angry, she had other tables.    My food was comped, got a $25 gift card, left hungry.  Gave card to a friend.  I'll never go to a chain steak place again.    I was also told by a former Outback manager that Downtown Scottsdale Outback is one of the lowest rated Outback's in the country.  Go figure."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Victorias filet mignon. Great with big family. Great food love his place."}
{"text":"All Outback Steakhouses are the same.  That's what they're designed to be.  But this one defies that -- all the waiters seem to smell like Nair.  Yes, Nair, the signature-smelling anti-hair product.  I am not entirely sure why our male waiter smelled like this, but it's the only product that remotely smells like Nair does.  And it was confusing and lead only to wild speculation.  Mostly it lead to not being hungry.    You're an outlier one, Outback Steakhouse #12324.  Stop smelling like Nair."}
{"text":"Always like OUTBACK..Stopped in this one yesterday, was in town for Arizona Cardinal Football game..Bartender very friendly..good food as always"}
{"text":"Service is always great. I've come here a few times and they always get my order right. The bloomin onion and the comp starter bread are great. My favorite item on the menu is the brownie a la mode. Warm and rich in flavor."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my mom. Food was great and Tony, our sever was amazing! Thank you for being so kind and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Who cares if its a chain?  As far as bang for your buck is concerned, Outback has always been good in my book.  It was a packed house when we got there, so we sat at the bar and Paige was our bartender and she was great.  She helped us get the table we wanted quickly and was very friendly.  Blake was our server and he was great as well.  Food was all very tasty.  Had bloomin onion, filet with wild mushroom sauce, and prime rib.  While the prime rib was a little tough in some places, it was still very good overall.  Good prices, good food."}
{"text":"Hey it's Jelly. My experience here was amazing! We came for my fiance's birthday weekend and we are highly satisfied. Had room for an aussie-tizer(appetizer), an entree and dessert. I highly recommend the \"chocolate thunder from down under\" dessert. The steak was cooked to perfection and the mixed veggies were to die for! Definitely a special time and memorable birthday. Overall including the tip we spent about $62.   -Xoxo"}
{"text":"Had a really great time here this past sunday night! We hadn't been to Outback in a while, but had gift cards and thought we'd check it out.  Walked in about 7pm, and were seated right away, even though they looked busy. Our server, Amanda, was great- very attentive and friendly. I was pleased right away to see that they had some new menu items- those new shakes look awesome!   We ordered a couple of beers, and a Bloomin' Onion to start. Amanda asked if we wanted the half size, which was great since I didn't know they could do that! It was the perfect size for 2 people! For dinner, my husband and I both ordered the new Steak and Lobster combo. They have different options to upgrade. I got the $14.99 version, which was tasty (only comes with one side) and the hubs ordered the upgraded Victoria's filet for a little more. He said it was great, and I believe him since he ate it all before I got a chance to ask for a taste!   The best part was that I had mentioned to our server that we were celebrating an anniversary, and right as we finished our meal Amanda brought out a complimentary dessert for us!!! It was the new French Toast Bread Pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I normally am not a fan of Bread Pudding, but it was so delicious!!! There wasn't one bite left. Thanks, Amanda!!   We really enjoyed our evening out, and even without gift cards, it wouldn't have broken the bank! We'll definitely return soon to try some of those other new items!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Outback in years and decided to meet a friend here for dinner. I did the online check in to put us on the wait list for a 7pm arrival. Got there a little before 7 and was handed a buzzer for a short wait. After being seated we were greeted by a friendly server who took our drink order. We got the Aussie Cheese Fries appetizer, which is always delicious, and enjoyed the complimentary bread. For my entree I went with the Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken and instead of seasonal vegetables I got the mashed potatoes. The chicken had tomatoes on top and I scraped them off. I found that the Parmesan sauce on the chicken kinda soaks into the breadcrumbs and makes it a bit soggy in texture. The mashed potatoes were a little on the dry side. It was a pricey meal, even with our 15% off coupon (which mostly offsets the tip). I would've liked to try the dessert trio, but we were way too full. Wanted to give 4 stars based on the service and appetizers, but my dinner was just underwhelming."}
{"text":"We went for dinner 5/31 to Chandler Blvd Outback. We had stuffed mushrooms.. cobb salad and chicken on barbie...  Bill was $40...  We had to ask for serving plates for our stuffed mushrooms. We had to ask for re-fills for our ice tea. The chicken on barbie was nothing special . It was a small serving for 12.50 price. The cobb salad lacked any eggs or avocado. It was nothing more than a few pieces of chicken cheese a couple tomatoes and lettuce that was not fresh. The portion was extremely small for 13.00 price tag. Service and food was sub par and pricey for what you got. Will NOT return....."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 3 just because the waitress we had wasn't the best. I felt like she was trying to rush us out because like 5 minutes after we got our food she came by and was like \"so dessert?\" We said no and she said \"okay here's the check\" then walked away.   I ordered the ribs which were awesome and my husband ordered the steak and choice of shrimp entree. He ordered his medium rare but got it pretty much still \"mooing\". Way too rare. The bread was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Classic Outback! I sat at the bar and the service was great...  Cold beer as always and the steak was cooked nicely, with asparagus and baked potato.  The server even brought me bread without me asking and was very quick with all the demands."}
{"text":"Great Food Best Service!! Birthday dinner tonight and the steaks and salmon were perfect. Ty was our waiter and couldn't be a nicer young man. Excellent service, experienced and very attentive!! We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered prime rib it was terrible. The meat was so hard to cut and no taste to it. Blackberry martini was good."}
{"text":"I took a friend out to eat here recently to celebrate his new job. We both started off with a cocktail, a cucumber lemonade vodka drink. Really refreshing. I ordered the Steak and Shrimp dinner with a side of broccoli and mashed potatoes. Really good. My friend got the Filet Mignon and he had zero complaints. The service was good. We will be back."}
{"text":"The wings were good, but the pork porterhouse was very dry. Also, the sirloin my daughter got was cooked properly and very tough."}
{"text":"I tried this location once more. I took my wife and daughter here for lunch. There were  only a couple tables occupied so there was no reason for such slow service. We all had soup and salad with a bloomin. onion to share. It took over two hours for us to eat lunch! My wife and daughter asked for some catsup fot the onion and it took our server twenty minutes to bring that.. I will never go back. Oh...the clam chowder was good, but the potato soup was thin and flavorless. My daughtr=er didn't even finish hers, which I've never seen happen before. She normally loves potato soup."}
{"text":"My Dad loves his steak the old fashioned way and we both enjoy having a martini or two before our dinner, so whenever I visit we all go to this Outback near my parents where we all can find something that tickles our fancy!   I have been to other Outbacks, but this particular location is by far the best I have ever eaten at. The steaks are done just as you order them, the staff is friendly, and the drinks are just fine.  The cheese cake comes in huge slices, so the four of us shared one covered with raspberry Saussure and all the guilt that comes with it!   The service has always been good, but this time around our server Frank was just awesome. My parents do not speak fluent English, but Frank was extremely patient when explaining the menu, and he was very attentive all the way through our dinner. I give him an A+ for the fantastic service he gave us."}
{"text":"Got some gift cards from a friend first time at an outback had the porterhouse and filet and lobster tail, lobster tail was the highlight, steaks were pretty decent, the filet was over cooked, porterhouse was on point, our food was really good just nothing extra ordinary, would return if I get some more gift cards"}
{"text":"Used curbside takeout today (7/23/14 @ 7:30pm)  I am staying next door at the Holiday Inn. Ordered the outback burger with fries and a bowl of Tortilla Soup. The medium burger was well done and pretty much everything a burger shouldn't be.  I explained that I need utensils however received no spoon. Therefore, my soup was eaten with a fork.  Tortilla soup was actually good so one star for that. Again, I explained I was lodging next door and needed all condiments. No KETCHUP or any other condiments for burger and fries!!!!! Fries were also blaw and bread was cold.  I would have gone to Bonefish like I normally do but they were closed for remodeling. I should have gone to Bob Evans instead or at minimum ordered room service where Ketchup is always delivered with a Burger and fry. I was going to call the manager of Outback to explain my displeasure but decided a review and me never eating there again is better for everyone. Normally, when I want steak I go to Long Horn regardless."}
{"text":"We've dined at Outbacks for several years and we have usually been assured of a fairly decent meal.  On this particular night (a Friday) we were in early (about 5:00 PM) but it was already beginning to get pretty crowded.  However, Outback is pretty good at moving the herd so the wait wasn't too bad.    The service here has always been exceptional, even on the busiest of nights and this night was no exception.    Our party of four ordered the quintessential rib-eye along with a couple of lobster tails and the associated salads and potatoes. The steak was mediocre and acceptable but the lobster tails, which were ordered grilled, were overcooked and dry -  It probably would have been to our advantage to order them steamed.  As the three stars indicate, the meal was acceptable but far from exceptional.  The prices at Outback are pretty reasonable but it seems to me that the quality of the food has deteriorated a bit over the years -- but that could just be me and my increasingly, crotchety demand for better food and service.  In the future, I will probably return to this Outback but if I'm really looking for a superb meal I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Took the family to Outback Steakhouse to try something different. It was St. Patrick's day and Lent, so we figured nobody would be at a steakhouse and we were right. We were seated immediately and I ordered a tall Stella Artois. Looking through the menu, I wanted chicken with mushrooms, but they didn't really have anything with just those two. So the waitress made a special request for me. I also ordered a side salad with ranch, which was really tasty, even though it had iceberg lettuce in it. My daughter ordered a ribeye steak and my wife ordered a sirloin steak. A little while later, our dinners were served.  My chicken dish was pretty skimpy. The chicken breast was kind of small and it was butterflied. It was over seasoned and too salty. My veggies were seasoned well and delicious. The chicken was a far cry from the chicken breast served with mushrooms and onions at Texas Roadhouse. At this point, I was happy that we went to Outback, but sad that the food wasn't more satisfying. It was a pleasant reminder of why I don't dine at Outback.  I tasted my daughter's ribeye, which should be a damn good steak, but it was small and tasted funny. It didn't taste like a steak should taste and it was spicy. Then I tasted my wife's sirloin, and it was nearly twice the size of the ribeye and twice as good. The sirloin actually tasted like a steak should taste - very good!  The service, beer, and salads were excellent, but outside of the sirloin, our meat offerings were weak, spicy, overseasoned, and they missed the mark.  Next time we want chicken and steaks, we're going to Texas...and I don't mean the state."}
{"text":"Quality at this location has gone down considerably, the food at other Outbacks is substantially better. The portions have gotten smaller and smaller over the years, it is the definition of penny wise and pound foolish...I use to be a regular at this location but never again do I want to step foot in there."}
{"text":"Just up the street form our house so it's a easy go to when we don't want to cook at home."}
{"text":"The service was actually quite good here, despite being a busy evening. The food was great and they took great care of my daughter. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner here for my boyfriend's birthday. First, the waitress did provide great service; we have no complaints about Emma. However, we both ordered the steak and endless shrimp (#teamgreedy). We both had our steaks prepared medium and the first time they came out, they were cooked to perfection. We sent hem back because they were too salty. The manager was supposed to come out and speak to us. That was about 45 minutes ago: still nothing. The second set of steaks that came out were not as salty, but mine was over cooked. It was a step or ten beyond well done. I sent it back and did not want a replacement meal. STILL no manager has come to speak with us and the bill was incorrect. She has managed to go and speak with the table next to us whose order was cold. They didn't complain until after I complained about my second steak was sent back. The bill was incorrect and sent back. After the correction it is still wrong. It has been about 30 more minutes, still no manager. Maybe there's a breakdown in communication, maybe the manager didn't care to come talk to us...whatever the reason we won't be back to find out. Again, EMMA did a great job even though she is new. She kept her cool and got everything taken care of. Knowing that she is new, makes it even worse that Sydney (the manager) did not come over to handle the complaint about the food."}
{"text":"Austin and Joslyn provided me with amazing customer service from start to finish. After a long day of work, it was good to come here and have a peaceful dinner. Austin, my waiter, was very knowledgeable about the menu and convinced me to try something new today. I had not been to Outback in a long time and today was a great welcome back! Even the host Christian was hospitable. Very welcoming and even came to check on me after he seated me.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cody is the only server in the state of Arizona that I trust to serve my food. I come to outback not for the food but for the experience that Cody is consistently providing me. Thank you outback, for hiring such a wonderful young man!"}
{"text":"This Outback is my fav IN ALL of AZ. :) Not only Is happy hour all the time, but the staff is very nice. The food isnt' fresh but, like I said the booze and staff are great!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, it's been years since I've been at Outback. I have been craving for steak for a few days so Hubby brought me here. Place was packed for a Monday evening. Our server was amazing but unfortunately I do not know her name. I ordered a bone-in ribeye. Sadly, it lacked so much flavor. I could have made my own steak at home and it would have had better flavor. It was very disappointing. This is definitely not how I remember outback to be. My Husband ordered another type of steak but I don't remember what type and it was too dry and lacked flavor as well. The appetizer my Husband ordered were the Aussie Fries. Definitely not worth $10! Burned fries with just a slab of cheese on top that didn't even go on the whole plate. It sad that our $80 dinner was worth a $10 meal. That's just how bad it was."}
{"text":"Heard so many good things about this place and its prime rib steak that I was disappointed. My cousins are always saying that the prime rib steak is amazing.  I had it but it was far too salty. I later found out that I should have had it cooked in the \"slow roasted\" method but went for Outback Style - basically peppery. It was very salty and very peppery. I tried someone elses Prime Rib steak which was cooked in \"right\" way and it was OK - nothing to write home about.  Also, heard that the bread they give you was brilliant too. Just tasted like normal bread with slightly different (to England anyway) butter."}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch and got an Outbacker Burger and we had a Bloomin' Onion too.  The Bloomin' Onion was good, but the burger was mediocre at best.  One side of the patty was almost burnt the other side just okay but the burger was pretty dry for a medium well done.  Sort of pricey for a hamburger and french fries and would not waste my money on that choice again.  Server was nice and service fairly quick at that time of day."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Good food.  Bartender Serena super nice and awesome. Very relaxing,friendly establishment. Outback is always great!"}
{"text":"Outback has great food and service. The restaurant decor is hip and the bloomin onion is beyond addictive. I had the filet on focaccia bread with a garlic spread. I like garlic, but the spread was too much for me. But with that being said, the filet was great on the focaccia bread and I received aujois on the side. I would order again without the garlic spread.   Joel is the best waiter. He is very attentive and personable, even with my girls. The girls request him everytime we go."}
{"text":"Great service! Got seated right away. Greeting from our server was a bit longer than I prefer but she was beautiful and friendly none the less! Our wedge salad was very good, steak and shrimp was also up to par. The ambiance is very nice and restaurant seemed very clean. Will definitely be back, as it is so close to my home. Thanks outback!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible food, well our adventure started when our waitress brought out the coconut shrimp, terrible taste felt rubbery. Then my father asked for a well done prime rib came out medium rare. The waitress seeing disgust on our face offers to have it recooked. Wow what a waste of time and service stay away!"}
{"text":"When I order a $20 prime rib and you have no horse radish, so I ask for a box to take it home uneaten; maybe give a few dollars off! I won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Much like any other outback. The staff was generally courteous and the food had been as expected. I recommend giving their blooming onion a try and the out back special steaks are a great deal."}
{"text":"I'll back is our go to steak place if we were looking for a good steak without all the fuss. The unfortunate part is outback is always packed. You should always call ahead for seating or do it online so that way you're not sitting there waiting for 30 to 45 minutes for a table. We ordered the biggest porterhouse that they have as well as the steakhouse mac & cheese mashed potatoes and a side of grilled shrimp. Everything was cooked perfect and service was very good just wish the shrimp were a little bigger. Also ordered the steakhouse salad which is my favorite it is their pecan blue cheese salad with sliced sirloin steak the delish.  I really love that they switched over to the automated system for paying or to call over your server so that way you do not have to wait for the bill awesome"}
{"text":"Want to give a great job to our server, Anika D on Friday night.  Very pleasant, happy personality, very attentive, answered questions and most importantly took care of a special order without any problems.  Thanks Anika for doing such a great job!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars .... the worst $100 Easter dinner of my life! I decided to go to outback instead of Bonefish Grill I'll never make that mistake again . It took 20 mins for drink orders and bread . Our waiter was visibly dripping sweat and in top of that Sat on the floor in front of our table multiple times too take our order and check on our table ..... super weird . Missing multiple items , overcharged my debit card by $20. Cold food , watery drinks .... Waiter asked to taste my watery drink to check for flavor .... I wish I was making this up ! Asked for a manager and was told this is the second complaint I've got about him tonight he really needs to step it up , never offered a discount an apology , didn't comp anything on our ticket . I'll never return , don't waist your time here guys"}
{"text":"We love coming here and sitting in the bar area. Food is always good and the staff is friendly. Its always busy too especially since its right next to the Outlets :)"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here on a recent stay-cation and it was a nice experience. The kids enjoyed their meals as did my wife and I (she had the PICK 4 option with soup, side salad, steak and desert while I had the Cobb salad) and the service was great.  The prices were inline with I was expecting as well.  My only issue was with the kiosk on the table where we paid. It was a bit confusing trying to include a gift card and cash. It's just easier to go through the waitress for full payment. Oh. And the same kiosk had games for the kids to play, but came with a price which I thought was odd (though kids shouldn't necessarily be playing games at a restaurant anyway, so I'm not overly upset at that.)"}
{"text":"Just left Outback and we're full and fantastic! Thank you Jessica for being a forward thinker.. helping us with our weird order for our two girls who wanted to share a steak and wanted a lobster each. What ever the math you made it work! We had a great time and the food was awesome! We had great conversation among us which means we didn't worry or have any concerns about anything else. We enjoyed our time. Thanks Jessica!"}
{"text":"Mediocre experience... Our waiter Gabriel was efficient but lacked personality... Even when I tried to get him to talk a little. My chicken was small.. Unbelievably small yet decent. I'm not sure what to make of my dining experience... Like I said \"mediocre\" at best. Oh forgot to add... They put us near the kitchen in the back, so.. We had the pleasure of listening to workers complain, talk about where they were meeting after work, and having their after work socializing literally right next to us. My only suggestion being a former restaurant person trained by Ron Panzo in Maui.... \"Don't take your customer out of their world and into yours\". \"Remember they are why you even have a job.\" 2 stars for decent food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner. I love steak and was really looking forward to eating here. I had the steak and lobster, which was good. My boyfriend ordered a burger (like he does everywhere) and was satisfied. The wait for our food did take a little bit though."}
{"text":"Request Ryan to make your salad....if you want the best of any Outback.  Great staff at this location.  This is a great place and you will be very happy you stopped here."}
{"text":"We came for the blooming onion. It was cooked in old grease, but still tasted good. The Rib-eye was very tough, as were the kids steak bites. The firecracker Shrimp was ok for breaded shrimp. This was my first time coming to Outback in about 10 years. I was disappointed, but I must admit. I would come back for the blooming onion and happy hour."}
{"text":"I was greet on 02/101/2018' as I walked in with an attitude from the greeted like its gonna be 30 mind. Expecting me to walk out like the people ahead of me did, but I decided to wait. While waiting I over heard a customer specifically ask if they offered a senior discount, the answer given blew my mind, I don't have a clue I just seat people. Hold on you don't know or understand company policies, ok, well after being seated I had a great waiter from the bar area. The steak I ordered was not what I ordered but it wasn't his fault, but the service and the food both don't deserve a one rating but they don't offer it here. I understand your understaffed at the time but your treating the people coming in the door like they called in sick and came their to eat or something.  I will never in my life eat here or recommend it to any of my customers, this I promised."}
{"text":"A place has to be MUCH better than Outback to deal with hour plus wait times! I've tried to come here almost a half dozen times for dinner on weekdays and weekends only to turn around and go somewhere else because 60 minutes is just unreasonable. I've even tried going on the website's reservation list. I've gotten a reservation for 45 minutes later, to get there and wait another 30 minutes.   I've eaten here another 3 or 4 times and service is never impressive. I enjoy their salad and bread. We always like our meals. But as a restaurant in general, this place is a nightmare to deal with. Not worth the wait, Outback. Find a better system."}
{"text":"I really like our \"outback\" it is always a good food and a very pleasant service. I do have allergies and servers and kitchen staff are always going on and beyond to make sure that my dishes prepared the way I can eat it. Never had any bad experience there. Food was very delicious and drinks are good too. It is sometimes crowded but it's only says \" the place is that good\""}
{"text":"So we are somewhat regular customers to this franchise and what it is now to what it was only 2 years ago is not the same.   The Portions of the side dishes are so much smaller.  Really you're going to skimp on salad and French fries?  The steak quality isn't good anymore either.  Sorry outback this was my last visit."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! My waitress Brittany was sweet, efficient, and fast. The foods delicious. We had the Ribeye and lobster. Honestly the lobster is 100x better than red lobster! I will be coming back because of the food and the service! Brittany deserves a raise and a promotion!!! Yesssss yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"From what I can tell, this appears to be one of the busiest Outback locations in the city.  Every time I come in, they're on a wait.  To me, that means that they're doing something right, since they continue to be very popular.  Every time I'm there, I get the Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail.  I am never disappointed with the meal.  As they are usually on a wait, I opt to sit at the bar for dinner.  Bartenders are always friendly and knowledgeable.  The mixed drinks are good, but consist mostly of ice.  As for cleanliness, I am relatively satisfied.  I've never seen anything unreasonable, but one sink in the men's room sprays water in every which direction, and has been like this for quite some time.  However, I'm not going to let bathroom sinks stand in the way of a good meal, so I will continue to frequent this outback!"}
{"text":"Ok. So. My parents insisted that we give this place another chance and we did. Very good service and food the only reason why I knocked off a star was because there was a party with two people arguing and it was a little annoying that these people weren't addressed to take it outside or be warned since it was kinda distracting."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their bacon burger lunch special but not so special price. It was good to be expected, nothing special though. I would have liked to have more french fries portion but it was adequate."}
{"text":"Came here recently to treat my mother to dinner. We both had fantastic meals, the place was full, but we were in a fairly quiet corner. We both ordered Ribeye, and shared an appetizer platter. Our server was polite and helpful, even the Manager came along just to check up on us. I would have no regrets in visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak quesadillas and opened it up to put some extra salsa on it and low and behold, an unsightly dark tangled hair rest nestled and baked into the hot cheese between the tortilla wrap. Appetizing indeed. All they did was take that menu item off my bill. Will never return to this or probably any Outback Steakhouse again. Disgusting.  P.s. the volcano shrimp tasted horrible too. Completely thick breading and hardly any shrimp. Changed their recipe and shrimp size altogether from original menu item when it first debuted."}
{"text":"Went and had a Steak dinner tonight. It was pretty good I had the rib eye steak with the garlic mashed potatoes.  It wasn't something that I can say was to die for but it was okay. Lacked some good seasoning for me and was kinda bland but kinda expected for a franchised steak restaurant.    I ordered my steak medium to help keep its a little red and it came just that way. My girlfriend got the steak and all you can eat shrimp the shrimp was quite good I will say. We also ordered a Sangria to share that came in a pitcher. It wasn't as strong as we thought it was going to be but the taste was quite good. It's a nice drink to share and just drink but don't expect to be buzzed after the pitcher is gone.   The meal was quite pricey for me to jot be totally and perfectly satisfied with everything from the taste to how full I was but it was okay. I still like Outback but with all the great steak houses in Vegas unfortunately it's not on my top list of places to go eat a steak."}
{"text":"Twelve friends went to Monroeville's Outback for a Christmas dinner last night. The restaurant was extremely busy. However, the manager agreed to let us decorate the table which was a very festive addition to our celebration.  We had two servers who did a good job taking our orders in a timely fashion. The only downside was the staff asking who ordered what upon delivery. Drink refills were a bit slow also but once again they were busy.   This is the first time I've been to the Outback in over five years. It was a terrible dining experience the last time and I just never went back. That being said, the food last night was very good and very cost effective. I will go again and I recommend that others go too."}
{"text":"Amazing service! They handles the salmon coming out at the wrong temperature quickly and professionally."}
{"text":"This was the worst  service. My husband and I walked into a nearly empty restaurant and sat 45 minutes before out food came. Once it arrived they bought him a soggy salad and me a piece a salmon with a 5 minute wait still in mash potatoes. I sent the salmon back until the rest of my meal was done. Horrible first time experience .. I likely won t be back to this Outback.. and I definitely won t be recommending  this restaurant location to anyone.. sad."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar.  Waiter pleasant. We ate:  Volcano shrimp.  They were on the small side had too much breading. They were tasty. Now if they can make them bigger and put less breading and make it more like a bang bang shrimp will be in business.  The wedge. How can a wedge go wrong?  It did not. It was delicious.  Steak was supposed to be medium rare and after two attempts we just ate it.  They can be better but there are so many worse. I would eat there again"}
{"text":"Walkabout Wednesday - The Best This Outback cooks your Order to perfection  French Fries crispy and not plentiful  Jerry our server even divided our wedge salad for us! This OB has never let us down  Even when snowbirds make it super busy"}
{"text":"Outback is perhaps not as good as it used to be.  A friend took me to celebrate my birthday.  Ordered the grilled shrimp appetizer and the prime rib french dip sandwich.  Apparently they no longer have the remoulade sauce to go with the shrimp.  A server valiantly tried to make it but it really just turned out to taste like thousand island dressing.  The shrimp were still good, though, and there were more of them (8) than there used to be (6).  The sandwich was a huge disappointment.  Overpowered with the flavor of too many onions and no other flavor (like MEAT for example) to stand on.  Also, was served on a sour dough bun which did not add to the flavor quotient.  I informed the server, who was just as nice as could be, and he had the manager come over, and she was extremely nice as well.  When I provide feedback to a manager (who the server sent over automatically; I did not ask to speak with her), it's more to help the experience for future diners; I'm not trying to get them to comp. anything and, since I was not paying, I don't know whether or not they did.  I do think that next time, I might opt for the new Lone Star Steak House that's opened up across the street and see if they can do better."}
{"text":"Saturday at 5:00 pm.  I count yen tables empty and not seating.  Interesting? Hopefully you will spend time in the bar?"}
{"text":"Revisited the restaurant again and I have to say I saw some improvement in the food  I had the ribs with fries my sister had a petite filet with steamed Broccoli and a salad , we both enjoyed the food, the only thing was the waiter , he was non existent , we had to flag down another waiter to get anything for our meal, he finally showed up to bring the check , needless to say his tip reflected his performance. Had to be the smallest tip I have ever left. It was very nice that the management sent a gift card  for the poor food I was served last trip. To bad waiters can give a restaurant a bad name."}
{"text":"A small group of friends and I, on average, eat at this Paradise Valley location once a week. But not anymore.  We usually are served by Russ or Spencer; very friendly, up beat, and all round professionals.  Tonight, we had a different initial server and several other servers wait our table.  The atmosphere was unfriendly and we felt that the restaurant just wanted to take our order and get us out as soon as possible. We didn't feel our business was valued. The tab was over one hundred dollars plus a very generous tip which I should not have left. I don't recommend this location.  There are many other restaurants in Phoenix who will appreciate your business."}
{"text":"1st time at this location.  3rd time ever being to an Outback and every time it's great and Valentines day was no different.  They had a Valentine's day special:  Bloomin onion, two 8oz sirloins, 2 sides, 1 dessert for 38$.  Of all the restaurants out there having a Valentines day special, Outback by far had the best deal period.   Plus I got credit for my Dine Rewards program and 15% off for being an AARP member....and they gave every lady a carnation whn leaving.... we waited about 15 mins to get a table cause they were busy, our waitress Victoria was great, ambiance was great, food was great...just a great dining experience overall..."}
{"text":"wow ...Have not been here in a long time . Was nervous about returning here after a couple of bad experiences, but this experience almost perfect ! We all ordered sirloin and lobster and all dinners were perfect . The only thing was the cheese fries appetizer was much smaller than it used to be for the regular portion and they forgot to add the bacon which the server brought. Overall was a great experience."}
{"text":"I went there with some friends. Very busy and very full. We had the blooming onion, my favorite, must try!! I also ordered a steak and crab cake as my entree. I thought the steak was very bland and dry and the crab cake was rather dry as well. Wouldn't recommend this entree. I might go again to give other entrees a try tho!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. I have been here so many times and it was delicious. Now not good. The last four times we were here it wasn't good in anyway.   The service from the moment we walked in the door was bad. They screwed up my salad and poured salt--they called it seasoning---all over it. Then the steak was way over cooked (I ordered medium). The fries were over cooked and crunchy. The water was never filled. They were terrible. I'm so disappointed. Eater beware this place is no good anymore."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people have left bad reviews for this outback... I've been multiple times and almost every time I go I've had great, friendly service and good food. This is my go to outback for the charlotte area. : )"}
{"text":"We don't really come here often but had a giftcard so we ventured out in this crazy Vegas heat. Our main purpose was to check out their \"happy hour\" it sadly didn't include any actual food for happy hour price. Our server Tanya R. was patient and gave us plenty of time after showing us where we could find the apps. We ordered the cheese fries which were sooo delish, the blooming petal which was tasty and the mac n cheese balls that looked, smelled and seemed wonderful but had a hint if sweetness I didn't care for. I mentioned this to our server and as she was apologizing the manager came by and apologized then promptly took away the funky tasting balls and said he would take it off for us. He was very nice and courteous and we ordered a piece of carrot cake that was soo moist and scrumptious. The manager definitely saved our visit. We liked that he fixed the problem promptly, came to check on us and then didn't bother us anymore. Sometimes managers have a tendency to overdo it. He was perfect. Not sure of his name but he had curly dark hair and was a thin little guy."}
{"text":"One star is too much. Terrible service and no compassion when we received terrible service. Burnt steak was served to us and the owner of the restaurant said, \"it really isn't my problem\". Totally insane. STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"I have been to this location numerous times and every time it has been wonderful.  This time, a guy asked me on a date and this is where I stated I wanted to go.  He called ahead of time for priority seating but it was a Friday night and we still waited over 30 min...but it was a window seat so I didn't mind.    I ordered my required chicken tortilla soup and believe me it was delicious!  Not every location offers it but here they offer it every time.  They use to have a blueberry martini and I don't know what happened because they don't offer it anymore!!!  Anyways, their prime rib is just delectable!  And their carrot cake, delicious!!  Tacky time, when Bobby, my date, asked the waiter if he could pay using a coupon his roommate gave him.....  I went to the bathroom before that happened, why didn't he ask the waiter then??? Tacky! Nope...I didn't go out with him again!"}
{"text":"A few years ago, I came to outback almost every week.  Their food was amazing and I love their complimentary bread that they give.  But then they started to go down-hill.   The food was cutting it anymore and the service wasn't as great as I remembered it to be.  So, I stopped going to outback for about three years.  BUT now, wow they changed their menu and added/removed a few items as well.  I was impressed!  They no longer have my favorite sinful sydney sundae, but they added milkshakes. Oh man was that AMAZING. I ordered the cappuccino milkshake, it is my new favorite dessert! It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't too powerful with the cappuccino.  It was just perfect. I am craving it as I am typing this review.  The entree was good, I ordered the half-order of baby back ribs.  It was tender and juicy.  I did not like the fries that much, but I was already full from the two complimentary breads that I ate and an appetizer.   Appetizer, we ordered the steak nachos thing, it was interesting. The nachos or \"chips\" was really good, but I feel like they didn't add enough steak on it.    Service - he was a great and friendly server.  He seemed busy, but he kept all of us content and no complaints at all.    I think I am in love with outback again!"}
{"text":"To commemorate Kristina D.'s library program about world culture, my friends and I have decided to go on a food tour of the countries she covers. This week was Australia and Outback Steakhouse is as creative as we are going to get with this country unless we can find pasties and meat pies.   There is nothing spectacular about Outback, but you will definitely get a good meal. Arriving at 8:30pm, there was no line and were seated quickly. After a day of amazing service, our waitress for tonight was ok. Our drinks took some time to come out, but we had bread to distract us. Once the blooming onion came out it looked like a pack of lions ravaging a zebra carcass.   I had ordered the 16oz. prime rib and it comes with two sides; the wedge salad subbing the ranch with the mustard vinaigrette to begin with and a sweet potato to go along with my meal. The salad was delicious. The sweet potato was good, but I should have asked for the brown sugar and butter on the side. It doesn't need it. Everyone else ordered steaks and were happy with their meals. Outback is not my first choice when it comes to satisfying my carnivore appetite, but it will do. At $23 for my meal, you can find prime rib for cheaper at most places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Like that of most Outback's, you know what you are getting. We came here at the suggestion of my father who typically pays so whatever he says, goes. Good service and typical Outback fare. I had a seafood platter which was pretty good. Lobster tail with a bunch of shrimp and a baked potato. Very delicious and they did a pretty good job! There's nothing too special about the place so which is why they got 4 stars. But overall you should get good food. This place must be under some big Corporation because they had all of those little screens at every table where one can play games and pay your bill.  Good to know for the future."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while. I want to give only 2 stars based on this experience but I typically like this place. I tried one of their burgers and it was bad. It was tasteless and dry, I ordered it medium. It was cooked correctly but yuck. And our fries were soggy:(  We would've complained but we were hiking all day and just wanted to go home and chill. Our waiter was great. Its a typical Outback, they all look alike. I will never get a burger there again though, I'd rather Fatburger. I will update if I go again, I'll order something else, I'm sure it'll be good."}
{"text":"It was late arriving to Las Vegas and we were hungry and the closest steakhouse to our location was a place called outback.  We made our way there on foot and went up a stairwell to the restaurant which seems like a rather obscure location  The place was definitely not clean and had a funky smell.  We were seated in a booth in the back.  I said what's the best steak you have and please instruct the chef to prepare it with a garlic infusion with a medium rare temperature.  The chef came out with the largest porterhouse steak I may have ever seen and he himself said it on the table along with a ribeye and a fillet mignon for my guests.  This quite possibly without any second thought could pass as or could be the best steak I ever had in my life.   I was truly shocked that out of this crappy Las Vegas strip dirt hole of a restaurant could come such an amazing steak prepared by an awesome chef!  Just ask for the best steak in the house prepared with a garlic infusion...   Give it a shot you can't lose and to top it all off the steak was so cheap I couldn't believe it.  Five stars goes out to the chef"}
{"text":"Call ahead seating?  We had never used it before, but we called at 6:15pm on a Saturday and they told us to be here at 7:15pm. We showed up at 7:15 and were told that our wait time was \"cut in half\" and that it would be an additional 15-20 minutes. Is this really the point? I'm kind of disappointed. Everything else was fine, but this put a bad taste in our mouth to start the evening."}
{"text":"Ate here first night we arrived for a convention. 1-placed smelled like dishwater or a musty clothes hamper.  2- waitress obviously hated here job and when a friend asked a question about a cut of steak she was told \"I don't eat meat, so, I think that one is better\" 3- got the ribeye sandwich and the meat was cut so thin I thought it was a very inexpensive deli sandwich 4- even the beer had a funky taste 5- water glasses had that musty taste as well.   Try bonefish next door or Melts down the road. I wouldn't eat here again for nothing. Not good at all."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and quick service. Loved the firecracker salmon! Will definitely continue going to this location!"}
{"text":"I went to Vegas last weekend and it was a first time I ate at Outback Steakhouse.  It is definitely a great location to eat and they open late.  I ordered a steak and it was deliciouse.  My mom ordered ribs and wow! the portion was huge.  The place is clean and has a good atmosphere.  The customer service was also great, very friendly stuff. We went with kids and right away they gave them coloring book which is always a plus in my eyes.  For six people I paid better price comparing to many other food places in vegas, and had an excellent dinner."}
{"text":"We will see about the food... Did call ahead seating and are told we still have to wait with every one.. Fail.  New steak place next door will hopefully respect their customers."}
{"text":"Very good place for dinner, delicious food. However, the only downside is how slow the service is. Even when I'm ordering take-out they are very slow. Besides that, I really do enjoy Outback. I usually get a bloomin' onion and Mac n Cheese. Get what looks good to you though."}
{"text":"The dinner was a great experience !  The new building is really nice and the staff did a good job.  We had the lobster tacos, the roaster chicken and the 16oz Prime Rib, all three dishes were outstanding.  I recommend this Outback to everyone, you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food! I am always a fan of good steak for affordable prices! :)"}
{"text":"It wa okay. Our server was new and didn't know the menu well. The endless shrimp was a plus for my boyfriend."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and the place was busy at 4:45 pm on a Tuesday night. Waitress was fine, and the place was clean.  What I didn't care for was:  1. I got the Porter House Steak and to be honest, it takes like McDonalds ground beef. This was clearly not a good quality steak at all.  2. The amount to tip at the end is based on the total amount with tax. This place seems to think that you should be tipping on the tax as well. Not cool and really makes me think they are trying to deceive the customer. This is on your computer check out system.  I rarely ever eat at Outback and I believe my last visit was 10 years ago. This visit did not change my mind and honestly the food has not gotten any better.  Doubt I will ever go back again."}
{"text":"Finally a good meal. Thank you Kayla you are awesome and whoever was the cook also awesome. I say these words because the last three visits we're horrible. The gift card was the only reason why I came back. Thanks, you both restored my faith. I will be back!"}
{"text":"After my last experience at the location on Las Vegas Blvd, I wasn't sure I'd give Outback another chance - but glad I did.  This Mesa location is 1,000 times better than the Las Vegas location.  Wow what a difference good local management makes!  Who ever is doing the hiring here, keep up the great work!  Every employee was friendly professional and attentive.  I had the Victoria's filet with all you can eat fried shrimp which was excellent!  Great tasting steak and good shrimp!  Refills on the soda were prompt and without asking.   Great job Mesa !!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably 6 times so far this year (& many times prior)  but today was my last.  I normally am ok with sitting in the bar, but being a Wednesday three days prior to a Holiday, it was really slow in Vegas so I requested to be in the dining room.  The hostess told the seater to take me to table 42 - REMEMBER that table #. It's code word for 'shove his ass in the bar at a booth'.  Restaurants need to learn not to hate single 1 tops. We are traveling business men and/or bachelors and I GTD you I eat out more then 95% of the people in your rest.  I HATE being treated like a third class citizen because I'm traveling solo on business.   I used to also eat regularly at a popular BBQ REST. once the forced me to sit in the bar when I specifically requested not to.  I haven't been back to any of their rests since - now 3 yrs ago.   It's simple. I requested NOT to be in the bar and you put me there because you think I'm stupid and didnt know the table your seater gave me was actually 'open bar seating'.  I won't be back.  There are WAY too many choices on Las Vegas to be treated like this.    Also Peppermill was completely empty. When I requested a new one - server exchanged it with another table and the empty was still sitting in the other table when I left.    D-O-N-E !!"}
{"text":"I was staying close by this location on a Saturday night, so I walked over there for dinner.  The wait was minimal, and I was directed to my table in 10 minutes.  My waiter was good.  He kept polite conversation going while making sure I was served quickly as well as those at his other tables.  Ordered the 14oz. Ribeye.  Unusual for me to go for that large of a steak, but I went for it - and ate the whole thing!  Cooked perfectly and great taste.  The restaurant was busy and the staff worked seemlessly to make it a good experience for all.  Well Done!"}
{"text":"We go here a lot for family dinners.  Seating is prompt even when it's busy, service has always been good or great.  Food is definately decent.  I don't know where else you can get a lobster tail, sirloin and a potato for $15 - they really have some great menu items and specials that are very affordable."}
{"text":"Good cheese fries.. Everything else had no flavor. Kids wouldn't eat sirloin macaroni. Veggies need to be chopped more and I will mention the flavorless sirloin. My particular porterhouse was the only meat that was tender and not dry probably because of the cut and price. What a waste of 90+ bucks."}
{"text":"We went on 4/25 for my birthday. The only nice part was our waitress. The wait time for everything was ridiculously long. Our blooming onion was super greasy and burnt/old oil tasting. My husbands Caesar salad was old & fries were way to salty to even eat. My prime rib was chewy. The shrimp on the Barbie used to be huge but these were small and over cooked. The whole experience was pretty disappointing and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Blooming onions never go wrong. However their steaks are terrible quality and serving staff is slow and inattentive. My girlfriend enjoyed her meal however and their mac and cheese was great. Vegans would love this steak house haha"}
{"text":"This experience started weird and ended alright. It would have been a 2 star if not for manager intervention. I came to this location around 1:45 pm on Father's Day. Pockets of people crowding around the door as I entered, patiently waiting for a table. I skipped right past and headed for the bar. Not a single person dining at the bar. Clue #1. I sat in the middle facing the television to catch the end of a World Cup match. It took a few minutes for the barkeep to acknowledge me and clean the area where I was sitting. I ordered as soon as she finished wiping down the immediate area. After about 15 minutes past, I had to ask for my salad and bread. 3 minutes later, my food arrived. This is a nuisance to me, I should be allowed an opportunity to enjoy and finish a side salad before the meal arrives. My NY strip was supposed to be medium rare, arrived medium well. You can't uncook a steak. I voiced my displeasure and fortunately a manager stepped in and made it all better. Steak was replaced with a Filet and cooked to my original specs. I probably won't return to this location but it doesn't influence my decision to return to other Outback locations."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I appreciate in a restaurant (especially chains), is consistency. I always know what to expect at Outback. A decent cut of beef prepared well and reasonably priced. So, if it's a Thursday night and you just want a moderately priced meal with consistent quality, Outback is a viable option in any city."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced for what It is (paid $60 after everything).  The lobster I got was the size of a shrimp and the steak tasted like rubber."}
{"text":"I seem to find that I can always count on Outback Steakhouse to deliver awesome food and superb service. My Mother-in-law frequently sends my husband and I gift cards to Outback so we pull up to the bar at our favorite location and every time Adam, the bartender remembers our names and has a smile on his face! We do not even bother getting a table, we just eat at the bar. I tend to order the 6 oz.filet, with the house salad and the tangy tomato dressing with a loaded baked potato. What could be wrong with that! I say nothing, it is always delicious and I am so crazy for the tangy tomato dressing, did you know you can ask to buy it to take home...or I will order the Alice Springs chicken with the same sides, and that is always just as good too. I love this place, it is great, the price is right, the atmosphere cozy and it is consistent!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night, ordered my steak medium-well.  The server repeated my order.  The steak came out RARE.  Sent it back.  They brought it back in 5-8 minutes, it was STILL RARE.  Now this is what I call ridiculously embarrassing.  The manager apologized and said she would take my meal off of our ticket.  Really?  No s&^+!  My daughter finished her meal, we left, I did not eat mine.  Could not wait for them to try to get it right.  They took our appetizer and soft drinks off the bill.  How generous.  With this kind of service, if I managed that restaurant, I would have said \"the entire meal is on the house and here's a gift card for $50, please give us another chance another time.\"  And no, I almost never write reviews and I certainly don't write them trying to get free meals!  I will never go back to that location and most likely won't go to another Outback restaurant."}
{"text":"Have not been to Outback in years. Let me say I was pleasantly surprised.  The Ribeye Steak was perfection and the warm molasses bread yummo. The best part was the service now I know they aren't your top of the line steak house, but they act like it with decent prices. You must get their chicken wings they are crispy to perfection and just a tad spicy. I will try it back in CA hopefully it's not just the Nevada hospitality."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night around 5:30. It was extremely busy but our waiter Jeremy and the other staff did a FANTASIC job. We were sat right away, drink order taken immediately and out not long after. Food was great, good portion sizes, and reasonably priced. All members of the waitstaff really helped each other out and were very friendly. I can't recommend this place enough. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Don't spend your winnings here for sure we wanted a steak it was a busy weekend so we called outback sure bet rite no way never again not sure why this outback was gross but beware the porterhouse steak was more nasty fat than any. Steak I have ever seen in my life for 30$ come on now and oh wait the ice burg Lettuce salad with three cherry tomatoes after asking for extra was wilted and brown our waiter was nice and so was the staff but if I was the manager I would be embarrass serving such food out bill was 70$ not worth a penny of it oh the water was cold ."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the petite filet. It was maybe a 1/2 thick and over cooked. Looked more like a cheap flat iron steak. In fairness the manager did take it off of our bill. If this is Outbacks idea of a filet mignon ill stick with longhorn"}
{"text":"Took my mother in law out for lunch . The food was excellent ! Had steak and endless shrimp. Never seen my mom eat so much! They even brought out a special desert for her birthday ! All the staff were super friendly and our waitress Teresa was the best! The prices are very reasonable ! I definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Could be worse, could be better. I've always gotten friendly service here so that's a plus.   I usually go between the NY strip and the Victoria filet. It's always enjoyable but never memorable. You get to chose two sides and I usually opt for mashed potatoes and a caeser salad. You get a good amount of food but I always leave feeling like the price wasn't totally worth it. Believe me, I know it's a chain steakhouse and I don't expect gourmet meals, but if given a choice I would probably go elsewhere. It's reliable, I will give it that. You always know what to expect. And I've never had a trainwreck experience (or hair in my food!)"}
{"text":"Poor service. Did not know about specials on tv. Sat at the bar for over 10 minutes till bartender came to serve ask for a happy hour drink was told it was 6:01 and happy hour was over. I explained I had waited on him for 10 minutes his simple answer was it's all computer controlled he cannot do anything about it. The food was excellent though I had steal and lobster, tasted fantastic"}
{"text":"This is a must try for families. This place has great service and is super fast. Very accommodating for big groups and the service was excellent. The food is really good and so are the drinks are tasty too."}
{"text":"My husband is always telling me \"steak isn't hard to prepare, it's the cut of meat, the grill flavor and the sides that make it a good meal\".  So when my husband asked if I wanted to try Outback, I was a little surprised.  They were very busy, but we managed to snag a table with very little wait.  Our server came quickly and offered to take our drink orders, we also asked for a couple of appetizers, the Seared Ahi Tuna, one for each of us.  It's served sashimi-style, big slices of tuna rubbed in bold spices and seared rare. Served with creamy ginger-soy sauce and wasabi vinaigrette.  It was an odd color, almost blackish, but the flavor as good.  For my dinner I had Hearts of Gold Mahi, a wood-fire grilled Mahi topped with artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, green onions and a lemon butter sauce. Served with fresh seasonal mixed veggies, This was delicious.  I recommend it, and it kept me within my \"diet\" standards.    We had good food, excellent service and even though I had the fish, it was a great meal for a steak house!"}
{"text":"Like to come here once in a while. Normally get a sirloin or some other steak. Sometimes the sirloin is very chewy, but I enjoy it. The servers are always awesome and I really enjoy their Oreo mini shakes."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was the bloomin' onion shrunk!!! It's about 40% smaller, but the price didn't shrink! Server decided on his own to give me the larger draft beer and he was kinda pushy with his opinions on what I would like. He also butter flied my filet without asking.  Food was what you would expect from a medium end stake house, but the waiter ruined the overall experience."}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good here and I never have to wait to be seated. I just dont really like that they make you pay for your food on the tablet that is on the table. I went yesterday with my daughter so we can get the 3rd dine rewards visit but my server did not even put my phone number in after giving it to her. This is the second time it has happened to me at outback. I guess it isn't really that big of a deal but I basically only went so I could get the $20 off at Bonefish grill"}
{"text":"I like Outback but their service sucks. Made online reservations at 6:50 got seated at 7:40 at 8:10 food arrived."}
{"text":"Service was amazing & the food was even better! However we did come at 7pm on Friday so we waited about 40 mins to be seated, definitely going to call ahead next time"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad steak there until our last visit Jan 4 2015 we went for dinner my steak we very tough our server took it back they made me a new steak it was just as tough as the first one with lots of gristle. I'm not sure if they are getting there meat from but the quality is gone, I well probably never go back we spent 50.00 for the meal not including the $10.00 tip."}
{"text":"Have'nt been to an Outback in many, many years, but when Mom said that's where she wanted to go for her Mother's Day meal, that's where my sister and I took her. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. When we arrived was told it was an hours wait, but my sister scored a booth in the bar area in 15 minutes.  As busy as it was, our server Mike, took care of all of our requests with a smile, refilled drinks promptly, and cleared plates quickly. Managers were checking on guests and handing out gift cards for $10 off your next visit. I like now at Outback you get your steak cook wood fired which is over oak wood with out a heavy dose of the Outback seasoning mix applied. My sister and I enjoyed our steaks which were cooked to order, tender and juicy. I had a dinner salad with bleu cheese dressing which I am very picky about, but it was really good with big chunks of bleu cheese.  My Mom ribs were fall off the bone tender and she really enjoyed them. I have to say that I won't be dinning at an Outback any time soon, but If Mom picks Outback for next special occasion meal, I won't be disapointed, especially if we get the same service and food quality as we did on this visit."}
{"text":"35 min wait was worth it. Lara kept up with our craving of the loaves of bread. Blackberry martini was yummy. Steaks were seared & grilled just right around the table: well, medium, med well. Grilled asparagus hit the spot."}
{"text":"Using the the feature online to get on the waiting list for our party of seven on a Sunday night, we were advised to come in around 45 minutes later at 7 PM. After we arrived, we were told by the hostess that we were waiting for the party to leave that was sitting at our table, we waited about 10 minutes in the waiting area. From there, everyone enjoyed a delicious family meal.  You know what to expect from the Australian inspired restaurant and they have consistently come through for me. Steaks are what is at their core and they provide a selection of 8 cuts of aged steak with your choice prepared either classic seasoned & seared or wood-fire grilled. I don't think you can go wrong with either, it just depends on how much smoky flavor you want. Cooked to order, there are actual photographs of what each temperature looks like on the menu. Speaking from experience from the service side, this is a good move because a good number of customers are unaware of how proper temperatures should present.  Ironically, their consistency did not come through for me with the Victoria's Filet Mignon Portabella ($24.99) as I requested medium rare and it came out hockey puck well done. But they did a fine job of rectifying the situation after I informed our server. She immediately acknowledged the mistake and apologized, offered me something else while I waited for the re-cook, and had the manager run out the perfectly cooked re-fire.  Also ordered was the well known bloomin' onion ($8.79), Aussie fish tacos ($11.99), the 7 oz. perfectly grilled salmon ($15.99), and from the special hand carved roasted sirloin menu, the classic roasted sirloin (8 oz. $14.99) and the marsala roasted sirloin (5 oz. $12.99). Everyone was pleased with their meals. If you like sweet potatoes, I would recommend this as a side for an additional $2.99. It comes topped with honey butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Don't forget desserts here either as they have a variety of mini and shareables selections."}
{"text":"I have been to many locations and I am a fan. This location is not a good one. I called in an order at 8pm. My food didn't come up until 8:45pm. I ordered rare and it came out medium well. The manager I talked to asked me how I wanted it cooked like I never said I wanted rare to begin with. It came back way over seasoned.The salad was Small and portly thrown together. The blooming onion was soggy before taking it out to the car."}
{"text":"Awful horrible terrible / worst food I eat in my live we we 6 people every dish was terrible the steak you was not been able to eat just chewy like bubble gum the meat in the salads the same the hamburger my friend was eating terrible too was vomiting whole night in hotel just terrible everything even the waiter gave us right the meat is sometimes not good !!!! Oh yeah !!! He took several items from our bill thank you for this but it is suppose to be a Outback Steakhouse  was a terrible terrible restaurant and happened to everyone of our 6 different meals all!!!! Wee horrible ...never again in any outback !!!!! Stay away or you get sick !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our visit was less than perfect but that's okay. We sat down and immediately noticed it was uncomfortably cold in there. Not a big deal to me. We ordered and once we saw other people getting their food first we started to wonder. I have patience but my company grew mad. I had a sirloin with veggies and he had chicken tacos. The manager came over and said she was sorry but the chef messed up a taco and that was causing the delay. She left and came back a few mins later and said not to worry about the meal as its going to be comped. Again, I wasn't mad or even bothered, things happen. Unfortunately, my company was. Okay, so on to the food. My steak was cooked to perfection. Tasted delicious. The veggies tasted fresh and the house salad was good. I enjoyed my meal. My company enjoyed the tacos once he got them. I think the only REAL negative complain I have was the air condition being on Arctic. Lol! Still a good experience minus the couple of mishaps."}
{"text":"I'm enjoying an evening lunch at Outback with my boys. The Concord Mills location is great! The waiters are very accommodating, the music is great and this location is always clean; the restrooms are clean but the water system at the sink is a little temperamental!  My waitress Cassidy was great and the manager Kate even came out to check on us to make sure we were satisfied!   The menu has some very appetizing choices and there's something for everyone. The Alice chicken was my choice this time although the Aussie 4-Course menu choices looked awesome! FYI the Alice chicken is a must try!  The cookie skillet is so good I think it's going to haunt me in my dreams! OMG, it's the right balance of sweet, salty, crunchy and chewy topped with vanilla ice cream goodness!   We will definitely be back soon to try another mouthwatering dish from this amazing menu followed by a dreamy cookie skillet!"}
{"text":"This has been our chosen steakhouse since we moved out of the city in 2008. Tonight, we were celebrating my wife's 37th birthday and unfortunately this was the absolute worst service I have ever received. We ordered apps and drinks and didn't see our waitress again until we ordered our entrees. I was overdue for a refill and asked for one. It never arrived. When another waiter brought out our entrees we asked for refills, this time for everyone. Again they never arrived and both my and my wife's steaks were overcooked. After eating our overcooked steaks the waitress finally arrived to ask if we needed anything else. For a third time we asked for a refill and finally received them to enjoy as a post dinner drink. We asked for a manager so we could voice our complaints, but were told that they were too busy with a larger party. The waitress offered us the manager's card instead. They weren't too busy to go ahead and charge us the full $125 for our overcooked meal with no drinks though. Needless to say, we are in the market for a new steakhouse."}
{"text":"Dependable food.  Love the breaded coconut shrimp    Try to eat here 0nce a week"}
{"text":"I was with a party of eight that had lunch at Outback Steak House.  The restaurant decided that they should add 18% to the food total and and sales tax.  I was so offended by this that I almost crossed it off and wrote zero.  The food was average and the service was below average.  The gratuity is 100% my discretion.  Do not automatically add it to my check.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Love the food here and the service. We often eat here at what would be considered off rush hours so we get exceptional service. Our waiter knows us and always steers is to the correct food for our tastes. The prices are reasonable and the surf and turf is much better than anywhere else we have tried.  We are not food snobs but we most always end up ordering the more expensive items in the menu knowing that you get what you pay for. The rewards program is far better than others."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go for a family dinner. The best part about it is the location. There aren't very many restaurants in the area. I'm not super impressed with the food or service at Outback (not just this one in particular). Everything seems pretty mediocre. But we still had a good time with friends and family!"}
{"text":"It's Outback. Why is their bread so good??? It just lays there and stares at me begging to be eaten.  They do have healthy options everything on their menu that has a little leaf by it [you need to mention the healthy to the waiter] but can be prepared under 600 calories.  I got a salad no cheese no croutons [no fun] to start and a 5 oz grilled [no butter] chicken breast and dry broccoli [fml training sucks].  And if you want to be a piggie pig they have a 4 course meal for $15 which is a GRRRRReat deal.  soup/salad/entree/dessert.  You can't really beat that.  My friend got their wedge salad and I swear the presentation on it was amazing, like 5 star restaurants presentation.  Service can be a little slow at times but this time we got a very nice waiter named Noel [like Christmas] he was very pleasant and attentive.  He obliviously was trained in French culinary/waiter service b/c he bagged all of our lunches w 2 spoons French style, again like you would find in a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Very positive experience!! Blooming onion was out of this world good! The garlic mashed potatoes are amazing as well! I want to recognize Jessica for being a delightful waitress and providing excellent customer service! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Last time I went healthy and got grilled chicken and dry [no butter] broccoli.  It was very good!  This time I ordered a steak and a potato with a glass of wine.  I remember when I was younger I thought the steak here was pretty good! This time not so much. It was tough and fatty, not so bueno. Didn't like it much at all. My friend ordered steak too! His was over cooked as he wanted M/R but got M/W.    If you go, I'd shy away from the steak, just eat the bread and drink some wine!"}
{"text":"Got some Newby kinks to work out.  Some hygiene issues too. The water container in the waiting area looked dirtier than the water inside. Yuck! And I'm a little concerned about the wait staff carrying the cloths to wipe the tables in a plastic bag in their pockets.  My waiter, as sweet as he could be, brought my side veggies to the table \"while they were warm\" about 15 minutes before my entree arrived so I ended up eating them cold anyway. Hoping things will smooth out as they gain a little more experience."}
{"text":"We got appetizers and drinks. The food was really good and big portions, but the service left something to be desired. It wasn't really busy but it took a while to even get water and silverware. The draft beer was warm, but the manager, Jessica, did come over and get us another. Food, yes. Service, no."}
{"text":"Visited this location yesterday 4-13-18. It was very busy. I was a little irrated there was more than enough room for seeting however there was a group of 6 older people that refused to move out of the way. They were just standing in front of all the seating and talking blocking patrons way as well as workers. We were seated quickly and had a kind waitress. She got our daughers order in quickly and food out then took ours. The steaks came out fairly quickly however they put so much seasoning on it the outside of the steaks looked blackend. We did not compalin as I understand the restaurant business. Never really have a problem with outback but it seems that when they are underpressure the food quality suffers more than anything. Thanks to the kind waitress though."}
{"text":"I was in on Tuesday night and our server Cody was awesome! We started off with an appetizer and it was out within minutes. When Cody brought out our entrees, he made sure that the steaks were cooked to our liking and was consistently checking up on us. He made us feel like we were more than just a table. We will definitely be back to see him!!!"}
{"text":"#outbacksteakhouse #disrespected I had the worst experience I've ever had eating at any establishment. I go out a lot and go at 5 star restaurantS. Since having a child, I've tried to go to more family oriented restaurants. I went to outback tonight, and have never felt more disrespected. My 18month old son was having a great time, giggling and did get a little loud and screamed. I was clearly saying no, inside voices.. but again. He is just over 1. After that happened, the manager David came up to my table and asked me to tell my son to be quite because people are complaining. As I understand he was doing his job, and he even brought us some ice cream, how dare you tell me to ask my 1 and half year old to be quiet. Also why would you bribe my child with sugar when you want him to be quiet. The manager told me that it is easy asking him to be quiet, and that he is just trying to please everyone. Well not us I guess.. He is still a baby. I'm so upset and will NOT be going to outback again. #NOTFAMILYORIENTED"}
{"text":"Food was not that good but waitress like her makes you want to come here again. Ashley was super nice. Excellent customer service. I give her a 5 stars and our food a 3 stars."}
{"text":"I Have ate at many outbacks before. This one is terrible compared to the others i have ate at. To start I ordered a porterhouse medium rare with a wedge salad. Salad took forever to come out and there was no bacon as described. Then the steak comes out right when i was eating my salad. And it comes out well done when i ordered it medium rare. They noticed it was wrong and sent out another steak. They sent out a steak that looked terrible and was almost raw and fatty. I think they were trying to punish me. The managemnet didnt care and the steak was terrible. I had a good server and paid my bill and tipped well becuase it was not the servers fault. But i would stay away from this outback. The food is below standard and management does not understand customer service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I don't think I'll ever come back here. Cody, our server, was very nice & accommodating so my gripes have nothing to do with service. First of all, it stunk like urine walking in the door & my husband said it was horribly worse in the blokes. Second of all, $3.29 for coffee or lemonade is a bit high. I have to say the bloomin' onion is still good but messy (it would be a nice touch to add a towelette for onion smelling fingers) and the bread is still pretty good. My Dad & husband ordered the pork steak which was cooked to order well as were the potato sides, but the steaks were a bit plain and average & could use some applesauce or bbq sauce to go with. As a vegetarian, I ordered a Cobb salad with no bacon bits (I appreciate the modification), but it came with yucky iceberg lettuce & no egg. It had nice grape tomatoes and packaged shredded cheese (also yuk). The croutons were fresh as advertised. All items seem over priced to me and generally just average. These chain restaurants continue to use those tabletop screens which are annoying to us. Also the tortilla soup they started with was a bit spicy. The portions are large so we took most of our entrees home."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Outback I forget how much I like it. I usually order some seafood dish or if I am in a steak mood, steak! The blooming onion is seriously the best! Ah such a good cheat food with the sauce. Yummy. The staff is hit or miss. Sometimes here they are friendly, sometimes so-so. We came on Christmas Eve as well and it was still pretty busy."}
{"text":"At the risk of sounding like an elitist, this is definitely not Ruth's Chris. (Which of course I knew going in...) However, is decent for what I'd call a franchised American-cuisine restaurant. Sure... they're called Outback (Australian) and Steakhouse (steaks), but, I don't (personally) view them as either.   I think they have a broader appeal because they are well known and accessible to most. Every time I go to one, I think \"don't order the steak.\" Yet, somehow, I always do... Which I always regret. The food is 3 stars (A-OK). Not terrible, but not great.  We went here before a show one night, and were happy to find absolutely no wait. We were promptly greeted and seated. The menu is really diverse - which I like. It's also not overly expensive for a steakhouse.  We were promptly brought our drinks and a big hunk of warm bread. Yum! I started my meal with a salad. It looked good, and was fresh, but was soaked in dressing. I couldn't finish it, but ate what I could. (Get your dressing on the side.)  For my entree, I ordered filet. I thought, 'who can mess up a filet?' I ordered it medium, and it came out rare-rare (red, cold center, and barely browned edges). I really tried to eat it, but couldn't. I wasn't going to say anything, but my husband assured me it was concerning raw. And, it was chewy - was it a bad cut or too raw? ...Must be too raw. Especially since my husband's ribeye was fine...   By the time our waiter came back around, he was half way finished with his and I'd eaten my potato. I showed the waiter my filet and asked if it looked raw to him. He agreed it looked very raw. He took my plate and apologized. Within a few minutes, he brought my plate back with my same steak cooked a bit more. While this was fine with me, I didn't think it was sanitary/allowed for restaurants to take eaten and cut up food into the kitchen, refire it and then bring it back out...  Anyway, I tried it again and decided I just couldn't eat it. It was cooked medium as requested, but it was so VERY tough and chewy. Filet should not be chewy. I cut it up and tried different parts of the filet... it was just a terrible cut of meat. It had a white strip all the way through (which I forgave at first because it's Outback), but was fatty and tough.  When the waiter came back, I politely thanked him for trying but told him I couldn't eat it. He apologized and sent a manager over. She offered to bring me something else, but I explained we had to run to make it to our show. Thankfully, she took this off of our bill and threw my filet away. They made it ok to the best of their ability, but I can't help but to be disappointed in any steakhouse that can't serve a decent filet.  So, it's probably better for family outings where people can get anything they want. I just recommend you do not order steaks. Despite it being a steakhouse. Sorry..."}
{"text":"The steaks were cooked to a medium rare as requested. Good stuff.  The lobster tails were overcooked. We mentioned it after we ate it all. haha So the waiter gave us a free appetizer for next time. He was attentive and the service was great. It's Outback Steakhouse. It was a decent meal. Not the best steak in the world, but definitely not the worst. We shared the Bloomin' Onion. Love those heart attack foods! I think I called it an Awesome Blossom which might be for Black Angus. Not sure, but it's a deep fried onion alright. Leaves you with the best breath ever afterward! I forgot to eat some gum and sat down at the blackjack table a couple of hours later. Oops! Sorry dudes. I probably reeked."}
{"text":"Okay, so as part of my new years resolution I have been trying to eat better, more salads, less red meat etc....It sucks but oh well.  Anyways, I had a craving for steak and we were right next to an Outback, oh well why not, sure it's not going to be great, but really, outback is the McDonalds of the Steak world, nothing amazing but you know what you are going to get.  Which pretty much sums it up, the wife had a chicken salad, I had the sirloin.  Steak was cooked to perfection, potato had way to much salt on it as ever, but nothing really negative about the meal."}
{"text":"Called ahead, told 30-40 minute wait, was 40 minutes with tables open.  We weren't here for homecoming or prom, just grabbing dinner with family.   My potato and pork chop were on a plate that was too small to cut the pork chop, and it flew onto the floor. Then manager did a great job of replacing it.   But! My waiter had no idea, asked about desert shortly after getting out meals, then brought the check before I got my replacement pork chop and while we were still mid eating. Very upsetting and an industry no no.  I ended up asking for my porkchop to go because I didn't want to feel rush.   Another flaw: when I ordered my baked potato, he asked if I wanted everything on it. Being how I usually put the bitter and sour cream on the side, I said yes. What I got was a loaded baked potato. I feel duped. He could have asked if I wanted it loaded! :-(   I would give more stars for the manager, but because the waiter was slow on the uptake, only 1.   Then! My man was given the check and he put his card in it, but after the card was ran, the check was handed to me. Face palm."}
{"text":"food was fantastic .. but i should be tipping the chefs because essentially i was refilling my own drinks up the entire night . servers were invisible"}
{"text":"It's a great place for steaks and the onion blossom!  If you sit at the bar you can get some snacks for cheaper and they also have drink soecials. I love the onion blossom that is very popular and the steaks are juicy. It's also affordable especially for happy hour.  The service has been good most of the time but on my last trip we got unlucky and ending up sitting in an area with a few large groups. We didn't get all the attention as we should have but overall it's a great place to dine in.  The salads here are also very good here and for some reason they have really great croutons. I enjoy this location very much and am a regular here."}
{"text":"We are locals celebrating our 10 year anniversary on July 17, 2017! We usually stay away from the strip but we decided to do a staycation and came to Outback to see my friend Lisa C. for our meal. She is amazing but unfortunately she was off that night. Our wonderful waiter was Jeffrey B. What a treat! He goes above and beyond to make your experience great. The food was delicious and the service outstanding!!!! Thanks Jeffrey!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Got chicken tacos, chicken tortilla soup, and the boyfriend got a cheeseburger. All food was delicious, including my all time favorite: the bread. Staff was friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Outback in years.  We went with some friends from our baseball team since we were staying at the hotel down the street.  I was very happy with our choice in picking this restaurant for dinner.    We had a variety of dishes and everything was wonderful.  My friend had the Salmon and it looked really good.  I had the filet medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  The service was good and we left very happy."}
{"text":"Getting to this location is an effin' nightmare right now. It's especially irritating if they forget part of your order and you have to go back - not going to happen.  Occasionally we'll get food to go here..nearly every time they forget some part of our order.  We peek in the bag look to make sure most of it is there but don't open each and every carton to inspect (big mistake).  The salmon comes with some sort of sauce that at least makes it edible. No  sauce. I called. \"oh yeah, the salmon doesn't come with sauce anymore\"  How am I supposed to know that? How is anyone supposed to know that?!  Should we just start asking about every menu item? Does the pasta come with sauce? Well, actually...it does...but not nearly as much as it used to.   It's TO GO. NO napkins, No plasticware.  The no rules pasta with chicken was dry. The chicken - A grilled breast tossed on the top of the pasta. Not cut into strips or cubes.  I've always been disappointed with the level of service and quality of food. It used to be convenient so I would suck it up and do curbside. No more. Never again."}
{"text":"If I had the ability to choose my last meal on Earth, it would be what I had last night at Outback. Yeah, it's a chain and I ALWAYS order the same thing every time. I really REALLY love it! Always consistently amazing and never disappointing!  So for last night at THIS location:  Bread with butter- Awesome! What is it, molasses bread or something? Whatever it is, the semi-crusty bread with fresh whipped butter was good enough for me to eat an entire mini loaf myself (and I usually never fill up on bread).  Caesar salad- The first time I had an Outback Caesar, I didn't really care for it. It does not taste like your average Caesar dressing, it's got a peppery kick to it. It grew on me however, now it's my favorite! So good and well dressed with plenty of croutons!  Herb-crusted prime rib (picture posted)- OMG, this is even more amazing than the \"regular\" prime rib I used to get here (which they don't have anymore). I always get it medium-rare without steak sear (I would think searing it would defeat the purpose of eating a nice, pink cut of prime rib). Oh, also ask for the creamy horseradish on the side. I wish I knew the recipe for it because it's delicious and not overly spicy. I usually do not have a large appetite, but  I must admit to finishing an entire 16oz cut, just couldn't stop eating (fyi, over the 8oz cut, you can get 16 for just $5 more... much better deal).  Green beans- Even the green beans here were picture perfect and  cooked just right. They reminded me of the ones I had at Morton's (which is pretty pricey in comparison).  Sangria- I had the blackberry and strawberry-peach. They were both good, but go with the latter, it was by far the best.  Waitstaff- Our waitress was pretty good. Very professional and friendly, but not overly so (some people may like or dislike that). No complaints here! I also liked how another waiter and even the manager pitched in to clear some of our dishes when she was busy. That's teamwork! Oh, the manager also stopped by to ask how our food was, shows he genuinely cares!  :)  *My 2-cents on a recent reviewer that blamed Outback for giving him and a friend a bad cold/flu. These viruses take time to incubate, up to 2 weeks in some cases. The likelihood of becoming this ill after less than 24 hours of exposure is pretty low in my experience (I'm a mom and have been sick many times in my life). I've also been sick at the same time as friends who live across town that I haven't seen for awhile, same symptoms and everything. We live in a big city with a lot of nasty non-handwashers. Just thought a possible coincidence with no real basis for blame was unfair for a 1-star review.  :/"}
{"text":"We were doing an early afternoon hang and stopped in. We ordered the blooming onion and the tidbits. The onion was as always wonderful my not so good value of the day was the tidbits which was advertised as lobster and shrimp appetizer  for $10 and consisted of 7 shrimp and barely 4 pieces of lobster and I say barely because they could barely be seen. Service was as usual excellent."}
{"text":"We have decided to rename Outback to Not going back Steakhouse! Actually the last time we were there we said we would never go back. Guess we forgot!   Now they have these point of service machines at the table and the servers spend more time telling you about it than it would take to take your order.  Guess that's the answer to eliminating these have to pay more waiters and cut back on expenses.   So, I ordered the 6 oz center cut sirloin & hubs ordered the 8 oz.  mine med rare his med.  when they brought the steaks mine looked like a small piece of pie!  Actually if you want to know the truth it looked like a turd.  I cut it or more like sawed it to see if med rare & not only was it ugly, it was way overcooked.  It was way different looking than hubs steak.  So I sent it back. The manager came out apologizing profusely and said everyone was laughing in the kitchen at the piece of meat (sh*t). He had no idea where that came from & said they would have another steak out shortly.  Which they did and which was good & cooked correctly.  Hubs steak was over cooked too but I am sure after having to deal with me he thought they had had enough complaining!  Speaking of which his beer was too warm & he had to put ice in it.   So, my two cents....I would have never let that steak out of the kitchen or served it.  The server even said it looked weird.  Our main server said they should have never served it as it wasn't eve close to what hubs had  served.   They did offer us a free desert which we refrained from and in the end they comped me my meal which was nice.   But......once bitten, twice shy.   We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Outback is a great restaurant. You can count on the tasty food and good service. They are reasonably priced and consistently deliver a quality product. This location gets busy during dinner time, but I've always had a good experience."}
{"text":"I get it, Valentines is a crazy day. Two tops galore. We just wanted a family dinner. The hostess as my first impression, was not welcoming, rude and annoyed by our presence. We may leave just because service tonight may be the same through this restaurant. I would say this Valentine's Day, outback is serving up sadness...."}
{"text":"So just had a bad experience. I got the best fish tacos in the world which I have been craving all night. Then when I get done eating the tacos. After explaining to my girlfriend how they don't taste the same. I am sorting through the rest of the bags to at least enjoy their complimentary bread. I find the salsa for the tacos in the bread bag. They had the green sauce with the tacos but the salsa in the bread bag. I mean who would even look in there and to top it off, there was no limes, or lemons for my girlfriends water. I am just very upset because they tacos weren't the best fish tacos anymore."}
{"text":"We've been going to this Outback since we moved to Las Vegas in 2000. For the past few years, we have been lucky enough to have had Matt as our server! What a pleasure he is. We are always greeted quickly and our order is always exactly as we requested. Despite usually being quite busy as there are many other \"Matt fans\", he spends a few moments with us in casual chit chat and makes us feel very welcome. As long as we live in Las Vegas, we will be returning to this Outback. The steaks, ribs, chicken, shrimp, lobster is delicious and always cooked to our satisfaction. Thank you for your excellent service, Matt. You are a credit to the company!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular about once a week.  I travel a lot and have been to many Outback's and this one gets it right most of the time. The steaks are always cooked correctly and the servers are on top of their game.  The worst part about this store is the speed or lack there of from the bartenders getting your drinks- very slow!  This restaurant could make a lot more money if they added a service bar.  Always look forward to visiting as they have a good crew there!"}
{"text":"Outback is the perfect steakhouse to go to since it's near by. I always enjoy my food. This particular occasion I tried their steak and mixed fish special. I got the small steak and it came with shrimp, scallops, mango salsa and baked potato. The steak was spot on with how I wanted it and I loved the grilled shrimp and scallops. That mango salsa just flavored the fish perfectly. Who isn't a fan of a loaded baked potato?! The potato was one of the biggest I have seen ha ha. Service was great. It's good for friends or for your date night.  I have a few tips for people about this particular outback. During holidays and weekends expect longer waits. For real, one time the line was out the door. I prefer to hit outback for lunch or early dinner on holidays and weekends. On regular week nights it isn't bad."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Waited 25 minutes longer than we were told, only to be told they have no draft beer (understandable pump problems), then order (2) Shock Top beers ready for another to be told there out of the beer. Come on 5:30 Saturday night. Took 30 minutes to get our cold loaf of bread and paid over $130.00, the food had no flavor at all. This sealed the deal on why we go to Texas Roadhouse when we want a GOOD meal."}
{"text":"After taking the day to recoup from New Years Eve on the Strip we decided to return to the scene of the Crime... Or crimes.. Heading out with some friends from out of town for the night Phil and his wife recommended the Outback steakhouse on the strip... No Problem.   We parked over at the City Center and walked over to the this location which in the 2 years I have been in Vegas I had never been here. Despite the group of people waiting when we got to the top of the elevator we walked in like we had an Aussie access pass or something.   The whole experience was fast track, If I finished this review the way our meal went it would go something like this.  Sitbreadbreadordersaladbreadsteakeatleave........ Now in the amount of time it took you to figure out what I was just doing there we had already been seated and served our first loaf of bread ordered and began to sip on our iced tea... I know you think I exaggerating but it's true, I wrote it here on the Internet so you have to believe it.   After our lightning fast seating and greeting and the quick stealth like drop of our bread the waiter is upon us. Welcome, what would like, how would you like it and could I get you anything else all things thrown out to us. After ordering our meals the salads hit the table, all fresh and crisp. The next part of the experience could be considered good and bad; before our salads were gone or even half gone the expo was standing next to our table preparing to put our amazing steaks in front of us. Now, for me i am not a fan of that but in this case it was okay because the inner carnivore in all of us at the table began to take over as the salads were pushed away and the knives were drawn.   the steaks was amazing, no fat, perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection, the outback hit a home-run.  This place changed my outlook on the outback, the food lived up to the hype in this case.   If you find yourself on the strip and in need of some meat, hit the outback and get some grub, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"The service was awful!! We are from LA came to town for the weekend. We always have great service to go along with the great food. At this location, we waited over 40 minutes to get our food. We had the manager box our food to go cause we were tired from our trip. Got to the hotel and they didn't even pack utensils for our food. The food was still great but the service here was god awful!!!! The waiter never came to see if we needed refills. People that came after us got their food from the same waiter before we did and it seemed the 2nd manager was going to check on everyone in our area except us."}
{"text":"Below average service. Took over twenty minutes to get our salads. My wife's medium rare steak came out medium well. Our bread was stale. To top it off they over-charged my credit card. Thank you Outback for the worst Mother's Day dinner of all time."}
{"text":"It's been six years since I've been to an outback steakhouse... Not much is changed, so I presume that's a good thing. This restaurant is busy customers are happy joyful clanging of dishes and laughter equally good time, good spirits, great food.  Fair prices, quality ingredients you can taste.   After my last few poor reviews, I needed a good meal and something positive to say...that's why I came, and why I'll come back again.   Check the back of the menu for some fantastic drink options."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, the delivery driver was awesome! She was very friendly and conversational. The food was all a good temperature for it to be delivery. I even ordered dessert and the ice cream was still frozen when arrived. The food was average taste wise and good proportions. The full menu is available for delivery and the delivery charge is $4. Over all a good experience."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Each time the place is clean, service is slow, employees are friendly and food is well I guess it's what you would expect. But over all a good place and I am sure I will go again. If you don't like when the servers come over and sing for your birthday this is a place where your won't have to worry about that. They won't sing but you will get free ice cream. The one thing I don't like is the location and outside of the restaurant, to me it just looks a bit run down."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a number of times and have always had a pleasant experience. Tonight I ordered the grilled salmon with mixed veggies. The plate came with just the salmon. We inquired and the waiter went back to get some. He came out empty handed and said the owner told him no. Then the table across the aisle asked the same question. At that point I retrieved a menu and showed the waiter. He agreed but said he was getting screamed at in the back but would send his manager over. She never showed, we paid and left. Not sure what to make of that..."}
{"text":"The food was good, servers were great. One BIG suggestion: make your ingredients easily available. Specifically, our son has extreme peanut allergies, and we couldn't find any list, online or in the restaurant that listed them. The Manager, Jordan, came out and talked with us, went back and checked the ingredients and let us know what was safe. She was pleasant and professional, but o am sure she has other things to do. Make a list of common allergic ingredients available please."}
{"text":"New Outback location.  You HAVE to use the online check in system.  We attempted to come here a couple of weeks ago and discovered an hour wait time.  No way.  Not going to happen!  Today, we did the online check in and only had to wait about 10 minutes.  It was like rolling VIP.  Chain place.  Decent food.  Husband asked for medium well, no pink.  He received it bloody.  Had to send back and wait for his food while the rest of us ate around him.  Manager came over to try and make it right, but its really hard to fix that situation."}
{"text":"I am removing two stars because of the recent changes at Outback: they removed the best seafood dishes from the menu (instead they added a bacon-seafood dish which is totally unnecessary... And is certainly not even an option for pescetarians) and they got rid of the patio. And in general, it's way too cold inside.  My fiancé likes to eat steak so I join him for dinner. But there is absolutely nothing available for vegans. So I sit there with a bowl of sautéed mushrooms and go home hungry. Not very progressive, Outback!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the costumer service here! The meal I ordered didn't come out how I expected, and right away the manager, Laura, and the server, Jennifer rectified the situation. They made sure I was comfortable and had a great experience. I would definitely recommend on the atmosphere alone!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars....  We were hosting a meeting at our facility near MetroCenter and wanted to have an dinner with some of our coworkers in from out of town.  Our first choice Pappadeauxs was booked and couldn't get us a seat until close to 8pm (on a Tuesday...of course they are running their AYCE Lobster on Tuesdays right now).  Our second choice TGIFridays next door I was told closed down so it was up the road to Outback.    There were 9 of us and they handled us pretty easily even though I believe our server was pretty new to the game.  When I go to any Outback [I travel a lot and Outbacks are pretty consistant] I usually stick to just about the same things, either the Outback rack (rack of lamb cooked medium rare ) or their 6oz Outback Sirloin (prepared rare+).  On this trip it was the Sirloin, a baked potato and thier wedge salad.  The sirloin was thick and seared nicely and perfectly rare on the interior, the potato dressed perfectly as was the wedge salad.    I have no complaints about my meal or experience whatsoever.  My favorite part was their house Gold Coast Margarita for $3.50."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating here at least once a week . Their service had gone downhill very badly for a while but I'm happy to say it seems to be getting much better . Food has been consistently good lately . Tried another location this evening and we were definitely missing this place ! Ask for Phil . Awesome server. My least favorite is Cheryl."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed Outback Restaurants... The food has been good, as well as the service.  Tonight was the exception.  Our server didn't pay attention to our table like those around us (a small party of 3).  After serving our beverages and taking our order, she pretty much ignored us.  In a highly unusual manner, my steak didn't come as ordered.  (I prefer medium to well done.). We had to flag our server to fix the problem.  She took the steak and didn't return.  The manager eventually found my dinner and brought it to me.  My hubby and sis-in-law were finished by the time I started and patiently waited until I was done.  Our server did return bearing another soda for my husband but didn't even ask if us girls wanted refills.  I finally asked the manager for more coffee as my cup had been empty for quite awhile.  My sister-in-law and I ordered the Wednesday special, which included dessert.  After a l-o-n-g wait, server came back for our dessert choices, asking each of us if we wanted it boxed to go.  No, we each told her we wanted to eat it there.  Off she goes... Without asking my husband if he would care for dessert!  Amazing!  After looking forward to a nice meal out, we were so disappointed.  If we go to this particular Outback again, we won't be sitting in her section...that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok ........... Was not to happy with the food .  Got the all grass fed burger .  The bun was dry and the hamburger patty was ok .  For what I got here I could have gotten the big Mack at McD's  Then they had to place us were there family's and kids that can't act right .  Service a little slow . But that expected on a busy night.  My wife got a drink that was skinny Rita that was like salt rocks drink . Tons of salt at the bottom of the drink .  The Manager was kind enough to to take off the drink .  This is the second time in an issue with outback this year . The first one was terrible. And I was really hesitant to come here tonight  but it was paid for by a gift card .  However????? The light of my date with wife was the New York Cheesecake...  I forgot all about the bad . That's until I got way to full from all the water I drank....  Will I come back ?  Food no  Cheesecake.. Heck yes !"}
{"text":"We had my husband's birthday dinner at this location.  He said his steeak was perfectly cooked.  I had the Ahi Tuna Sesame salad.  This salad would of been SO much better if they used mixed greens vs iceberg.  Iceberg has no flavor, at all.  Great table service and we loved our server."}
{"text":"Amazing service, my water glass never went empty, even with them being so busy the food came out in a timely manner and it was delicious. The staff is very friendly as well."}

{"text":"Was with family in Vegas. We were hungry. They wanted steak. I know. First mistake. Why go to Outback when there are SO many other places to eat? Well, my family wanted a familiar place. This location is location upstairs and is very dark, dingy and dated looking.   The prices were ridiculous. I know it's the Strip, but it's also Outback. We could have eaten inside at a nice place for what we spent here. A soda is $4.50! WHAT??!   My mother ordered the Ribeye. $39.00. The waiter said he advises we order the bone in because \"it tastes MUCH better\". The bone in was $10 more. My mother said not worth it. When the steak arrived it didn't look like a ribeye. After a few bites, my mother said it was definitely was New York strip. When the waiter came back to check on us (after quite a bit) she pointed out the fact that she was given the wrong steak. The waiter said \"I was you would have told me after the first bite. After that, there is nothing I can do. Besides I told you to order the bone-in cut\". So we left. and left 1/2 the steak as well.   Seriously-  you are in Vegas. Don't make the same mistake we did. Go someplace nice!"}
{"text":"We used to get great food here, but unfortunately both myself AND my girlfriend got food poisoning off of chicken strips last time we ate here. We were both sick and woozy within an hour of eating them. Careful!"}
{"text":"Estevan was our server, for a table of 5.  He was the best waiter in all of our weekend visit to Vegas. He was knowledgeable, fast, and friendly. We came on veteran's day, they had a blooming onion special for veterans.  He asked how many veterans we had, we had 3. He said we could have 3 onions then if we wanted. He did not have to tell us that, and I feel the average waiter would not. We took 2 lol. The food was awesome, too!  My only complaint is he didn't split the check and splitting it up is actually alot harder than it sounds without a machine to do it for you. I won't take off a star for it because his service was outstanding, but remember next time Estevan! Split the check for the guests. Food was amazing, I found myself wishing we had gone there instead of Burgr by Gordon Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, just came back home. Nice food ,attentive stuff. I love stakes they serve tender and not dry....salads are aweso0me, and that brown bread they serve.5 stars place."}

{"text":"A vegan writes a review about a steakhouse....  My DD is not vegan, so I do end up coming here from time to time for her, but it's always via curbside takeout.  DD enjoys their grilled salmon, tilapia, Bloomin' Onion, and Alice Springs Chicken Quesadillas.  Occasionally, I'll order a house salad, no cheese, with their Tangy Tomato dressing, a baked potato and a side order of broccoli.  Vegans be sure to omit butter from the potato and the veggie sides.  They have a variety of green veggies from which to choose.   Everything was fine until the day a large fly was found buried in my DD's salad.  Poor baby lost her appetite for days after that. I reached out to the manager who apologized and took my contact information. (He was going to send me something.)  I decided that I wanted my money refunded instead, so I went up there. The manager obliged and still gave us gift cards.  This gesture earned them an extra star, but I just cannot give an A-OK after fly-gate.     For a limited time, they're offering No Worries Wednesdays and Sundays. You can get a 3-course meal starting at $12.99."}

{"text":"During my stay in Mentor - home of the basic bitch - I'm bound to go to a Chipotle, Ruby Tuesdays or Wendy's while in town. This time - Outback Steakhouse. 5 stars for location because it's so close to my mum's house and 5 stars for curbside pickup!   3 stars for the the blue cheese pecan chopped salad - love the dressing, pecans and blue cheese, but they need to make it better - chop the damn lettuce, add some tomatoes and red onion, and crumble the cheese so it's not just two huge chunks in a sea of lettuce. Argh, I'll just do it myself.   Tried the grass-fed burger, it was OK, nothing special, needed more aioli and the fries should be fresh cut, I could tell they weren't. Overall, this is one of the least irritating chain restaurants and I give them credit for updating menu a bit."}
{"text":"This is regarding an experience I had at Outback this past Saturday.  We arrived around 6:30 and were told it would be a 30 mins wait.  We weren't seated until almost an hour later and it only went downhill from there. We all ordered salads with our entrees but the entrees came out before the salads.  What?  Dessert was comped but the food was still medicore.  This is why I try to stay away from chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I would not even normally write a review for a place like this; you get what you expect normally when going to a chain like this.  I went their recently however and pretty much everything was bad.  The food was so heavy and greasy, the service was terrible, and the waitress was really rude.    On their menu, they have a \"Filet Focaccia Sandwich\" which is labeled with an asterisk indicating that it is cooked to order with the standard \"Undercooked meat could kill you\" warning.  I tried to order it medium, and the lady looked at me like I was an idiot, and told me that \"It comes how it comes, you don't get to choose\".  I don't know if the menu is just wrong or what (I ended up opting for a different dish), but her response was ridiculous.  Even if you like outback, I would certainly not recommend this location..."}
{"text":"**Gluten-Free**I would give 10 star if I could! I'm hyper-sensitive to gluten and our waiter, Joshua, was beyond outstanding with my Celiac Disease...very knowledgeable! The Manager made my salad from a fresh batch of lettuce and even cooked my steak separately from other orders.  I really can't compliment them enough!  Their GF menu was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"A truly mixed review.  I enjoy a good steak every now and then.  I have been to this Outback location a few times now, and it seems while I eat in the restaurant, my steaks and meals seem to come out as ordered with no issues.  Ordering out though has continuously been a disappointment on more than one occasion.  This past Monday was Labor Day, and we decided to order out and call in some steaks since we figured the restaurants would be busy and my niece and nephew were a little too wired to have a quiet dinner out. In total, we ordered 4 steak dinners:  2 of the largest size Outback Specials - one MEDIUM and one Medium Rare, 1 small Outback Special cooked MEDIUM, and another steak (I forget which cut and size) also cooked Medium Rare.  We also put in for side salads, loaded baked potatoes, and an extra side of asparagus (which we paid for). What we RECEIVED was nothing but disappointing.  I received 4 HORRIBLY undercooked steaks, no asparagus, and and a missing side of mushrooms.  When I say these steaks were undercooked, I mean I had to check them for a pulse to make sure they weren't going to jump off the counter top and head to the back yard to graze!!!  Im no Outback cook, but I can tell by the TOUCH when a steak is basically RAW on the inside.  These steaks were so soft to the touch there is no way they could have been considered rare.  Cutting into each one proved my theory... all were basically raw on the inside.   This isn't the first time this has happened.  EVERY time we have used their curbside to go, we have had things missing, steaks undercooked, etc.  We HATE calling in, but after this last time, we pretty much expect the order to be wrong or undercooked.  I actually had to re-cook the steaks in the oven (375 degrees for almost 9 minutes to get mine back to a proper MEDIUM - pink center.... not walking dead red!!!)  The manager was very sympathetic and comp'd our meal, which was nice, but still.... why is it that EVERY TIME we call out for dinner, something is wrong?  Is it that tough for a steak restaurant to cook a steak properly???  I attached pictures of my barely dead cow slices."}
{"text":"It's a typical Friday night at Outback around 6pm and exactly what you expected PACKED.   However, we were able to get a table quickly and had a server named Heather.   From the time we sat down and throughout our meal Heather always had a smile on her face, continuously attentive to us and was always checking if we need anything else.  My fiancé decided to order something we don't normally pick, the philly cheesesteak and unfortunately he was unhappy with it, but Heather said no problem, let's get you something you like and substituted it.  Shortly after, the Manager Michael came by and apologized for the inconvenience and said our meal would be out shortly.   Honestly, it wasn't his fault, we should've ordered what we enjoy.  Quickly thereafter, our meal came.   The Manager Michael and Heather came back on separate occasions and multiple times to check on us to make sure everything was ok, which we were all happy.   At one point, our daughter asked if we personally knew them and I explained to her, No, they're just really friendly and amazing here.     Working in a customer service setting, I know how extremely hard it is when it's busy and you are doing your best to make customers happy.  I saw Heather running around helping serve tables around us and she was always so friendly and smiling.   At the end of our meal, I told her thank you for being so friendly and her customer service was amazing.   She said \"I try my best to make you have a great dining experience so you can just sit and enjoy your food and not have to worry about anything else.\"  Well definitely mission accomplished.      On another note, I know customers love to call to complain and rarely call to praise. I feel this location definitely needs to be praise for all their hard work to go above and beyond to make their customers happy, regardless of a busy day or not.      Once again, I just wanted to say thank you to Michael and Heather for making our typical Friday night dinner extraordinary special.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for my moms birthday. Had a GREAT experience. Our waitress was awesome. Her name is Brittany and she was not only a great waitress but so friendly and charismatic. Definitely a reason to go back. We all ordered steaks cooked medium and all were cooked perfectly. Great desserts too and the whole meal was only $100 for 4 people. Great prices and great service and food. Very impressed with this trip."}
{"text":"This location has been my family's go to spot on those nights when you don't feel like cooking dinner.   The porterhouse chop is delicious, lobster tails delicious, mac and cheese delicious.  We normally do curbside takeout and the service is usually good and fast."}
{"text":"We had a gift card and some dine rewards so we went out for dinner.  This was our first time at this location. Everything was very good and the service was good as well.   Our blooming onion was tasty and came out quickly.  My 8 ounce sirloin was cooked a very perfect medium rare and it was perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend got the chicken and rib platter and he enjoyed his meal as well. His fries were a bit overcooked,  but other than that it was perfect.   Our waiter was very friendly and checked on us many times. Our drinks were always full.  We will visit this location again!"}
{"text":"came here for a nice lunch with my boyfriend. everything was great, we got seated as soon as we got there and drinks and food came out in no time. however, the waitress seemed to be out of sight majorly of our meal. before we were even done with our meal was asking us if we wanted any desert and how to pay. overall just felt rushed and not wanted here. very unpleasant feeling to have when on a date."}
{"text":"I went to this location with my friend to get an appetizer and drinks. So great. Nice clean atmosphere. We had the best server. Food and drinks were awesome and came quick. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our 30th wedding anniversary. We were surprised that there was no wait but it for a Monday evening. We ordered cocktails and the wing appetizer. Service was a little slow. My husband ordered the porterhouse steak and I ordered prime rib. Our server came back and told me they were out of the prime rib. So I ordered the porterhouse. The wings were steaming hot but not spicy hot despite ordering medium heat. My husband upgraded for a wedge salad and it was worth the charge. I paid extra for the Mac and cheese. It was okay. Our steaks were not very good. There was little seasoning but tasted very bland and was tough despite being medium rare and medium. It seems like everything has cayenne pepper on it. To end our evening we were waiting for our check and our server walked by carrying a prime rib for another table!  Really!  I was so upset!  I couldn't believe what I saw. I was going to say something but thought it really didn't matter at that point.   Will never go back. Longhorn was much better quality steaks that have better flavor."}
{"text":"Always great!  Every time we go, we enjoy what we get. Our most recent visit stands out because of excellent service on top of great food.  My husband got the ribeye medium rare and said it was perfect. I got the filet medium and it was fantastic. I also got veggies with it and even the veggies were delicious.  We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms which we had never had before ...definitely will have it again. We both also had walkabout soup which is always good.  The only thing I wasn't happy with was the cheesecake I took home with me. But that was my own error ordering a cheesecake somewhere that isn't known for it."}
{"text":"Came to outback with elementary school fiend. He owed me a steak dinner...and no, not from way back then.  The place was pretty packed, but we sat at the bar and enjoyed.  The waitress was very helpful and friendly...and nothing taste as good as a free meal..."}
{"text":"With very few restaurants in this area, Outback is probably the only choice in north east Mesa..well unless you plan on traveling further east towards La Sendas.  I have visited this location 4-5 times and every time I am not impressed. Maybe because I am not a big meat eater. On the other hand, my hubby loves their steak and stuffed potatoes. He also loves the blooming onion. Unfortunately, I do not see nor taste on why these dishes are his favorite.  I will not be coming back here to dine in...but maybe just belly up at the bar for a few cocktails."}
{"text":"The first time service was AWFUL and food was just OK, we opted to give it a second chance because we wanted steak and this place is close to home. Second chance service was better but food was nothing special and not worth the price. They do have a good happy hour martini special for $4, that probably the only thing I would come back for is Happy hour."}
{"text":"Outback isn't a bad place to eat lunch. I order there unlimited soup and salad. It's really cheap and the food is delicious. In the colder months I love going there and getting the potato soup. It's really good."}
{"text":"I signed up to give good reviews, however this location had dirty silverware on three visits within weeks.  Almost raw green beans, no drink refills I filled glasses at our table myself and went unnoticed by the staff and Manager. I know people mostly give bad reviews but this  location is not to Outback standards."}
{"text":"I went here on a friday evening around 7 pm . We waited half an hour for an open table. It wasnt too bad of a wait. Our server led us to our booth. We ordered fish tacos and steak for dinner. Came with bread and salad. Also ordered the onion bloom fries whatever you call it. I was just disappointed because every food we ordered was salty. Like why? Did you guys pour half a bottle of salt in every dish? I didnt finish my dinner neither did my bf. The only good part about this dinner was that our server was kind and awesome. Other than that everything else was not so good. I dont think I will be back here because I didnt like the food due to the saltiness."}

{"text":"Three of us, including my elderly mother, had lunch at the Outback yesterday.    I am primarily writing this review because of the service.  It was excellent.  It started with Alex, who served as the host.  He immediately noticed that one of our party might need a little assistance, so he opened the door and held it for us.  He welcomed us with a big friendly smile.  He also made sure we got a booth that was close by so the walk was not too long.  Our server, Brittney, was also very good.  She was friendly and helpful.  She arrived quickly, took our orders and was very helpful.  She also followed up to make sure everything was okay.  As for the food, it's what you expect from Outback.  It was solid and satisfying.  I had the fish tacos, which were tasty although the fish was cold.  My fries were only lukewarm, but they were very tasty.  My companions had the chicken sandwich, which was good-sized and tasty."}

{"text":"I've never been a big Outback fan. To me it's another over rated chain restaurant that draws people in because of its decent prices and average food. I went because we have a couple of gift cards and it really is close to my house. My partner got the ribs. They were tasty with a decent sauce and very tender. I got the grilled salmon. It was average, but I didn't expect more at a steakhouse. The grilled asparagus was a pleasant surprise.   My other surprise is that after two days, my stomach is finally getting back to normal. I'm not too happy about that. I still have money remaining on the gift card, but not excited about returning. I guess next time I'll stick to the beef.   I've tried several times to go to this place on the weekend, but the lines have been out the door. I refuse to wait at Outback. They are so darn popular. This visit was on a Thursday night and there was no wait."}
{"text":"My little cousin and I had a very nice dinner and the food was very reasonably priced. This particular spot did not look too packed anytime you go or pass by. The server was super chill and not over the top which I respect. The volcano shrimp is a great appetizer!"}

It's the only restaurant I'll go to alone just to eat because she makes me feel comfortable and not awkward. The staff here doesn't change very often. Most the same people for years and I love them all. I highly recommend this outback over others."}

{"text":"It's Blooming Monday... thanks Kevin Harvick for finishing in the top 10 to give us a free blooming onion. Or so I thought.   Our server was cool and laid back. We were seated too quickly I think, because he seemed a tad unprepared. But he quickly recovered and brought us our drinks after a brief disappearance.   This spot was our older son's choice for his birthday dinner. He really wanted the blooming onion. Being over 30 and the way my digestive system is set up, I knew to stay away. So our two sons engulfed it on their own.   Our food arrived quickly. Ribs for me and hubby. We were disappointed by the size of what was called a \"full slab\". It was more like 3/4 of a slab. But they tasted really good. Our older son also had the ribs and was pleased. Our younger son had the kiddie burger which was a rather decent size. He scored better than we did regarding portions.   Two bites into dinner and both boys complained of stomach pains. So much so that I had to leave with the younger one. We didn't make it home! Thank God I work for CHS and this spot is close to CMC-Pineville. We had to make a pit stop there for him to...well.. you know. And we DON'T use public restrooms like that so this was MAJOR!  The blooming onion basically went through the boys. Never again will we order one. Too greasy. You know how that still small voice tells you to stay away but you still do it? That's how we feel about the greasy, I mean blooming onion.   So I will give this spot a 3. Our service was good. Hubby and I enjoyed our food...although mine was enjoyed after getting everyone home and settled. Just think twice about the blooming onion. Free isn't always good!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Outback a few times, generally pretty average for the chain- however this  evening I ordered the Seared Mahi Ap ( small), and the Small Sirloin -  The Mahi was so bad I didn't even taste it, dried out, smelled bad, the 4 pcs stuck together- it had been prepared hours, if not a day or more before hand.  Honestly - I have to think that if I had been from their corporate QC - someone would have lost their job - should have never left the kitchen.   Well - they took the dish - and actually seemed more interested in selling me another AP than really fixing the problem - no just the steak please.   The Salad was fresh and fine, the Sirloin good, a little tough, but it was the cheapest cut on the menu.  The Steamed broccoli was slightly over cooked - but then smothered in a butter sauce -  ask for it naked / sauce on the side.   Next time in the area II'll go somewhere else - there are like 60 restaurants within 5 miles of here - so there are choices."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but they're successful for a reason. The food is top-notch. Service too.  There's no adventure here but sometimes you want a sure thing."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Outback we have been to!!! The service is so slow!!! We have been long time Outback people and I think we will have to find a new one. The only reason they got one star is because they don't offer zero stars."}
{"text":"It's an Outback. It's a chain. It's just okay.   I will start off by saying that service was excellent. I mean if I took 2 sips of water, my water was topped off. When I finished a plate, it was quickly removed.   We started off with the Aussie Signature Sampler which has fried mac and cheese, bloomin onion, and cheese fries all on one plate. It was delicious... the carb count was definitely worth it. I paired it with a margarita that was flavorful.   So then my meal comes out, steak, shrimp and steamed veggies. It was not good at all. The steamed veggies were overly cooked and soggy. It was as if they popped a frozen bag of veggies in the microwave and poured it on my plate to include the water at the bottom on the bag. I didn't care much for the shrimp flavors much... can't put my finger on what tasted off though. Even though my steak was overcooked, it was still nice and tender.   Overall, I laugh at the fact that my expectations were so high for my meal but I can definitely say that service saved the day!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly how I remember it 10 years ago.  NOTHING has changed.  Service is mediocre and the food is... edible.  There is not much selection, even for the kids.  Want a good steak?  I'm headed to Roadhouse."}
{"text":"This is a reliable franchise that has a varied selection of meats, seafood, vegetables, salads and soups. The food is good, service is fast and ambience is comfortably family friendly. The brown bread and blooming deep-fried onion appetizer is famous."}
{"text":"Outback is a fairly consistent chain.  Decent steaks, pretty good salmon and decent shrimp.  The blooming onion is the signature app and is pretty good other than it is huge calories.    The biggest issue with Outback is the patron who bring kids that they let scream and yell.  Not really Outbacks issue, more to do with the clientele."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and mediocre service after being seated.  Came here late evening about 745 when they started to decide to seat us someone in the party requested a booth and one volunteered to buss and clean a table so that we could have a booth, check mark one. All of our food was good and cooked well, hubby ordered a philly sandwich, we also had two steaks and I had garlic filet on skewers. I like a well done steak with out being dry, just don't like blood on my plate at all and they did a very good job! we left all satisfied, I would consider a typical outback experience."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience several weeks ago.  I ordered 14-ounce Rib Eye dinner.... what I got what looked just like my dinner companion's steak in the 8-oz sirloin/(shrimp) dinner. A 14-oz Rib Eye is obviously a good-size steak. They tried to say it just shrunk.  The second Rib Eye was not much better perhaps 10-11-oz. But the worst part was that the second steak was so grizzly that it was mostly inedible. I actually took pictures of it just in case Outback HQ was interested. No reply from email to their customer service. What a disgrace all the way around.   I have eaten at Outback Steakhouses all over the US on business for many, many years.... Lately, they have gone progressively \"down hill\" in quality and service.  This particular place was empty on a Saturday night... always a good sign to stay away.  While the manager did remove the charge from our bill, the dinner was a bad experience. I can only guess that Outback provides the quality of meat from their corporate level.  We ended up buying nice steaks from a local market the next day and cooking them ourselves at home.  If we wish to have road-kill we can certainly find lots of cheap horrible cuts of steak in the local discount stores.  Outback should be ashamed.  Be warned...."}
{"text":"Love going in for a nice lunch and glass of wine!  Always a warm welcome and great service, The food is yummy and very reasonably priced. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Predictable food, service, always provides a good meal.  Both seafood and chicken are good options to steak.  The desserts are also quite good."}
{"text":"Yes, my review for Outback has only gotten worse.  Being that it is close to my house, offers curb side pickup, and their commercials look so great, with great offers, I have given them a few recent tries.  This past visit brought my review to a 1 star rating.  After seeing the commercial for the Steak and Lobster special for $14.99 and up I decided to go for it again. I ordered the 5oz. Sirloin and Grilled Lobster and a fully loaded Baked Potato. And, ended up only being about to eat the Baked Potato, which was cooked to perfection. However, the lobster was raw! Completely uncooked!!! And, the steak was one of the worst peices I have ever received.  Complete sinu?? Not sure the spelling on that.  But, I was unable to even cut the steak due to the veins and fat running though it. So, based on my dispppointment, I made a call to the restaurant to speak with the Manager. I selected the Curb Side Pickup option, gave my name, my order, etc. and was placed on hold as they were going to get the Manager.  After 15 minutes on hold I finally hung up and tried to call back with no answer. They had my name, my order, which included my number and still no call back. Very disappointing.  I guess the price should tell me what to expect. With that said, I am moving on from Outback. I would rather drive further and pay more to enjoy, and even be able to eat, my dinner."}
{"text":"I went in to eat here last night after walking the strip and im glad i did! The grilled shrimp appetizer was amazing! The drinks were good and cheap and my alice spring chicken was amazing. My server was Lorena and she did a fabulous job! She recommended a great wine for my meal as well! The restaurant was really nice inside and very clean. The bathroom on the other hand was very dirty and needs more attending to!!! A 1 star for bathroom"}
{"text":"It is very very rare that I ever experience perfect customer service.  But tonight we definitely did! Our doors got opened for us, seated right away, we had the best server...nice short chats, refilled waters when needed, and everyone thanked us as we exited.  Food was good. Nothing too fancy but very good.  I usually get the grilled salmon, but decided to go with the new item \"firecracker salmon\" and that was much better than the grilled salmon. We will definitely be coming back for good food and good customer service"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Outback and a movie. Unfortunately our dinner took to long so we missed the movie. When our bill arrived the server gave us 2 free movie ticket and free dessert!! Talk about amazing customer experience!!! Thank you Outback!!!!  Not to mention some amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"I accept the fact that the Yelp community will punish me for eating at Outback when in Vegas but - their value is just right. You can expect a decent steak without emptying your wallet - the night is young and who knows where I'll end up.   Outback rarely disappoints. Have I eaten better steaks in my life? Likely (but I also spend much more on it). Would I bring a date here? Probably not. Is it good for pre-gaming with a couple of friends? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Outstanding service  Lobster was excellent  Filet was tender  Baked potato and veggies were good  Cheese cake was my favorite !!! Parking sucks"}
{"text":"I've dined here a few times. It's like an old time move...it's time has past. They have no redeeming qualities, it's like an old and dark 60's resturant.   Too bad"}
{"text":"It's a good ole standby for a decent steak. Love the salad, went for the ribeye this time over the sirloin. I prefer the sirloin here for some reason, the Outback Special is the way to go."}
{"text":"We checked the yelp reviews before going and saw that most we're not recently satisfied but we chose to go anyways. Our experience was generally pleasing and I didn't have any complaints. We all shared a blooming onion which was delicious and came out pretty quickly and our food came out generally fast but still with enough time to finish our appetizers first. I am so full ty"}
{"text":"Went to eat here on Wed.,12/17. Great steaks and seafood. As always the bread is soooo good. Service was great, very nice lady. However, two of the chicken wings we ordered still had some feathers on them. We had them take it back and bring us two new ones. One of the two also had feathers on it. That's why I didn't give this location a 5 star. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We ordered 2 sirloins that were tougher than an old boot and full of gristle. We asked for one medium steak and one medium rare. They were so dry, there was no natural juices. The mgr and waitress were very nice and offered another steak. We will not go back however. Texas Roadhouse was just down the road. We should have gone there and will next time. Returned to OB 4 months later and had a much better dining experience."}
{"text":"So my fiance and I had dinner at this Outback and I just had to make this review, mostly regarding the service. We both thought it was strange that our server asked if my fiance wanted his Amstel Light in a bottle when that is the only way they serve it. Also I had asked for veggies as one of my sides and I got the baked potato so had to wait for my veggies a few more minutes after my meal got there. BUT my biggest complaint was that our server poured me my 2nd glass of wine, which was a different type of wine into the same glass that I already had been using. That is such poor Restaurant etiquette that I really wish I would have said something. Food was pretty good. I tried their lamb for the first time. It had a good flavor but it was very fatty."}
{"text":"Love the food and service! I love their baked potato soup, soooo good. My husband and I enjoy the steak and fries. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, consistent with the Outback franchise. No complaints at all! Good steak for a good value! Love  the bloomin' onion but it is oh so bad for you, so  I usually just add some bloomin' petals to my steak for $1 extra. Their homemade BBQ chips are awesome too! Made to order and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointing. We went on a Thursday evening about 5:30. Totally packed. We elected to sit out on their patio. Great choice. Only good choice of the evening. Comfortable, sevice was good. Food was lousy. 3 of us all unhappy. Tried to order the prime rib. Only comes medium well??? What kind of steakhouse doesn't have rare/medium rare??? It came out looking so well done it was awful. Overdone, looked like it had been sitting around for days. I ordered the bone out ribeye, medium rare. It came out like shoeleather, well done. Horrible. Guest ordered the sirloin and coconut shrimp. The steak was total grissle and the shrimp was flavorless.  The whole meal was a waste of time. You spend $100 for dinner, you expect more. Won't be back here for awhile. VERY POOR FOOD, STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Im a fan of Outbacks food, but this location gets less stars for the service! My Rack of lamb was cooked to perfection, however I think I saw my waitress twice the entire night and once was when i had to send another server looking for her."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was wonderful! Me and a friend got a huge booth to ourselves with more than enough space and we were eager to come back with her parents. Although that time they stuck four of us in a booth meant for two. We had no space and our two drinks each took up the majority of the table. I love their food and it's great, but being in such a small booth really took away from the experience and the whole time I spent trying to get comfortable which was rather hard in such a small booth. Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful restaurant with divine food but the lack of thought was a tad irritating. Along with the fact that there were tons of larger booths available. I'd recommend coming here but think about how many people you take."}
{"text":"Bread was fresh and tasty.  My wife got the \"trio\" platter they are advertising, and loved the sashimi tuna on it.  There was also a crab dish and one other item.  For about $11 that seemed like a great deal.  I had the 1/2 lb snow crab and 6 oz sirloin at $14.  The steak was a little tough - not bad, just a little tougher than I'd prefer even for sirloin.  Their prices are OK.  I feel they play in the same space as Texas Roadhouse or Brown Derby Roadhouse.  Problem is, they don't include the salad.  Their sweet potatos are much smaller.  We didn't have to wait to be seated.  But they were reasonably busy.  I prefer the calmer, quiet atmosphere to the other \"roadhouses\" I mentioned.  Restrooms in good state.  They are a 'good' value, something in the middle.  Neither a value offering with tremendous portion sizes, nor, a high end steakhouse."}
{"text":"Love this place but unfortunately the service the last two times was horrible. The food was wrong,  the waiter forgot everything we had asked him for. 3 hours later we finally left. Excuses after excuses. Just poor customer service at a restaurant that I enjoy"}
{"text":"Outback Steakhouses are a well-known chain. The one I am reviewing is located at 1950 N. Rainbow Blvd. I assume that they use the same distribution and menu, but this is the restaurant that I frequent. I love trying new dishes and places, but when I have a craving for BBQ ribs this is the only place I go now. A lot of other places have good ribs, but this place is on a different level. The meat falls from the bone when your mouth touches it. They are amazing. I can't bring myself to order anything else when I'm here. Staff has always been kind and attentive."}
{"text":"A little background, my family and I had given up on outback about a year ago. But wanting a steak and not wanting to break the bank we decided to give it another try. Our waiter, Eddie gave us impeccable service, he was attentive and entertaining. Our food was also very good. Good job Outback!"}
{"text":"I went here on Friday night with my family and it was a pretty meh experience. I think outback is one of those chains where somehow they fool people into thinking their food is good, but, in reality, it isn't. They do have good bread and good caesar dressing, but all of the steaks I have had there have been mediocre at best. This particular visit was not so great because my Grandma ordered lamb chops, but they turned out to be too spicy for her, so she asked for a less spicy version and they were very nice about it...but when it came back it was raw....not so awesome. So she had to send it back again and everyone else was done with their meal before she got hers. Also, I had the teriyaki steak and it was super sweet....not something I would want again. The meat was tough and it was just covered in the sweet sauce. It came over some odd tasting rice....not great.  I got it with a sweet potato which was drowned in butter and sugar. It just isn't someplace I would want to eat again if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Usually outback is ok but on this certain day it was the worse. First there were about 10 associates doing nothing at all while it took almost 45 minutes for my food to come. I ordered the salmon and a side salad. The salad came first and I could already tell there was something wrong. The salad looked so old like it had been sitting out for days. It tasted disgusting. So I told them to switch it out for an Mac n cheese. Which took forever to come. When it did come I didn't eat it at all and I still got charged for it. The salmon was ok but I don't think I'll be visiting this outback again."}
{"text":"First review of the year!!!  My boyfriend reallyyyyyy wanted outback so being the amazing gf I am I just had to take him. =) I've actually never been to an outback. For drinks I ordered the gingerbread martini. This drink was amazing and really tasted like gingerbread!! I wish it wasn't only seasonal.    The reason the bf likes outback is because he loves their prime rib. And what happened? They were out. This was his second time here and the same thing happened with this location. We asked to speak to the manager about it and he ended up price matching us for the ribeye. He really enjoyed it. I ordered the special sirloin. I always get my steaks medium. But it was a bit on the dryer side and tasted more towards well done.  The manager came back and ended up taking the ribeye off our check. We really appreciated that and that really shows good customer service. HOWEVER, apparently they ALWAYS run out of the prime rib right around dinner time. That to me is poor service. If this is happening on a daily basis why would you not be more prepared and have more on stock? We pretty much have to call ahead to see if they'll have it. Which I find ridiculous."}
{"text":"The cheese fries were burnt, the steaks were very tough.  Just a very bad experience there lately.  You wait a long time for your food, it comes to you luke warm at best, why is that?  Outback use to be one of my favorite places to dine, now the food has been so bad the last few times, I think I'm finally going to throw in the towel with them.  Why should I keep paying high prices for sub standard food."}
{"text":"Waiter not friendly! Steaks not cooked as ordered and were over seasoned. Majority of the food we ordered was not fit to eat and was thrown away. When reported to waiter he didn't offer to make it right. Reported it to the manager via email and have yet to get a response. The food is too expensive to not be edible!"}
{"text":"OUTBACK YOU NEED TO STEP UP YOUR GAME OR PREPARE TO LOSE MORE REGULAR CUSTOMERS LIKE US.This location has really gone downhill. We were seated and after 20 minutes never saw our waitress or had anything to drink. We had to get up and track down somebody to get drinks. Another 15 minutes before they took our order. Our waitress Lizzy was one of the worst waitresses I've ever experienced. We ordered our food and waited another 40 minutes to eat. The food is marginal at best and very overpriced. We were there on a weekend at 3pm and there was nobody in the place.Our waitress rarely came around and our drinks were often empty. My favorite places are the ones that leave a pitcher for drinks at the table. Our waitress also never brought us any food ; it was always a different person bringing us everything we ordered.An empty restaurant on a weekend is not a good sign."}
{"text":"Went online to get on list. Such a joke get here 10 min before schedule time and still waited for 45 min. Requested a half booth half table. After 30 additional minutes was told it was getting close for half booth half table then when they do call us 15 min confirming the request, was walked to a table. The only response was \"this is what is available\". Poor service and no ownership of decisions. Lack of customer service to the level of fast food."}
{"text":"I ate here twice, and I feel like I ate from two different restaurants.  First night was take out. Not having time to really read over the menu, I ordered a simple burger and French fries. By the time I ate it everything was still fresh and hot. It was as if the food had just came out of the kitchen. Everything was cooked properly. The woman who was taking care of to go orders was on top of it. She seamed to be working harder than any other servers. Her customer service was impeccable. I couldn't understand the bad reviews.  The next night the whole family ate in. I got a steak with potatoes. The steak had a pepper crust on half of it.  The potatoes were questionable as to if they were cooked enough to eat. Being hungry, I went against my better judgement and ate them. Later that night I ended up sick to my stomach. The kids didn't like their food. We took their order for the adults to eat the next day. After getting sick we didn't eat it. My husband's burger was soggy, as were his French fries. Service was poor. I totally understood the bad reviews.   After having such a bad experience I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Well there's a new menu. Some good choices. BUT, they removed the mixed vegetable side. We will definitely curtailing our Outback visits!  Stupid moves by some corporate peon. They will probably get a bonus as they drive Outback out of business."}
{"text":"I went to Outback steakhouse for dinner. We was seated and I kept asking myself why was it kind of dark. I had the prime rib which it was just OK. My husband chicken pasta was good though. Service was fast we probably stayed for thirty minutes for the whole service."}
{"text":"I did frequent this location quite a bit (at least several times a month) because unlike the Stephanie location they had open seating in the bar area but they have since stopped that practice. I also don't care for the server entering your order on the new Ziosk and they also no longer offer where you can get on the wait list from the outback website.  I'll unfortunately be marking this location off my list."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives, service was great! That surprised me for a chain. Food, not so good. Ahi tuna tasted old, it had a strange texture and wasn't cold. The seasoning was good, I just couldn't get past the texture. I ordered the sirloin, it was horrible. I have experience with sirloin and it can be good if prepared correctly and from a reputable source. This was inedible, I had one bite and asked for a box. I took it to a homeless man I know. Even they deserve better but I can't let food go to waste. I will say the lobster tail was expertly grilled. Surprised it wasn't over cooked, but very happy with it. Probably will just stick to tornado for sirloin in the future."}
{"text":"What can I say about Outback? If you're looking for a casual, not so fancy but still pretty good food. Then, this is the place! We started off with the Bloomin onion and coconut shrimp. The Bloomin onion has always been my favorite at the Outback. Their French onion soup is also good. I absolutely love their brown bread. I always forget what it's called. But, it's the only one they have and it's really delicious. I like that the butter is whipped and very soft so you can immediately spread it on the warm bread. I got the surf and turf. I forgot which steak I got, but it wasn't the best. Although, the lobster tail was perfectly cooked. I love their sweet potato, I asked for more cinnamon sugar to put on it. For dessert, we decided to try the new salted caramel cookie skillet. It was absolutely amazing! As far as the service, our waitress was wonderful. Ariel was her name. Although, the hostess that worked in the front was very mean when we asked her for something. She was new, but it was her personality that just wasn't pleasant at all. Overall, it was a delightful evening..."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was even better, our waitress checked on us often. The manager stopped by our table to check on us and even remembered us a previous visit. Our go to place for service and great steaks"}
{"text":"I'm being generous today (with the 3 stars, but then I'm lowering my star rating standard to a chain restaurant level). The food was good, but I can't help but to write a review on a chain restaurant (which I rarely do) because... isn't Outback known for their service? Maybe I am imagining things, but at one point Outback was like the \"Disney\" of the chain restaurant world.  Well, our waiter would have made Mr. Disney (of Outback) very upset last night.   First, they tried to sit 9 grown people in a table so small we were on top of each other (and that's after we've been waiting at the bar). After we asked and someone upfront told one of us they would add another table, no one did anything until we pretty much did it ourselves. Then we had food coming out so far apart that those who didn't have food felt bad for those who had and told them to stop waiting because their food would be cold. Yet somehow when my prime rib came out, it was luke warm. Furthermore some of us did not have side items by the time it finally came out (ran out of mashed tater at 8ish pm on a Wednesday night?). My water cup was mostly not filled. And I had to ask the hostess upfront to get me a to-go box for my mushrooms since asking my waiter twice didn't produce any sort of a box.  SO... the food was good, consolation prize."}
{"text":"I've came to Charlotte, NC for Mother's Day weekend and my family and I decided to stop here for lunch prior to going to Ikea. We walked in when they first opened and we were the first guests. My aunt asked to be seated in the corner booth and was completely ignored by the host. The host stated that \"the server doesn't want to walk across the room\". This was surprising considering that we were the only guests and that it seems like walking should be in the job description of being a server. My aunt asked again to be seated in the corner booth and the host continued to ignore her request and walked to another booth closer to the kitchen. I asked to speak to the manager who was polite, but by this point I was so upset that such a simple request was being denied during such a special occasion that we decided to leave. I would NOT recommend this establishment and the host should be fired."}
{"text":"Children in the bar area? Screaming children no less. This is the second time we've been here that we've had to endure this. Won't be back for happy hour again."}
{"text":"Came here with my colleague that had a craving for steak. We wanted something that's not a chain, but we were hungry and wanted something now.   This place is less than 10 min from our hotel. We went there around 130p, on a weekday. Place is only about a quarter filled with customers.   Service was friendly and quick given it wasn't busy. Both of us ordered the same, 11oz steak with coconut shrimps. Overall, it was ok. For whatever reason, I was expecting the steak to be more juicy and hotter in temp. Wasn't bad, just wasn't anything exciting or unique."}
{"text":"Very displeased with my entire visit here.   Not getting one star because the steak was good, but that was also done incorrectly. Over the course of our meal, there were about 10 fairly large mistakes that took place. Like completely forgetting items we ordered, bringing wrong items, constantly telling the server what was wrong and how to fix it, and just overall poor service. The server was nice enough, but very absent and not very good at his job. The whole experience was very unwelcoming and the staff seemed like they didn't want to be there at all. No one was smiling and, again, just felt like we were inconveniencing them. The manager came to our table probably 5 or 6 times to apologize, but that's all he did was just say sorry over and over. It was forced and not believable, and the apology stood for nothing because there was still mistakes and poor service after his slew of apologies. No action taken.  I think that if a restaurant has the cojones to charge you $130 for a meal, they should really get their stuff together. This experience pushed me to the other side of the fence when deciding if I will ever go to Outback again, to make it clear, we wont be. Wish it was better and the manager was able to fix all these mistakes, because believe it or not, its a good place to go and the family likes it."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Wait time was great.  Food was prepared correctly."}
{"text":"We came here when we couldn't get in at Texas Roadhouse on a birthday. Very pleased that we did. The steaks are outstanding, and the selection - including some nice shrimp dishes - is fairly extensive. Some of the desserts are also very good. They offer either classic grill or a wood grill. It's ostensibly Australian, but that doesn't really extend much past the decor. (\"Good day, Outback. May I help you?\" Really?? It's \"G'daaay\", c'mon...)"}
{"text":"I literally made this account just to review this restuarant. If I could vote 0 stars i would. They got rid of all the good menu items (bushman shrooms included). The waiter never even came back with our drinks. During the time we were waiting for him we decided we could've had our own steaks cooked at home and it wouldn't cost us 20 bucks for a 11 ounce. (I'm exaggerating a bit but you get what I mean.) So, after sitting there we got up and left without even putting in our orders. The price isn't worth it. The steaks aren't even that great, but BEFORE you could get a meal for 9.99 so it was a nice affordable meal to take someone out to, but now its not worth it. I've learned from this and i won't be coming back.  We were wondering why the parking lot was empty at dinner time on a weekend. Now we know why."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of steak houses I've eaten at lately and everytime I end up saying I'd rather have gone to outback. Can count on getting your hang for buck. Large portions and reasonable pricing, especially when going with a large family. If you're not a steak fan they have plenty of alternatives that's also what I like as well."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I got the ribs and chicken kabob with fries. They are definitely not generous with the fries. My wife got the 6 oz. Sirloin with fries and same thing. The only thing that brings me back to Outback is the Bushman Shrooms which they have taken off their menu but will still make if asked. From now on I'll order then to go and get my meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"I hadnt had a steak in a couple of years. The filet with blue cheese was excellent. Odd tho the bartender had no idea what to do with my outback club card."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like cooking so thought we'd take advantage of the free bloomin' onion and order their $14.99 special. Decided to upgrade to the 8 oz. for $18.99. We got a greasy onion where the coating fell off before we could dip it into the sauce. It was way too greasy. The steak was a dried up piece of leather and if I weighed it I'm sure it wasn't 8oz. The baked potato was so dry I asked for more butter to be able to eat it. Didn't get served with chives-had to ask for them. He said the mugs of beer were $1 off but they still cost $6.50 each. This is ABSOLUTELY our last trip here. I wouldn't even rate it 1star but you have to in order to do a review. BTW-all the tables around us were complaining about tough meat too. DONE.  Madeline contacted me by email. I gave her the information she requested and they have never followed through with getting back in contact with me.  I take eating a good steak seriously. Two weeks ago we drove from Vegas to St George for a good steak at TEXAS ROAD HOUSE."}
{"text":"It was my first time at outback tonight. We got greeted really fast. Only waited for barely 5 minutes while the host was clearly trying to make sure we got seated. He was very organized with making sure tables were cleaned fast. He got us a bar table. Which I love the booths. Our waitress was Cailyn, she was so sweet! She helped when I asked questions and was super informative about the menu. Her recommendations helped me find my new favorite salad! That blue cheese wedge salad is phenomenal. What a great experience. Will definitely be back for more. We also overheard a conversation between a guest and a manager, the manager handled it so professionally! I work in customer service at Davids Bridal so I know what it's like when people want menu changes or try to get discounts for things. The manager was so professional and so nice about the whole situation. Overall, such a great experience! I love this place! Thank you!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is they don't know cuts of meat,  twice I have been there in the last few months, both time was served cheap sirloin instead of the ribeye I ordered.     Never ever going back"}
{"text":"Ehh- ok. Not a huge fan. Onion petals were burnt, salad was ok. We didn't order any steak. However, our bartender/ server was very very nice!"}
{"text":"Last week when I came here for the first time, I had really, really, really great service. Today... Not so much. The hostess at me at the only table that had no cutlery. Why? Totally clueless and untrained might be the answer. I ask the waiter, \"why did the host to seek me at the only two but without any cutlery\"? He uses my question to launch into and less whining about them cutting out the busboys, to the point where I had to say to him, \"that's not an answer to my question and as a customer I don't really want to hear you complain about not having most points, it's inappropriate\". So then my sticks him out in their unseasoned and pretty flat and tasteless, so he has the manager come over and she replaces that steak, and I tell her about the whiny but waiter and the clueless hostess and also point out that the baked potato came out cold. It wouldn't even melt the butter. So she puts out those fires and apologizes, but I asked her to please train  The staff, as there is no excuse for sending out a cold big potato, or unseasoned steak, or whining about conditions waiters. You know, I was sitting there, and looking on yelp at other local restaurants that are their competitors and in the same parking lot just next to them is a steakhouse called Logan's with a lot better reviews. You know want to businesses firing their busboys that doesn't say it's a healthy thriving business, and there are reasons why. When the manager is only a 20 something manager you already know they're cutting corners on paychecks and you're really not gonna have somebody who really manages the business."}
{"text":"This was one of the best experiences I have had in a long time! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We had a large party of 18 and the service was EXCELLENT Both Stan (The Man) and Tyson got all of our orders right! This was by far the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have recieved in a long time! Both Tyson and Stan(The Man)  deserve a paid day off! Thank Guys for making my dining experience a pleasant one!"}
{"text":"Alice Spring Chicken is good, chicken is moist and prepared well. The staff is a little pushy, they try to get you to order appetizers even after you tell them you don't want one, they continue on telling you which ones are good and which ones you should try bla bla bla. Food and service are alright"}
{"text":"Not the greatest experience. We went on 2/3/18 at 9pm and our hostess literally said \"party of 4\", didn't even wait for my family to get up from the chairs...she dropped the menus off (with no silverware) and left. ? Ok. I will say our server (think is name was Tristen...he was Hispanic and had a Trach scar on his neck) was super friendly and nice. That make up for not getting my cocktail sauce or my husbands garlic butter. I don't know. Just wasn't the greatest. We won't be back to this location and that server needs to go to a better location because this location sucks. He's much better than that location."}
{"text":"Ok here it is, my wife and I went here tonight for our anniversary dinner I was after a good steak. I ended up getting the steak and lobster tail it looked good on the menu. The steak wasn't tender and the lobster tail was only 4 bites worth they also got our sides mixed up but that wasn't a big deal the stuffed mushrooms had a lot to be desired for this is a place I would not recommend unless you're on a serious diet and you don't mind leaving hungry"}
{"text":"So i stopped in Ikea last night and noticed the new Outback, wow what a nice place.. The place was busy but staff was friendly, food was cooked to perfection and the new owner made us all feel welcome and made sure everything was good. Our drinks were good and we will definitely be going back when we are in the area. Thank you we had given up hope and you restored our faith in the food.. Good luck and we will see you soon for sure!! A must go to.."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and got the burger... Not good. This was mediocre at best. Overpriced, over promised and under delivered. I won't order that again."}
{"text":"Good steaks, sides-included, at fair prices.  Service is good and a family restaurant atmosphere.  Decent bar menu and a happy hour.  Not a gourmet place but hearty servings so you don't leave hungry.  Different size filets and sirloins availability.  Nice wedge salad."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna was excellent at a good price."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant bar none! Went to dinner there last night with my family, December 24th, 2017. Justin was our waiter. He very attentive and crisp. He gave us ample time to finish our appetizers before eating the main course. Anything salmon on the menu hits the spot! The steam vegetables are always spot on, not too soft, and not too hard."}
{"text":"We received gift cards for Outback Steakhouse for Christmas.  We decided to go to the one in Frazier pa. This once very popular location was very disappointing.  The appetizer, shrimp on Barbie was overcooked. I ordered a ny strip for my entree..it was tough and not worth the $21.99 price.  My husband ordered chicken and ribs.  The chicken was also overcooked and dry with hardly any barbecue sauce, however, the ribs were very good.  So if you decide to go ...best bet are the ribs."}
{"text":"Horrible. This used to be a great place to go to eat. We knew we were in trouble the minute we had a gum popping waitress lean over grab the monitor on our table and place our order for appetizers. The go to coconut shrimp.....were over cooked and had no flavor. The bread was cold and hard. The one steak had a white film on the bottom of it in several areas.... that was scraped off by us. Water smelled. Absolutely the worst experience. Will not be back....."}
{"text":"There really isn't much to say about a national chain.  I went in for lunch--I had the all you can eat soup and salad.  the Caesar salad was delicious, and the Potato soup was piping hot.  I enjoyed it, but I could just taste all the fat and salt I was ingesting and I'm not sure if that made the experience better, or worse...  All in all, a good place to go for lunch provided you aren't on a salt or fat restricted diet.  it was yummy! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food we order a shrimp appetizer came with coconut and friend and skewer shrimp with crab stuffed shrimp.    For diner sharred a lobster and filet mignon.   The filet was so tender you could cut with a fork.   Great food, friendly staff, service was like we were the only people in the restaurant which by the way was full on a Saturday nite at 7pm.   5 stars and then some."}
{"text":"I was excited for weeks about this visit Outback for a Yelp event.  I had dismissed the chain from my list of favored restaurants when they got rid of Toowoomba Pasta many years ago.  That left sweet potatoes as my only option on the menu.  Mind you, I never ordered steak when eating out as it was never cooked to my liking, until recently.  This location presented an opportunity to visit during soft openings.  Back to my long-awaited visit to Outback.  We were a party of 30+, a fete not easily managed.  We served a portion of menu items including:  Aussie Bloom:  Topped with fries and sirloin = 1/5 Aussie Cheese Fries (not for me):  3/5 Mixed veggies: zucchini, squash, and carrots = 5/5 Sirloin:  Sliced prior to serving (rare) = 2/5 Grilled Shrimp = 2/5 Lobster Tails:  perfectly cooked = 5/5 Salmon cakes served with mixed vegetables = 4/5 Lemonade:  1/5  Chocolate Cake:  Lush deliciousness! 5/5 Boomerang Beer Flight (paired with foods). I am not much of a beer drinker but I appreciate the effort = 3/5 Blackberry Sangria = 4/5  Given the above, I would opt for a lobster tail, sweet potato, and grilled veggies.  For dessert, I would definitely go with the chocolate cake.  As the menu is not a la carte, I don't plan to visit Outback anytime soon.  However, I may make an exception for a late night snack of chocolate cake with a nice glass of wine!"}
{"text":"This Outback used to be my goto Steakhouse but the last few years I find myself going less and less.  My last trip we had a good server and our food was delicious! My only complaint is that  our appetizer arrived after our salads and we really didn't want it at that point."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I use to love the Outback special whenever I would come eat here, but the last few times I have been here the steak has been chewy and dry.  Tonight took almost an hour to get our food.  We had my step daughter with us and she was starving by the time her food came (which most restaurants make a point to bring her food early since she is 3 without us even asking).  We will probably not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm not a big meat eater but I do enjoy a steak once in awhile provided it is a good filet. Also haven't had a beer in years. At Outback they have a Wednesday deal providing both, except it's a sirloin. Eric sat us in a nice booth and Jazmyn came over right away. I watched Eric cleaning tables and going here and there to make sure everything ran smoothly. Jazmyn offered us delicious dark bread and butter while we awaited our steaks and baked potatoes fully loaded.  Miller light. We really enjoyed our meal and wonderful service! Well done!! We'll be back to try the chicken and fish."}
{"text":"The dining experience here was so-so. The food is fairly good the service is average the temperature was too cold and it's too loud. We may come back again. But then again we may not."}
{"text":"Visited this location on 02/18/18. Would have given a 5 star rating but the parking situation is terrible.  Worst parking lot set up I have seen in a very long time. Would have thought it would be standing room only out the door a mile long.  Once we were able to park, not in the restaurant lot itself mind you, things were great. We were pleasantly greeted and sat immediately.  The overall decor and atmosphere was the same as the other Outbacks I have been too. The property was very well cared for, maintained and clean.  Our waitress was wonderful. She was very polite, easy to talk to and personable. She explained that she was in a split section and we may have periods of waiting that she preemptively warned us about.  However, we never experienced any wait in service or need at all. She was on top of everything and made our visit uneventful.  The food was prepared efficiently and expertly. The food was visually appealing and tastefully appetizing. No complaints or short comings here.  Overall, a very pleasant and fulfilling meal. Just what we needed. Would definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Service is definitely a one. But the food added the extra star. This location needs to better their customer service because having to waste time to wait on their mistake is a no-no for me.  My family pre-ordered their food 24 hours in advance. We knew Christmas Eve will be a busy time for everyone. But to give our full order to the wrong family, at the wrong time? How the heck did that happen?  My parents kept requesting for a manager. But I guess he/she did not want to talk to my family at all. Mistakes happen, absolutely. But that easy 5:00 pm pickup turned into a time hassle.  BA HUMBUG!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with a pretty good sized group. We had a little bit of a wait, but it wasn't terrible. After we were seated, they took our drink order right away. They did take a little bit of time returning to take our order, so we put some appetizers in on the little table kiosk.  When the waitress showed up, she took our main order. The service definitely picked up after that because we got our appetizers almost right after. Just as we were finishing those up, our meals came out. All our food came out as ordered and was simply delicious. Also, Not once did my water go empty because they were on top of the drinks.  Overall, I think they did an amazing job taking care of our large group."}
{"text":"The 8oz Victorias cut was one of the best steaks I have ever had. Coconut shrimp and blue cheese crumb crust ess gold as well. Blooming onion was subpar."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to go to Outback Steakhouse this evening for some delicious steak, pasta, and our kid's favorite macaroni before our visit to the mall. We always enjoy coming here and we love the blooming onion appetizer. This evening they were so busy, service was delayed, and alot of items forgotten. However, our server was very polite and we figured she may be new. The manager was helping staff throughout the night, and overall we enjoyed our meals. Also, Jeff at the bar was so friendly and made us feel at home. We will definitely return and highly recommend for those looking for an appetizing steak dinner in a family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was in a hurry but didn't want fast food...promptly sat and greeted at the table..told wsiter I was in a hurry. Dinner came out right away. Steak was perfect, broccoli was perfect and my iced tea glass never got empty.  Great experience...thanks"}
{"text":"I've never been a Outback fan but my grandson wanted to go there after early school shopping so stopped by for lunch. From the hostess to the waitress, Corrie, everyone was very nice and accommodating. I had a Signature salad and the grandson had ribs.  Everything was fresh and very well made. I joined their club upon being asked by the hostess because I plan to go back and try several other items I saw on the menu."}
{"text":"When I'm feeling light in the wallet region but still want a decent dinner,  Outback is where it's at.  I can get a 6oz. sirloin, house salad, loaded baked potato, and bread for $10.  & if I want, they'll bring it to me in the car when I stop by on my way home from work.  Tell me what other restaurant does that.  NONE.  Long live Outback!"}
{"text":"We stop here almost ever month when meting the step kids mom for exchanges. The service and food was great two years ago. Since then every time we have been hear the service has been horrible. Not once in the last 8 months has our order been correct. Looking forward to the one in Concord opening. We will make the extra 30 minute drive."}
{"text":"Don't order the ribeye! You will get a steakam covered in salt. Of course not literally. The ribeye was in edible, Full of gristle and salt. The baked potato with small, over cooked, and did not come the way we ordered it. Our server, very nice, was less than attentive.  This was a mediocre experience at best. Actually a disappointment for a birthday celebration. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"I admit, I love Outback normally. However, this one? SERIOUSLY disappointing.  This location is meant to be the busiest Outback in the world. I cannot even beging to believe this considering we went in on a weekend evening and were seated straight away (and there was a lot of empty tables).  So what was good about the experience. Oh, Nothing.   Firstly because the location is on the strip the prices are suddenly increased. The steaks are much more expensive than in any other Outback we have ever been to. So instead hubby had pork chops and I had a burger. We started with the onion bloom.  No bread was given to us- guessing that because we decided not to have steak we werent seen to be worthy of it. Whatever.  The onion, it was greasy very greasy and I am sure the oil they used was old. It also didnt taste great.   My burger was ok, fries were meh. His food? it was ok. but then he is always ok with his food. I must be picky.  Whilst the place was quiet we had to wait ages to get the bill. The service was not great and the place didnt seem clean. I wont even go into the state of the restroom :/  This place needs a refresh completely. Its not a wonder it was so quiet."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, not super impressed with the quality of the food. I've eaten at other outback steakhouse's and I've had wonderful dining experiences. This leads me to believe that this was just a particularly bad day or maybe it's just not a great restaurant which kind of leads to management.  The service was good the place was clean, but none of us were very pleased with our food.  I kind of expected some uniformity in the menus or I should say the quality of the food because they are a chain, but I do know that sometimes management lets things slide and that's when you start having bad experiences."}
{"text":"Hate to say it but this is the worst service I had at outback from hostess to waiter.   The hostess was not very attentive and seemed lethargic.  Our table had no napkins/ utensils and waiter could not be found when needed and barely check on us.  We were better off going to a fast food with the service provided."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's appropriate to report suspected food poisoning on Yelp, but here I try.  Went to Outback on Craig Rd with my wife. We have frequented this restaurant numerous times.  Wife had the salmon dinner.  I had the steak special.  Dinner was uneventful.  When we arrived home, my wife said she felt weak and nauseous.  She then ended up throwing up her entire dinner in the toilet. After that, she returned to normal.   My wife said she thought the salmon tasted a little funny and was bad. Maybe this is a freak event, but I raise the issue so other diners will be aware of my wife's mishap and be able to use our misfortune to evaluate their own bad experience more effectively."}
{"text":"The food was great, our server Lloyd was awesome, and it was a perfect dinner to end our trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went in o. Wednesday night at 7.  No crowds.  Made reservations on line when everyone agreed on time.  Excellent setvice.  Wife's steak had too much pepper,  but they gladly brought her out new one.  Manager even came over to apoligize for it.  Overall, great dining experience"}
{"text":"My first time at this Outback and first impression is excellent! I was there at a Yelp event, tasting the new menu items launching on October 9, 2013. The staff is super friendly and nice and as always kudos to the Yelp staff for organizing another fun event! From the new menu items I loved the flat breads (Margarita and Chicken/Artichoke). I was sad that the Chicken/Artichoke flat bread came last cause I barely had any room left for it; otherwise I would've eaten the whole plate myself! The breaded mushrooms and the coconut shrimp are also a success! The BBQ chips tasted ok at first but then became too greasy for my taste. Can't wait for the new menu to launch so we can come back for more delicious food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decided to grab some soup to go (its pretty delicious and sounds like a great thing to eat in my pj's in front of my TV).  I've eaten at this location before but never done takeout.   Online ordering didn't seem to work very well but they are pretty nice and quick."}
{"text":"My husband and I had one of the most enjoyable and delicious dinners tonight at the Outback on mckight road. The server was Mary and we could not have been more pleased .  Thank you Mary once again You made our anniversary dinner that much more enjoyable with your pleasant and cheerful smile  Joan"}
{"text":"When it comes to steakhouse chain restaurants, Outback is pretty darn close to the top. I've always had a good quality steak there and rarely ever had a problem with service. This location was no different.  We were in at a little after 5:30, so I guess we were \"early birds\" since it was pretty dead. Our waitress came over and took our orders quickly. I decided to try something non-steaky since I had a steak the other night, and went with the pork chop. It was a decent size of meat, probably between 6-8oz, and I had the mashed potatoes and a side caesar salad. My wife got a shrimp caesar salad entree, but it only came with five shrimp, so she was kind of bummed about that skimpiness.   Overall, good food and good service makes it a pretty good place to grab a steak...if there isn't a Texas Roadhouse anywhere nearby!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy the Outback from time to time. This location is very peaceful and not too noisy like the other locations I have been too. I ordered the petite sirloin and lobster tail, and yes it tastes just as yummy as it always does! Thats why sometimes I like chain restaurants, because you know excactly what you are going to get and it always tastes just like it did the last time. We arrived at 4pm, as the doors opened for the night, I think I like being the first customers of the evening as its very clean and the food is the freshest. Our waiter was very attentive and brought the food in a timely matter. I will always go back to an establishment where I feel comfortable and treated nicely by all the staff. Thank you Outback!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at Outback, ordered a steak med well, it came out med rare, sent it back only to get a burned well done steak. This is the last time we eat at this Outback"}
{"text":"Starting with the waiter to get our order and getting our food took over 40 to 50 mins (bloomin onion, mac n cheese, lemonade & chicken tenders) got lemonade at the end of our food, no water refill unless asked  totally disappointed with food and service"}
{"text":"Wow, they have changed since I have last been there.  I have been a fan of Outback Steakhouse for years.... until now.  I was in the mood for a good steak so I suggested we go tonight.  What a waste of hard earned money!  I loved (past tense) Outback Steakhouse.    As par for the American course the serving sizes have gotten smaller (really small) and yet the prices have not.  In fact, it was more expensive than our last visit.  I am so disappointed with the quality of the meat too.  I ordered the basic sirloin (the cheap cut but no so cheap) and it was so tough it was difficult to cut with my steak knife let alone chew it.  It had a boring flavor too.  My husband ordered the pasta and it was dry and almost tasteless too.       I will not go to another Outback Steakhouse again.  Ever so disappointed and now with $60.00 less in my pocket.....   :("}
{"text":"We drove out of the way to eat at this location.  I have never gotten bad food here and this trip was no exception.  Upon being seated we asked for the Kevin Harvic special and received a free Blooming Onion.  Everything after that came out correctly and cooked to order.  Our server was very friendly and very knowledgeably of her menu.  The dining area was clean.  They had a posted sanitation grade of 97.5.  We will be back to this location!"}
{"text":"I was taken here for Father's Day by my family.  A lot of other people had the same idea.  Thankfully, we had done call-ahead-seating to reduce the wait.  After a short 15 minute wait(and a trip to the bar) we were seated by the hostess.   Our server came to our table and pleasantly introduced herself.  She took our drink orders and gave us a minute to look at the menu.  She returned and took our orders, brought our salads, and placed on our table a delicious mini loaf of bread. A runner from the kitchen delivered our entrees.  Every order was correct.  Our steaks were cooked to the proper level of doneness.  Our potatoes were dresses the way we ordered them.  Everything was great. The dining room appeared to be clean and the kitchen had a good sanitation grade posted.  Our server kept check on us and kept our drinks refilled.  All of the employees were pleasant and kind.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends and was blown away at how awesome our service was. Specifically, it was completely due to our waiter, Robert. This guy was amazing. Very attentive, awesome demeanor, and just a great guy in all aspects. If you go here, you must ask for Robert. Amazing food as well, per usual."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years to grab a quick good meal  Well after last night I will not be returning to this location  On are last trip here are food was wrong and service was bad I mean bad  So the manager gave us a free app card for are next visit  So last night we wanted a quick bite to eat at 7:30 at night there was not even half of the place taken slow night  We got seated with no silverware then after are very awkward server came we got silverware. He took are drink order and we gave him are card for a free blooming onion  We got are drinks and are stale bread \"nasty\" then about 20 min later he took are food order. We waited about a 1/2 hour for are meals and wouldn't you know it are appetizer came out with are meals GREAT :-/ so they did try to make it right but at this point I just wanted to eat and LEAVE  After we got done eating we asked for boxes and check 20 min later we get are check and they charged me for my FREE appetizer  We got it straightened out then the manager try's to bribe us with free desert to give them another chance next time  THERE WILL NEVER BE A NEXT TIME  even the other server said to us that are server doesn't belong in the bar area  Hhmmmm maybe a hint"}
{"text":"Outback what in tarnation? Visiting from Jax FL on leave, where there is also outback and this was the worst experience I've had at one. Especially in Scottsdale! Which I hold to a very high standard this city is very impressive in appearance and the people. There were maybe 3 other tables in the restaurant and the service was slow and inattentive to detail. We were given no silverware or menus until we finally had a server take our drink order 5-10 minutes after we were seated. The server messed up multiple requests that we had made. They messed up my boys steak, and he requested a water to-go but alas was made a soda water. Wart the fark."}
{"text":"Food was good. Waiting time was ok 30 mins. The table was clean. Everything was great until our bill came. It wasn't even the amount of the bill. It was our waitress. We paid through the little tablet that's on the table. My husband had cash that we were going to leave on the table so I didn't leave a tip on my card. As we were waiting for the waitress to bring us our boxes. When she came back with our boxes she says to us \" I noticed you didn't leave a tip on the card, so is that correct\" We were like in shock like excuse me? I have never been asked that before. Umm we WERE going to leave a tip on the table but now NOPE, like why would you even feel the need or the damn nerve to ask us. Like we even had to grab our own steak sauce cuz she was no where to be found and we understood they were busy and we were still going to leave a tip. But not any more! Like come on! The nerve to even ask us. Ruined our whole experience. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today and had an excellent experience. There was one other table in the restaurant. We noticed the restaurant was super clean. Our waitress, Hannah, brought our drinks quickly and kept up with refills really well! The meal was well-paced and it felt like everything was brought out at the right time. We started off with a bloomin onion, which we enjoyed. I liked the side salad a lot, too. We ordered the steakhouse Mac and cheese and it was perfectly cheesy! We also got a center cut sirloin and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The manager came by to check on us during our meal and make sure everything was okay, which was nice. Overall, our meal and service was way better than expected and we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and ordered the chicken taco lunch special with the cup of chicken tortilla soup. The cup of soup is about 2.5 ounces and did not have any chicken in it. I ate the entire cup in less than 6 spoonfuls. Tacos were great and service was as well"}
{"text":"I've been to Outback a couple dozen times or so now and I think both the chain and this location are underrated.  People on Yelp are always relentlessly bashing the chain restaurants, but I've had nothing but pleasant times from here.  The service has always been warm and friendly, I've never had a mistake with what I ordered, and usually unless they are very busy it has been prompt as well.  My wife and I love that they have booths in the bar area as we usually like to keep an eye on the games playing but still have a comfortable seat.  One of the reviews said the restaurant was gloomy and compared it to a dark place in Lord of the Rings.  Seriously???  I can tell you that while the restaurant doesn't have the sun shining in through big open windows it's otherwise very relaxing and I never had a negative vibe from it.  People act really crazy on this website sometimes. . .  Anyhoo, I've tried a wide range of the menu, and everything I've had has been delicious.  Their sirloin is the best deal in my opinion, on par with many better cuts from other places including their own Filet Mignon.  Recently they've had a special one where it has a mushroom pesto parmesan glaze that is scrumptious, and comes with two sides for $15 ~.  Will put you in happy food coma for sure.  My favorite pairing is their baked potato and broccoli, but you can't go wrong with any of the sides.  Their burgers are extremely juicy and flavorful, easily one of my favorites in town, and almost any of the woodfire grill items are a home run.  Chicken, ribs, pork, etc.  My wife has mentioned she had a bad experience with one of the sandwiches so maybe that's an area to avoid, but otherwise I've always been quite content with their menu.  And prices are right, most dishes are $10-12 or less.  They bring bread and butter out ahead of time.  I always like when places do this, although the bread is tasteless and unexciting.  They need to give you a few different kinds or just get a different kind other than the one they have because it's one of the few knocks I have.  Thankfully you can make up for it during the dessert course, I strongly recommend getting the Thunder from Down Under if you still have any room left in your stomach for a sweet tooth.  Succulent brownie with Ice Cream on top?  Yes Please.  They're not going to blow your socks off, and they're not going to make your anti-establishment friends happy, but otherwise this Outback does an awesome job and it's one of my go to places when I'm in the mood for some comfort food.  Hope you get a chance to swing by and see for yourself"}

{"text":"I dined here this past weekend with my 2 children and had a wonderful experience, Paige was great! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Last night was one of the worst nights I have had and it could have all been simply avoided. It was my birthday and my husband decided to order take out from outback after a full day. He ordered the alice spring chicken and I ordered the pasta with chicken. I ordered online and we arrived 30 mins later to pick it up. He walked in, and no one was there to greet him. He literally stood there for 10 mins just waiting. Finally some girl who didn't speak to him or make eye contact came up put a bag of food on the counter and asked him his name and told him 54.00. He handed her cash, and she stood there looking at him waiting. SHE EXPECTED A TIP! He put his money into his pocket and she angrily rolled her eyes, and walked away from him. We drove home sat on the couch, and began to dig in. I took 3 bites of my chicken before I looked down at my food and saw that the chicken was RAW. Yup, the center of the chicken was raw, and pink and looked like rubber. I immediately ran to the bathroom and had to force myself to throw up. Now usually this wouldn't be that upsetting but I am pregnant with my first child. Fear crept into me, and I called the restaurant and spoke to a wonderful manager there I think named tammy who apologized profusely and asked me to come back in and she would give me a full refund, and has offered to remake my food and I politely declined out of loss of appetite and fear. I had barely waddled to my car when my husband received a phone call. He handed me the phone and let me know it was the OWNER OF THE STORE, a man named Jim. I was impressed the owner was calling me at 9:30 at night and I believed that this was the step in the right direction. Boy was I wrong. Jim started out friendly saying he apologized and that this never happens, and \"that usually in these sort of situations, we offer to remake the food, and offer you a credit.\" I declined and said I was sorry that I couldn't eat there again. He started to sound frustrated. He began rattling off excuses. I asked him are you aware I am pregnant and your restaurant served me under cooked food? He said he was. I asked him if he was aware of the fact that before we even got our food how down right rude the lady who checked my husband out was. He began making more excuses saying she was bagging up our food. I told him so you had 30 mins to make and bag it, and your website says the food takes 20 mins and she still needed that extra 10? I then began to get angry, telling him I didn't want to hear any more excuses. He began to push the credit on me twice. I lost my temper and said let me explain this as clearly as possible. I am terrified, and disgusted at the fact you tried to serve me raw meat, and I will not and do not want to eat there again. He became furious. FINE! He shouted, You bring me the piece of chicken and I will give you your money back. He repeated it back to me 4 times like I was child. I told him it was already in my lap and I was on my way and hung up. I began to cry and my husband was beyond furious. When we got there, the Tammy was kind and you could see the worry etched on her face. I was fighting back tears at this point. I asked him if there was a place we could go talk privately so patrons wouldn't hear me yell. She said okay and brought me to the back. I immediately began to cry and a Hispanic man came into the room and did not introduce himself as I bawled, explaining to her how disrespected I felt just now after the phone call with Jim. You could see Tammy fighting back tears and looking lost unsure of what to do but the Hispanic man just stood there glaring at me. He walked away came back in and said , Mrs I have the owner on the phone and he would like to speak to you. I became livid saying that was the man who just spoke rudely to me on the phone. I took the phone out of his hand and said Don't you ever f***ing call me and be that disrespectful to me do you understand?? He began yelling at me saying he wasn't being rude to me and I hung up on him. I asked Tammy right then for a corporate number. She said they didn't have one. The Hispanic man said yes they do and to give him a moment and he would be right back with one. I was crying hysterically at this point, and the fact I just had my makeup done and paid 134.00 for it to be washing down my face and onto a napkin in a god damn outback steakhouse on my birthday, just made It worse. I told tammy that I am not angry at her and that this is completely not her problem or fault. I told her that I know she is just trying to do her job, and protect her company, and her job, and also fix the situation, but at this point there was nothing she could and that wasn't her fault. She then, turned and opened the drawer to refund my money when Hispanic man walked back in, saying he had found the number. He had his phone in his hand and when he tried to hide the screen I saw clear at day that JIM WAS ON THE PHONE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION. I finally broke and walked away."}
{"text":"Went here because I thought it was going to be good boy was I wrong. Steak is overpriced and it taste like shit. If there was such a thing as fast food steak this is it. I pick out my steak and grill it all the time and I can tell you the quality of these steaks suck. Customer service wasn't bad, just don't order the steak."}
{"text":"The is the last time we will order anything from this Outback Steakhouse. The order was once again incorrect. You guys will charge us for something that we will not get in the order. I don't understand why it is so difficult to double check the order. Never again."}
{"text":"The service from the well trained staff rates a 4 star, but the food quality and presentation are only a 2 star. That is why I am giving three stars to this Outback property. As much as a franchised brand like Outback is an assurance of quality consistency, I could swear I have experienced tastier examples of the same menu items at other Outbacks. Tonight I ordered the Ribeye steak and it was very bland, lacking the usual spicy blend seared into the meat that I have had at other Outbacks. On the plus side, I have been to this location 4 times and the staff are way above average in friendly, competent, prompt an appropriate service! Really, the people working here are closer to a 5 star than a 4... Now, if the kitchen could just prepare meals that were more line Aussie Outback and less like high school cafeteria in flavor and appearance!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken on the barbie. This is heathly and consistent at every outback! Great service and ambience as always! And don't forget the beer bread!"}
{"text":"I am a reluctant 5-star giver, at best.  But our 14 person group had yet another excellent dining experience at an Outback Steakhouse on the road.  As in SoCal, we'd been put off by a long delay at another local restaurant and called Outback to see if they would accommodate our group.  They cheerfully consented.  We waited maybe 10 minutes inside the restaurant while they cleared and set our table up and then sat down to eat.  Our servers were what brought this otherwise 3.5 star review up to five stars.  They were cheerful, on the spot, corrected any oversights immediately, made thoughtful suggestions, and didn't dote.  Don't get me wrong - this is a chain steak restaurant but one that our travelling group has decided is high up on our list of \"go-to\" spots when we're too tired to explore other options.  My rib eye steak was cooked to perfection, the ceaser salad wasn't overdressed, and my garlic mashed potatoes were tasty, if not a tad on the dry side.  I split a chocolate mini-milk shake with a coworker - it was to die for!  Barring any future negative experiences at other Outbacks around the country, we'll certainly be back.  Thanks, Surprise, AZ Outback!"}
{"text":"Outback has a funny way of making a dish that should be relatively healthy and ruining it.  Don't get me wrong - the flavors are often tasty, but if you are trying to watch what you eat, this is not the place.  My understanding is that they use a garlic-butter sauce for cooking just about everything, which really ruins the healthy aspect of many of the dishes.  If you ask for it to be excluded, it will go a long way towards keeping your meal reasonable.  For a fast casual eatery, Outback is fine.  But if you really want a great steak, there are so many other places to go that won't cost you all that more for much better taste and quality."}
{"text":"Jared are server was superb the manger Dana on point with customers food as always great. Coconut shrimp on point. Steak house mac and cheese TOO die for.any steak you get you will love a must visit.clean comfortable thank you for the great food"}
{"text":"I have been to many outback all over .in california,utah,and here in arizona.this was probably the worst one.the restaurant was not that busy.but trying to get service was hard even when you use the little monitor to summon d your waitress like a flight attendant. The other servers seen the flashing red light didn't ask if they could help or go get our waitress."}
{"text":"Had an awesome dining experience with my girlfriend tonight.  Our server Maikon was super quick and very attentive!  My steak came out a touch underdone to my preference, but it's definitely not a big deal - and they quickly whisked it back on the grill and got it back to me in no time.  Meanwhile, the manager Jason stopped by and reassured they'd have it fixed quickly - which again, was not a big deal at all, but I appreciated the gesture either way.  All in all great job, we don't come here often, but when we do it's always very busy and everything is always awesome regardless.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the prime rib.  Our server told me they only had medium left. Really? We got here at 5:30pm and they are out of medium rare?  My prime rib and broccoli arrived cold. They tasted okay but cold.   Then our server left us for more than 15 minutes after we were done eating. I asked for a to go box and the check. She was gone for another 10 minutes.  ~ug~"}
{"text":"3 words: NO NO NO!! And this is coming from an avid Outback lover!  If your servers name is EARL...RUNNNNN!!!! He's rude, argumentative, and kinda a tool.  He told a customer across from us, who clearly had a really thick accent and was a tourist,  \" here in America.....\" Really?! Just awful.  I sent my first steak back because it was a Frisbee, and just as tasty.....that turned into a whole discussion with the waiter who tried to convince me that because I ordered my steak well done it was acceptable for it to be a hockey puck.  I ordered ANOTHER cut, this time medium well.....and it came to the table still bleeding, mooing, and making milk. I was done! Earl then asked me if I wanted them to \"Cook it longer\".  The saving grace was the manager Patrick who was insanely awesome and attempted to rectify the train wreck that was my meal.    There are numerous steakhouses in Vegas, so save yourself time and energy, and don't eat at this one."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars. Food was horrible.. Ordered the ribeye steak 14oz @ 24$ with unlimited shrimp for 8.99. The ribeye tasted as if it was obtained from a cow that was over a hundred years old... I could have gotten a better cut from Albertsons for half the price, cooked it myself, and still would have tasted more tender.. The shrimp were so small I thought I was on an episode of \"punked\". And the breaded shrimp actually tasted very closely to the jalapeño poppers from Jack in the box... Anyways very disappointed... Will not be going back... Save your money and go to a near by restaurant that will leave you happy."}
{"text":"Second time my wife and I have tried this location.  Over advertised, under delivered.  The only thing that was hot, was my wife and I because the air conditioning felt like it hadn't been turned on.  Service was poor, leaving only the food that lacked in taste and overall quality.  Another restaurant added to the list of where not to have an enjoyable experience.  Shame on the management."}
{"text":"No Rules~Just right.....Right?....Wrong..!! Ok, I used to be the biggest Outback fan and would have given them 5 stars all day long but something that was special about Outback in general has faded. You used to get good steak for a reasonable if not a cheap price. It was extraordinary but now just ordinary. The first one that opened near me I went to 3 times the first week cause it was so reasonably priced. I'm all for a franchise staying in business and prices will always increase but most meals are $10 to $15 bucks more, portion sizes seem smaller and all the add ons can really drive up the cost in a hurry. I'll still go to Outback as it is still pretty good but mainly cause my girlfriend loves it."}
{"text":"A consistent and dependable quality family-friendly steakhouse in a pleasant casual environment. The recent remodel is very nice and the addition of comfortable patio furniture outside for those times when you have to wait for a table is appreciated. Not sure if you can bring a drink from the bar outside, but it's a pleasant enough area regardless. We like to go for the Wednesday 3-Course Menu special that seems to be a regular promotion now. There are also three different price points offering at least different menu items each, including soup or salad, a side, and a dessert. I always order the French Onion soup. It is always piping hot and a rather generous serving considering it's part of the meal. I believe it's $1 extra, but so worth it. Just the right amount of cheese on top, that you get a bite with every spoonful. Recently we also noticed the portions of sides seemed to have gotten larger. I'm not complaining. Finally, the carrot cake is the best, but we end taking it home to enjoy later after filling ourselves on the main course. Here's a tip I almost hesitate to share: if you go around 9:00P.M. after the mall closes, it's a much quieter and quicker dining room."}
{"text":"Horrible. Worst Outback I've ever been too. The company should shut this location down. Management is the worst"}
{"text":"Okay so I've been coming here for a minute !! And you know what ??always good so don't be a fool come here for a affordable dinner that you will remember !!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have had in a long time.  I eat out a bunch and I know my way around a restaurant. 45 minutes after I ordered my to go order, I asked the bar tender to check on it for me, she looked and found it was sitting next to the bar. Tonight not only did the bar tender not care enough but the supposed manager who came out of the kitchen had nothing to say except I'm sorry.  When I left, I placed my to go sack on the pic nick table on their porch I didn't even want it after having such a bad experience. Outback once had a great concept they offered great food and good service at a reasonable price but no more! Now they just don't care and tonight their employees and  management  proved it to me! I sent a email to the Corp office and the next day got a call back from the store manager. When I returned her call I was told that she was in a meeting. That was part of the problem, the mgr should be on the floor with customers and staff not stuck in meetings. That was it for me, I'm done with this place and I recommend you stay away as well and support your locally owned restaurants."}
{"text":"Updating this review to add that their to-go and online ordering is really good.  I place my order online, pay at the restaurant, and the food is always ready when they say it will be ready.  And they've never screwed up my order and I've used the online ordering service like 3 times.  Will continue to order my steak dinners here!  oh and plus if you place an order on Wednesday night you can get a 6 oz steak, salad, side, AND dessert for like $12.99. that's an amazing deal."}
{"text":"Ordered online to pickup at 12:37 PM. Was present at the curbside takeout at 12:45 PM. Waited 5 minutes and no one came by to even say hi. Tried calling over to the store and could not get a hold of anyone. Had to leave. Horrible customer service. Could not even get food. Will never go to this location again. Worst Outback experience ever."}
{"text":"Went here last night and was surprised to see the parking lot packed. As we walked in, there were people waiting to be seated, and we had no reservation, so were waiting as well. As crowded as it was, they were pleasant and well organized, and we only waited about 10 minutes! My boyfriend and I were both really hungry, and were happy to get free bread to start the meal. Additionally, when our food was taking a little while longer than expected, our waiter gave us another free loaf of bread. Everyone here is always very nice, and the food is delicious, the new macaroni and cheese side is a new favorite. I love the spice in it, and everything's decently priced as well. I have been coming here for years and definitely recommend it, a great place for a date or a family meal. I have always enjoyed it and wanted to write my own review when I noticed it had only three stars. It is not perfect, but it is definitely one of my favorite restaurants, and am not disappointed when I go!"}
{"text":"Decent surf-n-turf, I only really go to Outback when a friend suggests to meet there. Its not too special to me. Always seems to be a long wait and personally, I think theyre overpriced for the quality of their food. Guess the name goes a long way for this place..."}
{"text":"Hey! I got to ride the famous Coke bottle!!! Lol. The only reason I came here is because I had been eating at luxurious restaurants all thru my stay in LV, so decided to try something less expensive. It was somewhat busy but didn't have to wait! The waiter was awesome,  joked around with us and was attentive. Don't quite remember his name, but if you read this you will remember us, \"with a side of Roy Rodgers\" hahaha... Everything was good, but the 3 stars is due to the quality of food. It was not tasteful.  I had to keep putting salt and a lot of A1 sauce because it was just not that good, yet, I had been having top of the line steak all weekend at Vegas' higher end restaurants, so I can't expect Outback to be magical.  Either way, I have eaten at other Outbacks and have been way better experiences with regards to food. Gotta raise that bar up!"}
{"text":"Yikes .. Bad experience at this location .  Everything from the bread down to the dessert was pretty terrible . I'm a sucker for their brown bread and it was never hot and fresh , even when me and my guest requested some . I'm guessing they were trying to get rid of the  older bread as it was getting closer to closing .  Salad was brown and croutons were stale .  The steak was actually ok ,, although bland   But was  cooked well and  mashed potatoes were ok . Just throwing this out there , I didn't like the fact that a baked potato could be \"loaded\" for free but mashed potatoes would be charged 1$ . Why  ?  All in all probably won't break my next to eat here again .. But I may give them a try again  ."}
{"text":"Took the family to outback tonight for dinner.  This had to be the slowest night for an Outback I've ever seen.  Had to do with the Cavs getting their rings and the Indians playing in game 1 of the World Series.  Wasn't busy at all.  We did not order an appetizer or a dessert.  My oldest daughter ordered a sirloin steak and had no complaints.  My youngest daughter ordered ribs off the kids menu.  They brought her an adult portion and she had no complaints either.  Neither did I since they only charged me for the kids portion.  My wife ordered a filet.  Normally a filet is 1 1/2-2 inches thick.  This filet was about 1/2 inch thick.  She asked if they brought her the right steak.  She was told it was.  And they get asked that all the time.  I find that odd, but my wife said she enjoyed her steak.  She said her potato she ordered was lukewarm.  I ordered a ribeye, asparagus, and had a salad.  The salad is a pretty standard salad.  I had no complaints about it.  Same with the asparagus.  The ribeye was good, not great.  Half of it was cooked closer to done.  While the other half was closer to medium.  Not sure how that happened.  It was somewhere between tender and tough.  Was juicy.  It was pretty much what I would expect from a Choice cut of beef.  My wife and I ordered the wine sauteed mushrooms.  I was told they didn't have that on the menu any more.  The wine mushrooms on menu we were told were more of a steak topper.  Not a side of mushrooms like they used to have.  If we wanted something like that we'd have to get the french onion mushrooms and they come with cheese on top.  So we ordered the french onion mushrooms with no cheese.  They came out with cheese on top.  By the time we got them without cheese I was half way through my steak.  I didn't really care for the french onion mushrooms.  I wish I could have had the wine sauteed mushrooms they used to have.  Overall it was what I expected with a few minor blips.  I'd give it a 2.5."}
{"text":"The wait staff is lackadaisical. The steak is consistently under or over cooked. The plates are usually dirty. There is food in the butter and dressings. The place is overall disgusting. They messed up one of our orders and when they brought it back out it was in a to go box."}
{"text":"We did check ahead seating so we didn't have you wait long. Friendly service, our food was cooked perfectly. I really liked the parmesan crust in the tbone. The manager was present Abe friendly. He checked on us often. The clam chowder was well seasoned and spicy."}
{"text":"I normally would give a chain store like Outback 3 stars, but I think this one deserves an extra star for service.  I always place a difficult order here, and they come though consistently."}
{"text":"Terrible food but a wonderful waiter/bartender named Chad.   My steak was over cooked. But my potato soup was amazing. Chad also made me 2 excellent drinks."}
{"text":"Went for the filet and crab legs. I also ordered the French onion soup which was very good. Got the macaroni and cheese and again excellent. The filet and crab came and the crab legs were outstanding. The filet however had a couple of lines of gristle and I had to cut around them. If you asked me, this was a terrible filet and it shouldn't be advertised as one. It was done medium so it shouldn't have been tough. It was the gristle that I couldn't even chew."}
{"text":"Staying at the Sheraton next door for a wedding in Exton on 4th June went to the Outback with friends from the UK on the Friday 3rd and had a tremendous night. The food was wholesome and first class, suited all tastes of our party. The service was excellent and a special mention must go to Britney our server who made the night for us, would have adopted her and taken back home to Bardsey! Top night"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!! Service took forever, we arrived around 8:30 hot seated right away and didn't wind up leaving till almost 10:30 We had 2 filets and 1 ribeye  All the food came out ice cold The steaks were so tough we couldn't cute them The manager came over and apologized and looked at one of the filets and was confused as to what the cut of meat was  In the meantime there was a party of 10 at the front complaint about the same stuff  The manager comped our whole mean and gave all 3 adults 20.00 gift cards.  I definitely will not be going back, I'll just re gift the gift card.  The only resin I gave 1 star is because I had to"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here twice this week, once for lunch and once for dinner. Food was prepared as ordered and service was very good. I believe quality and service is improving nicely."}
{"text":"Is it my imagination or has this place gone a little downhill??  The food was good but the service left a lot to be desired.  First our waiter forgot to bring my soup. Then a server tried to bring us lamb chops.  When we did get our entrees they brought me a rib eye when I specifically ordered a 12oz prime rib!!  When we ordered he didn't even ask how I wanted my prime rib and so I had to get his attention before our meal was brought and tell him. That's partly my fault though.  We were seated near the door and with the traffic coming in and out we were cold. And our food got cold really fast for this same reason. I'm hoping we were just unlucky and got an inept waiter. I did let him know how displeased I was in the tip I left him."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday and I was pretty sure it was going to only be mediocre (chains are so hard to judge sometimes). But I got the filet mignon and crab legs dinner and 'fabulous' doesn't even begin to describe it.  The one drawback was that the crab legs were frozen, but what do you really expect in mid Ohio? And even that small detail couldn't distract from the fact that my filet was a perfect medium rare. Perfect. No disgusting extra chewy fat, no 'marbling' that you can't get through, a perfect sear and it was so tender I almost didn't need a knife to cut it.   I would have given this place five stars except the onion bloom thingie was slightly overcooked and dry and our waiter was somewhat inattentive."}
{"text":"Everything you would expect a meal at outback as it should be food was good no mistakes service on the patio seems to be taboo and always takes forever but overall decent experience"}
{"text":"Very displeased with the food,management,service on my latest visit. The ribs were fatty and tasteless and expensive. Chili's has much better ribs and cheaper. I went for the steak and lobster special which i looked up on their website in the am. I get the menu and its not there. I was told it was changed that afternoon. I asked for the manager and told her that was the only reason 6 of us came to outback. She refused to honor it. 4 of us got the wed special and 2 ordered the regular menu and they totally refused to use the aarp 15% disc on any of the meals. Carrows has a better prime rib for $9.00 less than outback. I certainly will not return."}
{"text":"Came here as part of my volunteer work with Make-A-Wish...lunch after a shopping spree wish.  The staff was wonderful!  They had balloons up welcoming the wish child and her family and balloons at our table. The manager, Sarah, and our server, Chris, were both very attentive and made our wish child feel very special.  The food was very good as well.  Although my steak was a bit overdone, it was very well seasoned! Overall,  a really good experience!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this location.  The bartender and I had a great conversation about football all while she did a wonderful job serving me.  I'll be back soon.  My only complaint are the prices, although not this locations fault, I have always felt they were way overpriced.  $12 for a small chicken Caesar salad?"}
{"text":"When calling this outback, the automated Aussie voice told me to use the seat ninja app and you \"show up when your table is ready\". So I downloaded the app and \"got in line\". The wait time was 43 minutes. The whole time the app runs and uses your battery. The app tells you to arrive in \"x\" amount of minutes. We showed up to Outback when it said to come in 2 minutes. We checked in and the hostess says, \"okay, the app cuts your wait time in half\". Wtf? That's not what the automated message said. It said to show up and your table would be ready. So here I am waiting another 10 (maybe) minutes for my seat. Will not use this again or go outback again. This is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Well, I finally won the fight with my family. We no longer have to eat here!!   PROS: server Norma was very sweet.  We were seated fast, even though they don't take reservations. (10 of us)  Ahi was great, bloomin onion was as well.  Drinks kept full throughout dinner. Problems solved in timely fashion.  Dessert was carrot cake and the trio and both were awesome!  CONS: Onion took about 30 min. We were told another server stole ours. Salad was barely dressed. Sweet potato had some sort of funk inside of it. *see pic* Now for the steaks....we had 3 filets medium rare. 1 was medium well but my niece was hungry so ate it anyways.  The bone in rib eye was medium, although ordered rare.  My porterhouse was medium well although ordered medium rare. My other nephew also ordered a porterhouse and it was medium rare and thick. Mine was skinny and overcooked. Norma took back the 2 steaks and had them re fired. Rib eye came back with grill marks and was a perfect rare. My steak was borderline rare/medium rare and very tender but was so obviously cooked on a flat top. No grill marks and had that crust on it like the filets. All veggies and potatoes were cold. All of them even though we were warned about the plates being hot. Weird. There are 2 things that really annoyed me tonight. One is that the server kept blaming everyone else. Runner mixed up the steaks, another server stole your onion etc.. and when you put a hot plate in front of a guest, put the protein closest to them. Most of us had to grab the plate and turn it towards us. Even the manager did this when he brought our new steaks out. Serving 101 people!  For the $300 price tag for this meal, its just not worth it to go back."}
{"text":"The new crab special is a ripoff. Dry split clusters with very little meat and very small legs. Charged extra dollar for 5 tiny pieces of asparagus. Petite filet was medum when I ordered medium rare. I should have sent the entire plate back but I don't waste food. Crab looks NOTHING LIKE THE COMMERCIAL!"}
{"text":"Despite the negative comments, my family decided to give it a try. Im so glad we did! As soon as we walked in the hostess greeted us with a smile and was very nice. Our waitress for the evening was Lorena. She was great! She knew a lot about the menu and recommended great cocktails and appetizers. Very friendly and helpful. I did however order a ribeye that was a little under cooked for my liking but Lorena was great and got a new one out for me as fast as possible. She made sure everyone was happy and treated us like a couple of regulars. If the waitstaff is like her im sure business is booming! Definitely coming back before we head home!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is okay compared to other steak places.  If you join their website and e-mail list, you can get some great deals or coupons.  I like to come here when a nascar driver wins a race because you can sometimes get a free appetizer.  When I come, I usually get steak, but I don't find it as flavorful as other steak places that have it for the same price.  I also did not find their lobster tail that flavorful either.  The couple of times I ate here with friends, my steak did not come out how I ordered.  I usually order a medium rare, and they make it medium.  However, I do believe they have the best blooming onion though!  That is very flavorful, but make sure you share with someone as it has alot of oil and salt. The service in this location is great though!"}
{"text":"We went there last night for a quick dinner, and had some of the best service we've ever received. Our server Phillip anticipated all of our needs before we did, bringing us extra bloom sauce and recommending a blackberry lemonade martini, checked on us often, and was so nice! I'm a server so I tend to be more lenient because I know that sometimes people have other things going on, but I honestly don't think I've ever received this good of service. Normally it's over the top or sub par. New favorite quick dinner spot, and we'll be asking for Phillip next time too!"}
{"text":"The WORST Outback in our area! If there was an option for -5 stars, I'd be giving them. There are far too many restaurants in Cleveland that are great to ever waste our time at this location ever again. First, the restaurant and restrooms were absolutely disgusting... not sure how they pass inspection. Our waitress, Tara, couldn't give any attention and was useless the entire dining experience. Should've known when it was taking forever to get drinks and having the order taken that this waitress did not have her priorities in order.  Once we finally ordered, no waitress to be seen for almost twenty minutes... we were waiting for refills on water. The order arrives and was messed up but there was no one to tell because Tara was once again missing. Since our food was getting cold, we asked another waitress to grab our waitress. Our waitress still took another 7 min to come out totalling around 20min AFTER food arrived. No drink refill until we asked, glasses were completely empty for about a half hour total. No apology or offer to have manager come over. Once the check came and I signed, Tara took it upon herself to snatch the check book from under my face which was in the middle of the table, not at the end for her to take. Rudest most useless waitress ever! On the way out, I voiced concern to the manager but he didn't give two f*#ks either. He apologized but it was half assed and he didn't care. WORST. EXPERIENCE. EVER. IMO the 10% tip was too much. I'll be writing corporate about this horrendous experience and never stopping here again."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times now. The food and service are both consistently good. It's our go-to outback location. Have not tried other locations yet, so not sure how it compares to other location."}
{"text":"waitress was friendly.  food was just ok. i remembered it tasting better, but i havent been in awhile my steak was overcooked...not med but it was ok. my shrimp was VERY crispy. I prob dont have to go back."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and excellent service.  Ribeye was cooked as ordered, great flavor and a good quality steak.  No wait on a Wednesday evening but most tables were occupied.  The wait staff were efficient, friendly and helped make the dining experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch, we were promptly seated and drink order was taken right away and received bread.  We both got the ribeye melt lunch combo, but it only comes with one side- soup/salad/potatoe/ or veggie. I think it would be better to have a side plus soup or salad. But alas I ordered another side along with soup. The ribeye melt was absolutely delicious :) highly recommend. Our server was Tony, he was a very nice guy with some humour mixed in. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this Outback for at least 10-12 years.  Never had a bad experience until the last time I was there which was a few months ago.  My wife ordered the full rack of baby back ribs.  When the waitress dropped off our food, I noticed that the rack on her plate only had 7 ribs.  Now I BBQ ribs a lot at home, and I know that a full rack of ribs has 15 bones.  Outback is selling a half rack of ribs and calling them a full rack on the menu.  Oh, and the price is about the same as it was before they started selling half portions, and about the same as other restaurants in this area for a real full rack of ribs.  When I spoke with the manager, she informed me that she gets the full racks that her food suppliers sell her.  But when I asked her if her meats were supplied by the Outback Corporation or if it comes from a real meat supplier, she said all of her food comes from the corporation.  So Outback is deliberately selling half racks of ribs as full racks.  Well, that was the last straw for me and I won't be going back to the Outback in Fraser.  They lost a long time customer just to save a few bucks.  I hope other people are realizing what's going on there."}
{"text":"I keep coming to this location because it's  convenient and the service is always great.  Service is 5, but the food quality is 2-3.  I always rate food with a simple question.  \"Can I cook it better myself at home?\".  The answer for their food is yes, which wasn't always the case.    Unfortunately, their beef quality has declined over the years.  Their beef is too lean.  With steak, fat is flavor.  Without the fat, even a perfectly cooked med-rare steak will be dry and tough.   Since we keep returning, I keep hoping that it's just a consistency problem.  Sadly, it's consistent low quality.  There are a few steak restaurants in nearby local casinos, with prices within $10 of Outback, with much better beef quality.  After a tough Outback steak, I almost always leave feeling like I wasted good money."}
{"text":"Food was great.. But like I said in my last review we come because you shouldn't expect that your in Fine dining.. It's casual dining.. Our FAVE kinda of place!. Can't beat the price for what you get..   Carly was our server and was a great server.. Would of got 4 stars, but when we asked another server for just sugar.. He acted like an Ass and wanted to say it wasn't his table and walk away mumbling stuff under his breath!   Oddly he was our server the last time we were here and didn't add him in my review of his conduct! But now I will.. Last time we came here.. He had the nerve to take the open seat next to my son while taking our order.. My son gave me the look as WTF! But I guess that's how he takes his breaks or he just thinks he owns the Joint! Wish I knew his name! Nonetheless, might be awhile before we revisit!   PS: we didn't let it hurt our waitresses tip! If it were someone else they would of took it out on the Tip! Not her Fault!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this location. The food is always amazing, we go to this location because the one on 59th Ave and Bell does not compare. The manager here is super friendly, food and service are excellent. We will be regulars for a long time :)"}
{"text":"I must admit I am a frequent patron of this particular Outback. I encountered several rare problems the last time I was there. The very next day it was still on my mind so I called and requested to speak with the owner. She called me the next day and couldn't be more professional. After hearing my concerns she sincerely apologized. Forty eight hours later she FedEx to me complimentary Tuck Aways to be applied to my next visit. She was very concerned and offered these without my prompting her at all.  Megan DeAngelo managing partner sure knows how to run a business and make her customers feel your complaint was NOT on deaf ears. DONOT hesitate to visit this restaurant . It was an \"off\" night  and the owner takes to heart your opinion and input...."}
{"text":"been a few months since went to Outback.  we decided to order appetizer $9.99  onion peels the best part of bloomin onion.. nice and crispy minus grease.. aussie fries with cheese and bacon  surprisingly good and mac n cheese balls.   So bad calorie wise and yet so good. thats what squats and crunches are for  .. everything in moderation. hubby enjoyed alice springs chicken with garlic mashed and I simply had pasta with nice kick of heat. minus no meat.   waitress was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Very clean, friendly environment. The food service is outstanding as long as you don't sit in the bar area and your server is not the bartender. If your server is the bartender, plan on sitting a while and maybe pack a snack. But besides that, the manager \"Michael\" is hands-down one of the best in 20 years! He comes across very kind and listens to the customers. Our server who goes by \"wolverine\" (his actual name is Richard) was absolutely amazing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We are major customers that come to outback. We like the open seating in the bar ! No kids and we can eat have a drink without a long wait !  Now they have no open seating and you wait to sit evening the bar. Where they  seat kids.  We are done !"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was poor. The guy would be gone for ever. When asked for condiments they came after half the steaks were eaten and food was cooling. Sauces need to come right away before food cools.   The girls helping him and another guy were very responsive. Don't know why they keep that guy or don't train him better on being prompt.  5 stars food.  1 star service.  Average 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great takeout/pickup customer service by Jazzy. Efficient, quick, on time, and very courteous and friendly. She's a great person to have on your staff and makes me want to patronize outback again. Thanks Jazzy!!"}
{"text":"From out of town and had dinner at Stephanie outback been at other outbacks got to say Michele waitress is awesome remember what I ordered remembered my name very very attentive and nice I certainly will be back thanks Michele for being such a great person !!!!!!  Another visit this place is awesome Richard is very friendly good guy to talk to this place is the BEST Outback I've ever been to keep up the great work I see why Henderson outback is #1 from California and I don't ever get the service you receive from Henderson talk about customer first and professional pride !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"In a moment of weakness, we broke down and gave ye olde Outback a whirl...partly due to a couple reasons 1) sheer convenience and 2) free food.  I mean who doesn't love a deal, right?!  Even if it's free though, their banner bloomin' onion is a way better idea than a reality.  Or just limit yourself to a bite (or five) of all that fried, greasy goodness. Further, the happy hour deals, which vary by location, are just OK featuring $5 cocktails ('ritas, sangria, martinis, oh my!) to help the grease go down. Of the chain steakhouses, their food is par for the course...you know what to expect with no surprises.  The wood-grilled ribeye was flavorful and the steamed broccoli was not overdone like it is in most other establishments.  And my mate seemed to enjoy her blue cheese pecan chopped salad, but we definitely wanted to hit up the gym afterwards.  Lastly, service was friendly and prompt, but it will certainly be a couple more years before we put another shrimp on the barbie."}
{"text":"Food was great and so was the service! The manager was wonderful she was prompt when something was wrong and our server was also. Thanks for a great night !"}
{"text":"Great service, short waiting time and friendly staff. I was about to order a big meal but my waitress, Megan, told me about an affordable deal they were having. My sister had order a med well steak and realized it was still rare. Megan took the steak back and Mike brought it back in a quick min. Very fast and even gave us free desserts for the mix up."}
{"text":"Not your normal Outback... The menu is different - the smallest outback special you can get is 12 oz! Sodas are over 4 bucks each. Super loud.  Our server Helena was good though, over worked & very busy, but she friendly & efficient."}
{"text":"My fiance and I wanted to try it out because it was so close to us. We came in and was greeted right away from the host. We went to the bar to have a drink while we waited. The bartender was very nice and suggested items for dinner. The food was amazing and so was the service. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Get the wings fried extra crispy!!!! And baked potato soup. My go to...and I love it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love outback steakhouse because of their sensibly priced steaks and meals. Nine out of 10 times I come here the customer service is fantastic, but a couple times at this location I was left completely high and dry when I walked inside. Sat myself and then waited for the server to come and talk to me for over 10 minutes... After I brought it to the attention of the manager he offered me free dessert."}
{"text":"Visited Outback for mine & my wife's anniversary last night and couldn't complain about a thing. Food was delicious, staff were friendly & everything was really well priced. Our server was great and kept delivering the bread (my wife's favorite). We took our cheesecakes to go since my wife wasn't feeling too fantastic.  Next day, my wife called me up all angry because I ate her entree from the night before, which I did NOT because I value a happy life!  Somehow, it had not made it's way into our \"to-go box\". I called Outback and spoke to their manager there. His name was Dan and he was a real nice guy. The customer service was fantastic, I couldn't believe it! I'll definitely return since I was really satisfied with everything.  Thanks again Dan"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and had their delicious NEW fish tacos! Great flavor, nice and hot with all the fixings. Found out it's on the dinner menu for people who want to go to outback and aren't feeling a steak. Getting better with options on the lighter side!"}
{"text":"Tonight  (Wednesday) was a very busy night but my husband and I only had to wait a moment to be seated.  Our waitress Jennifer was by far the best waitress I have ever had here. She was personable and attentive despite being incredibly busy.  Good food -good service will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my son and his family to lunch  here at 2:30 pm yesterday.  They were not busy at all but after we were seated it took ONE HOUR to get our food!!!  I ordered the large filet mignon to be cooked medium, but it came medium well and tough.  I let the waitress know.  She took that steak away (why?  I'm sure they disposed of it) and brought me another one... it was cooked correctly but the meat was tough.  My husband's steak was thin and overcooked but he did not want to complain.  My grandkid's grilled cheese was so hard that she could not eat it but I did not want to complain about that, too.  Both the waitress and the manager who came over were very nice and apologetic.  The manager took the charge for my meal off our bill."}
{"text":"I had the signature Blooming Onion. I had a piece of it that others with an appetite for fried foods ordered. It was nice to look at."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of outback, but it's one of my husbands favorites. Usually they're not bad and I do love the bloomin' onions. This particular location is just horrible though.   The steak is always fatty and almost inedible. Their chicken is way too spicy (usually very nicely flavored at other locations) and the bloomin' onions seems smaller than usual. We went a couple nights ago simply because we were shopping in the area. They actually served us Clam Chowder that was so thick I was able to push it into a little hill in the middle of my bowl and stick my fork in it ( I was bored! lol) pretty disgusting. I also had to cut apart the potatoes they put in it because they were each about a quarter of a potato. I just can't believe they let something like that out of the kitchen!  The only good thing about this location was our waitress, Betsy, she was very nice, helpful and kept our drinks full.   If you're going to go to outback, avoid this location. There are 2 that aren't that far from this one."}
{"text":"We had waited over an hour for our food. Our drinks were never refilled. We were never asked once how our food was. Then the waitress made us wait another 25 minutes. So we just paid and left. So upset!!"}
{"text":"The food and service at this location has always been top notch.  Tasty food, seasonal selections and fun drink options (alcoholic & non-alcoholic).  The only downfall we have noticed repeatedly is that the floor is ALWAYS extremely slippery.  We have noticed every time we have visited this location and have feared that we might slip and hurt ourselves.  This seems to be worst on the left hand side of the restaurant from the entrance, but was also pretty bad in the restroom area on the opposite side.  This is not enough to keep us from coming back, but management might want to look into the issue before someone falls."}
{"text":"Service was good, margarita just ok, side salad good, filet mignon didn't have any flavor as it was cooked on a griddle. Gotta have mesquite wood."}
{"text":"Heading there today for my birthday ! Hope I can walk out when I am done. Lol  Going to start with sample platter and then look at the steaks."}
{"text":"Meh is about right. Saving grace was the sweet waitress we had, she made everything better than it could have been.  Outback is a steakhouse, so you typically come here for steak. Everything was decent ACCEPT FOR THE STEAK.   We ordered the mushroom appetizer which was good! The mushrooms were fried in the same batter as the bloomin' onion and they were tasty. Came with ranch dipping sauce... But it was SUPER spicy. The waitress told us they use a spicy ranch. This is probably the company issue, not this location, but that should definitely be indicated somewhere in the menu that the ranch dressing is \"southwest\" style. Southwest though!? It's an Aussie theme! Not southwest. The same ranch was on our salads and again, was spicy.  My baked potato was decent. Wife's fries were fine, but the steak... My guess is that the steaks were frozen, and put on the grill frozen. We ordered the 9 oz. but I do not think that's what we got, they seemed much smaller. The outsides of the steaks were somewhat burned and so the insides were well done. Wife doesn't mind well done meat. Medium rare is my version of well done, so mine was terrible. And chewy! Oooof.   We also waited quite a while for our food, when we were just driving through on our way home to NY. It was irritating especially since there were only about 5 other people there.  Meh truly is the right way to sum up this visit."}
{"text":"This review really teeters between 3 and 2 stars. While the food was absolutely delicious, I consider my health the priority. I'll explain. I have celiacs and needed gluten free foods. I ordered gf ribs and a salad with grilled shrimp. All gluten free. But I felt very much like the server didn't care or have much knowledge about gf items. Which is a major turn off. She was very friendly, but when the staff doesn't have a knowledge of gluten, it makes me cautious.  And I've also been very sick, this next day after eating there, and am feeling like I got \"glutened.\" So that is pretty upsetting for me. While their food was wonderful, I didn't feel like my dietary needs were cared for. But just about the food: The grilled shrimp is TO DIE FOR! So good! And Baby back ribs, YUM.  there are some extra cons. The place is a little dated, and run down. Pretty small too, so it was just a smidgen uncomfortable."}
{"text":"if you want a good steak you can usually count on outback.  this location is SOOO much better than the one in the middle of the strip.  the parking lot is a bit small but the food never disappoints.  for a while they had a walnut / cherry type salad, then it went away, but it's back! big drinks and they come often, the wait staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"I usually only write reviews if a dinning experience was either amazing or terrible. Our night out as a family here was darn near perfect. And that's saying a lot seeing as how I have four young children and dinner out usually ends with most of us screaming and crying- myself included! The staff here were so kind. They talked to my kids, involved them in the experience, answered their questions and were patient with us. They took our order right away and brought the food out fast, even though the place was busy. The food was amaaazing!! The kids even ate most of their food. I ordered the 12 oz prime rib and when they brought it out the chef had given me a 16 oz. cut for no extra charge. Hubby ordered crispy chicken sandwich and said it was pretty darn good. We ordered shrimp later in the meal (super yummy) and they brought out two side dishes at no extra charge!! There was a kid's meal promotion going on at the time that we weren't aware of and they added the discount to our check without us even asking. Garrett H. was seriously the best sever! Funny and gracious! Really awesome experience over all and we will definitely be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"This was my families first time visit to an outback steakhouse it was pretty packed the wait wasn't that long it's about 15 minutes the waitress was fairly nice, she recommend the ribeye with the big baked potato. Which was delicious. 10oz is pretty big! Also the Bloomin onion (the smaller portion) is still pretty big enough for two people. We are coming back for sure. Overall great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Only went to Outback because it was walking distance from my hotel. I should have drove somewhere. Ordered the salmon. It was thin tail piece, over cooked and over priced. Blah. Now I know why I never eat there. I guess I needed a reminder."}
{"text":"Outback is just ok, it's nothing amazing but not bad either. Their onion blossoms are huge and tasty, their baby back ribs were meaty and good too. I got their grilled chicken sesame salad and that was eh... the salad was really watery almost like they just put wet lettuce on the plate without drying it, so the dressing was really diluted. The waitress stopped to tell me that it was super busy and she just wished she could take a break and her feet hurt and how she's been running around all day, like I care? lol anyways, overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"my family and I will never step foot in another Outback Steakhouse again. - it took 2 hours to eat and get out of there and there were only 6 customers in the entire restaurant - it took 40 min to get our onion blossom appetizer - their restaurant smelled like dirty, damp, rags - menus were sticky - ordered the steak and lobster dish and the size of the steak was smaller than the palm of my hand and I have small hands! - service was ok but the refills on water need to be worked on."}
{"text":"We had the salmon dinner last night. Service and food was 5 star!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been an Outback fan for years and my husband, parents, children and I have made a habit of coming to this particular Outback a couple of times a month.  This past year our visits have decreased as we have seen changes taking place that have not been favorable.  However, we were still coming at least once a month and would anticipate at least an average,  mediocre experience.  Unfortunately, we will not be returning due to our latest visit.  Upon arrival we were seated and our waiter came over to our table.  I believe he said his name was Larry and he had more the demeanor of a used car salesman than a waiter.  After he introduced himself, he disappeared.  Seriously, he was gone for more than 15 minutes.  We had menus, but no water, no bread, no attention whatsoever.  He walked past us a couple of times and we attempted to catch his eye.  The third time past our table and more than 15 minutes after we were seated we flagged him down and requested water and bread and said we were ready to order our dinner.  He told us he would be right on it.  Several minutes later we received water but it was served by a bus boy and we still had no bread and no one to take our order.  At this point I told my husband that I wasn't liking our waiter and the lack of service that we were receiving.  We talked about leaving and decided to suck it up and stay.  A full 10 minutes after receiving the water, our waiter brought out bread and was ready to take our order.  Mind you, we had been seated there for a half hour by then and only had water and menus in our hand to show for it.  I ordered potato soup and a dinner salad.  My husband ordered a filet, medium rare.  During another trip past our table, following placing our order for dinner, our waiter was caring a tray with two soft drinks on it.  We thought that maybe these were the soft drinks that we had ordered.  They weren't meant for us but we were given them nonetheless.  They were both spilled all over us as our waiter was passing by.  Seriously, ALL over us.  I had Coke in my hair.  Every time I blinked more Coke ran into my eyes.  My blouse was covered in soda, as were my pants, my husband's pants and our shoes.    Now, I know accidents happen.  But there was no apology for his collision!  He left us with our one little paper napkin each to try and dry ourselves.  He then went to the table next to us and told them he was sorry, that he would be back in a little while with new drinks for them!  Are you kidding me?  I was soaked and my husband was wet.  We were heading to a movie following dinner, but there was no way that we could go any place without changing.  Our drinks never came. The dinner was sub-par and the only good thing about this incident is that it gives us a great story to tell when people are talking about their WORST restaurant experiences.  To top it off, a female manager did come over to see the damage.  After she asked how we were I told her that I wasn't doing very well and that I, as she could see, was drenched.  She said \"Sorry\" and left, never to be seen again.    Frankly, I thought that our bill would be adjusted somewhat, at least enough to cover the dry cleaning bill.  But not a chance.  We paid the bill and promised each other that we would never return again, either by ourselves or bringing our family.  Terrible, terrible service!  Wish I could give ZERO stars."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night at 8pm and it was very slow and we had a coupon for a free steak dinner. The manager introduced herself and sat us at a table around a few other people. My GF and I were very hungry, and about 10-15 min went by and no waiter came to greet us. Very frustrated by this, and seeing this as a bad sign of the service to come.. we just ended up walking out and going across the street to our goto restaurant.. Chilli's, where I've never had bad service and the food is good.   To add to the insult, the manager and hostess that opened the door both saw us walk out and thanked us for coming in and to come back and see them soon. I'm pretty sure we were about the last couple to walk in.. it was pretty funny how bad the service is."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant is only getting 3 stars! I'm sitting here with an amazing filet mignon, decent broccoli and a potato loaded to the gills! Sure the veggies could be steamed a little less but honestly...  The courteous and awesome service I'm receiving totally makes up for it! If you sit in Garrett's area you WON'T be disappointed! He goes above and beyond to make your visit special!"}
{"text":"Quality is slipping in the attempt to stay relevant with the times. . I feel like the competition to say in the Applebee's and Chili's arena has hindered the experience I use to crave from Outback. The steak menu is diminishing and being replaced with fluff and buff, not my cup of tea! The service is always amazing, it's just not what I remember it being, disappointing as best."}
{"text":"Today we dined in for lunch, Brandon was our server. If that was his name it could be frank or Bob or jim, any of which are acceptable. I would have to say that his service was bar none top notch, some of the best service I've ever had. This guy deserves a raise or promotion, he maybe the only reason I return.   Food on the other hand was not super stellar. I ordered a burger during lunch, with cheese, that was so over cooked it was almost unpalatable. Not only was my burger dry and bland it arrived without cheese slathered in mustard, all of which would be fine if the burger was cooked to order and somewhat juicy. everything else at the table seemed acceptable including the soup, salad and other meals, sadly the burger was my only letdown.  I'm so excited that outback has started serving lunch however coming in on my lunch hour to A 15 minute wait isn't what I expected. We were told at the door that they were short on servers which was the reason for our wait.   The restaurant was clean the servers were friendly I will definitely give them another try but I won't be trying another hamburger from the outback in Tempe a.k.a. cheeseburger.. Bravo Brandon service top-notch thanks again."}
{"text":"I ordered Prime Rib-Eye steak. One of the best steaks. So tasty and well cooked. The place was quiet and cozy. I ordered children soup which I didn't like the taste. In general very good experience and i will do it again."}
{"text":"I went today for my lunch and it took forever, over an hour. I ordered a cheese steak. The cheese steak was horrible, soggy and extremely salty. Won't do lunch again."}
{"text":"This location has the best manager. Abby is spectacular!!! I simply cannot express how professional, caring, genuine and sincere she is! Abby brings the meaning of management to Outback.   After a minor issue, she ensured we would be taken care of. Abby did just that. She checked on us multiple times, she laughed with us and made us feel so incredibly welcome. Because of Abby we will return to this location and only this location.   If you want an awesome steak, seafood, service and the chance at meeting a manager that cares about her restaurant, go to this location!! I guarantee everything you have will be perfect. It all comes down to management, the servers are happy, the bussers are happy, the hosts are happy. They rave about Abby and now so am I.   Outback, if you read this, definitely give some recognition where recognition is deserved. It started with ABBY!!!"}
{"text":"Very poor experience here. Went on a Saturday night about 2 weeks ago. Waited for 45 minutes when there were open seats available.  We were seated and ordered quickly. Food took about another 45 minutes to come out. My wife's food was not warm."}
{"text":"This Outback location is close to both my work and my home.  I often find myself here.  I pretty predicable as to what I order, usually I enjoy the house salad with blue cheese dressing, and the coconut shrimp (with some yummy warm bread and butter- of course!)  My boyfriend and I often visit for a quick dinner, sometimes we share a steak and a side, but most often it is usually salad and appetizers for dinner.  We always sit at the bar, and there is a fabulous bartender who we just enjoy- thank you Gavin for always being so attentive and just great company!"}
{"text":"Well, our server started out with a strong introduction, but ended up being awful by the time the appetizers came. I honestly think that she might have been on something. I'm typically more forgiving of servers since I used to be a waitress myself and understand how chaotic a busy evening can be. We asked for things 3-4 times (bread, drink refills), she'd walk away then come back to the table empty handed. She had a lot of personality, but..It was really odd. The 4 stars is for the food. It was fantastic. Luckily, the kitchen staff was most definitely sober that night. The ribs were incredible, and the prime rib was cooked perfectly. Kudos to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Fast service, very accommodating, great gluten-free experience!  Went here for 'date night' and had a great meal.  We ordered two appetizers, the blooming onion and the grilled shrimp.  They were both as good as described on the menu.  For entrees we got a couple of filets cooked medium-rare and they were perfectly seasoned and tender.  My meal was prepared gluten-free and to perfection.  We'll definitely be going back to the Outback!"}
{"text":"OK, so I'm not a big fan of chains but my hubby and my bff's hubby love it here so we recently did a couple's night and I realized I had not written a review. I think The Keg or Flemings nearby do a way better steak but of course Outback is a lot cheaper. I will say that I'm happy they have some fish options, especially ones that are grilled without a lot of fattening sauces. That plus the asparagus makes for a yummy and healthy meal. I do wish they had a better wine list, though."}
{"text":"Choosing stars was difficult for this review. My brother loves to eat at Outback for their \"Walkabout Wednesday\" special--sirloin or chicken with one side and a beer/beverage for $9.99 every Wednesday. Last night my eight-year-old daughter and I joined him. We sat at a booth in the bar. The food was good; our steaks were cooked correctly and the bread and sides were hot and fresh. My daughter was playing with the tableside kiosk/tablet when our server came to take our order, so she said she was happy to tell us the items on the kid's menu, as they are nowadays only available to see on the tablet. My daughter chose steak and the server listed her side choices, and my daughter proceeded to choose mac/cheese to go with her steak. As I stated before, everything was good. When the bill came, we saw that while our meals were $9.99, my daughter's was $8.99 for her kid-sized steak and an add'l $2.50 for the mac n' cheese. (So, her kid's meal with the smaller steak was actually more than our adult-sized meals.) As we were unable to see the kid's menu and our server never stated there was an upcharge for some of the sides she listed, we flagged her down, and asked if she would take the upcharge off. She said sure and went off to take care of it--or so we thought. A few moments later, the manager \"Diana\" comes over to our table and states, \"I'll go ahead and take the macaroni off THIS TIME...\" well...  I have to admit, I was irked. It was total server failure for her to not inform us about the \"premium sides\", not to mention it might have been nice for her to tell us the kids steak was only a buck less than our adult meal which was a lot more food. Frankly, I did not take it well. I let Diana know that I thought it was rude for her to come over to our table and make a point of telling us she was doing us a favor like we were scammers trying to get something for free. Upon my getting upset, she just stated (over and over and over....) that she had just come over to \"smooth things over\" for us--total bulls*t!! We were not upset before she tried to make us feel like schnorrers. At no time did she authentically apologize for her rudeness/inappropriateness nor actually seem to honestly care. She even acknowledged my brother is there all the time--ie a regular, long-time customer--but seemed to want to use that as some kind of defense that she, Diana, is not usually a sh*tty manager. Sorry, I'm getting so irritated again remembering it, it's making me mad just relaying the experience. So, I'll just summarize--the food is decent but whatever you do, be sure you know the prices of what you're ordering in advance or you might have to deal with Diana--and you'll regret ever giving any of your money to this Outback. I'm sure my brother will be there again next week, but I guarantee I will not be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary. The food was great and the server Trista was very friendly, nice and super attentive. Always checked up on us and we never gone thirsty because she kept out drinks filled.  not like the other servers that you have to call out first to get anything. Trusts made sure we Ate all set and taken care of :-)"}
{"text":"I come here often. The staff is extremely polite, if they make a mistake, they correct it. The service is top notch and quick. The food is great, and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to return to Outback since the new Henderson location opened.  We used the \"click thru seating\" to get on the waiting list. It was showing about a 30-35 minute wait. We were seated within about 2-3 minutes of our arrival. The service started out great with our waitress coming right over to take our drink order. The drinks also arrived quickly. After that, it started to taper off.  We ordered the bloomin onion and I went with the prime rib and house salad. The onion was delivered and after eating less than half of it we were done. It just wasn't as good as we remembered. It was quite a while before we got our salads or saw our waitress. I was just going to ask for her when the salads came out.   Again quite a delay for the entrees. The prime rib was pretty good, not much fat which was nice. It was just very thin. I did not care for the garlic mashed at all. It was overpowered with some herbs that masked the garlic flavor. The whole meal was also very salty. Again the waitress disappeared for a while so we had to get someone else to find her for our bill. It was about $70 which just seems really high for what you get here."}
{"text":"when my husband treats me to a shopping day at the outlet mall I always look forward to stopping in at Outback. it is consistently great food and great service. they handle crowds with no problem. the servers are so friendly and helpful and everyone is your server. the manager Michael is very attentive. Trenton is psychic, he knew I needed things before I did. we loved being able to use the table kiosk to order appetizers,call for assistance, and pay. that really helps free up the staff so everyone has more time to help all the guests."}
{"text":"the main reason we go is the blooming onion...so yummy. the garlic medallions are succulent but not enough for the price. the broccoli is amazing. the kitchen has mastered consistency; the staff is exceptionally friendly and attentive.   the app to pay is easy."}
{"text":"While we are generally not big fans of chain restaurants we would visit Outback 1-2 times a year with family.  Food was usually consistent, nothing spectacular.  A recent visit left me crunching on a piece of lead shot in my wedge salad, which had me panicking about my teeth!  I showed the piece of metal to the manager who nearly shrugged it off and comped my salad.  While I don't think this is a regular occurrence, the reaction of the staff was ridiculous!  How about \"so sorry\" or a follow up phone call to make sure everything was OK after I went to the dentist (yes, he took my contact information).  Seals the deal on us going there again..."}
{"text":"Great steak! Great quality and good sized portion compared to the other locations I've been to! Great staff and service! Thanks for a great date night! Onion bloom!!"}
{"text":"Ordered ribeye medium and the steak is salty as hell!!! Not touching my steak at all."}
{"text":"We waited a hour + for our food I asked for a well done stake it was bloody u could see it before you cut it my moms was burned and the blooming onion was over cooked and vary salty"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever at an Outback so I was excited to try it. The interior was nice other than the alarm system that was broken and loudly beeping the whole time. We got seated and ordered our food pretty quickly. It was my mom and I and we shared an order of Bloom Petals which were really yummy. My mom ordered a bowl of wedding soup and I got the Crispy Chicken sandwich, it took a loooong time to get our food and the place was nearly empty. Our waitress was not the friendliness and when my mom asked about getting a coffee she basically told her that the coffee wasn't fresh and that it was dark roast so it wasn't good anyways. My mom also inquired about the crab cakes and the waitress told her that she didn't like them and that the restaurant down the road had better ones... ummm okay... not to mention it was 100 degrees in there and I had to pull my hair up bc it was so hot. 30 minutes later our food came out and it was extremely hot and very good so I guess that redeemed them a little. I'd give a 2 for experience and 4 for food soooo 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"today i went for lunch (1130 am) & tried the lunch menu.. they have some new buffalo shrimp MUST TRY.!!! & peach bellini's only $5.. my service was pretty good.. food was AWESOME"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short, because I didn't even stick around for dinner.  99.99% of the time when I have a reservation, I have a table waiting for me (or I have to wait a nominal amount of time, such as 5 minutes for the staff to clear one).    When I called this location yesterday (6/30/12) to schedule a reservation they told me my preferred time of 6.30 pm was full but that they could get me a table at 6.45pm.  We arrived at 6.45pm only to be told that it'd be 20-30 more minutes.    Now the situation was exacerbated by the fact that when we told them the name our reservation was under they simply handed us a pager and said it'd be 30 minutes, not once even looking at the reservation book...  Having just purchased movie tickets for a movie which was showing at 7.40pm, waiting an additional 30 minutes for a table we had already reserved wasn't going to fly.  So Instead we went to Hops across the street, we were greeted and immediately sat, the service was quick, efficient, and we made our movie on time.  Needless to say for all future dining needs in that area I will not waste my time with Outback again, instead I'll go right to Hops...  To everyone else out there, wake up, Outback isn't worth the kind of money they charge, you live in a city with great dining options you should skip this restaurant location..."}
{"text":"Thank you to the Outback Staff for making my husbands night special !! Great food, great service !!"}
{"text":"We came here on Valentines day which of course is busy. Our server did come back to check to see that everything was well, offer refills, etc. He was friendly as was the staff that opened the door. The food was good too. I didn't give 5 stars because it wasn't WOW but it was good and a favorite in the neighborhood because of the bloomin' onion. The blackberry sangria was delicious, and my first drink I've had here in the multiple times I have gone here. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in Las Vegas over the weekend. We decided to eat at Outback Steakhouse for the first time. The food was good and the waiter was attentive. The only problem was the host was very rude to my children. As we were about to leave my boyfriend needed to go to the restroom. My kids ended up playing with a tablet that was in one of the tables . The host came in the meanest way and told them they shouldn't be playing with the tablet and took it away from them and she said that we needed to pay since they charge for games. I went to talk to the manager that I was willing to pay for whatever game they were playing but the manager said she took care of it already."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a better experience here than my last Outback experience in another state. While this one was not as bad, it was certainly not something I want to repeat. Here's a few tips to the somewhat oblivious manager who was on duty during the lunch rush on Sunday 11/29/2015:   You're going to be busy on a holiday weekend. Plan ahead.  42 minutes is far too long to get food to the table (and have it wrong when it arrives). People generally know what medium, medium rare, medium well, etc means. Getting all of the entrees at once is usually the general idea in a restaurant. You should be aware when the dining room is out of control.   Not a great experience here. I guess that must be the Outback brand these days. I'm done. Drive through at Steak n' Shake far exceeds the experience here. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Well, I went 2 the Outback's on Sahara on my 1st hott date wit my honey...I had a gr8 time cuz the convo was off the hook...Our waiter 4 the nite was very tentative but not overbearing...Steak was cool & the lobster tail was good, as usual...Drink was aight...I shoulda had a glass of wine...All n all, this spot gets a 5star cuz even tho I've been 2 this Outback b4, this was a very memorable nite 4 me..."}
{"text":"We usually eat here when in Vegas because it is by the outlets.   Food is always good, service varies, but never bad. The location makes it subject to being really crowded at times and not at all during others. So, your wait will vary.   We had the coconut shrimp, and no rules Parmesan pasta with chicken. Very good.   My only advice is to avoid the bar if you want to eat and talk. Last time we were there, a group of Australians were drinking and it was very loud."}
{"text":"they actually call them \"CRAB\"Cakes -   We ate at outback last night. , Wifey ordered her 6 oz filet & I, instead of ordering my usual baby back ribs or grilled salmon, I selected a \"NEW ITEM\" crab cakes. Yeah I know wtf order CC's in a steak house??? NEVER AGAIN!!!  The crabcakes (two) were 70-80% filling, 20-30% Crabmeat. And they looked like what my mom used to make with left over mashed potatoes Actually if I can remember 50+ yrs ago, my moms \"potato cakes\" tasted better..  The crab cakes SUCKED... But my stupidity for drifting off my usual...... I did learn something, my mom's potato cakes were not her creation.. many many pictures of them on the internet....."}
{"text":"My family and I come to outback at least twice a month, if not more. My mother absolutely loves the food here which is why we come here so often. First of all, the hosts at the stand are very accommodating when it comes to our seating arrangement. My mother is a complicated one, so she always asks for a booth with a high chair, and they're very friendly and helpful about it. We've come here at all times of day, but the evening is always a bit rough. The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is because sometimes the service and food is a bit inconsistent. For example, the broccoli sometimes is very dry or the sweet potatoes are really hard, or maybe the soup is a little watery. Other times, you might have to flag down the waiter or they might be too slow to come and greet us, but like I said, we came here so often and the good outweighs the bad.  I typically get the baked potato soup without bacon. It's one of my favorite dishes, and the broccoli here is amazing. If you're a vegetarian/vegan, do not get the broccoli!! We were informed that the butter used contains chicken brother. Just an FYI.   The last time we came, which was yesterday, our server was Trent. Trent was very patient and friendly. He came back to give us bread several times, and didn't seem bothered at our modifications for food. He's very nice and wouldn't mind having him again. There was a moment where he was coughing and excused himself, and came back a few seconds later, which we all laughed about together. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Mothers Day Dinner 2017! Had a yummy Peach Blini, our Blooming Onion was outstanding, they did forget the Ceaser dressing on my salad, but were quick to rectify it. I had the best most tender steak dinner I've had in the longest time, which was cooked perfectly! My husband had the steak & lobster, which was cooked perfectly also! We arrived at about 3:45pm and were seated right away! Our server Cody was fantastic! He made sure that our experience was the best that it could be. I saw the staff tending to people waiting to be seated with samples of appetizers!  This was the best Outback experience I've ever had! Thanks to all, including the Chefs that made the meal just perfect for this Mother who cooks 96% of the yearly meals"}
{"text":"There steaks and ribs it's hard to chewed and dried. The breads are cold and no butter served."}
{"text":"NOT WORTH IT! Do not go...    Wish I could give no stars!  Didn't even get through the door before being treated awful.   We called for call ahead seating and was told there was No wait. But she said we could put our name in.  So we proceeded and said party of 8 - she said \"oh, let me ask my manager\". Since when did a party of 8 need approval to make a request ???   She came back on and said there may be just a small wait since you are a party of 8.   We proceeded to outback...  we got in and they told us there was a 40 minute wait since all the 6 tops were taken..  I said 40 minutes??? Why didn't you say that instead of a small wait? - she said \"I did say there may be a wait\"  I said forget it. We will not wait 40 minutes.   *** I will add the couple we were with said that they had a terrible experience the last time they went. They were waiting for a table at the bar and every drink they attempted to order was out, even just Diet Coke."}
{"text":"The food is good, but inconsistent. I came with 3 other people and some dishes were good, but some dishes were bland. My friend ordered a 22oz medium steak that came back well done, while I got a 6oz medium well steak that was perfect. My advice: don't be afraid to send things back."}
{"text":"My boss and I were in Westlake for business meeting so we went to his favorite restaurant.  Outback steakhouses fill the bill for people that think there are getting a good deal for a steak and lobster dinner at $15.00.  The steak is a little larger that than a quarter pounder.  They make it look like a fillet so you think you're getting something and I have had larger prawns than the lobster - but the price is really pretty good for what you get and the flavor of the steak and lobster are also pretty good.  The place is clean and the service is good but I just do not get the wait?  I would have given it 3.5 stars but I really don't understand the wait.  Why do people stand in line for so-so food that can be beat by many Mon & Pop places that would appreciate your money much more than a big chain?  I believe in supporting the local economy and try to support the local places that can't compete with the advertising deluge the big chains produce."}
{"text":"Disappointed! They gave us a broken buzzer and were nasty when they said that we \"missed our name being called\". Once we were seated our waiter was friendly but bith of our orders were missing things. . No toppings as requested on the potato and my sirloin w/ mushroom sauce had no mushroom sauce on it. The fries were soggy and not flavorful. Of all the Outbacks I've been to, this was the only one to disappoint me!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit dismayed to see this particular location of Outback get some bad reviews. This is the location we frequent the most and I can say we have never had a bad experience.  Of course, some servers are better than others, but never have we had a rude or uncaring wait person.    Tonight we had a group of 3 (one teen) and the meal came to $60.  This included two beers.   We all had the outback special and ironically, one of us had the 6oz cut, one the 8oz and one the 11oz cut.  I will include pictures for size reference if anyone is interested.    All our meals were prepared as requested - I think we all said med well, so not sure if that makes a difference.  We were seated right away- in the bar area....they asked us and we said sure.  It was 6:00 on a sat night so I was happy not to wait.  They have a special right now, if you buy $50 in gift cards you get $10 free so we asked if we could do that and put it toward our meal tonight and they said sure!    All in all, I don't have a complaint.  Service was good, food was good and we were seated quickly."}
{"text":"Having experienced terrible service at Grimaldi's in Summerlin tonight reminded me that there's actually a restaurant out there that I would rate a 10 out of 10 in customer service: this branch of Outback Steakhouse. Hubby is a chef & hates cooking when he comes home, so we've eaten at quite a number of restaurants.   That said, this place has 1 of the best managers we've ever encountered.  Managers (the good ones, at least) are supposed to welcome patrons & stop by their table at least once: this was what the manager here did when we had dinner here a few months ago. And the food was as fantastic as the service."}
{"text":"The blooming onion is awesome and the Aussie Fries were pretty damn good too. The beers weren't too pricey and actually the some of the coldest beers I've ever had.  Why only 2 stars? Some of the worst service I've had at a steakhouse in my life. The bartender was very rude.  She continuously made my buddy and I feel unwelcome despite there hardly being anyone else at the bar. We were hurried with our drink selections and then essentially made fun of for our choices. I enjoy outback and will return, possibly even to this location, but the service I received was poor at best."}
{"text":"I was actually impressed .. Its been ages since I have been to outback but it was quite the change.   group of 4 ordered about 80 something bill   Prime rib was my order along with salad and apps.   Prime rib done really nicely - not alot of hard gristle or nice cut of meat for price. I was actually impressed that everything was coursed out from the beginning of the meal towards the end of the meal.   Our waitress was really amazing -- keeping up with re fills I counted at least 3 times while being bombarded with a 9 top that just finished a group of 7 plus few other randoms.   Overall it was a great experience. All our meats where cooked to right temps and left very happy as well as the front door being open to us when we where leaving bye the host  obiv leaving a great impression with that."}
{"text":"Food is always great at Outback.  We like to sit at the bar and eat and have a few beers.  We have been to this location three times and the same bartender has been on duty, Friday night.  She is rude and acts as though you should be grateful she is there.  VERY passive aggressive.  If you like to sit at the bar I would recommend heading up to Chandler location were you will receive customer service and not be forgotten (twice they forgot to put our order in) no apologies just rude sarcasm."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner on 01/07/16. Called ahead seating, arrived and waited about 15 minutes. We ordered our drinks, Waiter brought them, no straws. Took 10 minutes to get straws. He came back by and refilled my husbands Sprite with water. Service was terrible. took 20 minutes for him to take our order. Anything we needed took 10 minutes no matter how easy it was. We called for the manager twice, he really could care less. We went here about 6 months ago food and service was not good we just thought it was that visit. After last night we will not be returning."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience EVER!  Steaks over cooked and salty.  Server brought the wrong steak - had to send a burnt hockey puck of steak back. So two out of six meals sent back - we didn't get to eat together due to the mistakes.  It was a special occasion.  The lobster was so small and mushy that came with the steaks.  No bread was offered - had to ask a few times.  Water glasses were left empty. The ladies room very gross. The service was so slow and the place was not that busy PLUS you the customer now have to be the cashier so you use the kiosk on the table to pay so one would think servers would have more time and be accommodating to their guests however not the case. We Will never be back."}
{"text":"Lynn was simply the best! Made us feel right at home. The hostess was also very kind and had a warm greeting.  EP"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because the hubs wanted to try out the AYCE shrimp.  I ordered the small filet (medium rare) with mashed potatoes, grilled shrimp and a side salad.  The filet was tough and took me a while to chew and chew ... and chew each bite.  The mashed potatoes were good, shrimp was salty and my side salad was decent.  The hubs got a filet with the AYCE shrimp - the shrimp were tiny. Probably bay shrimp.  And they gave very small portions.  He tried the scampi, buffalo and fried.  The scampi, if we were forced to choose were probably the tastiest out of the three.  We also ordered the cake pop trio for dessert and it was SO sweet we couldn't finish it.  The only good experience throughout the whole thing was that our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"I had a gift card and resisted my initial instinct to head to the trusted location I've been to near the South outlets, to come here instead. Bad idea.   We arrived around 3:15, and they were pretty empty. Despite that, service was slow and they seated every subsequent party all in one area with no breathing space.   Our server was nice, but a little on the slow side and refills on drinks and bread were hard to come by. We ordered before several other groups seated near us and yet our meals were the last to arrive.  The shrimp appetizer we ordered was sad. Skimpy for the hefty price tag. My fella and I shared a porterhouse with baked potato for him and I added a sweet potato on the side. The steak game out dry but after waiting so long we decided to just suck it up without sending it back. My mom's chicken breast was dry as well.  The best part about my meal was the sweet potato and that's sad for a steak restaurant, even if it is a chain."}
{"text":"I've been to this location on several occasions in the past, but I was here most recently today for lunch.   My coworker was raving about the blue cheese wedge for days and she convinced me I need to try it. Well, I didn't order the wedge, but I did try the blue cheese chopped salad instead. I don't know why I'm so averse to chopping up my own wedge, hah. I have to admit the salad was great. The blue cheese was tangier than most, which I love. Nothing better than blue cheese.   My salad came with a half sandwich. I chose the prime rib dip, but I was a little disappointed that it was served on a focaccia bread instead of french bread. The meat was pretty good, but I just wasn't a fan of the bread and decided to eat around it. My coworker was just as thrilled about her wedge as before. A winner in her book again.  The service was fast and friendly and definitely a great place for a quick bite when you're limited on time. The meals were very reasonably priced as well. The lunch specials come with a soft drink and are incredibly filling for the price."}
{"text":"I really like it here I usually get a platter meal steak and lobster or something like that.  The blooming onion is a must have it is totally worth it and you will have leftover. Over all friendly staff quick to serve and check on you often love the fosters on tap.I think it's funny how the servers try to do a Australian accent it's kinda horrable but funny at the same time. No worrys mate we put an extra shrimp in the barbi for ya."}
{"text":"Very good! Enjoyed myself. They meat was good. Veggies as well. My drink wasn't strong enough. And that's why it for 4 out of 5 stars. I will be back  its near the whole foods."}
{"text":"Confession is good for the soul, right?  I'm Amy B., and I am a food snob. My plane was delayed and I missed dinner with my colleague and I could not find the Chick-Fil-A I thought was down the road and so I begrudgingly went to Outback to grab a quick dinner at the bar.  And it was good. There, I said it.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't gourmet. But my salad, salmon, and baked potato were all very tasty, and the bread they served me was fresh and hot. I asked the bartender for a local beer, and the Red Oak she served me was refreshing and crisp. And the service was really good: The bartender recommended the salmon when I couldn't make up my mind, and followed up with the kitchen on her own initiative when she felt my salad was taking too long to come out.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I can now see a future in which I go into an Outback without dreading it. Thanks, Gastonia Outback!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Outback Steakhouses before, but for some reason this time the service was a little sub-par and the food just wasn't that great.  My fish was lacking in taste, and my friend's chicken was terrible.  I know they can do better and maybe we were just unlucky.  Regardless, I won't be hitting up this location again."}
{"text":"Wrong order came out and then when the right food came out it was terrible. Do not order the stuffed mushrooms, Tasted like a mushy tasteless bread, no flavor whatsoever. Also the blooming onion was about half the size they usually are. Will never be back. Sad to see these chains skimp out on there food"}
{"text":"Do not spend your money at this location. Awful service and food was plain and dry.  Server has no personality or hospitality. She didn't even greet us or ask us how our day was. Just got our drink order and started to walk away. Then I stopped her and told her we wanted to order an appetizer. She should've offered.  When we were done with our appetizer the server took my fork and when the food came out I had to wait around 5 minutes for a new one.  I ordered my bake potato loaded and it has just about nothing on it. Seriously had like 3 green onion slices. It was so dry that I had to use the bread butter on it.   We ended up just cutting the night short, paying and leaving with boxes. The whole time we were here I felt like the waitress didn't want us there. Definitely is not a welcoming environment. I will be driving further to another location next time or finding another steak house to go to and spend out money."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed. The blooming onion was very oily, the steak was very small yet still expensive. The server was abrupt and unfriendly. We did eat our meals but I am not planning on returning."}
{"text":"I think this may be one of my new favorite places! They have the honey wheat bread that resembles pumpernickel for starters with butter! Yum. Comes in a loaf not round. This place is awesome! Has the best wedge salad EVER, very tasty with the mix of ingredients they put in.... sweet a bit, Roma tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, blue cheese, red onion, etc....and good size portion. I was able to ask it be a side order instead of ala cart. All the steaks come with two sides. And I love how the menu shows the different cuts of steak and how it is cooked. But mostly our server made it very very pleasant! I'll have to go back and try their desert to next time!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Mitchell noticed the USAA card and instantly gave a military discount and thanked me for my service. We will definitely be coming back for another meal soon. We felt very welcomed and like valued customers."}
{"text":"Ive always enjoyed my dinners at Outback and this time in Vegas was no acception.  Its always crowded as its good value for the money and nothing fancy as most \"Yelp-people\" know.   Me and my dinnerdate shared a victorias filé and new york strip 50-50 to get two differnt kind of cuts. The filé was lean and tender at medium but the ny strip was really tasty. Not as lean as the filé but so much more steakflavor. This is the steak i will come back for!  The ceasar on the side was ok but nothing more but the sweet potator fries was a real treat though a bit on the \"sugary\" side.   Too bad this place cant offer anything else in sauce accept the A1 since most steaks taste even better with a pepper sauce or wine sauce. The sautéed onions as a side is a must.   The service was fast with a smile and the cold Foster beer didnt dissapoint with the steak.   The total check was around 180 $ for 4 with tip wich was good.  This is not the best steak or the most beautiful restaurant but you get what you pay for and to get Vic & Anthony class dinner/steak its a different pricerange that is roughly double up from Outback and some more."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate with my cousin who has food allergy. They made sure to double check everything was cooked right. Our waitress, Dawn, was so nice and attentive to our needs! The manager, Derek, stopped by to check once more everything was okay. Great experience! We will definitely be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"It's weird, I used to hate outback steakhouse at home in MT, but I've always really liked this one.  I'm not sure the service is any better, the food is obviously the same, and I think this one is older so it's not as sparkly, but there's just something about it.  Maybe it's as simple as only ever going here with my friends instead of being marched out by my family for steaks?    Anyway, yeah, it's a nice outback steak house.  I've never had any illnesses or horrific service experiences. The person that opens the door and the person that answers the phone both actually say \"G'day Mate.\"  **Shudder** It's amazing what 19 year olds will do for a paycheck."}
{"text":"Went for the crab and steak.  Steak was amazing, crab was sweet but some of it was overcooked and dry.  But it was sooo sweet.    Our server, Dylan, was attentive.    We didn't do any appetizers to save room for the crab and we were too full for dessert, but the new options looked amazing!  Next time!"}
{"text":"I love steaks...and I thought outback is known for their steaks. I cannot be more wrong. Today I had the worse steak at any restaurant I've ever been to. We came here to celebrate Father's day. I initially ordered prime ribs. Apparently 12pm is too early for serving that. So I picked Rib eye. Oh no it was too early for that too. Fine. I ordered my 3rd favorite - medium filet Mignon and pay extra to have grill asparagus.   When the food arrived, the filet mignon was as hard as a rock and it was all burn up on the outside. As for the asparagus, it was also completely burn up to the point I couldn't even chew into it. This is the first time the food was so bad I didn't even want them to replace my meal. My appetite was completely ruin at that point.   Take a look at the photo - it is gross. I will never eat here again. If you plan on bringing your dads here for father's day, please reconsider....  P.S. Upon reviewing other yelpers review, I should have never come here. Yelpers already complained about the food and how it always ran out of prime ribs and rivets.  I hope this place will close down soon and make room for the good one."}
{"text":"Not a private parking lot, shared with Concord Mills Mall. Still fairly new so everything was clean inside. Bar with nice size TVs everywhere Bathrooms were clean. Sat at a little table, half table, half booth (hate the invention of this sitting arrangement and little tables) always run out of space on the table and they keep bringing more dishes...ugh Bread was cold, why bring butter?  It ain't melting on cold bread (I was disappointed) Blooming onion good but greasy at the bottom (need paper on plate so it can soak up a little) Steak with AYCE shrimp starting at$15.99 for 6oz, the food was hot in temperature, steak medium on one side and well on the other.  Sweet potato very small (2 good fork fulls) glad I had blooming onion to act as side dish. Fried shrimp was delicious, fresh and hot in temperature. Was not offered dessert."}
{"text":"Weekday Lunch Private parking lot  Immediately seated Mark was my server.  He had a great attitude and checked on me several times. Sirloin, grilled shrimp, veggies and loaded baked potato Food was hot in temperature and fresh.  Steak cooked as ordered.  Best loaded baked potato I have had in a while. Manager was visible walking throughout the dining room and filling glasses when needed."}
{"text":"Have been going to various Outback Steakhouses, but this most recent visit was disappointing.  We initially got our seat in the bar area, which is first come first serve, so we bypassed a long wait for a table.  We were promptly greeted by our waiter who took our beverage orders while we skimmed over the menu.  It seemed to take a long time to get back our drinks, maybe 10 minutes along with our bread.  Mind you, we each got sodas, it isn't like it had to wait in line to get filled at the bar or specially made.  When ordering, I got the Blackend Tuna and inquired how to make it a 500 calorie dinner or less (since the menu stated it could be prepared that way).  The waiter found it rather funny that I would ask, and then asked me if that is what I wanted to do.... I figured that since I was asking then yes, that is what I wanted to do.  My fiance got a chicken dinner but substituted the mixed greens for straight broccoli, not a hard request.  Our dinner came out, and she had mixed greens, which the waiter left on her plate, and did not take it back, he said that he would just bring out the broccoli that she ordered.  I thought this was rude... why would someone who didn't want something want it left on their plate, let alone on the table.  My fiance waited as long as she could to eat her chicken since the broccoli was taking forever.  Her chicken was already eaten by the time he brought out the broccoli, which was one huge piece of broccoli, not even cut up, it was like the whole head was steamed and thrown on the plate.  My fiance asked for the nutrition information on the plate she ordered, and the waiter seemed bewildered by her request.  My fiance and I both follow the Weight Watchers program, this is why we need the information for our dinners.  I weigh 172 lbs at 6 feet tall, I don't look like I need to be on a diet, but this is what we use to manage our intake.  Either way, it seemed like we were bothering the waiter with this request and he advised he would ask his manager for the information.  The manager was busy dealing with a credit card issue at another table, so we waited.... and waited, and waited.  Much to say, we ended up leaving since we were getting sandbagged.  We would have complained to the manager, but he was obviously too busy after 20 minutes to come to our table.  Oh.. PS... we even ordered dessert, the Oreo cookie type of waffles, whatever... which were great, but again, the waiter felt it was necessary to remind me about the calories in the dessert, since I took it light with my dinner.  Since when do people get ridiculed for watching what they eat.  I was really disappointed to have this service there, and I can assure you, we probably won't be eating at the Mentor, OH location again, or for that matter Outback in general."}
{"text":"We ate here last night. Had the porterhouse pork chop. Ordered medium cook, got rare, and it was tough. It's hard to ruin a pork chop , but they managed to do a good job of it. Mashed potatoes were dry. This is the second time we have been disappointed in our meal here. That's enough. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Confession time! I had a coupon so it was pretty easy to pick where I was gonna eat Friday night. My girlfriend and I decided to just get appetizers for dinner and share. We ended up getting the chicken quesadilla and the sampler appetizer plate which came which blumming onion strips, mac n cheese bites, and bacon/cheese fries. Service was good.  The bread they give you in the beginning helps with the hunger while we waited for the food. The waiter kept our water glasses full so I was fairly satisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"The Food was excellent!!! Best Outback Experience I've ever had. Our waitress Deja was extraordinary as well. Tony, manager, went out of his way to make our Anniversary dinner special. Great food and staff. Was very excited to see an excellent Pinot Noir in particular on the list as well which we enjoyed."}
{"text":"We came here for my daughters birthday. She loves Outback Steakhouse's. When we sat at the booth and received our bread 3 of the 4 plates were dirty with food particles. The women's restroom was a mess!!!  I won't go into detail. The waitress spent several minutes chatting with another table so another server brought our food out. It was lukewarm. When we ordered desert 2 of the 4 spoons had dried food particles on them as well. There was a chunk of bread under the table my other daughter kept stepping on from a previous patron. All in all we were very disappointed with the cleanliness of this establishment. We will continue to patronize Outback, but certainly not this location."}
{"text":"Slow service.  Had to flag down a waitress to find out who had our section.  She took our drink order and had the manager deliver.  Took forever to get our salads, took forever to get our meal.  Meal was ok, not great.  My husband ordered potato soup and salad.  The soup was all broth, no chunks of potato.  We got my drink free for the horrible service...whoopee!  I see now why they got poor ratings.  Must be they never look at their reviews."}
{"text":"A rep brought lunch to the doctor's office from the Outback for 10 people and the orders were all correct! I don't remember the last time a to-go order from a restaurant with customized orders came with no errors. Bravo"}
{"text":"After coming here after a long walk on the strip, it was  everything that I expected. Quiet environment, great service by our server Lorena. She was very attentive and suggested great menu items. The food was delicious as we had a little bit of everything. The bread & raspberry butter is to die for!!!  I'll definitely be back!"}
