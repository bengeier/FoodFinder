{"text":"This place is amazing.    Algebra is the type of caf√© that you often see in movies, but rarely in real life.  Owned and operated by an artist from Tripoli, the den's name is inspired by a combination of personal background and history (algebra has Muslim roots and is a universally recognized discipline).   I'm usually a germ freak, but I didn't even care that the place seemed less than spic-and-span.  The owner initially planned to focus on coffee, but we're all the richer for his decision to turn to tea, instead.  The Friday Night Market tea is my personal favorite.  Ask where he got the idea, and you'll understand its long and cumbersome title.    Just stop reading the reviews and get to Algebra."}
{"text":"Lovely tea house with a great selection of teas.  The tea menu is varied and unique and all teas I have had here have been delicious.  Algebra also serves up a nice menu of food including delicious sandwiches, salads, and hummus.  The interior is cozy and inviting, complete with wood burning fireplace."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome!   But... I ordered their mocha coffee drink and it was made with rose water.  I'm not a huge fan of having my coffee taste like roses.  I'd be interested in coming back to try the food"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Unique and friendly atmosphere. A gem in this City. Would recommend to anyone looking for a out-of-the box experience. The owner hand crafts cutting boards, mug, tables, and even the front door. Hands down my favorite place in  cleveland. This is spot fosters many interesting conversations and customers often make life-long friendships. It's a very welcoming, eclectic environment. Never been to any place like it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Here's the thing: this is not Starbucks. Algebra is a place to come and relax, enjoy yourself, and meet new interesting people. Also you can study for hours on end and no one will say anything. You get to know the baristas, other regulars, CIM students, and local artists the more you go. Becoming a regular at this place has been one of the best experiences I've had in this town so far.   The owner, Ayman, is an incredible individual who genuinely wants you to come here and enjoy yourself.   I would definitely recommend the house latte, labneh, the dip plate, Syrian tomatoes, their weekend breakfasts are amazing, the Palestinian coffee, any of the tea (it's all amazing), and the coconut pepper cafe."}
{"text":"Great place. An asset to the community for sure. Kind owner, inviting atmosphere and original foodstuffs and drinks. Sat for a few hours, resting from a roadtrip, thanks to Yelp for the tip, got a few neat treats to try, and the owner gave my boyfriend and me a bag of gunpowder green tea as we were leaving. A good man for sure."}
{"text":"Oh, Algebra. It's hard to choose a star-rating for them as it's such a mixed bag. I LOVE the cozy, artistic atmosphere, with the wood stove, cozy seats, hand-made pottery & woodwork, and great art everywhere. You can't beat that and certainly won't find anything else like it in the area (especially now that all of the Phoenix coffees look & feel like Starbucks). It's a great place to hang out, whether alone or with a friend, as it's very relaxed and you won't feel crowded or rushed out. They have a great selection of food and drinks and I've enjoyed everything I've had there. I particularly like the falafel wrap.   Where things start to get spotty is the service. Prepare to be ignored and count yourself lucky if you get timely, friendly service. On one occasion the server flatly ignored me for a good five minutes because she was too busy talking on her blu-tooth and wandering around the place aimlessly. I will say that the service seems to slowly be getting better, but even so the norm seems to be to ignore the customer until they're 'ready' to acknowledge you. I keep coming back for the atmosphere and the variety of coffee/tea that you won't find elsewhere. I would make it a point to come back more often if they upped their game on the customer service."}
{"text":"Great reasonably priced food, lots of types of teas, many vegetarian food options, free wifi, friendly staff, good music, chess, board games, reading material, relaxed ambiance, plenty of space and more.  This is like the best of Seattle coffee shops, but in Cleveland, and with the added benefit of free parking in the surrounding area!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing !! The food is delicious , especially the soups they have in the winter . It's such a nice cozy place to sit down with a nice big coffee or tea and relax or study for a while ."}
{"text":"I lived across the street from Algebra for a couple of years. I have nothing but good things to say about my experiences there. Many mornings I found myself there with Ayman, the most welcoming of hosts. It always felt like I was visiting an old friend who was perfectly willing to talk with me about anything under the sun. The food, coffee, and tea, were always wonderful and different than other places. There are not many places I would feel comfortable spending an entire afternoon, but this is one of them."}
{"text":"I love algebra tea house, it's an awesome place to get tea, coffee, and some great food. I love their hummus you have to try it. This tea house is great for just hanging out, and for studying. It's very different decor, and I love the handmade ceramic mugs and the purple door. If you want to go somewhere with great tea and a unique atmosphere check it out!"}
{"text":"Algebra Tea House is a truly unique experience in Cleveland. Everything in the place is hand made, right down to the espresso cups. The hospitality is always extraordinary - but maybe in a European way. There's usually only one person working there, so if you order food, it will be a while. But the food is excellent, and clearly a labor of love. The brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday is my favorite, and the whole place smells of the best bacon.   The teas are all excellent. The coffee is unique, and bears no relation to anything you would find at Starbucks. It's a very light roast with some interesting spice (maybe cadamom?). Keep an open mind, and you might find yourself wanting more by the time you get to the bottom of the mug.  So grab a book, or sit down and play one of their many board games, or just come to think about stuff. Algebra Tea House is the kind of place you will not forget."}
{"text":"Quaint little tea house-with trinkets and artifacts that complement with the expansive exotic tea menu. Great food, atmosphere, music to set the mood for great conversation. We had the Friday market Libyan tea-who knew you could add whole peanuts to rich flavorful tea; Fijian green tea-with tones of pineapple and papaya tasted perfect with honey.  We had the freshly made falafel with hummus (very well balanced texture); fool madams-richly flavored fava beans. To finish off-some beautifully served Turkish coffee, the house latte-it's phenomenal with rosewater that accentuates its taste with a couple of desserts-honey bread and algebra banana. Everything served with a warm, welcoming smile by Jameela."}
{"text":"It took me almost four full years at CWRU before I finally made myself go here.  I now consider that previous time to have been mostly wasted.  The food and drinks are frill-less, but plenty of options ensure that everyone can find his cup of tea (sorry, it was unavoidable) or baked good (cookies, pies).  The real allure is the totally unique ambience.  The tables are made from logs.  Board games abound.  The mugs are hand crafted pottery.  The tea strainers latch onto the side of the mugs.  The baristas (baris-tea?) are liable to play Scrabble with regular patron in between brewing up tea.  No table is the same, so you'll need to choose your seat wisely.  My favorite (so stay away from it) is the wavy reclined seat toward the back.  Great for reading and/or a nap (only if you're a decaf drinker)."}
{"text":"Had pretty high expectations for Algebra Tea House, considering the 4 stars on Yelp, but it just wasn't my cup of tea (sorry I had to..).   The place is cozy, artsy, and unique, but a bit lacking in seating area. The tea menu was quite extensive, and I ended up ordering a house chai tea latte while my friends ordered some loose leaf tea. I love my chai tea lattes, but this cup just didn't cut it for me. It was pretty much a very watered down chai tea latte. I took a sip of my friend's tea and it, too, tasted watered down. For a place that is known for their teas, they should do a better job making them.   The prices seemed okay at first, but upon second thought after tasting the teas, I realized they were overpriced (unless you count the extra cost of water). We also waited for quite some time for our teas. While I understand it takes time to steep tea for optimum temperature and flavor, the time it took for our teas to be ready did not result in quality tasting teas.   In short, unless you like drinking watered down teas, I would skip this place. If you're a chai tea latte fan like me, you're better off making your own chai tea latte using Trader Joe's spiced chai tea."}
{"text":"Like eclectic, like bohemian,laid back,tea,coffee and middle eastern food lets not forget funky   in a good way.         So guess what. What you see is what you get.    Would I go back Yes is my answer.         Try it on won't cost you a fortune.       Oh yeah middle eastern music too.              Good friendly people included."}
{"text":"I love this place for its charm and vibe. Great for smoothies and teas. lots of veggie opts. There is a one man cook (the owner i believe) without a hair net but for some reason i dont  care at this place. i just look over it -think of my own kitchen and enjoy my bagel with fresh veggies and green smoothie tea drink."}
{"text":"Everything good that has been said about this coffee house is absolutely true. Relaxed, intelligent atmosphere, laid-back staff, a varied array of comfortable places to sit, and extremely tasty drinks and foods. This is the kind of place national chains mimic because it draws a varied and devoted clientele by projecting a cool, is-this-someone's-house-or-a-coffee-shop vibe. Strongly, strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Total hidden gem.  Reminds me of some of my favorite hard to find spots throughout SE Asia & san francisco; cater to open-minded, friendly people who are in the market to lounge, enjoy worldly/ ethnic food/ drinks/ music & atmosphere.  Anyone up for a good chess match?"}
{"text":"Algebra is amazing on so many levels. Firstly, the food and drinks are stupendously delicious. The house coffee has cardamom blended into it, their tea selection is extensive, and their iraqi kebab is to die for.   The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing. The mugs, cutting boards, tables and other decor are all made by the owner. It is a great place to study, go on a date, or simply get a bite to eat or drink."}
{"text":"What an amazing cultural experience!! I love the food, coffee, tea (tons of organic teas), and the decor. The owner does amazing wood art works and keeps a very coffee shop feel that reminds me of seattle. Something starbucks will never be able to compete with. Try the Schwarma and the Arabic Coffee. MMMMM!"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem!  Quirky coffee and tea shop with a full food menu.  I love their falafel wrap and pizzas, and have heard that their brunch is awesome.  Plenty of options for omnivores, vegetarians & vegans.  Really gorgeous and eclectic decorations.  A place to go for inspiration."}
{"text":"When I was a student at CWRU, I would come here a couple of times each month. The falafel sandwiches here are the best! So delicious, filling, and you get a bang for your buck! Love their smoothies and crispy potatoes as well! Have dined here and taken out. Service is quick and the people that work here are lovely!"}
{"text":"Their weekend brunch is SO good. Tasty, inexpensive, and there are a ton of choices. The tea mugs are kind of weird, sometimes, though, and they don't always bring out a group's' food together. It's a really good place to study, too - free wifi, comfortable seating, and generally quiet."}
{"text":"Quirky, hole-in-the-wall, vaguely Middle Eastern-inspired cafe. If that description didn't make a ton of sense, that's about right, because it's tough to describe the atmosphere of this place. Upon opening a tree-branch themed door, you are greeted with tree bark-shaped furniture, couches, and an unpredictable music selection ranging from classical to electronica.  This tea house is great for studying as well as a casual meal, but expect a significant wait time. In the meantime, you can study, explore the Middle Eastern food/tea shop, relax on a sofa, play board games, or scribble on art pads scattered around the tables.  As a regular, I usually order an Iraqi-kabab sandwich and my favorite guava smoothie. However, everything on the menu, from house pizza to couscous, has been delicious, if a little pricey for a cafe. The homemade ice cream was tasty as well. The people at the counter are very nice and easy to chat with. On a few occasions, our food took a very long time to arrive or the order was done wrong, and each time we got free food and/or drinks with our order. I didn't mind it enough to take off a star.  Overall a fun, dinky place that's worth visiting if you're in Little Italy and not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. This unique little place is a must! Great atmosphere! Be prepared for a laid back, bohemian vibe. The food is amazing and the prices are great. I love you, Algebra."}
{"text":"Not your average tea house. The cool door caught my attention as we drove by, so I stopped in while my partner was picking up coffee at a shop in Little Italy. It's like a clubhouse for hippies. Pillows and rugs to sit on, a few mismatched couches and chairs, and eclectic decor. I want to go there in winter and establish residency.   It was a warm day, and we had already eaten lunch, so I didn't order much. The iced options are pretty slim. Their selection of hot teas is unbelievable. I got an herbal tea that was very good. I'd like to return and check out their food selection."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful spot if you are looking for a nice calm atmosphere and tasty drinks and food. Plenty of places to sit and read or do some work, or bring a friend and play some scrabble. The Turkish coffee is good, but not always the same since different workers seem to prepare it differently. They have a good selection of food that will satisfy the body without leaving you weighed down and sluggish afterwords. I got the lentil soup last time and it was perfect on that cold afternoon.  Free wifi is always nice, and the music selection has never disappointed.   Stop in, grab a seat by the fire and crack open a good book. This place makes you want to stay a while."}
{"text":"Great spot in Little Italy!   Tons of different kinds of tea and great food and snacks. Very cozy and comfortable too!  They open at 10 am but not realizing that, we went in around 9:15, and they still accommodated us nicely without a problem.  Recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad to have found this place.   I'm moving to an area nearby, and will likely frequent Algebra at least once a week, if not more. The workers were friendly, the decor was both comfy and exotic, the games to play (chess and checkers) and drawing pads to doodle in were a quirky and fun touch, and the food and tea were so yummy (and served in whimsical cups and pretty wooden serving boards).   My tea, Thurmania, was delicious, and had cardamom pods rising to the top. It had just the right amount of honey sweetness, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a layer of honey mixed with the cardamom seeds left at the bottom when I finished my drink (yes, I ate the honey too... big sweet tooth). My boyfriend had the Darjeeling tea, and it was also yummy, but I preferred my Thurmania. I'm looking forward to tasting more of their tea menu, as well as their special blends menu (chais, spiced milks).   Lastly, their hummus was a knockout. It is literally the best hummus I've had recently, and probably ever. I'm  not sure how they make their hummus (did it come from a can, did they make it in-house?), but it was just. SO. GOOD. They drizzled it with olive oil, dolloped some kind of tapenade-looking goodness (might have been a spiced tomato mixture?), and sprinkled a mixture of spices on top.   I've been made an immediate fan and I can't wait to become a regular here."}
{"text":"Trying to find a parking spot should have been an omen.   This place was the worst.  Brought my daughter and her friend who we're visiting from Austin to what I thought would be a great tea experience for the two tea lovers.  First of all the place is filthy.   I wonder if the health department knows of this place.   I believe if they did it would not be in business.  There was a huge pot of something sitting off the burner  not being properly cooled.  The person taking our order waited on customers, prepared food and took money all without gloves or hand washing.   Totally turned me off .  I do not recommend this place to anyone .   We left without our tea"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but I can confidently say there's nothing wrong with this place.  Goodness: 1. The smells 2. The tea 3. The smoothies!! (Cucumber!! Gosh, soo good!) 4. The service 5. The seating 6. The fire!!! 7. The door. I mean, come on. That's reason enough to just go inside!  Summary: Love."}
{"text":"Algebra Tea house is one of those places where the ambiance is very good. When you enter in to this place it gives you a feeling that nothing is going to be typical. Truly, this place is like no where. They have very unconventional seating arrangement. Very unconventional variety of teas and very unconventional kind of cups.   I visited this place in summer and there is no AC in this place. The fans looked like they will fall down any minute and the person who is working there, looked at me in a very curious way. I am sure he does not believe in the place and may be he does not agree with the character this place has.   I personally think this place has a lot of potential to be the best Tea place in the town. But it will have to make some minor changes to get there! I think the owners should visit Dobra tea house in Burlington, VT and learns something from them."}
{"text":"Saw this place on SkipTheDishes last night (Thurs) and it looked interesting. The prices were great so we ordered a few things to share. My review is for our food experience as takeout/delivery.   First, delivery was delayed 20min because demand was higher than expected. We had ordered:   * 2 hummus plates: falafel and hummus, and spinach pie and hummus with salad * 2 wraps: Shawarma, and Cajun chicken * 3 smoothies: house blend, mango lassi, and coconut pineapple  * 1 banana Nutella dessert wrap (bc, my sister is 5. lol jk)  The 3 sandwich wraps arrived tightly wrapped in foil and they were still warm. The 3 smoothies were cold. The hummus plates, however, were kind of a mess. They put everything for each \"plate\" in a big open takeout container, so the falafel was swimming in the hummus, and the salad and hummus were all mixed together and coating the spinach pie. How hard would it be to just put the messy hummus in a separate container? I'm sure it's fine in house served on a plate, but as takeout, not the best idea to slop this all together. This took off 1/2 star.   The other half star hit is the gummy pita offered for the hummus and the Nutella wrap. Crispy pita chips would be much better with the hummus, and a flaky pastry-type wrap was what we expected for the desert wrap.   Now for the good! First, the smoothies were delicious and refreshing. The house ones were a bit airy, but fresh and tasty. I would def recommend the coconut pineapple, which was creamy and just the right thickness to be very satisfying.   The falafel was also wonderful, four generously sized balls with the perfect crisp and nutty texture. They are green inside. The spinach pie was flaky and delicious (i mean, where it wasn't soaked in salad dressing and hummus). I would recommend both of these plates for eating at the cafe.   Both sandwich wraps were also flavorful and generously sized. A little heavy on the greens though. The chicken was nicely spicy. But the beef in the shawarma wrap was divine -- just the right amount of crispy char to make this one a must-have.   So overall a solid 3-star. Worth a visit, with a few shining stars, but I'd hesitate to order any plates for takeout/delivery unless they change their hummus packaging."}
{"text":"The foods good on the weekend, but unfortunately the girls that work there are just a little too rude for my liking."}
{"text":"This is something that I would drive by everyday and never think to go in. I maybe feared it would be too much to handle or dirty but that was not the case. This is like a story book, very mysterious and personalized. I love it. I went with a mate who knew about this place. We parked behind a random building and we were not towed which was great. My friend got a bowl of soup that was giant and i got a smoothie and Chicken Schwarma. They were both great, not a vast amount of chicken but comes with hummus and pita which is nice. I am one of those weird germaphobes and take note to get silverware or hand wash prior. I did not see a bathroom, that does not mean it is not in existence; I just did not see it. Overall it was like $16 in the end so an expensive lunch but soups are cheap as our their drinks other than the smoothies. The food took a while but they were quite busy. Overall a treat and will come again!"}
{"text":"I used to come here to write all the time when i lived in Cleveland.  Great atmosphere, love the decor, furniture, and teas.  The wood fire place wasn't enough on the harsh winters but hey, sometimes you just don't give a crap.  I loved the local crazy, artsy, hippie regulars, too."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in Algebra as I write this review. I really want to rate it higher, but this is the second time they've forgotten my order! I put it in at 8:00, it's now 8:45...And there are two girls working (usually there's just one person), and it's not crowded, so there's really no excuse here. My advice would be to make sure you see whoever is taking your order write it down. If you don't see them write it down, you won't be getting anything. Currently one girl is texting on her phone and the other is letting a customer sample lots of things on the menu.  I really wish the customer service was better here!  I shouldn't have to remind somebody to make the food I ordered, and I don't plan on doing so.    Atmosphere is unique, you're either going to like it or hate it. All the furniture/mugs/everything is handmade by the owner, which is cool. The furniture is definitely not going to be comfortable for tall people but it's good for studying, a unique date, or just meeting up with a friend.  The food is good most of the time, but things change depending on who is making it. My two favorite things on the menu are the Fool Madams and the lentil soup. They both fall into the comfort food category but are healthy, which isn't a combination that is easy to find elsewhere.   The coffee is generally weak, except for the Palestinian-style one with cardamom, that one is usually great.  All in all, food is good, service sucks, atmosphere is either going to be your thing or it isn't.  Edit: I spoke too soon! No, they didn't suddenly remember my food. Instead, when I walked up to pay, the girl behind the counter looked me in the eye, then looked back down at her phone to finish a text. AND I realized that she is training the other girl. This girl is not fit to be training anybody! I really hope the owner reads this. It gets better: when I went to pay for the things I did receive, I reminded her of what she had forgotten and then she proceeded to ring me up for everything anyway... Crazy."}
{"text":"LOVED the ambiance. Love, love, love. I've been looking for a quirky coffee shop in Cleveland for ages, and finally found it here - thanks to Yelp!. Large coffee and tea selection, strange and eclectic decor - great!  There is a major downside though. I came here to get my writing on for some grad school applications. There were only a few empty tables, so I happily grabbed one, only to realize that there wasn't an outlet within ten feet of me. I was admittedly at a middle table - but I wish they had extension cords, or SOMETHING so that all tables could get power. My laptop's a bit of a clunker and eats battery fast.  The wifi was also having some major issues while I was there - I don't know if this was an isolated incident or something common, but luckily another customer asked the barista if she could reset it, and it seemed to work better after that.   I can't say anything about the food -  I actually only got tea here. They were very nice about using my mug rather than giving me one, I always appreciate it when no one makes a fuss about that (which is admittedly becoming more common).   Check Algebra out - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Algebra is simply a wonderful little tea house/cafe/coffee shop with a hip yet homely vibe. It's artfully decorated with plenty of comfy one-of-a-kind chairs and couches to sink into and chill for a while. The counter staff are helpful and attentive, and they prepare food and drinks with love and care. Everything is just so beautifully presented. I have to admit I haven't tried much of the lovely-looking menu, because I get the hummus salad every time. It's simple, fresh, and flavorsome. I really must try the Moroccan sardines as they sound divine. The fruit smoothies are also fantastic and served with panache. Algebra is definitely the place to come for a light meal or refreshing drink any time of the day or night."}
{"text":"I got here an hour ago ordered a drink and was told they'd bring it to me. An hour later still haven't gotten my drink. I went to the counter to remind them but there was no one around. It wasn't even busy. So now I'm moving on and see if I can get some caffeine elsewhere. At least the wifi was free and got an hour's work done."}
{"text":"Algebra Tea House is a very special place in Cleveland.   Firstly, the food and drinks are unique and delicious. My favorites are the Iraqi kebab (spiced to perfection) and the chai (real chai, not the overly sweet stuff that comes from a carton). The Algebra Omelette is a fantastic brunch option.   This place is amazing on so many levels. The owner makes all of the mugs, as well as the woodwork in the building (including the front door, shelves, tables, cabinets, cutting boards). You can buy mugs and cutting boards (they make great gifts!) A variety of teas, spices, and other random groceries are also sold.   Algebra is definitely a great place to relax, engage in random conversation at the counter, study, or meet up with friends. Definitely a place that every Clevelander should experience at some point."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. THe food is delicious and the owner, his wife, and a few other workers there so friendly. The atmosphere is different from the usual restaurants which is also very nice. If there was a down side, there are a few workers, that are just not the friendliest, and once you're used to how the owner and the other workers normally address you, it can be a little alarming and slightly off putting. There have been times, I avoid going there just because I know that there are certain workers working at that time :/ Other than that, a really good place!"}
{"text":"This little place is amazing! It has everything you could want from a tea cafe--cute interior, chill servers, a good food menu, free wi-fi and a nice atmosphere. Also Algebra is just a sweet name. This gem is situated along the red brick cobblestone streets of Little Italy, and some of their tea blends are exquisite. I recommend the Fiji Green. Appropriately, I stick around here for hours and work on my math and physics problem sets."}
{"text":"y(x) = awesome food + awesome atmosphere + good coffee  Albeit, I found it a bit pricey for the amount of coffee you actually get ($4 for smaller than a 'tall' at Starbucks) .. but any coffee shop that's not Starbucks already gets 3 stars.  The coffee is good (although the mocha was a bit diluted) but not the best I've had (The Roots Cafe is awesome).  The best part of this place is the feel.  It's a real coffee house, there are young folk all around, even late at night people are walkn' by.  If I lived near-by I'd be a poor man with a stomach full of coffee.  Oh and the food is great.  The dude grows herbs in the garden and in the middle of preparing the food steps out and grabs some herbs and puts it in your kebab.  Tastes great.  Another of Cleveland's hidden gem"}
{"text":"I only went in here once, and never again.  I didn't even get anything to eat or drink, so I can't speak for the quality of the food or drink.  But the atmosphere was a complete turn-off.  It's a dark, cluttered room that complete reeks of incense.  The smell is so heavy that it's not even good.  I couldn't enjoy it in there long enough to order anything!"}
{"text":"The Algebra tea house is a wonderful spot to get a coffee or tea, have a snack, and spend a bunch of time working on your laptop or reading a book. The tea is great, the food is good, the prices are reasonable. The service is slow but friendly, and speed doesn't matter so much if you're planning on hunkering down for a while.  The ambiance is very quiet, homey, and earthy. The tables are all set up to be comfortable for a long stay while you work or have a quiet conversation. There's a little wood fireplace in the back, and plenty of couches and comfy chairs.  Most of the food I've tried are the middle eastern themed sandwiches (like falafal or shawarma or kabab). They're all tasty, though fairly simple. When I've been to Algebra, there has only one person working behind the counter, and that has made service pretty slow. When you're settled in for a while to get some work done, however, slow service isn't a big problem. Particularly when it's friendly!  Overall, a wonderful, quiet, homey atmosphere with decent food and tons of different teas. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  The food is good, and the smoothies are a great value.  Service is a little inconsistent.  Really cool one night, closed early the next (they close at 11PM  normally).  I love the variety of teas, and the medditeranean menu.  Will go again, depending on who's working there"}
{"text":"Very disappointed by this place. There are only two components to tea, and our barista managed to mess both of them up. My tea bag was not secured properly so the leaves exploded into the water, and my boyfriends water was not even hot so the tea did not brew properly, resulting in his tea tasting like plain sink water. We had been wanting to try this place for a while, but after this experience we probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!  I went out of my way to go here because I had read the reviews.  I'm all for hippie, earthy stuff but this was too much.  It looks like a dirty little hardware store where they also serve coffee.  I was almost too grossed out to order.  I got some sort of coconut coffee that had little 'floaties' of coconut.  I ended up throwing most of it out.  I'm not sure if it actually tasted bad or if I was just turned off by the atmosphere.  It's too bad.  I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"This is a nice cozy spot on Murray Hill Rd. Appears to be pretty popular - it's always been packed whenever I've stopped by. The people working here are genuinely friendly and caring. And they make good drinks. Sorry no particular recommendations here regarding drinks and food. I've had a few things and liked them all.  I also like what they've done with the place in terms of decor.  Really the only reason I give it a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because it's always packed when I go : / sorry !   Regardless, I highly recommend everyone to swing by at least and try something!It's especially nice when it's so snowy and cold outside and you need a cup of tea to warm up your mouth and hands too.   Last thing, for all of you coffee lovers. This is a tea house - Keep an open mind and maybe try something else for a change :)"}
{"text":"This is a quirky little tea house on Murray Hill road away from the main drag of Little Italy restaurants. The prices are reasonable and they have a good selection on the menu. The reason why I am giving it 4 stars is about aesthetics: it always seems very dark in there and it would be nice if they had more comfy seating near electrical outlets in case I go there to do some work."}
{"text":"As a graduate student living in Cleveland's Little Italy and attending CWRU, Algebra has become a sweet study spot for me - if not by virtue of its intimate vibe, then certainly by virtue of location. This coffee house sits snugly between my apartment and my school. This fact, coupled with my Lebanese heritage, makes the Arab-infused Algebra a natural, recurring choice.  The best choice? Not according to their current equation. Even the mathematically challenged will notice that a few aspects of the cafe don't quite add up. I wouldn't say that my Algebra grade is an A. But it passes for me, certainly, and it keeps me coming back despite its negatives.   For the sentimental, international romantic, the background music is choice. It never fails to bring a few childhood memories to mind for me, and if you're new to the voices of the East, you're still guaranteed a goosebump or two. The funky, original playlist features Arab greats as well as international favorites and lesser known artists. It definitely beats Starbucks' jazzy, unoriginal, repetitive tracks.   The cafe's creativity is just as visual as it is auditory. Bohemian, \"messy-apartment\" style from the front door to the back room. I'm a *big*  fan of the unorthodox ceramic creations. It's a refreshing combination of messy, old-school, functional, colorful, modern, and primary.   Why Algebra doesn't make the top grade:   The art should NOT be used as dishware for the restaurant. A few of the older coffee mugs in the shop have started to deteriorate. The glaze at the base of the cup is cracked, and bacteria can crawl in there and produce nasty smells and tastes.The owner/manager should double check older mugs and dispose of them appropriately, or reconsider his glaze choice.    I enjoy the bohemian, messy vibe - yet it is too messy for my taste. The pots are stained, the food prep area always looks unkempt, the floor is covered with dust and grime, the shelves dirty, and the tables are almost always consistently sticky. Atmosphere is one thing, but cleanliness is quite another.   Lastly, each time I order the same thing from the menu, it is made differently. I attribute this to the young college staff who hold part-times here. No issue with them (they are very sweet), but they need to learn a standard menu. Algebra's Arab food menu is not stellar by my standards, but the tea menu is phenomenal. I recommend this quirky hole-in-the-wall for a place to study or catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Love the relaxed atmosphere. So welcoming... It's like you're at a close, kind of kooky/very artsy friend's or relative's house. Love it. The owner made pretty much all of the art and serveware in the place; that's dedication to your craft! The owner is also super nice and friendly. He is in all the time saying hello to customers and managing the place.  Great drinks and very authentic Palestinian coffee.   The food is fantastic and actually the most authentic Arabic/Middle Eastern food I've had in the Cleveland area. They have really great hummus and the falafel is fantastic (note that I am a huge hummus and falafel snob).   I love bringing new people here to experience it. Can't say enough good things. Down to earth, authentic and just a great place to be. You can study here for hours or have lunch with a friend."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life. The girl working was SO SLOW. I don't mean like she was busy, so that caused her to be slow, it was like she didn't know what she was doing. She made my coffee with the wrong milk so I had to point that out and then she didn't know what milk I had asked for, seriously?! I was the only person who ordered a coffee to go. And WORST OF ALL she made my wrap with NO GLOVES AFTER SHE TOOK SOMEONE ELSES PAYMENT. I am literally disgusted and will never go back!"}
{"text":"Algebra Teahouse is a nice little find on the East Side. It boasts an expansive menu of Middle Eastern Cuisine (but not just Middle Eastern) which I've never been disappointed with. The drink menu is also long. The coffee does have a different taste to it if you're used to Starbucks, but if you wanted average coffee, you'd be looking for a Starbucks!   The ambience here is tricky. Most people won't have a problem with it especially because it's pleasantly different than what one is used to, but f you like clean cut contemporary you may be not be comfortable with Algebra. Along with the books and games for people to enjoy while they're there, Algebra also sells a variety of goods from imported foodstuffs to hand-made pottery.  A visit to Algebra Teahouse will make a nice afternoon for anyone.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was a bit of a skeptic for a while...but I have decided that I am a fan of Algebra overall.  I was always wary to even go into the place due to the unkempt chachka-laden outside. It always looks messy and disorganized. I thought it made the neighborhood look sloppy... and I still do. But I deal.  The first time I visited, I got an Espresso Milkshake. I was expecting a rich coffee milkshake. What I got was a vanilla shake with espresso grounds. Just plain gross and gritty. Weird. On another occasion, I had one of the coffees and I thought it was bit too weak.  But I wanted to like this place. It IS kind of cool. No where near a chain coffee shop. I kind of like the mismatched furniture and hippy vibe. They also have a lot of middle eastern food. I always get their falafel wraps at the Hessler Street Fair and they are really good.  So today, I decided to give them another chance and I went in for some lunch. I ordered the Iraqi Meat Kabob wrap. I was expecting the server to go in the back and heat something up and bring it out. Instead, the friendly guy behind the counter pulled out a skillet and started chopping onions. The meat was pre-mixed with spices, but raw and cooked from scratch. I was really impressed that food is cooked to order here. I was expecting more of a pre-fab meal like most coffee shops have. They have an actual full sized gas stove behind the counter, not just a flat top grill. It was cool watching him cook my food. The taste was excellent. Very fresh and flavorful. Definitely better than I was expecting. The owner is Lebanese or Palestinian or something (can't remember exactly) so there are a lot of middle eastern offerings on the menu. There's also turkey sandwiches and things. I'll definitely be coming back for food.  The tea and coffee selection is pretty extensive and there are a lot of unique flavor combos. I had the Darjeeling Tea and it was pretty good. It was cool because the server \"made\" my tea bag from loose tea. Again, I was impressed with the made-to-order feel.  So yah, I'm a fan. Algebra is definitely unique and worlds different from anything else in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the front door or the dark atmosphere when you first step in. I know I was on my first visit.    I remember walking in and feeling like everyone had stopped what they were doing and turned around to see who the non-belonger was standing alone at the entrance. But that was all in my imagination, I think.  I have since become a regular algebra-goer, coming here at least once a week for my fill of delicious coffee, tea, and authentic Mediterranean food  Owned and built by a Case alum, this gem of a tea house really delivers on uniqueness, authenticity, and atmosphere. With their one of a kind handmade tables, cups, wooden plates, artwork, they really leave their mark as one of the coolest coffee houses in Cleveland  You really can't go wrong with any of their food, I am a big fan of their falafel and shawarma. Their hummus is also very good, but a little tame for me, I like my hummus more offensive with more lemon and a tad more garlic, but that's just a preference thing. Algebra is also very vegan friendly and has a large assortment of healthy menu options. Isn't it a great feeling to finish a big meal and still feel healthy afterwards?  Their drinks are not for the average venti-mocha-frappuccino-with-extra-whipped-cream 'coffee' sippers. As is the food, the drinks are authentic and are generally not too sweet, if at all.   If you are unsure of what to order, I recommend the chai tea and perhaps the falafel sandwich as starters  My only gripe with this place is that they aren't too consistent because they have a different person working there almost everyday, all of whom have their own slight variations on food and drink prep, so if you liked the chai tea you had Monday morning, you might not like it as much Wednesday night.  But this place delivers on so many other aspects, that I can't bring myself to give them anything below a 'as good as it gets' So come check this place out, order an iced chai tea with falafel sandwich, you won't be disappointed!  And remember, on your way out, it's push not pull :)"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant/tea shop! The (Middle Eastern/Arabic) food was excellent and even prepared right in front of us. We had the fool madams entree, the banana algebra dessert, and a cookie - all delicious. The tea selection was amazing, and I say that as someone who drinks up to 8 cups of tea a day. (I know: I have a problem.) The ambiance is relaxed and casual, and there is a variety of seating. Prices were very reasonable, and I liked the decor. If we lived nearby, I fear I would be here all the time. Regarding service, we had no problems, though I could tell that the woman working had been the only one there for many hours and was tired."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Super hipster and quaint. Perfectly tucked away in Little Italy. Food is super good and filling. Smoothies are delicious. Their service is a little slow but other than that I have nothing negative to say."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to picking up a late breakfast for my son who is inpatient at Rainbow, but at 2:20 pm on a Saturday they said that they were not serving breakfast.   Disappointed because he found items on the menu that sounded good to him"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's got character.  Nice music, interesting art and eclectic comfy furniture. I like studying here. I'd like to try for lunch sometime. Menu looks tasty."}
{"text":"They have a great variety of teas which can be served hot or cold and an unusual coffee menu.  If I lived in Cleveland, I'd always be here.  Didn't get to order anything off the menu, since we had a full breakfast at the Baricelli Inn.  On my way to the bathroom, I thought that I got lost in some magical forest.  The bathroom doors (one for brothers, the other for sisters) appear to be carved from one larger piece of wood.  When you enter the sisters' bathroom, it's like you are stepping into a bizarre world.  Trippy."}
{"text":"I am going to keep this short and sweet because there really isn't a long story as to why Algebra Tea House is getting a 2-stars from me. I paid $3 for a Coconut Pepper Cafe. $3.... for what was probably 2 sips of the weirdest most \"unique\" (I use \"unique\" because I think the words I want to use would be too rude) drink I think I have ever choked down. It was honestly just an espresso with an excessive amount of coconut flakes mixed in, topped with extremely potent black pepper. I don't know what I was expecting when I ordered this.... I mean it is literally exactly what the named described, so maybe I am being unfair. I guess I'm just not trendy enough and my palette isn't alternative enough to understand this thing. Ah well."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite brunch/study spot in Cleveland. You probably wouldn't expect it but the potatoes are probably the best (or at least top 3!) breakfast potatoes I've ever had. They're crispy, well-seasoned, and plentiful... what more could you ask for? The space is cozy, feels like home, and in the winter they keep the wood stove going so it feels like you're studying in a cabin instead of the middle of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It was hard to find and in a rather unexpected place, but was extremely memorable. In fact, I write this review four years after being there and still remember in detail my time there. The owner was friendly and well-informed about all the coffees and teas there. It came all came across as rather unique for a coffee/tea house, if that is the type of experience you're looking for."}
{"text":"This was my favorite coffee/tea house anywhere--in the whole world.  Everything about it is wonderful.  The atmosphere is quirky and unique.  Each table is different, oddly shaped...some more practical or comfortable than others.  The drinks are amazing.  I love tea, and the teas offered here are of the highest quality, and are unique and different--some of them are ones that would be difficult to find elsewhere.  This place makes an outstanding chai.  It also offers high-quality, Arab non-alcoholic beer, something I am a huge fan of, and something that can be hard to find.  There are baked goods and fresh fruit (and sometimes vegetables) available for a reasonable price.  The baked goods range in quality from good to excellent.  There is also a unique culture associated with this place.  The owner and people who work the counter are intelligent, interesting people.  The atmosphere is intellectual and is conducive to meeting people and having interesting conversations.  There is free wireless internet, and there are scrabble and chess boards (which are frequently used), and a computer and printer available for a small fee.  There are certain events on a semi-regular basis...including things as diverse as chess tournaments and a bluegrass night.  Parking?  Not always easy but you can usually find it on the street.  This place is a short walk from the Case campus, and it is also a short work from the University Circle station on RTA's red line.  This is primarily a neighborhood place.  I would recommend checking this place out, if you like this sort of place.  I recognize that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but for those looking for this sort of place it is the best one could find!"}
{"text":"What kind of bra always comes off for smart people?  Alge-bra!  I made that one up. Could you tell.  What to get: The Guava drinks. Are you sure: Yes, Guava taste of it and you'll agree.  I've had the guava drink 3 times now, the first 2 times it was pretty awesome. Not like, blows me away and changes my life, but still really enjoyable. The third time, the girl had to look up in the manual how to make it, and didn't do a very good job. It came out pretty average. Nevertheless, the prices of this little tea shop aren't as high as you'd imagine, and that Guava drink is pretty damn imaginative. I'd definitely come here again.  I'm torn between a 4 and 5 star rating for it, but the fact that they use very healthy ingredients, and that the service has been extraordinarily friendly every time I've been here, edges it over to a 5."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cafe in Cleveland. The place has a unique atmosphere, its cozy and easy going. The staff are friendly and welcoming. You can sit there for hours sipping your drink without feeling awkward. You can read, study, work , watch movies on you laptop (the place has Wifi). I love the food and their selection of drinks. My absolute favorite is the Coconut-Pineapple smoothie, its delicious."}
{"text":"This place reminds me a lot of the coffee shops back home in Portland, Oregon.  Lots of eclectic furniture and art.  There's a mini shopping area for teas, coffees, and random ingredients in the middle of Algebra.    Algebra is more of the kind of coffee shop where you go in and relax with a book or catch up with a friend you haven't seen in a while.  It isn't your venti mocha frap to go kinda place.    I had the house latte iced (I love the addition of rose water and honey).  My boyfriend had the coffee with coconut and pepper- get this if you are looking for something new and feeling adventurous.  The food is a great value- lots of wraps and salads.  All are made in the little kitchen across from the counter."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's quiet and tucked away, and it has so much personality! From the cool wooden tables, to the floor seating in the back, to the HUGE variety of teas, I was sold from the start. I've had 2 breakfast burritos from this place and they were both delicious (beef bacon, potatoes, and eggs). I am a meat-eater, but they appear to have several vegetarian options as well. If you need something special, I do know they make everything to order so I am sure you can customize. They also sell a few staples of groceries in case you live nearby and are in desperate need of nutella or flour.   Another really cool feature of Algebra is the game collection. You can sit on pillows in the back area and play games if you have some time to kill. They also keep a book exchange library on the front right wall. I have traded 2 or 3 books out already and I love that they do this!"}
{"text":"Last weekend I happened to be in the Little Italy area, and I decided to try this place out because of the great Yelp reviews I'd seen. It was a hot day and I was definitely craving an iced espresso drink... so I ordered the house latte to go. The poorly maintained espresso machine should've been my first warning sign. There weren't many people in there for a Sunday afternoon--just a pair of folks that placed a food order before me. So naturally, after ten minutes went by, I couldn't really understand why I was still waiting. I looked over and saw that no one was even working at the espresso bar. They were just making food and hadn't even started my drink. So I asked them if my drink would be ready anytime soon, and they said a few minutes. Then I overheard the barista saying to the other that they didn't have enough ice. I was thinking to myself...\"wonderful.\" But I was still hanging onto the fact that once I got my latte it was going to be so refreshing and delicious...I had to wait! In retrospect, I wish I had just walked out then--since apparently you pay after your order comes out. When my drink was finally ready, I left quickly. Unfortunately, what I thought was going to be an iced latte turned out to be an iced coffee. I'm not super particular and usually this wouldn't be a big problem for me, but this coffee wasn't even good. And since they made the mistake of serving me regular iced coffee, couldn't they have just given it to me right away instead of making me wait? It's not like it was freshly brewed... Plus, it only had a few ice cubes in it so it wasn't cold enough (could've seen that once coming...) I threw it away after a few sips. Since I'm not a local here, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that apparently Algebra Tea House was having an off day. The staff were pleasant and friendly, for sure, but I'm not giving them any points for efficiency. I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Algebra is one of my favorite hideouts in Cleveland because it is so unique. In terms of taste, ambiance, amount of boardgames, and funky furniture, there is just no comparison. Love their coconut almond chai tea and its the only place in Cleveland that I've encountered Turkish delight. Definitely a cool place to go if you are looking for something novel to try out.   There's also a hippy, zen, organic ambiance to the place. Even their bathrooms are labeled for \"brothers\" and \"sisters\"."}
{"text":"A darling place that's hot in the summer, cold in the winter, and quirky in all seasons.  Delicious homemade chai (none of this Oregon Chai nonsense), and a fun menu of kefte on Mondays, couscous with vegetables on Wed.  The hummus comes in generous proportions.  Plus, free wireless."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, cute decor, wood stove in the corner, natural wood cut tables, games (chess etc).  Service is personal and nice, nothing fancy. Makes it easy to go there to hang out.  Food was good and interesting. Highlight is definitely the space :)"}
{"text":"Anyone ever seen The Dark Crystal?  Apparently, all of the characters who wouldn't set out to eat or dismember you decided to get together and share their passion for tea and organic architecture.  Chairs, tables, window surrounds, and the like shaped out of random pieces of wood and fabric.  Door handles formed out of scrap wood.  Windows flung wide into the open air and, subsequently, crushing humidity and heat (at times) of Ohio in the summer.  Quirky as all-get-out, but fun.  Apparently, there's free wireless, but I couldn't imagine sitting in the store and fiddling with my Mac in the heat of the last couple of weeks.  There are times when I'm dang thankful for air conditioning - this store might be close to perfect if that was an implemented feature, but perhaps that's merely one of its attributes that I'm missing the \"wonderful\" quality of.  We had the iced tea, brewed strong enough to be akin to chewing green tea while sniffing mint, but it was refreshing in the midst of the hot afternoon.  There appeared to be a pretty fun selection of fresh fruit, pastries, and dried fruit available, along with a ton of hot teas that I'll need to come back on a cold day to try.  Definitely fun and different, and the friendly guy working behind the counter didn't resemble Aughra, a Skeksis, or a Gelfling in the slightest."}
{"text":"Why does the Algebra Tea House deserve 5 stars? Because this cafe offers a unique environment that no other coffee shop in town has managed to replicate. It is a quaint, quirky little joint that offers a relaxing environment for those looking to chat with a friend. The employees set the radio to classical and jazz--probably on 89.7 or 90.3--thereby creating a sedate, tranquil atmosphere. Random interesting books are scattered around the establishment and fun games such as chess are supplied to provide entertainment.   Although the drink I tried was not the most amazing hot beverage I have ever had in my life, it was still really good, and I would certainly pay for it again--although next time I will probably try something else on the menu. I do concur with another reviewer that the servings were small, but, for me, when I come here I am not paying to have the best tea drinking experience in the world. I am paying for the opportunity to hang out in a tranquil environment where I can pass time with a good friend, and perhaps play a game of chess. I definitely recommend.  Check out their site for pics: www.algebrateahouse.net/"}
{"text":"We found the Algebra Teahouse yesterday while walking Murray Hill for the Feast of the Assumption.   Eclectic, cozy, bohemian vibe, reminiscent of a small village gathering spot on the Mediterranean.   Artsy, beautiful hand finished wood tables, great selection of coffee and tea.  Even the bathroom is really cool!"}
{"text":"Due to currently at the time of writing this very unconstitutional rule against a certain religion being active, I have to say I am so grateful for this wonderful gem of another culture, correction: of ONE of many interesting and enriching cultures this world luckily still has to offer for us to enjoy and learn from, besides the fact that the food in there is simply awesome, in particular the cucumber smoothie and the shawarma are excellent.  The place went through ups and downs over time so it depends on the moment if you get excellent service and polite counter staff or if you get un-engaged kids playing with their smart phones.  Besides that please note the fantastic wooden furniture and also the pottery, which is all the amazing work handmade by the occasionally a bit eccentric owner, I wish he would go into production with the stuff, I would want such cabinets at home. Oh wait, I tend to rent, well one day I will settle, then hopefully we can do it.  Hopefully this place will never be bullied out of town or out of the country, we need it now more than ever."}
{"text":"I don't come here often because they do not have the typical breakfast food you generally crave. However, this is a MUST GO TO restaurant... or at least once in your life if you're living in cleveland. If you're a visitor to cleveland, you should come here for the uniqueness of the restaurant but I might recommend Coventry Inn as the place to eat at.   If I had to list my top 3 favorite breakfast place, it would be Coventry Inn, Algebra Tea House, and... i have yet to have a 3rd favorite.  Now, algebra tea house. my friend introduced me to it and when i walked in, it had a really hippy feel to it. The cool thing is, every furniture, cups, plates, etc... is made by the owner. So the cool thing is, every cup looks different. Even the bathroom is decorated in its own unique style.  Onto the food.. it takes awhile between the time you order and the time you get their food. But the reason is because the owner and/or the one other chef there actually hand cooks every food each time an order is placed. The food there are so fresh and so well made. I never mind the wait because this place is meant to be a chill time with a good friend or two.  Must Eat: Algebra Omelet. This dish is amazing! It's also their signature dish. Also, their home fries are soooooooo delicious."}
{"text":"You're kidding right? $3.08 for one, half filled cup of loose tea in a drafty cafe? Something's not right here. At first, I actually liked the vibe of this place, and considered giving it a good review. Once the tea came, however, I thought they must be joking. I had the Hibiscus which tasted very similar to Tazo's Passion Fruit. For all I know, it WAS Tazo. I received one small (partially filled) mug of this stuff with no pot of hot water. Whether I could have asked for more water, I do not know; but they should have at least offered. Worst part for me, was the actual experience of sitting in this place. None of the chairs are all that comfortable and the place felt like an icebox. Someone left the back door ajar and since they don't have running heat (aside from a wood stove in the back) it was quite nippy. Would I go back? Reluctantly, yes...but that's just cause I'm a sucker for tea."}
{"text":"As a student at Case, Algebra has become one of my favorite places to study, as it offers a unique and comforting atmosphere along with great food at a reasonable price.  The decor is quite unique, with chairs in all sorts of shapes and sizes, many of which are shaped like tree trunks.  Various trinkets and games litter the shelves, and guests are welcome to pick up a game to play in the tea house or pick up some paper and drawing utensils to draw a picture.  Often, there is music playing in the background, although the style of music seems to change each time I go.  The staff are extremely friendly and can often be seen chatting with curious customers.  The food offered is delicious;  I especially like their sandwiches and pizzas.  As a tea house, they also offer a variety of teas and other hot drinks, which are a nice addition during long days of studying.  I am also a big fan of their guava smoothie, which is cool and delicious.  In addition, various flavors of ice cream are offered for those with a sweet tooth.  On weekends, they offer breakfast, which is quite tasty.  I enjoy their omelettes, which are served with home fries and toast with butter and jam.  The blend of its unique look, comforting atmosphere, and delicious food makes Algebra one of my favorite spots in Cleveland.  Especially great for students like me, but really a fun place for just about anyone."}
{"text":"I think I'm seriously in denial that I had to leave NYC and now live in Cleveland. That said, yelp has threatened to take away my beloved elite status if I do not step it up and come out of my reviewing shell so since I'm a big girl here it goes...  I couldn't stand studying at home anymore so I turned to yelp for somewhere quiet that would feed me and let me study for a few hours. This place is close to campus near my house and overall so darling.  It immediately reminded me of a bunch of places in Park Slope-except for the amazing perk of being middle eastern!   They have Arabic coffee, zaatar and labneh! And the tables are mismatched like my favorite tea lounge: hey, I think I might embrace Cleveland living after all.   Come here for somewhere quiet and friendly where you can read, eat delicious comforting food and study. Wish me luck-boards are Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Algebra has a lovely selection of teas, accompanied by a decent breakfast and sandwich menu.  But what makes Algebra so special is that nearly everything in the restaurant is made by the owner.  And I'm not just talking about from-scratch entrees. I mean the tables, the plates and cups, the window sills!  Talk about homey.  This is it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and very reasonable prices!  Try the Moroccan sardines with a side of hummus, salad, and pita, and you won't be disappointed.  I love the eclectic decor and the wood burning stove.  It's the kind of place that could easily become addictive!"}
{"text":"Algebra has a wonderful atmosphere and good service. Nice desks, cook games, funky art and even hand/crafted mugs. However, their chai is very watery and their coffee can be weak. Would visit again for their study-friendly atmosphere but not for their drinks."}
{"text":"My children go to college in Cleveland, so I've only gotten to eat here when I've visited them. I've loved everything I've eaten here!  The hummus and falafel plate is fantastic. Also had the shawarma, Moroccan stew, spinach pie, the pickled eggplant; all delicious!"}
{"text":"I spent SO much time here in high school and when I came back recently, I was pleasantly surprised that nothing had changed.  Same eclectic patrons and chatty employees.  Same random stuff for sale.  Same ohmygodit'ssogood Mango Sweet tea.  Do yourself a favor and stop in next time you need something warm to drink in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the algebra tea house.    If you like laid back, completely chill environments. This is definitely the place for you. We walked in because I was craving some good, like GOOOOOD hummus. We looked over the menu and just asked the incredibly polite lady behind the counter to bring us a few of her favorites.  She did and we ate and ate. Boba, Hummus, tatsiki, fresh veggies, falafel. The naan was amazing and fresh. The tea was hot and delicious.  We laid back and enjoyed our surroundings and our food. We did a bit of shopping after we ate and brought home some loose leaf teas I'm extremely excited to try.  You can find any type of tea, Moroccan, Islamic type spices and or foods here. Very convenient.  We can't wait to come back, very calming. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was even better. The place the clean and well kept."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and warm ambience. The food and the great host will have you coming back. Will return. All the mugs, tables, and cupboards are handmade by the owners."}
{"text":"Algebra Tea House is one of the first places I tried in Cleveland when I moved here 5 years ago. I have frequented this cafe countless times since then and am absolutely in love with it. the hummus is always fresh and the harissa is a perfect addition to the any of the sandwiches/plates. My favorite things on the menu are probably the smoothies- especially the Triple Berry Soy and House smoothies. The House smoothie is probably the best smooth I have ever had! The falafel is always perfectly seasoned and not too garlicky, unlike those you may find at many other chain restaurants. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because I find their milk teas a little too watery and a bit weak. Also, the quality of the food highly depends on who is on duty. The cook/cashier/server is usually excellent, but I have found that that is not consistently the case."}
{"text":"Iced options barely exist here. I ordered a chai, got a non dairy milk, and after about ten minutes it came out to me. It was watered down almond milk. Luckily their prices are reasonable but I will not be returning. My boyfriend got the sweet mango green tea. It was not sweet, and it was also watery. They should refuse to serve iced teas then if they are melted ice. I had been waiting to try this place for months, but now i regret my desire."}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love coming here! It's a great place to just kick back, hang out, grab a small bite to eat and drink delicious tea!  My favorite: the moroccan mint.... yuuum!"}
{"text":"Oh my god this is my most favorite place to drink tea ever. One of my good friends lives in Cleveland and I can't understand why she isnt there every waking minute. They have a variety of delicious teas served in very artsy and adorable mugs. They have a few different games (including mancala!!!) and none of their furniture is the same in design. They even have a different algebra problem on the board every day for people to solve and get something free, not really sure what it is though, I obviously didnt do it. I was too distracted by the adorable cat rubbing its head on my  leg."}
{"text":"Dear lord I love this place. Visiting Algebra Tea House is like falling down the rabbit hole to the artistic and inspiring coffee shop of Alice in Wonderland. In a world where I often feel like the art of good coffee shops is slowly dying, Algebra Tea House gives me hope. When you walk in, you'll be positively overwhelmed at how much you have to look at! The artistic vision here is awesome. I adore that they serve their coffee in artisan-made mugs and every detail here is really thoughtful.  Just FYI if you need an ergonomic seating situation, like I do: the seating is mostly mismatched couches, floor pillows, alternative seating, etc. A good, sturdy backed chair is in rare form here. So, not 5 stars for me, only because it's a little hard for me with my injury to stay here for anything longer than a quick visit. But, the quirky seating is part of the charm here. Students will really enjoy this place.  When I visited, the place was bustling with students that were sprawled everywhere. There was literally 1 gal working, and boy, was she working hard. I didn't order any food (I took pity on her soul), and waited about 15 minutes to get my green tea. No biggie, it's not her fault she's scheduled solo. They also sell teas to-go, which were delicious. I wanted to buy one, but they only come in really huge bags for $15, and while Kiwi Hibiscus tea sounds awesome, I didn't need that much. But, all the tea makes Algebra Tea House smell like heaven. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks, gracious and helpful staff, and a unique atmosphere combine to make Algebra Tea House one of my favorite places in the area.    The food at Algebra is probably the best food I've ever had at a tea house or cafe.  The food is reasonably priced, made when you order, and always fresh.  I love the Algebra Salad, which is a generous portion of perfectly dressed salad topped with cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese, and zattar spices.  The Iraqi kebab sandwich is also delicious, as is the spinach pie plate, which comes with a side of hummus and salad.  I have had only good experiences with the food here!    They offer a variety of coffee and tea drinks, which are also very good.  The mocha is one of my favorites.  Usually I do not like mochas due to the syrupy sweet quality they have at every other place I have tried.  Algebra's is much less sweet than your average mocha and they add a splash of rosewater that makes the drink truly delicious.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, the drinks served in house can be pricey and even smaller in size than the \"small\" offered at most other coffee places.  Finally, the atmosphere of the place is nice and truly unique.  A wood burning stove inside makes Algebra Tea House a nice place to come on a cold day. The only downside in my opinion is that some of the seating can be awkward and uncomfortable.    I would highly recommend Algebra Tea House to anyone in the area who is interested in trying something new, or who is just looking for a relatively inexpensive place to enjoy a meal or beverage."}
{"text":"What a fun spot to enjoy a snack, coffee or tea. The interior is very unique and feels like you're in a museum. Great atmosphere to study or read a book. I loved all the art work everywhere.  They have products for purchase including different types of coffee. I love how everything is local and home grown. It's great to support places like this rather than a typical Starbucks. Worth checking out! They also have outdoor seating :)"}
{"text":"Algebra was never my thing too much. I didn't mind it so much as it just wasn't what I loved or excelled in. Hence, the tea application. I generally go for the specialty focused, detail driven cafe. Those are generally beautiful and absent of clutter. Here at Algebra, it is entirely different. Not to be derogatory either. It has much eclecticism, therefore much character. Much art. And it looks like it belongs in a far away land. Africa? South America? Australia? Europe? Asia? I can't decide. It has culture, but I don't think it's Cleveland's culture. (Research will tell you that the owner is from the Middle East. That makes plenty of sense.) It looks like a cafe DRIFT magazine would feature, for a prime example showcasing the local culture of that particular city. But I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be Cleveland. And that's what makes it unique and worthy to occupy some space in your heart.   And your stomach. Some hot cardamom tea was what occupied mine. It was good, once the pods were scooped away."}
{"text":"This the quirkiest, artsiest, and most delicious cafe in the Cleveland area. There is comfy seating, Bedouin type decor, and authentic, freshly prepared Middle Eastern food. The owner of the cafe is a wonderful artist who takes great care with all aspects of the cafe (his studio is in the basement).   The tables and mugs are all handmade by him, as is much of the artwork. I also want to add that pretty much everything here is made from scratch. He soaks chickpeas in large tins overnight to make fresh hummus. The muhamarra is pretty much to die for and the coconut almond chai is amazing. It doesn't get much better than this."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and the food is always great, the people are always inviting and friendly and I leave happy every time. I love how they have over thirty different teas. Best thing about the place is that all the food feels home cooked and personal. Jamila (probably spelled it wrong, I'm sorry) is great! I highly recommend the Fijan Green Tea. Service is a bit slow, but it's just Jamila (sorry, once again) cooking."}
{"text":"Various adjectives are littered around yelp reviews on Algebra Tea House just as the decor of this establishment is equally \"messy\". But hey, it is eclecticism at its finest. I will admit upon setting foot in this joint, I was immediately displaced and yet somewhat cozy, this will be the melancholy you will feel here. Sure, it is a place that will spark good conversation-- warm tea chats, but it leaves something to be desired.  You just woke up and found your dear friend cooking breakfast for you on a Sunday morning, this is the Algebra Tea House experience. The decor is a mix of an unkempt, rustic studio apartment where the food will waft through every nook and cranny. We sat behind a shelf of teas available for purchase along with $25 mugs that you may receive your tea in! Alluding to a decent brunch menu, we went with the toasted pita sandwich and bagel sandwich. The teas were Spice Peach Black and the South African.  Get your jaw ready for some oral gymnastics! The toasted pita sandwich was well-wrapped and stuff with just the right amount of vegetables. Factor in the vegetables, feta, and house sauce... and you've got a nice fresh-tasting wrap. The bagel sandwich was loaded with cream cheese and the bagel was toasted to a golden crisp. The food, on this account, was something to just hit the spot (but not quite transcend).   The tea is a soft spot. While the blends look and smell fantastic, poor tea etiquette is sometimes an aberration (especially when you call yourself a tea house). I'm all for letting your tea sit for desired strength, but the lay person should have a timer to notify removal of the tea bag. This makes not only for a uniform tea experience, but also a dependable one (as you'll know the quality of the tea, and not just how long you've let it steep). The Spiced Peach Black will do you some good, let it sit for a bit for the peach to come through. The South African will make love to you with its lavender and rose hips.  Algebra Tea House's redemption comes in a simple menu with a simple presentation (as disorientating as it may be if you're used to Starbucks). They in the least include a little plate to let your tea leaves sit when they're done steeping. But I suppose that is the allure of this place, you leave your worries behind and warm up in the cozy atmosphere. Its distance away from busy streets gives it the semblance of an oasis of comfort in a busy world. Maybe that's just what you need, and some good warm tea. Go in, have a sit and sip."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting in my rental car, outside my hotel, unable to check in. The wifi connection is horrible, so I whip out the iPhone app, Yelp \"Free Wifi\" and find this place. Sure, why not?  What a great Yelp find! This place is just awesome. I wasn't expecting the produce stand, the retail teas and tea-ware, the awesome decor, or the super great service. But that's what I got!  I had the peach tea and it was just right!"}
{"text":"Wow, color me surprised. I was expecting another charbucks/phoenix coffee cookie-cutter place. This blows UH-Arabica out of the water without a fight.  My date and I spend 2 hours playing chess while the barista hung out and had oranges and beans cooking on the fireplace. The time flew by. An enclave of peace and warmth.  The coffee was good (if a little cold) at 7:00p, and my date loved her tea. She said the date filled pastry left something to be desired.  But I have not seen a coffee house of this caliber since leaving the West Coast. Everything in the place feels \"organic.\" It is like wandering into David the Gnome's tree and hanging out.  I wish, as Chris said, I found this place earlier into my time at CWRU.  Just an excellent tea/coffee house nestled away with a toasty fire and good music playing.  I'll be in back playing chess if you need me from now on. Shall we play a game?"}
{"text":"Such a creative decor. Warm and friendly staff. Ordered the zaat we zeet, and the Mother Earth tea. The tea was fragrant and refreshing. Pita was fresh and warm. Overall a great experience. Would love to visit again. The mugs were custom hand made."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have VERY high standards when it comes to coffee houses, as I was spoiled by the world's best one in my college town. So I guess take this review with a grain of salt, if you please. Soo there was good and bad. While a bit scatterbrained, the barista was friendly and helpful. However, when I received my drink, the mug it was in was very oily? Or greasy? I wiped it down with napkins but it was still greasy, which isn't a great first impression of the cleanliness. The place was actually rather dark, lit only by natural sunlight coming in the windows. There wasn't very much seating, and I ended up on a verrryyyy low chaise covered in a very dirty and crumby blanket, and using a bench as a table. It's not a place that's very cozy or easy on the eyes. I did, however, like the bathrooms, and the clientele is great for people-watching. I'll be back to give it the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Algebra is the hidden gem of University Circle. The food and smoothies are incredibly tasty -and- healthy, with a warm and comfortable environment for working and studying.  Best part is it's all incredibly priced for students on a budget."}
{"text":"This is our go to brunch spot on the weekend. As a vegan, it's nice to find a local place that feels super home-y and has a large variety of drinks and food! Our favorites are the ful madames and Syrian tomatoes, both of which are served with warm and fluffy pita. The service is always quick and very friendly and I love the eclectic vibe."}
{"text":"I usually question why I eat here as I leave the door.   The food is good, but not great. Their kitchen setup is sometimes questionable and leads to a long wait time.   My last experience was pretty poor. I ordered the basic breakfast (potatoes, eggs, bacon, and toast). The potatoes were a tad over seasoned and the eggs were burnt. I probably won't be back for food.   Their tea and coffee is pretty decent but over priced. Smoothies are good.  Decor is horrible in my opinion....."}
{"text":"This place is laid-back, friendly, and \"different\".  Definitely not your corporate coffee-house.  Delicious, fresh food...staff is chatty and genuine.  Ambiance is calm and peaceful.  I love the way the interior is decorated.  In this place, you feel as if you are a guest in someone's earthy home...no rush here."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here I decided to check this place out for a lazy weekend breakfast.   Quirky hole in the wall place - check Boho ecclectic vibe - check Great place for hanging, studying with college students - check Nice, quirky college age staff - check  I did a stupid thing, though, I went to a tea house and ordered coffee.  I also ordered the French toast.  For these two items, I was much better off making them at home.  My French toast was made out of cheap white bread and was limpy and flaccid.  It was sad, and the coffee to wash it down with was no better.  BUT they did serve real maple syrup, which was appreciated (seriously, we are in OHIO, serve real OHIO syrup folks).  So all in all, for my culinary needs, this place did not meet them.  While this place has a vibe that is cool, I am just a decade too old to appreciate it for all its splendor."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma salad and the hummus falafel plate along with a mug of tea, it was outstanding! Great funky atmosphere, almost like someone's living room. Authentic feel and flavor."}
{"text":"This is my second review of this place and I'm writing it because I am just SO sad.   Algebra holds a very special place in my heart. It will forever be one of my top three places to be in Cleveland. The atmosphere is cozy and rustic and away from the norm of other coffee shops. The food is absolutely fantastic and beautifully prepared and priced well. I respect the owner and his artistry so much and that only adds to my sentimental attachment to this place.   However, the last two times I've gone, both with out of town friends to show off, I've left with a bad taste in my mouth. It breaks my heart to feel this way, especially after 8 years of great experiences. In the past, I have been more than understanding of the slow service. Most of the time, there is only one employee working and they can only do so much. But the last two times, the girl acted like she didn't want us there. She was so cold and unfriendly that it made my friend and I want to rush out of there because we felt SO unwelcome. But the biggest blow came from the unexpected pulling of my very favorite coffee in the universe from their menu. I left that day shaking my head in disappointment and disbelief. I really hope this place steps up its game."}
{"text":"For one, they don't have coffee here.   Second, the Wifi didn't work.   Third, they did not accept my VISA. All in all I did not like this place and wasted my time trying it out.  this place was dark, dirty and cramped there was no where to spread out and study.  The girl at the counter was nice.  Just not my scene."}
{"text":"The tea was good. While I was there, I manage to get an Iraqi kabob, which was fresh and delish. The kabob in portion size was very decent and the price was not too bad.  Will be stopping back."}
{"text":"To add to what others have said: it is *such* a comfortable environment. So cozy, homely - even with (or because of) the strange, eclectic art and furniture. The many friendly regulars that are always here contribute to the comfort. Also, the BEST smoothie I've ever had. This is because they make it with rose water (often used in Indian deserts). And it's different every time, depending on who's making it, what's available. I've been there for breakfast once, which the owner - Amin (?can't remember) - prepares for you. I ordered a plate of seasoned tomatoes, feta, olive oil, and basil, with pita..... more delicious than you can imagine They also have the usual eggs-and-toast. And you can enjoy your breakfast at the counter, chatting with the chef/owner. (Breakfast only on Saturdays and Sundays though)"}
{"text":"The place is sooo intriguing, and so far from up scale, but so homely too. The food was fresh and spectacular, the tea was delicious, and the atmosphere was so cozy i didnt want to leave."}
{"text":"Very unusual and fun. Skip it if new experiences frighten you! The atmosphere, with handcrafted furniture and artistic wooden plates, is like someone's attic: not dirty, just kind of crazy. Tables at all different heights, including cushions on the floor.  I'm no tea expert, but as for the food: best falafel sandwich I've had!"}
{"text":"Great place to explore different types of tea and the culture behind! Had Libyan tea for the first time! Very exotic and tasty! Definitely will come back for more tea and coffee!"}
{"text":"I was expecting to like Algebra Tea House - it was recommended by my fiance's cousin (who is awesome), and I LOVE tea. When we arrived on a freezing day after Thanksgiving, we were enamored by the cozy, eccentric, and fun interior. Shelves are filled with bags of loose leaf tea to buy, handmade mugs, tea accessories, and some grocery products, including an Israeli spice mix. Various tables and chairs are scattered around, mostly in the back where a cast iron stove had a nice fire going.   We ordered tea and settled at a table to chat with a friend who had arrived a few minutes before us. He already had tea and a sandwich (which he said wasn't that great). Our tea arrived and despite letting mine steep for awhile, I took a sip and couldn't taste anything! I was really disappointed because the description had intrigued me. Oh, and I was cold, so the warm water was not as helpful as it could've been.   I will say that I quite enjoyed the bathroom - funky door, and hand lotion for customers too! Very necessary during the cold, dry days of winter. And at least the girl working there was super nice and friendly, and chatted with us when we found out that she was originally from the Philadelphia area. Would I come back? NOPE."}
{"text":"I could probably just hang out here all day everyday if I didn't have to work. I may start working here actually. Not for the place, although it would be a cool place to work. The guy who was working there today was a really nice guy. I tried a couple pieces of the white pizza and really liked it. I had the turkey wrap and it was awesome. The coffee was great also. I am glad that I finally tried this place. It is probably one of my favorite places that I have been in a long time. I wanted to take a nap on the little bed looking couch chair thing. This may be my favorite coffee house in town. I hate to say that because I really love the staff at E 9th Phoenix. There is just more food here and it is very relaxing to hang out. There also were not any of the banker guys from the Federal Reserve that I cannot stand hanging out here."}
{"text":"A really unique eclectic place - but not in a bad way at all. Really friendly workers who even offered up a slice of warm pumpkin pie for free. I love places with a huge loose leaf menu and this is one of those place - they also sell their loose leaf tea. Their hand made mugs and tea pots make every cup unique and special and some it looked like were offered for sale. A fire place in the back just added to the homey feel and the amazing smell in the air of fresh homemade Palestinian soups and dips. Seating is a mix of random chairs and couches all arrange in a manner encouraging conversations and lingering in the shop which offers Free WiFi. Street parking was easily obtainable on Black Friday so I image any day perhaps aside from the Fest should not be problematic. This is a few blocks south from Mayfield Road hill but isn't too far to include it in your walk around Little Italy."}
{"text":"I love the inside of this place.  I had my first date there and I will choose it for other dates! It just made you want to set around and relax.  Plenty of tables! Nice good hot Chi tea!"}
{"text":"Very eclectic. It's my favorite place to get work done b/c I feel inspired. They also have a cool wood burner. Sights, smells, sounds... all come together at this place to create a true experience all it's own. 5 stars for that alone.  5 stars also for the coffee drinks, expertly crafted and well priced. I haven't found their coffee concoctions elsewhere. Root tries, but just isn't as good.  They do operate on the honors system when you order, so you just go to the register at the end and tell them what you had. Quite honestly, I'd rather just pay right away, but I appreciate the novelty.  We did wait for our coffee for a while, but the relaxed atmosphere made me feel like a jerk for being so impatient.   I really really love this place."}
{"text":"how much stuff here do they microwave? I literally watched the waitress pull my coffee right out of the microwave and bring it to me..."}
{"text":"Nice to experience once if you never, but terrible service. We waited for 1 hour for Kebab and the guy just gave excuses no apology when I actually went up to see what was taking so long."}
{"text":"I really like a lot of things about Algebra Tea House, and I'm glad that it's held on and stayed open despite the fact that it barely advertises (you can't even really see the sign on the front door unless you stop and look hard). It's definitely an asset to the Little Italy neighborhood!  Don't come here if you want to study and focus and be really studious. You won't...well, you might if you have no appreciation for cool art, random musicians that come in and jam, affectionate cats that wander in from time to time (at least the last time I was there), and other types of phenomena that are far more interesting than anything you're studying (unless you're a humanities major...but since there are like 4 of them at Case...) Come here if you want to enjoy a great cup of coffee and feel like you're cool and artsy and such. There's sketch books in which one can draw, games to play, and so on. It's a very rich multi-sensory environment!  This is a GREAT place to end a date that begins the Little Italy area. They have a variety of beverages, both hot and cold, so there's something for everyone. I really enjoyed the Palestinian Coffee.  The only problems I have with the place are: 1.) The seating isn't exactly comfortable--they have chairs in a variety of bizarre shapes--some resemble tree stumps with absolutely no back support, and others recline to the point where you're almost lying down--this can make life really difficult when you're dressed up! 2.) The beverages come in cups that contain slightly more liquid than a Dixie cup. I really, really, really don't like going to a place where I feel like I need to drink or eat abnormally slowly so that I don't finish far before everyone else. Since the prices are a tad higher than usual, one would expect a bit more, y'know? To be honest, this is the no.1 factor that keeps me from going here regularly. I am exaggerating a bit, but seriously...the portions here make a Tall-sized beverage at Starbucks look ginormous.   Oops, I just compared this place to Starbucks...I can already see the rotten fruit and vegetables that are being thrown at me by the purists around here who think that going to Starbucks is like committing heresy, so I better finish and get outta here."}
{"text":"This place is the SHIT!!! And I think Weezy F. Baby said it best, 'Long hallways, I got 10 bathrooms I could shit all day N----'. This is the most legit coffee/tea house I have ever been to in my life, and at the risk of throwing down too many musical references early on in this review, Algebra Tea House is 2 legit for Hammer. If you're looking for Starbucks stop reading now, at The House, as I have affectionately named it, you won't be forced to order triple frapa capa half dongin insert obscure awkward rhyming shot of espresso McDouche with a twist, and you won't be forced to pay for it either. The best part of The House, the most expensive thing on the entire menu is $6.50, with most Coffees and Tea's reppin' right around 3 bills. The Wednesday Special, Vegetarian Couscous, is choice, and is currently still contently roaming the depths of my bowels in the epic search for sphinctoric glory. It was delish, if I may. I heart the abreve. The Iraqui kabob brings more noise than Cleveland bitchin about Lebron, the butternut squash soup is Herculean, and the cappuccino, espresso, and almond coconut sage tea can be classified as no less than orgasmic, literally messed myself upon tasting. Where else in Little Italy can you walk in, sit on a beanbag with a little oak carved table in front of you, drink a bit of tea, and have a conversation with a hippie boy from Case about eating a sock? I contend, Nowhere. Check out The House kids, its tighter than your little sister. Truth."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for long.. The food is unique and ambiance and interior decoration is cool and trendy.. The owner of the place is friendly and pricing is affordable..."}
