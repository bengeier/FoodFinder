{"text":"It was almost closed when we get to the place after picking up my husband from the airport, we were just wanted to get some desert, We came in and greeted by a gentleman at the door as he let us pick our table, the restaurant environment is inviting, some tables are custome made and blend it well with the rest of the interior we offered menu, and looked at them, the gentleman ( turned out to be the chef and owner) explained to us whats on the menu, finally we convinced to order main course, I ordered Cajun marinated Lamb Chop and my husband ordered Grilled garlic chicken leg, the presentation was excellent and lamb was excellent so does the chicken my husband ordered, the chef let us tried different type of home made original Srilankan bakery ,  ALL OF THEM WERE DELISH, we will definitely coming back for more"}
{"text":"Great Food ! Great Service ! This place really has ambience. I want to recommend this restaurant. Definitely a five star place !"}
{"text":"The chief is very passionate and creative. Great experience everything we had was great. The flavours in all our dishes were unique & tasty."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews! It's a quaint place with very nice decor, the server was very attentive and knowledgeable. The presentation was beautiful,  all the food was expertly prepared and fresh.   There are several Western choices on the menu to suit everyone but we were happy with the traditional Sri Lankan items."}
{"text":"This place is great! We went on a Saturday which probably wasn't the best idea as they only have a buffet available and I would say it's more catered to the western pallet than the Sri Lankan food I was expecting. However, what i did have was absolutely delicious and having grown up with a Sri Lankan grandmother and father, I can tell you that this place is as authentic as it gets in terms of flavour and spices. The environment is so warm and homey. Almost as if your sitting down to dinner at home with your family. The owner is very nice, extremely friendly and personable. I'd swear he was part of our family at some point and if not, mind as well have been. The wait staff and other chef were all incredible but I would say this place will need to expand or change locations soon as there was very limited seating and groups of people waiting outside the restaurant to experience this cultural delight. I would recommend going during the week as you can order off their menu and I can almost certainly guarantee you will not be dissatisfied. This is my first time at this establishment, but my other family members have been here almost every weekend since they opened. And they are extremely picky so that says a lot. Defiantly a 5 star place, I gave it 4 because of the lack of seating and not being able to order from the menu on the weekends."}
{"text":"Went to Cuisine Cinnamon, since my colleagues recommended the place. Had an egg kottu, ulundu wade, cutlets, Sri Lankan rolls, egg roti, vegetable roti ( elawalu roti) for lunch. Everything tasted so perfect. Presentation was perfect and neat. I think it was Chef De Livera who served, he was very attentive and polite. I had been waiting for a while to visit this place, since I've been missing food from back home. Definitely will be visiting again, especially on their Saturday night dinner buffet. Keep up the good work!"}
