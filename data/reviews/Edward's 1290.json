{"text":"A friend and I both had the Huevos. The food was tasty enough but the portion was tiny. Equivalent to 1 small taco with 2 fried eggs. My sausage was cold. They wouldn't let us split the bill or payment Only one could pay. Weird."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO! 
Such an awful experience! The place was not even busy and still we had to wait for an hour and 20 minutes for our food. While we waited, no bread in the table. We literally had to ask for the coffee every single time. When the food came; it was below mediocre and all things we asked to replace were wrong. We had people with allergies in the table which was unacceptable. The bill took other 20 minutes to come which made this 2 hour experience even worst. Seriously; WORST place I ever been in leslieville. If you're even considering, try Lady Marmelade, Okay Okay or any other brunch place around. The menu is also very restrict. Have you heard of a french brunch place that do not serve any type of eggs Benedict? Well they don't... #worstbrunchever"}
{"text":"We had had a pleasant enough brunch at this restaurant a few months ago and thought perhaps dinner might measure up. Wrong.

We needn't have reserved; the place was empty but for one table. The main occupants of the room were loudspeakers pounding maniacally for almost no one. Diners are at the mercy of the manager's taste in music: wailing saxophones and other unsuitable noises.

The cooking here seems amateurish, almost home cooking but not really professional. Fries were overcooked, roasted peppers tasted canned. Beef shortribs merely average, lacking the rich taste one finds in bistros around the city. (Try Le Paradis or Avant Go√ªt, for example, if you can get in.) The pumpkin pie was not bad, with candied walnuts.

This is a neighborhood restaurant, a bit far from the centre of the city for a casual dinner. You have to make an effort to get out to Queen East to taste this food."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic but the food sucked. My boyfriend ordered the chicken pot pie.  He didn't even eat it. He hid it inside the omelette that I didn't touch :)
I had the portabello and red pepper omelette. It was just ok. I also had an order of home fries and they were swimming in grease."}
{"text":"The other reviews are correct that the menu is unique (i.e. you won't find 5 kinds of eggs Benny.... or any at all). That said, the selection is extensive. Everything we had was well executed and set it apart from other brunch spots. Service was friendly and efficient. Music was great. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I have been about 5 times for dinner and have had really consistent experiences here. I can easily recommend it for a nice bistro experience."}
{"text":"I've been debating between giving this restaurant a 3 or 4 star review. 
Here's why I'm sticking to 3:

The price. Food was good. But it wasn't great. For the price (the bill came up significantly higher than, say, my new favourite spot for brunch, \"Lady Marmalade\") and the fact that the portions left me barely satisfied, I'd expect something significantly better tasting.

With that out of the way, service was good, the place itself looks clean. Nice decor and a very chilled atmosphere. Good music.

About the food: Was it bad? no, not even close to that. But it wasn't outstanding. Not a place I'd be going back to anytime soon - the menu didn't leave me with anything I'm curious about trying."}
{"text":"I found the food to be only okay, but I certainly expected better given the prices. Got off to a rocky start when they were sold out of what I initially wanted to order (was not told of this fact until I tried to order it). I had a Caesar, which was more ice than anything else. It was pretty lame. 

For breakfast I had the omelette special, which was made with cream cheese, chives and smoked salmon. It was good, nothing special. I also switched out the salad for \"homefries\". I use homefries loosley as it was just a bunch of underseasoned potato chunks of varying sizes (everyone at the table who got them mentioned that they were underwhelming).

Unlikely that I will be back, too many better options around."}
{"text":"By far one of our best breakfast joints on the east end. We have been coming here for over 7 years now and are always satisfied with the high quality food and friendly service. We make sure we arrive early always before 10am and do not have issues with lining up to find seating. By the time we are done with breakfast and on our way out we usually pass a long line-up waiting to be seated.  Overall great place that is family friendly!"}
{"text":"Tiny sausage, not a lot of ketchup, some potatoes flying around and an egg covering grilled bacon : it was my full monty brunch at Edward Levesque.

It could have been a little bit more sexier for a 15$ brunch. Two sausages would have been great for instance. A bottle of ketchup could have add some fantasy and make my potatoes happier. You know how much sausages and potatoes love ketchup right? 

The coffee is terrible in north america anyway so I was not expecting something amazing. It was coffee and you can order liters. 

The sweet charming piece of love came from the 6$ orange juice: not tiny and just fresh and tasty. I love oranges. Thanks Florida.

Two stars for the full monty brunch. 

If you go there, bring your sausages"}
{"text":"Edward Levesque makes a most excellent brunch in Leslieville! Some have bemoaned the lack of menu items that don't feature eggs, but happily I'm always in the mood for eggs!

I had the poached eggs and italian sausage with chili sauce, sundried tomatoes and hash browns served on cornbread which eagerly soaks up all the deliciousness and provides just a hint of sweetness to balance the chili sauce.

Me and my compatriots split the delicious flourless chocolate cake for dessert, it's not even close to Terroni's though.  The coffee here is fantastic, really smooth and mellow flavour but still a strong cup. Also, check out their mint tea, it's a teapot full of fresh mint and is absolutely delicious.

Everyone was really friendly and attentive, and we were quite happy with the service and the meal.  We ate very well for under $20 all-in, and I would recommend Edward Levesque's for anyone looking for a great breakfast in the city.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"A group of four of us went here during Winterlicious. We had plans to go elsewhere, but decided that we wanted to support a local, non-franchise, operation instead. Firstly, street parking on a Saturday was FREE after 6pm - which is almost unheard of in the city. Score 1.

We entered the restaurant and were greeted by the hustle and bustle of the open kitchen - something that was a draw for me whenever I drove past this place, and I also knew my brother would dig it as he is trained in culinary arts and also digs the energy and transparency of an open kitchen concept.

In a nutshell, the appetizers were absolutely amazing. Delicious, flavourful, and unique. The mains were mediocre -- lacking the robust standard of flavourful that the appetizers had set, and then the dessert came back to redeem the dinner on the whole. I'd definitely like to try the brunch out one day, and would likely return for another dinner experience (when they aren't dealing with the rush of Winterlicious)."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sun morning.  Got there ~10am so our group was seated easily. 

Ordered a lamb burger and it was tasty, but nothing stood out as exceptional. 
Latkes were quite good - crispy on the outside and potato-ey-good on the inside.  The side salads were fresh and nicely dressed. Smoked salmon was ordinary - was hoping for something house-made.  Server did not know where the smoked salmon was from or if it was made in house. Others in the party were disappointed with the portion sizes.  And none of us are really big eaters or expect American-sized portions.

As for beverages, the apple cider was essentially warm apple juice with a cinnamon stick. The flavour had not infused into the juice. The water for the Mighty Leaf tea was not quite hot enough to really steep the tea properly so that was a disappointment.

Service was adequate.   Too many other brunch options in the city to come here again."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but I felt so very awkward trying to get in and out of the seats here.  I'm not so good when I'm tipsy, and all the tables just felt too close together, and it felt very hard to have a private conversation when I could easily overhear the couples at the tables on either side of me.  

And even worse, the food was completely forgettable (except the chive and cheddar biscuits--I could have made a meal of them!)  I don't think I'll bother to go back."}
{"text":"This is definitely a roller coaster restaurant for me.  Very high highs and very low lows.  Service is always good and wait times acceptable even on the weekends.  You need to know your menu however.  I have had some excellent food for brunch here - the entire \"poached eggs\" selection is pretty good.  The pancakes are very bananaey and substantial and you can mix and match a make your own from the sides section for about the same price as a set menu item.  So far the avoids are the potato latkes and the chicken pot pie.  Both sound attractive and delicious when you read them on the menu.  Neither lives up to the hype.  Very small portion sizes, dry and completely lacking in flavour.  Not sure what their thinking is on the latkes but after investigation we determined that the pot pies are delivered premade from a third party source.  You may want to order foods that are made on site to avoid a similar disappointment.  I wasn't blown away by the omelette I had once either - not fluffy at all but I only had it once so can't assert whether this is a chronic problem or whether this was a one time flawed dish."}
{"text":"I went to this place for dinner. Although the ambiance is very romantic, dim lighting, jazz music, and not very crowded so kinda cozy, the food leaves alot to be desired.

We ordered the grilled eggplant which was OK. It had some goatcheese and came in the shape of a sandwich with pieces of pear stuffed in the middle.  The whole thing was drizzled in olive oil and drenched with pine nut pesto. I don't recall what else was in it - the whole dish was very unmemorable. Price tag $10.

We then ordered two dishes for the main.  Georges bank cod file cornmeal crusted with lemon thyme/olive oil roasted tomatoes. The fish was fresh and it was crispy. But there was no flavor to the dish.  Very bland. Price tag $21.

We also ordered the duck breast. The meat was ok. Overcooked for my taste. The waiter did not even ask how I wanted it cooked. There was not much flavor to the duck breast. It was much worst than the duck breast from chinatown or what i had in a mom and pop resto in Paris. It was served with a sweet potatoe mash which sage, concord grape rosemary reduction - sounds all fancy but basically it was some weird tasting sweet potatoe - huge disappointment, and a side of dark purple looking sweet sauce - the whole dish was not memorable either.  Edible but nothing to write home about. Price tag - $19.

We also ordered two glasses of red wine by the glass which were decent. 

The bill came to around $85-90. The service was ok.  There are somethings money can't buy, in this case, it was an out of this world food experience.  Everything was meh...very disappointing.

I don't think I will be going back.  I've had better, esp for that price.  I noticed on the way out they had a microwave in the kitchen. Who knows what that is used for. Hopefully not for reheating something pre-prepared."}
{"text":"A group of us made reservations here a couple winterlicious' ago. We got there and they told us they didn't do brunch reservations. A reservation was made with the restaurant and there is no question about that. The only question was when. So perhaps there was a miscommunication, but should our party have been made to feel like morons? The staff were quite rude about it and any sort of \"just make the customer happy, the customer is always right\" was tossed out their pretentious window. We waited to eat and didn't make a big fuss about it, but the way staff and even Levesque himself (who made it quite clear on who he was) treated us left a poor taste in all our mouths. We were actually in awe. It's as if they had to have the last word and make sure we agreed that we were in the wrong. To redeem themselves they would have to live up to the hype. But they failed. The food was good, but not good enough to warrant any snootiness and not good enough to bring me back there. Edward Levesque's is just another average Leslieville restaurant. Not much to boast about, not even the service. I have a much better experience at Joy or Lady Marmalade or even some random pub."}
{"text":"The chef and server were so friendly I really wanted to like the place but sadly the food was underwhelming. First off, I think the lunch menu is sorely limiting if you're not in the mood for eggs or a sandwich. Secondly, we had an extraordinarily long wait for what were essentially three sandwiches for our party on a Friday with just two other tables occupied. I shudder to think how long the wait would be when the place is packed.

I had the lamb burger which would have been fine if it weren't for the cringe-inducing salt bomb of tapenade atop the meat patty. I don't know what was the worst; my too-salty burger, too-herby homefries, or too-sweet strawberry lemonade. The S.O. was similarly unimpressed with his chicken, avo, bacon sandwich.

I would've told the waitress but the third person with us was picking up the tab so I just pretended to enjoy it (and downed about a gallon of water)."}
{"text":"Steak Frites.  The cut of meat was tough and the fries must have had a collision with the salt shaker - shockingly inedible.  The dessert was stale - like, days stale. The waiter denied that it was old - please, I'm no fool.  Luckily they took it off of the bill.  They ran the coffee grinder way too much and made noise counting out change from the cash for what seemed like an eternity.    The waiter was always in a hurry, backing up as we were giving him our order.  Why?  We were there on the early side of the dinner service before the crowds. Presumably he needed to go back to counting his change.  I was really looking forward to trying this place after hearing so much.  So disappointing."}
{"text":"We tried to get into Miss Marmalade on Queen St E, but there was a big line up.
We recalled this restaurant which we tried to get into, couple of months ago, but they were doing renovations.  
So we took our out of town guest and the three of us got right in.  Oddly the owner recognized us from that brief encounter and thanked us for coming back.
Now for the service...most excellent.
Now for the selection..great choice of vegan and carnivore dishes.
Now for the food.
The sausage on my plate was cold.  Not sure if that was the way they serve or it just missed the heat.  The eggs were OK and the home fries a bit mushy.
But all in all the food was good.  The apricot marmalade was a hit on excellent bread toast.
Not overly inventive but met the criteria for a good Canadian breakfast.
We would return though, as the overall experience was good."}
{"text":"I went for a late lunch today and was delighted by the food, service and ambiance.  I don't live anywhere near Queen Street East, but have made a point of eating here at least 4 times a year."}
{"text":"Avoid! Just sent back both meals. Fish cakes were mushy and full of filler and I think my daughter's burger may have actually been off. Huge pile of mixed greens as salad. Does that still have to happen? Have never really had a good experience there yet they still charge a ransom. We are done trying."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night.  Food was AWESOME.  Started with a lamb dish with Moroccan spices, which was very good.  For my main course I tried their steak, which again was amazing.  Cooked perfectly, and marinated nicely.  Have also tried the burger, which was very good as well.  Very good homemade relish, and a small amount of gorgonzola, which was all it needed to make it taste great.  For desert I had the carrot cake, with a chevre icing.  As with the rest of the meal, it was to die for.

Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We received unbelievably slow  service for dinner.  It was 90 minutes from when we sat down to when we started eating dinner, and this was on a night when the place was not even full.

Besides that the food was only average.

Do yourself a favour and go to the Nose down the street instead."}
{"text":"Was there for a brunch for a first time after hearing lots of hype about the place. While waiting in line you can read ravings from various newspapers on the restaurant's door and see their kitchen.
The ambiance is pleasant and the music is good (not that I usually care...but I had to find something positive), however pretty much everything else was disappointing.

- Greeted by a server that was obviously more busy with his self image than the basic service manners (bringing cutlery for example! They perhaps expect you to eat with your hands instead...)
- Cappuccino was atrocious (tasted like a re-heated breast milk with a super-weak shot of espresso). Gross.
- Poached eggs with sausage and corn bread was ok, fresh ingredients, came fast, but even without the chilly sauce you couldn't escape the overwhelming spiciness. 
- Asked for additional glass of milk but of course that was ignored/forgotten.

Might be better for dinner (as other comments suggested), but definitely not a good brunch experience at all. I'm sticking to Bonjour Brioche, thank you."}
{"text":"Nice enough decor and I love the open kitchen right as you walk in. When I stopped in today there was a 10 person line that ended up being a 20 min wait and one of the waitresses was so nice to bring us coffee while we waited. 

After sitting down in the dark, loud back with the overpriced menu this place lost a lot of its charm though. Portions are small, and while the food is tasty, it's not worth paying $14 for huevos or $16 for poached eggs and cornbread. 

I'm glad we tried it but I won't be back - plenty of other affordable diners in the area."}
{"text":"Since it's a long-time favourite, it pains me to write this update.... but I have to agree with so many other reviewers this time around.... our most recent experience was not so fantastic.

We had dinner here last weekend, and so much just seemed off.  Our waitress was a bit odd - she sometimes interrupted mid-story.... other times she would appear so quietly that it would be awhile before we noticed her standing there listening.  She mostly seemed a little distracted, but overall she was okay.

Then, my Mom ordered the guacamole as an app, having had it before and loving it.  But this time, the portion size was teeny tiny, and she said that on previous visits it had been much bigger and better for sharing with others.  Another thing she noted about it, was that it had a 1/2 fried green tomato in it, which filled a large portion of the dish, and made even less room for the guac.  So it seemed like they cheaped out by filling the bowl with filler.

Then there was the chicken pot pie, which I ordered for my main.  It was alright, not spectacular.  But I discovered a large, sharp and jagged chicken bone in my mouth mid-chew.  Very scary in my opinion.  Luckily it was big enough that I noticed it right away.  But I found myself hyper-aware of the fact that there could be more bones in the dish, and couldn't relax for the rest of the meal.  

My Mom and brother both ordered the steak, which were the last dishes to arrive (no problem, we assumed it meant they were hot off the grill), but my brother quickly noted that his plate felt cold and that it was cooling the steak quite quickly - his meal was only lukewarm, definitely not hot.  He felt a warmed plate would have made a huge difference.

It was a good, but definitely not great meal.  I was very disappointed, as I felt Edward Levesque's was a place of consistency.... but clearly it is not."}
{"text":"We came for brunch with friends- and the four of us loved it! The place is cosy and modern at the same time  ( like sitting in a friendly Franch cafe). Its open space gave the chef an opportunity to give us a taste of a new cake on our way out.
The waiters were professional and friendly. 
And the food was mmm delightful to the eyes and taste buds.  Next time  (and we will come again) I will take some photos."}
{"text":"Went to Edward Levesque's Kitchen for dinner last year during the winterlicious event.  As I entered the restaurant the chefs greeted us, which gave me good feeling about the restaurant for good customer service.  But the waiter that served us was just darn rude, he didn't even really wanted to serve us and kept avoiding our table.  I assume it's because we were in our early 20s and most of the guests were older so didn't see us that important.   The food was great, but the portions were pretty small.  I had to go down the street to the a fast food restaurant to fill up my hunger."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday for brunch with 4 friends, one of whom had a small baby. First point of issue was that there was only one highchair available for the whole restaurant which was in use when we arrived which made it very difficult to eat our meals while balancing a baby.

The service started out OK pretty friendly though minor little annoying things like continually putting hot pots of tea and cups of coffee down right in front of the baby despite being asked not to, or providing multiple jugs of cream and only one jug of milk for a table where 4 out of 5 people ordered tea not coffee. On the plus side the waitress was very helpful with asking the chef to do a substitution on one of the dishes.

But all that wouldn't be enough for me to give such a low rating, the number one issue was the food. I ordered the fruit&granola bowl, my friends each ordered one of the poached egg dishes. My dish consisted of cubes of apple covered in yogurt with a tiny, easily less than one spoon full of granola sprinkled on top, not what I would expect from a fruit and granola bowl costing $9, more like a small fruit bowl sprinkled with granola. My friends dishes were all overdone, the eggs were cooked hard all the way through which is obviously not what you want from poached eggs. 
When asked by both the waitress and the manager if everything was OK, we explained our issues with the dishes to which we got an \"oh OK\" from both without any apology or offer of a reduction in the bill. 

As a side note, I don't like when the wait staff clears plates from the table before everyone is finished eating, and then delivers the bill before we have asked for it.

All in all I would never return here, the service was not great but not bad enough for just 1 star, however having problems with all 5 dishes along with the waiters reactions to our complaints was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I randomly ran into Edward Levesque's Kitchen on a rainy day after dropping off a zip car across the street and I am SO thankful that I found this little restaurant. 

The kitchen is exposed at the front and all the cooks are so friendly and welcoming. Not one of them ignored me and they all said hello with a smile.

We were seated in the back and the waitress took our drink orders right away. The interior was home-y and comfortable and the bathrooms were really cute. I had a truffle oil, Stilton, onion and chive omelette that was TO DIE FOR. I've never had an omelette like it before in Toronto. Pretty damn good. Ended with their carrot cake that I wanted to order 5 more times... 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Friday evening meal.  Warm ambiance, unexpected wine selection, pleasant staff (the entire kitchen greeted us on the way in!), and eclectic background music at just the right level for enjoyment and intimacy.  Delicious soup (don't worry, they eschew cream!) and comfort-food special: a thick slice of ham garnished with chives and mustard accent atop scalloped potatoes and green beans.  An elegant Californian Sangiovese to round out the meal.  If this were my neighbourhood I'd be a regular.  But hey, it's worth the drive!  Will try the weekend brunch soon.  Can't wait.  Thank you for starting my weekend off well."}
{"text":"We came here a few years back with a larger group and had a fantastic brunch. My hub and I came again a few months later and dismissed the poor meal as perhaps the chef having an off-day. 

It's been a couple years since and we went back today...clearly for more punishment. He ordered steak frites with a side of eggs, I had a dish the menu called \"Italian Sausage\" and a side order of mushrooms bc my daughter loves mushrooms. 

It must have been the same chef we had years ago bc every dish had something glaringly off: the steak was the size of my 3 middle fingers, which I dismissed since perhaps it was a brunch-size steak ($18). My Italian sausage was about 3 inches long and overcooked to the point that when I cut into it, it fell apart ($16). The mushrooms were cool to the touch and the cornbread muffin was very dry and brittle. We returned both the mushroom and muffin but the new muffin wasn't that much better and colder inside than the first muffin! 

The service was good but the kitchen staff needs an overhaul.  Our fault for going back for a second round of abuse."}
{"text":"We waited for 1 hour for our main course. I cannot even begin to describe how horrible our experience was at this restaurant. Do not waste your money and time. Have a nice dinner elsewhere, where they actually care about your time in their establishment."}
{"text":"Where do I start?! So let's talk about the lack of attention that we got when we arrived and I'm pretty easy going but 25 min just to get a coffee? We waited and hour and twenty min to get out food and the orders were not correct. At this point I was still patient cause you know things happen but DO NOT LIE TO MY FACE AND TELL ME THAT THE KITCHEN IS BACKED UP WHEN PEOPLE AROUBD US WHO CAME IN AFTER US HAVE BEEN SERVED, EATTEN AND ARE READY TO PAY THE BILL!  All four meals would have taken me 20 min for me to cook at home. It's not rocket science its two orders of omelettes and two orders of bacon and eggs. The owner came to us and told us he would comp our coffees and I'm not one to look for something free but really the coffees come on now. The story changed at the end and the chef lost out order. To get the bill took another 25 min and the place wasn't busy at all. I will NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER go back to this place again and I don't recommend that you even try it. $15 for lame bacon and eggs that came out cold. If you want good brunch you are better off to go to Fran's Diner or Cora's. Five thumbs down for this place."}
{"text":"It may be a case of too much hype but I'm sorry to say that I wasn't over-the-moon in love with Edward's. 

Don't get me wrong - there are a lot of great things about Edward Levesque's.

When you first walk in, you are essentially standing inside the bright, open-style kitchen. The service was excellent. - friendly and attentive. The no screaming kids policy was quite alright with me. The banana pancake now has a special place in my heart, as does the thick cut bacon that came with my 'all day' breakfast. Although 'sharing' is prohibited, I was happy to say that my admission that we were sharing the pancake was well-received.

But there were a few things I simply expected to be better, especially for the cost of brunch for 2 ($45 incl tip). The home fries were pretty weak - no taste, not crispy, bland potatoes. A total downer for the 'all day' breakfast plate. The drip coffee was pretty great as far as drip coffees go but I was surprised to see that they were $3 a pop. Ouch. My bf had the 'special' smoked salmon omellete and commented that it was good but probably not $14 good. He had a caesar as well, but you only needed to look at the glass to know there was a hell of a lot of ice in it...

Overall, I wanted to like it more than I actually did."}
{"text":"I had planned a 10am brunch on a Saturday, which doesn't leave a lot of options in Toronto. After reaching out on Twitter people had told me that Edward Levesque's was good but the chef was crusty. That doesn't bother me at all, a lot of people are really nice but that doesn't mean I'll pay to eat their food.

I was also told that the wait staff were very nice. And this is true, our waitress was very nice and always over to refill water and coffee. 

The food was...meh...

I ordered the sage polenta topped with a poached egg and a side of portobello mushrooms. Overall the dish was underseasoned, and I would have given them leeway thinking some people are adverse to salt and pepper but the portobello mushrooms were so bland.

A friend ordered sliced tomatoes with herbs but the tomato was so overripe we couldn't eat it. The person slicing it had to know. To our waitresses credit she asked us why we hadn't eaten it and when we told her it was too mushy she took it off the bill. 

My other friend ordered the pancakes which were supposed to come with some sides that never appeared. Overall she said it was okay.

It was a decent meal but none of us will come back. Perhaps the dinner is better and that is why it gets such rave reviews? I'll never know."}
{"text":"Used to be a loyal regular customer and I always took my out of town visitors there for brunch/lunch.
Liked the choice of good quality meats and eggs and was willing to pay for it. As well, the waitress, Christine, who's no longer there, was amazing.
However, the last time we visited we had the worst service imaginable...the waitress rolled her eyes when we asked questions and made no attempts to help us order when an item was sold out and she just appeared soooo bored. 
When the owner came over to the table I asked him why he was no longer offering the good quality meat and eggs, he responded that he got too many parking tickets when he went to pick them up and that no one else delivered that quality.
We were stunned. So the prices stay the same and the meat is from china town? Parking tickets?! Seriously?
I was in the restaurant industry for 20 years and I do have an understanding of the cost of good quality food, but his explanation was ridiculous. 
Edward also speaks to his kitchen staff like they're his slaves and he does it in front of customers....!!!!!
We're saying goodbye to you Edward."}

{"text":"We went for dinner based on a recommendation from a local friend (we were visiting from the US).  We had a very nice dinner.  The beef stroganoff was especially delicious.

{"text":"We had brunch here this morning because we happened to be in the area. At $12-14 (not including coffee), the standard breakfast offer of eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes is pricey. My boyfriend found the portions on his meal wanting. I found it extremely strange that they served a tablespoon of ketchup in a tiny dish for 3 people, but they were happy to bring more tiny dishes of ketchup when we asked. Service was lovely, but given the price and portions, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was here for brunch of the weekend with some girlfriends.  My phone had died so didn't know that they'd changed the time to a half hour later so was stuck waiting.  That part is not their fault, however not having anyone offer me anything until I flagged someone down and asked for a coffee is. Once my friends arrived the service picked up, however I still didn't love my food.  

I'd go back if someone wanted to meet there but I wouldn't be the one suggesting it."}
{"text":"Okay so the name isn't exactly inspiring and the signage has no real draw, but somehow I still ended up eating brunch here on a Saturday and am pleased to report back that the poached eggs on briney lentils and sourdough bread was actually really great.

{"text":"I'm not an unfair reviewer. I will say that the food was tasty. There was a small mistake with my order but it was corrected right away. I chalk this up to the servers and the folks in the kitchen who were all very polite and helpful. The real problem with this place is Chef/Owner Ed Levesque.

I have no doubt that the poster who used to work there is being absolutely truthful. I was shocked by Ed Levesque's overall attitude. From his comments to our attire when we walked in the door (why yes, we did just finish a run) to his out right \"NO\" when I asked if we could have the bill split in two...I can't remember every eating somewhere that had such an ungrateful, rude, childish chef/owner. 

I think the menu restrictions point to just how arrogant and unaccommodating this chef/owner is.. Have you seen the \"All Day\"??? Two \"not poached eggs\"....I've never seen that on a menu before, so when I asked the server about this, assuming it was some clever way of describing some unique new way of preparing eggs I was a little surprised for find out that it just meant I could order eggs, two eggs, and I could order them any way I wanted....expect poached. Why on earth would someone put that kind of restriction on a menu?  So I asked if they had poached eggs on the menu and the answer was yes, I just had to order them on the side....ummmm.....what?!?!? 

I can honestly say I will never go back to this restaurant. I would much rather spend my money at a restaurant where a Chef who loves to cook is actually grateful that people enjoy his work. 

I'm very relieved that he changed the name to \"Edwards 1290\". I'd rather not have the name Levesque (which is also my last name) associated with such #$@&*$@##"}
{"text":"Been to Edward's three times since we recently moved here.   First time I had the Meatloaf as it is a Friday special, it was absolutely wonderful, it is made with beef from a special organic farm.  Cow is slaughtered on a Wednesday and the beef arrives on Thursday.  My friend had the seafood pasta, he said it was delicious.
Second time I came with my husband on a Sunday, I had the coq au vin which was superb and he had Seafood Risotto which he loved.
Just returned and just had to have the Meatloaf again, this time my husband had to have it to see what I was raving about, he was very impressed.
Edward certainly knows how to deal with seasonings and how to pair flavours.  The Wardolf Salad and the Beet Salad are both delicious.
We'll be returning every week and want to try their brunches, which are a huge favourite here in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Sorry, I just don't like it here.  The food is probably worth four stars, but I just never seem to enjoy myself here.  First of all, the space and the music are way too serious for me to take seriously.  Second, everything that comes out of the kitchen is not quite what you'd expect.  

For example,  steak with garlic potatoes and asparagus turns out to be a steak with a little bit of a sauce on top that is extremely garlicky.  The sauce it turns out is made with potatoes.  The asparagus is basically a garnish.  Who needs to mention a garnish in the menu?

This restaurant is too clever for it's own good.  But you might feel differently, and really, I don't want to dissuade you.  Go.  Forget this review.  Enjoy the place.  I'll be elsewhere."}
{"text":"Such a bad experience!  We had to wait over an hour for our food because they forgot to put our order in. When it did arrive, the food was average at best. Their steak frites was something I easily could have made at home.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, I had daily special for brunch which was steak with sunny egg, ok nothing special... French toast was good also"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as part of the Summerlicious promotion on a weeknight.  The restaurant is small but not overcrowded.  The decor was a wonderful collection of drawings and photos from the past with a mix of modern art.  The service was prompt and efficient from both the waiter and the owner Edward.  We enjoyed a lovely glass of prosecco to start  with our appetizers.  I enjoyed the cold beet soup and my husband the sardines.  Both excellent, full of flavour.  Our main courses were amazing, a chicken Fattoush and Seafood Risotto. The risotto had small scallops and shrimp in a delicious sauce of lemon thyme just bursting with flavours.  I ate every bite and could have licked the plate.  Dessert was a rhubarb cake and lemon mousse, but elegant and delicious.  

Portions were just right, very European, not the giant American sizes.  We did not feel rushed or hurried which is a pleasant change from most restaurants.  Perhaps because it is a weeknight.  

We are looking forward to returning and trying the full menu again another night."}
{"text":"I so want to like you Edward Levesque!  You're in my 'hood, you're local and you have this great intimate space, but I've been there three times now and have been disappointed the last two times.  Today I had the 2 poached eggs with lamb sausage ($15).  The eggs were totally overcooked - the yolks were solid.  The best part about poached eggs, imo, are the runny yolkes.  Why bother poaching if you cook it through?  I also found the bread soggy from too much of the lentils.  The only redeeming item on this plate was the sausage, which will nicely grilled and deliciously sesasoned.  The last time I had the pancakes and found them super soft and not worth the price ($11).  Too bad! Maybe dinner is better, but I doubt I'll go back for brunch."}
{"text":"We had a great branch at this place. We loved the fresh orange mimosa. We will definitely go back!!!! We'd like to try dinner there next time.  Everybody should try this restaurant. They use really good ingredients here."}
{"text":"After reading a number of excellent reviews I brought my father who lives in Leslieville out for lunch.

When we walked in, there was no one to greet us. The kitchen is open so I asked if we should seat ourselves. He responded with a terse \"no, wait there\" and waved us away. Ok... 

Our waitress was not on her game. She left us for long periods of time, did not replenish water or coffee unless asked and even that took an eternity. 

They were running a prix fixe menu that sadly had run out of a number of the items. I settled on the hanger steak (medium rare) and frites and my father had the Shepard's pie. The Shepard's pie was very good but I had to send the steak back as it was well done and the frites were cold. The second steak came back medium rare and was very tasty.

I really liked the decor, it was cosy and well appointed. 

With as many restaurant choices as there are in Toronto and now more closely in Leslieville, I am not likely to return until I see reviews indicate that the inconsistencies in wait staff and food have been address.

For now, adieu Edward."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! Went here for a late lunch with D and another friend of ours who lives in the Beach 'hood.

SO GOOD! It had been a couple of years since I had been here, so I was excited when our chum suggested it! The updated-retro decor & atmosphere can't be beat, and you've GOT to love a place where the servers aren't chipper. I HATE chipper servers, especially at breakfast-oriented places. UGH.

I couldn't decide... so I went for 3 sides: the sweet & sour roasted root veggies, the sauteed mushrooms, and the flat-top potato cakes with sour cream & chives. D had the Cumbrae's sirloin burger with onion marmalade on a sesame challah bun, and our friend had the jerk angus strip steak on grilled pita with avocado, two eggs over easy, roasted tomato, chives and olive oil. All three of us LOVED our meals and agreed ELK would pretty much become our go-to hangover place when we're partying on the East Side.

The fries (which I didn't even order... just totally stole from the boys!) are particularly noteworthy. Well done to perfection, not too greasy, not too salty (leaves room for one's own taste), YUM! The tarragon mayo it comes with isn't my fave, but tarragon fans would no doubt be in heaven!

I also ordered a Cappucino, which was unexpectedly one of the best I've had in some time. 

It loses a star for slower service than I like to see, because my mushrooms were greasy, and the bathrooms were totally gross."}
{"text":"Leslieville is part of the city that's getting more and more face time and for good reason. It's an area rife with independent businesses and unique eateries. One of my absolute faves is Edward Levesque's Kitchen. There is an actual Edward. He says hello to you when you walk in. And he has really really good taste if the food is any indication. 

We like coming here for weekend brunch though dinner is equally as awesome. As always, it's sheer torture to pick just one thing to eat. French toast stuffed with honey and ricotta? Chipotle steak and eggs? Italian sausage with corn bread? Now you see my predicament? *faints*

Also, they serve really good coffee and juice (try the strawberry lemonade!) and serve you real maple syrup.  And they also have a decent wine selection.  

One other thing, ELK tries to support local growers and farmers and all things sustainable. 

Whichever you pick, you're sure to be pleased."}
{"text":"I've read some of the previous reviews about Edward's here at Yelp and I can see that the restaurant has had some issues. I have been a regular at Edward's over the past couple of years and I've come to realize that for me it is dinner only at Edward's. I don't care for the lunchtime menu whatsoever. As a previous reviewer said, if you aren't in the mood for eggs you are pretty much SOL. 

The night time ambiance at Edward's is far more enjoyable for me. Edward, I think more than anything, is just one of those misunderstood sort of fellas. He comes off as being somewhat of a cranky prick, a bit standoffish but as time has gone by I've grown quite fond of him. He is the only restaurant owner I've ever taken a bottle of wine to as a gift, appropriately it was called The Hermit Crab. What I really like about Edward's is that almost every single time I've been there for dinner over the past year the menu is different. It is a one sheet menu and it changes constantly. 

Most recently we took some friends for dinner to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. Right from the get go everything was good. The wait staff was attentive but not in your face. Like the menu the wine list also changes. We ordered the McManis (I love this wine) which is an easy wine to drink! Apps included the grilled calamari which were tender, not rubbery, a Moroccan ground lamb spread over a grilled pita with pomegranate seeds and some arborio rice balls with Tallegio cheese in the middle of them. Everything was delicious. 

For the mains, two of us ordered the Skirt Steak with rapini and smashed potatoes and the other two ordered the Lobster Risotto. Meat was cooked perfectly (we both ordered medium rare). This has been one of the short comings for me at Edward's. The minute the beef goes to full medium I have no taste for it whatsoever. It's happened to me a couple of times at Edward's and I've spoken up about it. Even passed comment to the kitchen on my way out. The Risotto was lovely, tons of lobster meat, in large chunks. As usual I was a snappy happy and have attached a couple of pics of the mains. Ultimately though my most favorite meat dish at Edward's is when he does a Pork roast. It is often stuffed with dried fruits, sweet potatoes, cumin, coriander and glazed on the outside. It is a thing of beauty. My other compliment to Edward's kitchen is that after suffering through years of my Mother's beets (gag) I have found enjoyment in them again. Once, with the pork, I had glazed roasted beets in three different colours, absolutely delicious and sweet. 

I will continue to be a regular at Edward's. I will continue to take friends their for special occasions."}
{"text":"I have been a few times and unfortunately I have to agree with other reviewers that things seem to be going downhill. The food is still great and the service is good, but only when you can get their attention. It's so packed for weekend brunch, they often are rushing and not attentive if you want to order or pay. The atmosphere is ok but you have to be fine with being packed in and they can't seem to decide if they are techno cool or chique as evidenced by the often way too loud music. Hope it goes back to being a bit more family oriented."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years (mostly because they seem to be closed whenever I walk by).  We had brunch here the other day.  It wa delish!  I ordered the full Monty which came with everything!  The toast was thick and nicely toasted.  It came with roasted tomato, mushrooms, eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage and beans!  My DC ordered the huevos ~ she lived the bread that was a thin pita like thing but tastier and arced with all the huevos toppings.  Definitely worth stopping in to experience!"}
{"text":"there must be some large window in the roof (cant think of the right word now) or perhaps it's the colour of the walls, but i always feel fresh and happy when i walk in here.  (is that a commercial for..?)  anyhow, the food is wonderful -  i think ive only come for brunch and i always  look for a place that has some new take on the standards and this place does, like the banana, tahini. yoghurt and oj smoothie or latkes topped with smoked salmon and cream cheese.  Or perhaps youd prefer your eggs with truffle oil (it comes with other stuff but hey, i just say yes after the words truffle oil appear).  Be prepared to wait for brunch on the weekends as this place is well known in the neighbourhood and about halfway between lesliville and the beachs."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food.   The double-smoked bacon is one of the best uses of deceased pig I have ever tried.   A wonderful menu full of interesting and exciting creations that make for a noteworthy brunch.

It's brilliant that you have to walk by the kitchen first.   An excellent way to be introduced to a foodie restaurant.  The chefs say hello, which is also a nice touch.

The ambiance in the restaurant itself though is somewhat lacking.    The crowd feels somewhat like a Norman Rockwell painting come to half-life.  

The place feels kinda like a goyisha version of United Bakers."}
{"text":"Overpriced. The best thing about the was the interesting menu. Servers couldn't follow instructions even though the staff was light. Their salad was sorry pieces of wilted lettuce with a lemony excuse for a dressing . Bland fish cakes and an unscrambled eggs...won't be back..."}
{"text":"I liked being greeted by the chefs the minute we stepped through the door.  It set my mood for the morning, and I had a feeling our brunch experience there was going to be just lovely.  Unfortunately, my psychic powers failed me.

I wasn't impressed with the food.  I ordered the waffles w strawberry sauce, whipped mascarpone and wildflower honey.  It came as a singular waffle, quite small, with a single dollop of what was more like strawberry jam than sauce in the middle.  Crowning this was the mascarpone, which somehow had a powdery texture to it.  I was actually concerned that perhaps it had spoiled, and I promptly scooped it off to the side.  The waffle was rather tasteless and heavy.  No idea where the wildflower honey was used.  I tend to think it was left off.

My brunch partner loved the bacon on his order.  I'm a vegetarian so I can't vouch for it personally, but I feel it's only fair to mention that the bacon has a good rep.  Maybe I ordered poorly.  Who knows?  

The back of the menu is quite amusing, and lists one or two popular memes (web and otherwise), such as \"Unattended Children Will Be Given an Espresso and a Free Puppy\".  It's a welcome distraction from the decor.  The deep yellow on the walls, and the framed sepia pictures hanging on them, made me feel like I was in a late 70's department-store tea room.  The tables were lining the longer walls of the room, but this created a very wide gauntlet down the centre of the dining area.  It felt awkward, like looking at a painting with too much negative space."}
{"text":"The chef is excellent (though i heard he's a bit of a bad ass).

Went for brunch. Found the food to be really good, the menu was exploratory, a play on traditional, fun, and tasted phenomenal. Be warned though, the portions are hugeeee. I highly recommend you and your friends also share an order of the savoury tea biscuits to starts. 

The menu changes monthly, so I'm not going to bother listing out  what my group and I ate/shared, but i will say, the way Edward prepares his lamb, polenta and pancakes is extraordinary. 

And one more thing. Those jams will touch your soul inappropriately. All i think about is his blueberry sauce and the citrus jam. Damn you E.L."}
{"text":"Great Winterlicious menu. The food was perfectly done, not too much not too little. Love the intimate atmosphere"}
{"text":"- no brunch reservations (clearly posted everywhere) - no substitutions (footnoted often) - no children (overtly implied) - 

The good:
- Standard \"All-Day Breakfast\" was made with top quality ingredients.  The bacon was thick and crispy - either they cut it themselves in-house or they get it from a great butcher because it's the thing I enjoyed most about the meal.
- Breakfast has everything - hashbrowns, toast, bacon & eggs (not poached - I didn't ask because I feel like they don't want you to ask - but I wish that wasn't the footnote that affected me) and all of the ingredients are of farm fresh quality
- I like the actual restaurant; walking past the open kitchen on your way in, the space between tables, the professional wait staff.

The bad:
- I didn't love the hashbrowns. They are soft through and through. Not the texture I am looking for in a hashbrown.  I want it crispy on the outside.
- We didn't notice the extensive breakfast-alcohol drinks menu until we had already ordered juice.

I will definitely go here again, looking forward to trying dinner. Brunch is only Friday, Saturday & Sunday and there are no reservations."}
{"text":"2.5 average

Everyone seems to agree about this place. It is not worth it. There are many other brunch places around. Why the heck did I pick this one today? At least at 2pm there was no line and food was fast to come. One of the waitresses was nice, one was not and not helpful. I did not find egg benedicts on the menu. Bread, eggs, etc were not more than ok. Frites and aioli are good... but you want more from a brunch place. 

I hate false leather blanket [skai]. So noisy when you move :)"}
{"text":"went for brunch Saturday. Great french toast on challah bread with awesome berry compote.
boyfriend had eggs with smoked trout and salad that was great too.
loved getting coffee while standing in line. nice touch
line up was about half an hour long but i waited because i saw the lovely food being made. decent prices and nice brunch. not going to line up like that Every saturday but once in a while worth it"}
{"text":"Best steak and frites in the city. Fresh cuts of beef from Tweed, Ontario, arrive every Wednesday."}
{"text":"I walked into Edward Levesque's Kitchen on my random A Day of Leslieville. Turned right on Greenwood and Edward Levesque's Kitchen is the first decent looking eatery that was still opened for late lunch. The chefs busy working in the front was the another reason that pulled me in.

Tuna Melt ($7) has a generous serving of green salad with a light dressing. The open face sandwich itself was light with just a touch of cheddar cheese. The ingredients were fresh and I felt healthy after eating that!

I found the lighting a little dim for a lunch/brunch..but overall it was a great experience!

footnote: they ran out of the multigrain bread and substitute with something else...."}
{"text":"Have dined here several times over the past year. On occasion the food and service were very good and sometimes the food could be better. This time we invited some out of town friends to join us for Winterlicious and made reservations for a specific table a few weeks in advance. Upon arrival the desired table was not available and we were told that it was the computer's fault as it assigns tables (ridiculous). Food was fairly good but we have had much better at this place. Very bothersome was the Winterlicious wine list which described type of wine and country but not the name - when served the wine comes in a carafe (even when ordering a full bottle (what are they hiding?). On leaving our friend took a photo only to be abruptly told by the owner/chef that he does not like that. We have noticed his abrasive attitude before. We understand he studied cooking at George Brown - however it is obvious he must have missed the 'public relations' class. With over 7000 restaurants in Toronto we will dine elsewhere from now on."}
