{"text":"Stumbled into Katz Deli, which was tucked away in a food court next to a McDonalds, and had a wonderful lunch of L' Ancienne Smoked beef.  Our waitress, was very helpful, and the place reminded me of one of the old deli's in Cleveland Ohio my family used to be regulars at back in the 70's. Old Fashioned smoked beef was described as more seasoned than regular smoked beef and it had more of a corned beef spice than a pastrami flavor.  It was one of the best smoked beef sandwiches I'd had.  The bread was very fresh, and it came with a heaping portion of wonderfully cooked pomme frittes.  The cole slaw was lackluster, but the pickles were very good-vinegary and salty.  We also had the chopped liver was came as two large scoops with crunchy, burnt onions-burnt being a positive description, as that's a typically deli staple, and they were crispy and a perfect compliment to the liver.  Molson Canadian on draft, and you have a perfect lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the last year. Once to eat in (tuna sandwich and fries) and twice ordered from take-out counter (smoked meat and a club sandwich on those occasions). Service is fast and courteous, prices are not unreasonable. Now to the food- the tuna sandwich was totally not special- a can of tuna drained and emptied onto plain white bread with iceberg lettuce (add your own mayo and salt n pepper for flavour). Will not order this again. The club sandwich- looks one way in the picture they have up, arrives looking different- toast was overdone and crunchy leading to sandwich falling apart of a bite. Chicken was not too dry but almost. Asked for extra mayo (Miracle Whip) and was given another one of those too small packaged mayo thingies...bringing the total free mayo count to what is probably three tablespoons. Not enough!  The coleslaw was incredibly not special and was a tiny paper cup of the stuff- not as depicted. In their picture of the club they show a full half or whole pickle- my club came with one small slice (cross section not lengthwise) of pickle. Disappointing. The French fries are clearly of the frozen variety and not very tasty, just greasy. The only thing I've had from this place I liked was the smoked meat (old fashioned of course) but without good slaw, a decent sized serving of dill pickle...and fresh cut fries it falls short.  If you go just get the smoked meat and a coke. (But they only serve Pepsi).  Expect to pay 12-15 bucks for a drink and a meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but not amazing smoked meat sandwiches - the  Cherry Coke was good.    One thing that I liked about the place was the atmosphere - the place seemed like it was straight out of a 1970's NYC movie - all that was missing was a Chock Full o' Nuts luncheonette next door."}
{"text":"Bien situé et propre, mais dégueulasse. Pas d'autre mot. De la nourriture en can réchauffée et hyper salée. À éviter."}
{"text":"This place could be awesome if they only paid more attention to details.   The establishment is clean and the service was acceptable.   I ordered a super smoked meat plate that comes with fries, a small container of cole slaw, a pickle and a soft drink for $10.25 before tax. That's about $5 less then the going price at the better quality delis in Montreal.   The smoked meat was really very good. Not too salty and it melts in your mouth. The bread was fresh as well. If a sandwich is all your looking for then order it by itself and you will leave happy.   The fries were horrible. It seemed as if they were blanched but never cooked a second time. Oily, half raw and tasteless.   I didn't even try the cole slaw. It had been sitting for so long that the paper container it came in was falling apart and there was a brown crust forming on the top. The pickle tasted good but it was not fresh and the snap had gone out of it.   As I mentioned, if I had ordered only the sandwich this review would have been very different."}
{"text":"Understaffed, poor food and terrible service. Go somewhere else as this place is just a waste of time. We were looking for some smoked meat and thought this would be the place but it looked bad so we ordered pizza. Quite possibly the worse pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"When it's nice outside, Montrealers run out and play, this goes for lunch time also. My favourite Deli was PACKED because of said nice weather. So we headed of to Katz Deli at the Place Ville Marie. Because we wanted a Reuben Sandwich and that was the plan we were sticking too.  The place looks like it must have looked 40 years ago but it's clean and maintained and looked like every generic restaurant looked like when I was a kid but it had this nostalgic feel to it.  Now there's not much to say here because we had our grub and left. It wasn't a culinary exploration of any sort. But they had a twist on the Reuben Sandwich which I didn't expect but I loved it anyway.  They made it an open faced sandwich where you have the usual Russian dressing, the krout, the smoked-meat and then a heaping pile of cheese the whole thing is salamandered until the cheese is nice and toasty, some fries are added and raw veggies.  Making things better... they have CHERRY COKE. Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.  Reuben's remains my kick ass Deli but this was definitely a tasty twist I wont shy from biting into again."}
{"text":"Katz est un petit comptoir et un restaurant de plein pied, à l'intérieur de la Place Ville-Marie. J'y suis un occasionnel lorsque je veux un smoked meat sans avoir à me rendre sur St-Laurent, chez Schwartz. Comme Ben's est fermé depuis 2006 (snif snif !), c'est peut-être le seul déli du centre-ville immédiat qui existe encore. Deli 500, sur Sherbrooke, n'est pas meilleur non plus. Katz, c'est bon mais... ordinaire, sans plus. La salade de choux est un peu trop mouillée et servie dans des petits bocaux en papier. Les portions (grosseurs) de smoked meat sont, disons, moyennes à faibles. Le badigeonnage de moutarde est pauvre et le pain est moyen. J'ai vu mieux. J'en fais des meilleurs chez moi ! Malheureusement, il n'y a aucune différence véritable entre les diverses sortes de viandes proposées i.e. les différentes cuissons proposées... à l'ancienne, etc..... On peut espérer mieux côté assaisonnements. J'aimerais comparer avec le Katz New York, pour vraiment voir si c'est de la paresse culinaire ou si le constat se fait aussi à New York. On possède quand même les meilleurs Bagel à Montréal !!!  Katz is a small food counter in the Place Ville-Marie food court. I'm an occasionnal client when I want some smoked meat but don't have time to run on St-Laurent, at Schwartz. Since Ben's closed down on 2006 (snif snif !), it might be the only Deli left downtown. Forget Deli 500, on Sherbrooke, it's not worth any trip. Katz is nice but it stops there, ordinary, nothing more. The slaw is served in tiny paper cups, too wet. Meat portions are, let's say, average to small. The mustard spread is almost none on average bread. I've seen much better. I make better ones at home ! Unfortunately, there is no difference between the choices of meat cookings offered on the menu, old fashioned, etc... Seasonnings should be better. I would like to compare with Katz New York and see if it's a general lazyness or just a local thing. Anyway, we (Montreal) have the best Bagel in America !!!"}
