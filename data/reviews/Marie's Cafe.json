{"text":"What  a great place in the  Medina Square. The food is fabulous and the prices and very reasonable ,,, you must try the Eggs florintine!"}
{"text":"Eat here about once a month. What's not to like? They know how to cook eggs and such, and the menu offers some interesting brunch items. The decor is easygoing, service is prompt (consistent with food cooked to order) and prices are very fair for a nice meal. Weekday mid-mornings, you will often have the place almost to yourself. Bad for them, good for you.

I like the place and will go back often."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning - just happened to be in Medina!  Oh my what a breakfast!  We had the best chicken chorizo hash and eggs Benedict.  The food was incredibly flavorful yet light.  The service was great!  The only thing that would make it even better would be a richer coffee!  We will go back even though it is a bit of drive for us!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just the best breakfast in town. It can get busy so be prepared to wait, but in my opinion as long as they keep bringing me coffee it's worth it. My only complaint is that they aren't open on Sundays."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped in here for lunch today.  I have been in most all the restaurants on the Medina square except this one.  It is spacious and is quite a relaxed atmosphere.  In fact the sign on the wall says, \"Sit, Relax and Gossip\".  In front near the big window are couches and a fire place.  The waitress just brings the menus then after you decide what you want you go up to the counter and order and pay.  The waitress brings the food out to you at your table.  I had a bowl of Hungarian chicken and dumpling soup and a vanilla latte'.  It was delicious and was presented nicely.  The coffee was GREAT!!!  My sister had a grilled cheese sandwich on 9 grain bread that had been grilled in garlic oil with swiss cheese and tomato.  She says it was the best grilled cheese she's ever had!  It was served with a nice green salad.  It sounds like they serve a great breakfast too.  I will certainly go back.  I want one of those grilled cheese sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"Again, have only eaten breakfast here, but the food is good and the staff is friendly.  The prices are a little higher than Eli's for the amount of food you get, but still relatively cheap.  It's cleaner in appearance than Eli's, but haven't had any concerns/issues yet at either place.  Again, typically walk over on Saturday mornings, and normally a decent crowd as well."}
{"text":"At first this place was hidden but when I finally ate there it was amazing! The grilled cheese is my personal favorite and the chicken Waldorf salad is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great service from friendly people.
The space is clean and organized, while the food is great. Also, they have some epic coffee!"}
{"text":"I was excited to have lunch here, because my Mom lives in Medina and recommended it and there was a Yelp deal.  It was worth it because of the deal and the menu was promising for healthy and veggie goodies.  But the expresso machine was broken, and I had been looking for a coffee drink, so I was disappointed there.  The lemon on my water glass smelled like it had been sleeping with fish.  The meat in the chicken soup was tough and too large for the soup.  I mean, nice that it was white meat, but the pieces should have been cut smaller.  I had a veggie wrap, and it was good, but I was not pleased with the wrap (seemed thick and dried out).  My friend (a picky eater) had a pork sandwich, and she enjoyed it; it was tender and they met her requirements (no mushrooms, no mayo, no this or that).   Now all that being said, it is a sweet place, and I would try it again.  Great location right on the square and the waitress was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place. Only 2 servers working lunch on a busy day. Poor ambiance--very tired looking, with mediocre food. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great find in the cute little downtown area of Medina.  You walk up to the counter, peruse the quite extensive menu for a little cafe, and place your order.  They'll bring the food out to you.  The decor is a bit spartan but what really made me smile was the collection of old cookbooks in the bookcase.  I checked out a few recipes from Germany, Italy, the West, and Mexico.  It took me back because it reminded me of the old Grand Diplome cookbook collection my Mom used to keep on top of the refrigerator...anyway, I digress...I ordered the Falafel wrap and a side salad.  I have been on a hunt for good Middle Eastern food so I figured what the hell, right?  Well, it was very good.  It was perfectly spiced and refreshing at the same time.  It was obvious who ever was behind that recipe knew Middle Eastern flavors well.  After I finished eating I complimented the girl behind the desk and she told me the chef's wife is actually Lebanese.  Bingo.  That explains it!  Large portions, good prices, and a cozy little fireplace.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We visited the town of Medina (about 30 minutes southwest of Cleveland) one afternoon in 8/05 and had a very pleasant late lunch at Marie's Cafe.  Marie's had just opened five months beforehand and it's a husband-and-wife operation (Brian & Mary Hilberg).  Brian's brother-in-law did the plumbing, one of his brothers did the legal work and another brother provides the coffee beans.  Marie's is named for Brian's grandmother, who died the previous December.  The café is a cross between a gourmet sandwich shop & a coffeehouse - and our sandwiches (grilled vegetarian wraps), dessert (a big peanut butter brownie which we shared) & coffee were all delicious (also filling).  There's always a soup, salad & sandwich of the day and they rotate through *40* different soups.  They don't have fried foods, and prices are reasonable.  The interior is a good size and also charming; it has big windows looking out on the village square, beautiful dark red walls, and even (two) sofas & a fireplace - really comfortable, and the type of place where you could sit & relax for a few hours.

Medina is a county seat - and the village square is surrounded by four short blocks filled with cute little cafés, shops & various other (small) businesses.  It also has a few historic old buildings, including a courthouse and a (former) fire station."}
{"text":"I was sad with my experience at Marie's.  I chose this as our breakfast place due to al  the great Yelp Reviews.

Service was sub-par with a waitress who looked like a deer-in-headlights every time I asked a question.  She couldn't keep up with the refills and I had to flag down the other server for some help.  I never thought we'd get our check either.  

My mother, who is NOT picky, stated, \"It's pretty bad when you screw up breakfast.\"  I have to agree.  Its a shame as I love breakfast and was really hungry.  The coffee was crap.  There's nothing more to say about it.  My mom got an omelette which came with potatoes.  She said they were flavorless and not worth eating.  The omelette I took from her face was mediocre.  I ordered the Eggs Florentine and was underwhelmed.  Overall I wish I had skipped the place and gone elsewhere.

Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great food and service even though its just one person. Went there for lunch and ordered a salad. Trust me literally one of the best salads ive had, really good quality of food apart from Taste and preparation. Also tried the hummus, it was good but could have been better. Good Ambiance as well. Must go!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, the menu had some creative options.  The service was slow because there was only one waitress to help the whole restaurant.  When we arrived, there were three tables ahead of us who had already ordered or were eating. My husband and I waited close to 40 minutes for a breakfast sandwich and a breakfast burrito.  We would give this place another chance if they hired more staff and did some remodeling.  The overhead fluorescent lights and red walls do not create an inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great place to grab lunch.  Food has been great every time we have visited.  I only wish they were open for dinner and offered more seating."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. The atmosphere was friendly. There place was very busy. I ordered a blt. The bacon tasted like microwaved bacon--and it tasted a little funky. I did enjoy the bread-- sorta sweet and perfectly toasted. The tomato was mealy and tasteless. 

I had a side salad. The greens were tender."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is one of the best in Medina! I would recommend Eggs Florentine. It sounds odd on the menu, but tastes awesome!! My only complaint is that the service is always very slow compared to the business of the restaurant. However, the quality of the food is usually worth the wait."}
{"text":"For the past year, I have assumed Marie's Cafe was like every other greasy spoon in Medina.  Boy, was I wrong.  Sorry about that, Marie's.

My friend, Rachel, suggested MC for our brunch date last week and I obliged.  I mean, some days food is food.  That day I was recovering from a cold and not feeling my best, so I was glad she made the decision.  

When I walked in to Marie's, I was a little confused by the set-up.  I assumed we would be sat in the quaint dining area first, but the hostess explained the 'order & pay at the counter and we'll bring you your food' system.  Did I miss a sign or does everyone just know?

The menu at Marie's is exciting and includes a wide variety of flavor combinations and prices.  I was so pleased to look up at the 'specials' board and see the word 'confit.'  I had no idea that word existed this side of Cleveland!

Between the two of us, we had the eggs florentine, oatmeal, and blueberry cornmeal cakes.  Everything was perfectly prepared, but I gotta be honest.. I could live on those blueberry cornmeal wonders.  Somehow they slip in the most subtle (yet rewarding) bit of cream cheese in each little cake!

Marie's, you are my new culinary muse."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Had scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries with grilled onions in them and rye toast. I wish the coffee was hotter. They keep them in warming carafe's and they don't stay hot enough! I wish they had regular pour sugar containers because we had to keep asking for more sugar packets and we never had enough. 
Other than that, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in town square.   I had the BLT, which was great as it was served on grilled bread, but had very little bacon, and also had a ton of garlic aioli sauce.   I reeked of it all day long.   My husband had an omelet, which was extremely dry due to the small amount of cheese.    His home fries and sour dough toast were good.   

We wanted to like this place, but it turned out to be nothing special.

Service was very good and prices were a little on the high side."}
{"text":"This is our most favorite place in Medina!  Best breakfast in town.  Amazing service and even better food!"}
{"text":"Grilled cheese is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Get it. You can even order it for breakfast. Breakfast burrito was decent too, about what you'd expect. 

But that grilled cheese....."}
