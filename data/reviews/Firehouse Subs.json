{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and if you are looking for a good meatball sub, come here, but, YOU MUST ORDER THE EXTRA CHEESE, or you are missing out. The new sweet and spicy meatball is good too, has a smoky flavor"}
{"text":"Too bad there's not a zero stars option.  This was my first visit to Firehouse and I will not be back.  I ordered a medium veggie sub with no cheese - to go. They asked if  wanted to add cucumbers or green peppers to that. Huh?!  I asked what comes on a veggie sub, if not veggies?? I then told him to give me every veggie they have.  Got back to my office and unwrapped the sandwich I just paid $8 for - and found it was a lettuce sandwich with two slices of tomato and about half a black olive.  Seriously.   I will try and add a photo to this review.  Save yourself the hassle and go to Sandwich Masterz instead.  Everything I have had there has been fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches ~ subs. The freshest ingredients and an awesome variety of hot sauces to try.     The kids have fun mixing up their own soda flavors."}
{"text":"First time having FHS. The on-line ordering made placing my order a breeze.  When I got to the shop, I was pleasantly surprised. Very spacious, clean and bright. The team was very friendly. My sub's were ready when I arrived. I got the large meatball. My wife got a turkey sub and my son got a chicken ranch and bacon. Very high quality and fresh and very tasty. I will definitely be ordering from FHS again."}
{"text":"The cherry limeade is awesome. And as far as the sandwiches go, I've yet to try a bad one here. I don't know that I can say that about any other sandwich chain.   As a chain started by firemen, hot sauce is supposedly a running theme here. Over on the side is a case of various hot sauces from around the world. Some of the hot sauces are delicious, some are off putting, but I really don't know that the hot sauce adds anything to their sandwiches. To each their own I guess, but it's safe to say you won't be disappointed by Firehouse Subs.   Be sure to put it into your rotation of places like Subway or Quiznos."}
{"text":"Gotta Love Firehouse!  The #10 smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket is to die for!  Love It!"}
{"text":"The Veggie Sandwich was awesome!! Also loved the assortment of hot sauces available to use. Really cool place with good food."}
{"text":"I walked in at lunch rush and was extremely disappointed.  I first went to the men's bathroom.  The toilet would not flush and the paper towels were out.  I came out and told the person who looked like the shift leader/manager and she just shrugged me off, totally unfriendly.  I realized that they were understaffed and it was just two employees working which is probably why the customer service was terrible.  I ordered the food and it was good but if the bathrooms are that bad, I can only imagine how bad behind the counter it might possibly be.  I hope they get their act together.  Customer service is what keeps people coming back-anyone can make a decent sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! They have hot subs with great bread and loaded with meat. My favorite is the cheddar brisket. Try it the way it comes. I stop every chance I get when I'm in the area. My husband likes the New York steamer. It's the way to go if you are a pastrami lover."}
{"text":"Firehouse is my favorite sub place. The hot subs are absolutely scrummy: I recommend the Italian. The service is friendly and fast. Maybe the only drawback is a very crowded dining room at lunch time. But that's a good thing for a business! I'll be back--many, many times."}
{"text":"I got a meatball sub from this location, and it was excellent.  Location is very clean, and staff was very friendly.  They have an online ordering option, so my food was ready to go as soon as I arrived.  The only negative is that is a bit pricey.  Over $10 for a 12 inch sub and beverage.  Not a ripoff since the food was very good, but still a little higher than I'd like to be paying for a sandwich."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches, but the service is horrible. I've been there 5 times since they opened and every time our order has been messed up. Tonight we waited 10 minutes for someone to greet us because the employees were watching a basketball game on tv. Plus they didn't give us a bag of chips, cookie, and drink we paid for. This is typical, something is always missing or wrong. It's still the best sub place in Cave Creek since Bad Donkey closed, but the employees are very sub par. Don't expect to get all you pay for, and it's not cheap for fast food ($45 for a dinner for 3 and a kids meal).  Would be an excellent sub shop if they had competent employees."}
{"text":"Yay finally they are open! I have been waiting for this sub place to open since it is hard finding a decent sandwich place.   As you walk in, it looks like a regular sub place but it's red and I guess gives the firehouse look. The staff greeted with \"welcome to firehouse sub.\" They were very helpful with what was the best seller sub and add-ons. The Hook & Ladder Sub (combo $7.78 sub $5.59) is the best seller sub which has hot smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted Monterey Jack. Even though the Hook & Ladder was tempting my stomach wanted the Firehouse Steak & Cheese. The Firehouse Steak & Cheese (combo $7.98) has hot sauteed sirloin steak and onions, melted provolone, bell peppers, mayo and mustard. I added mushrooms with it and asked them to take the mustard out. I have to say that it was oh so yummy! Also, if you order a kids menu ($3.69), my daughter enjoyed her grilled cheese with her red fire hat.   I would most likely be going here again and try all the subs since they sound all tasty."}
{"text":"If you want a warm sandwich in the winter, you'd better take it to go! Come in from the 40 degree weather and sat in a/c with a hoodie and jacket on. Fingers and nose frozen with a/c blowing on me! I couldn't even enjoy my meal.. If I decide to try this again this season, I will update my review. If I were a fireman, maybe I could endure the extreme but I'm not 'har har har'!!! I'd also concur with some other reviewers to say the place was dirty and there's nothing that pisses me off more than a restroom with no paper towels. Try washing your hands in this freezing place, having to open the door with your hand (I can't deal with germs) then going out into the cold restraunt with wet hands!"}
{"text":"The best turkey, bacon, ranch sub I have ever had. The service is friendly, the store and bathrooms are very clean and I've never had a bad experience during any of the times we've come in. I have recommended Firehouse to all my friends and hope their experiences are as awesome as ours have always been."}
{"text":"Club on a Sub. So good. Soooooo goooood. Ask for extra pickles, trust me. Friendly staff, wait time is negligible (and worth it.) Brownies and cookies are good too. Love their tea and that coke freestyle. Yummmm."}
{"text":"Their variety of hot sauces is the best.  Most people don't go for the hot sauce but I say bring on the heat!  You can't beat the oven baked subs either."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for lunch while running errands. I ordered #5 sandwich which was a Turkey breast, bacon ,cheddar cheese, lettuce , tomato on white roll.The roll was fresh and perfect.The turkey was sliced thin and a generous amount,.melted cheddar and fresh tomato and lettuce.bacon was just ok.Overall my sandwich was close to perfect.My husband had the cheese steak on white roll.He thought it was one of the better steak sandwiches he has had.We will definitely return.A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I have weekly chemo right down the street from this location and live about an hour away - I have been dying for a delicious sub lately. I took a drive and came across Firehouse Subs. I see online that many people complain about the \"unison greeting\" of \"1012, Welcome to Firehouse Subs\" - while at first I thought they were just calling out someone's order number, then greeting me, I heard every employee say the same thing to everyone who came through the doors. Before leaving, I asked the manager about it's significance - it's a standard real-world firehouse greeting to let everyone know that someone has entered. I love it!   When I told the young gentleman at the counter that it was my first time there, he smiled and explained how everything works and helped me to find just the right thing for me. I was asked several times by different employees if everything was great for me. Again, I love it!  In just a few minutes, they brought my food to me at my table - using my name...I love it!  I tried the New York Steamer sub - very fresh and flavorful! I love it!  The place was super clean, as well. Everyone was constantly working and the manager (I'm guessing she is maybe the franchise owner?) was interacting with everyone and directing them as needed. I love it!  She told me she hopes to see  me back and to please spread the word about them...building brand loyalty - I love it!  I WILL be back - every Thursday afternoon after my chemo appointment...why? Because I LOVE it!  Kudos to the management and staff :) Great concept and great product! I love it!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out this place with a co-worker of mine, I will be honest..I did order something though I was not interested in eating but what I ate was the philly cheese steak (I believe that's not the name they have up there but similar ingredients :D). I originally wanted a meatball sub but however since I do have food restrictions with pork (Their meatballs are consisted of beef and pork), I could not order it and was pretty bummed. The sandwich I had was alright, I will definitely come back when I have a taste for subs. It was a little dry but not too dry, everything seemed to taste good."}
{"text":"On the search for the best sandwich shop in Vegas, I'm a huge fan of Mr. Pickles in N. California and so far they haven't been beat or matched.  This place is good though, it reminded me of a hot really fresh Subway Sandwich, I got lost driving home ( have I mentioned that I just moved here?) And the sub was still warm so I bet it would be amazing fresh and hot.  I will be back to try others."}
{"text":"Our party of 8 was welcomed by a great staff. They were very friendly & the food was yummy!  The manager came to our table to make sure everything was satisfactory. She gave our youngest a Firefighter hat which he loved! Great service and a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"Super slow service. It really took 18 minutes to make a 4 inch sandwich and I was the only person in there."}
{"text":"Ok went to jimmy johns and Firehouse subs to see who's tuna sandwich is better. (For my taste) I know your thinking who goes to firehouse for tuna? This guy does. Plus the lady working the counter was like \"odd two people ordered tuna today.\"  They both cost about the same.  Ok first off lets go by how fast food came out. Jimmy johns wins. those dudes pump those things out like nobody's business. I pay, and boom sandwich in hand. Firehouse I had to wait a bit longer but still didn't take too long.   Taste is a toss up. I preferred the actual tuna in the jimmy johns. It had more crunch from the veggies. Now firehouses one held up better because the bread is softer. I feel like my teeth are not sharp enough to bite thou jimmy johns bread sometimes. And when my teeth finally get thou delicious bread, it decides to leak white fluid that will smell and look like all sorts of body fluid.  (You take ur pick.... They all dry white....)   It's hard to pick a winner because I want to say the flavor is better on the JJ, but I ate more of firehouses. Just because it was easier to eat . I don't want to go about my day smelling like tuna. I'm can't tell you why but i am leaning to jimmy johns don't know why. But still both are leaps and bounds better than subway. Time to go find a breath mint to wash down the shame that is this review. Do people even read these?"}
{"text":"I had their subs for the first time recently. Quality is so much better than a subway or port of subs...or Jimmy John's which I won't eat since the founder poaches elephants."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly.  We paid nearly $35 for two medium subs with one drink + chips and two kid combos."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD can these people make a sandwich. I was at a tournament in Las Vegas and my teammates and I desperately needed food. I found this place with my phone and I am so glad we went here!   The Sweet and Spicy Meatball sub is absolute heaven. I also tried some sort of chicken sub and substituted the mayo for honey mustard - it was amazing. Yes, we went to this place twice in one weekend.   There is also a great soda machine here with over 100 flavors to choose from. If you like your food on the spicier side, there are a number of hot sauces at the end of the counter that are rated 1-10+++ on the hotness scale.   The establishment itself is very clean, and very much like one would imagine a firehouse back in the day (minus one of those awesome poles). The staff were all very friendly and seemed really amused at how excited I was about their food.   If I could, I would eat there all the time. Firehouse Subs, please make your way down to Southern CA!"}
{"text":"The laundromat is next door to Firehouse Subs. It was around 109 degrees today. So we put our clothes into the washers and go outside to have a smoke. There are maybe ten empty tables out front of the sub place, we sit at the end table.  As we sit we talk about if we want to go in and grab something to eat now or wait until after the clothes are done. When a worker comes up and asks if we've been helped yet. My sister says \"No\" then the worker says \"Really??? So what you're just going to sit there and not order anything!?\" then mutters \"F***ing A**HOLES\" Great customer service. Now we *are* never going order anything. All it would have took was a \"can I get you a menu\" or \"can I help\" or \"just go in when you're ready\" but no your worker was a total jerk. I mean I get it, there are almost always homeless people around there or at the least sort of shady looking people hanging around, you don't want loiterers hanging around making a mess and taking up customer seats. But it was 109, no one is waiting to eat outside... in fact there were only two people inside, hardly a rush. You would have had four more customers today if you had any sense of customer service. Now you've lost four, and our friends and family, and got this review. I can't say what the food was like since I never made it inside and have zero plans to ever go back.  EDIT- I am willing to upgrade my rating to 3 stars from the 1 star I initially gave it. The owner replied to my rating which goes a long way toward mending my opinions of the staff. Maybe one day I will get to try the food and edit my ratings further."}
{"text":"We recently purchased the brisket and cheddar.  They were wonderful!   Best we have ever eaten.  It is higher than Subway but they are really not in the same catergory."}
{"text":"Sub shops are peculiar.  There are so many chains, they must find a hook to stand out.  Frankly, too many sub shops in this area appear a little too spartan, and possibly unclean.  Service usually makes me think that the employee has been on the job only a few days and already hates the owner.  This Firehouse seems to stand out as an exception.  It is very clean, and service is efficient and exceptionally friendly.  The food does not really rise above expectations, a creation designed to appeal to a low common denominator while keeping costs down.  But that applies to all chain sub shops, and this Firehouse, at least, is better than the competition (but see my review of the new Publix across the street)."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket sandwich!  So tasty. Service was excellent also & the tables were all clean.  They were very friendly & Dave made some money saving suggestions. All was perfect."}
{"text":"This week we took our first trip to Firehouse Subs in Chandler.  The staff was very friendly and explained the menu to us since we were new.  Way to on the hiring!  We had the turkey, bacon ranch and the bbq beef brisket sandwiches.  Both were excellent but too much to eat for one person.  Next time we will go with the smaller sizes.  We took leftovers home to the kids so $20 bought two huge subs and a coke.  In the end it fed 4 which isn't too bad.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We visited the Warm Spring location today, and our first time visit to Firehouse sub was very dissatisfying and unpleasant. We order a carry out order and found a long strand of hair embedded inside between the meat and the bread, which was awfully disgusting. We have to spend extra time in driving back to the location for an explanation from the store manager name Stephen. We spoke to Stephen regarding our order and he did not try to solve this issue and simply tell an associate to make us another sub (the SAME ASSOCIATE who probably DROPPED  LONG CURLY HAIR in our sub in the first place!!). We felt unwelcome for showing him our issue on the order, His reaction showed that it has happened before and he was not surprise at all. We did not receive a formal apology from him or his associates. He was giving us bad attitudes and facial expressions, it was very disrespectful. We expect a store manager to be properly train to handle and resolve issues, but his actions showed that he does not care for his customers or opinions in improving food hygiene for this store location.  I believe his overall customer service was extremely dissatisfying. Our only reason for going back to the store was to receive an apology and explanation, not simply remaking our original order. He did not take the time to look at the sub and try to hide his mistake. At the end, we refuse his offer and got a refund. Before this first time visit, we heard great reviews and recommendations about Firehouse Sub; therefore, we did look forward to eat a high quality sub at Firehouse. However, we did not see any of the \"great reviews\" from our first visit. It was a great disappoint!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this location several times and LOVE IT every time! The food is delicious (and I'm not a huge sub fan) and the atmosphere is great. Plus we can round up to donate to emergency services."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Texas and I'm so glad that there's a firehouse near me! This is my favorite place to get a sub hands down. The meats are fresh and the bread is delicious. I will say that the staff was less than.. High school aged kids who looked miserable and completely gave us the impression they couldn't wait for us to leave (even though it was 45 minutes before closing.) that would be my only complaint.. Definitely not bad enough to keep me away from this place!!"}
{"text":"New favorite sandwich shop. Friendly staff, and they've never gotten my order wrong. Also love the Coca-Cola Freestyle beverage dispenser, with more than 120 drink choices. By far the most sugar free beverage choices I've seen."}
{"text":"Omg, talk about taste buds going on a journey of amazing flavors, I had an Italian sandwich and it was AMAZING! Can't wait go back. It was my first time, and staff greeted me once I came in, they guided me through the menu. And my choice was just perfection.  I also had a bite of my friends  steak and cheese and let me just say that alone was also a bite of heaven itself."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Stood for over 5 minutes waiting for someone to greet me and ask what I wanted. Made eye contact with 2 employees and still nothing."}
{"text":"This Firehouse helped out our high school by coming to our after school cool party for our freshmen. We are extremely grateful for their great service and willingness to give their time (and coupons) to us. Thank you guys so much!"}
{"text":"Gross, I should have just  made a turkey sandwhich at home. (How do u mess up a turkey sandwhich?) My sandwhich looks like it was smugled across the boarder in somebody's crotch. Do yourself a favor and have your sandwhich delivered by Jimmy Johns or Jason's deli."}
{"text":"I was super excited that they opened one of these down the street from my house. My parents lived in Gilbert for a while and had one close to them!   The first couple of times we ordered food here lived up to their Gilbert chain except for some slow service. I chalked this up to being a new establishment trying to get their bearings.   Unfortunately the last time we went here was a utter disappointment. My husband will usually pick this up on this way home without any quality issues ( seriously three minutes away from home!) This last time the sandwich was so soggy the bread was just a wet pile of mush. It actually made me gag! Wet bread is the worst right? Yeah, it is for me at least.   I really want to give them another try, but am a little worried about getting the mess I attempted to eat last time."}
{"text":"You have to eat the sub at the store or it gets soggy. They steam it and they are good sandwiches, but the longer they sit the soggier it gets! They have a good variety of sandwiches. They are definitely NOT on the health diet."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Firehouse Subs on the recommendation of my best friend who lives in Utah, so I was happy to discover this location in Henderson, NV.    I ordered the meatball sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the Italian Sub. The meatball sandwich was delicious! The meatballs were tasty and it was a perfect amount of cheese and sauce melted on top. The bread was lightly toasted just how I like, and very freshly baked. The Italian sub that my boyfriend ordered was good, however the oil and vinegar they used was a little too sweet for me.  The restaurant was clean and the people behind the counter were very friendly and efficient. We were in town visiting hey family member, and would definitely go back and eat there again the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"They talk highly about their subs. To pricy for one.Very little meat. Subway still ranks #1 still and thats  sad. no healthy subs either. I also didn't like how the manger was done grating other employees. Very rude to their own employees."}
{"text":"I have been obsessed with this FHS for the last year and a half and have never reviewed. This place is hands down my favorite sandwich joint. The burst of juicy deliciousness when you bite into these subs is simply amazing. Add to that some of the friendliest service ever and a cool Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain and you've got something worth a few visits. FHS, you get an A+. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at this place all the time when I lived in Florida. When I came across this place I had to hit it up. I loved it so much I went back three more times while I was in town. Check it out. you won't be upset."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome every time. Fresh super fresh. The choices!!! Best toasted sub out of all the places I know and love even potbelly and portosubs. Cool soda machine!! I can't decide ever, go ahead of me. Tip! Try the iguana hot sauce! Ugh this place... :) service is great too!"}
{"text":"Normally we love this place. Today was our first bad visit. my wife ordered a sub with cherry peppers but they put jalapeños.  They burned her mouth pretty bad. she's positive they were jalapeños. I asked about it but they insisted they were not jalapeños.  i ordered a large steak and cheese. 4 inches of it was nothing but bread and sauce. Not cool."}
{"text":"I love this place! The roasted chicken on wheat was amazing and the customer service was incredible. We asked for extra pickles and within one minute we were served a basket of pickles - at least 6 pickles!  The coolest thing about this restaurant is the Coke soda machine that offers 120 different soda options. I could have drank all the options but I had filled up on my hoagie.   This place has become my new favorite quick lunch spot in the 'burbs. :)"}
{"text":"It's a actually relaxing place to come and have a lunch sub and just enjoy the great food they have.  Very nicely done honestly"}
{"text":"Decent tasting sub.  But this location is maintained poorly.  It not only is dirty but has a horrible smell that hits you immediately after opening the front door."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I come here often and love this place. This time the bread was old and hard,when I approached one of the employees she couldn't care less, not even an I'm sorry. I didn't want my money back I just wanted them to be aware. Won't be coming back. The place was empty and dirty."}
{"text":"Their meatball sub is literally the best meatball sub you will find in town!!! Sooo so so good!!! They're chili too, it's perfect for anyone! I love this place too much haha :)"}
{"text":"Walked in, and no greeting by anyone.  The workers just looked at me.  I placed my order and waited.  And waited....and waited.  They need to pick up the pace.  Got my order home and discovered they gave us the wrong bread on each sandwich.  And my husband's sandwich was about 3 inches longer than mine, but they were supposed to be the same size??  I called and complained, the manager was ok about it.   He said that the bread they get in is inconsistent.  What?  Then cut it all the same length for cryin' out loud!  I am in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this a 4.75 or something, but yelp doesn't believe in decimals! Firehouse subs is certainly my new sub stop. They give you less options than other sub places (white or wheat bread--that's it!) and you don't really stand at the counter picking toppings.  But the subs! The subs are so good! The Italian is especially spectacular. The veggie sandwich is also awesome with mushrooms and melted provolone cheese. They steam the subs to warm them up, which makes the bread a little bit fragile, but still good.   Oh and besides that, hearing them all yell \"welcome to firehouse\" when you walk in is the best!"}
{"text":"3 employees - 1 customer ahead of me with 1 sandwich order. Took over 10 minutes to get my 1 sandwich. Most of the time, the employees were standing around... Pretty lackluster."}
{"text":"These are the best subs around! I don't go anywhere else anymore. The service is great and the people friendly."}
{"text":"This place is SUPER CUTE, I have to say. The tables with the dalmatian spots are to-die-for. MOST of the staff is friendly, the girl ringing us up did not seem amused at anything or interested in anything other than taking our order, but maybe she was just having an off day. Everyone else was nice, and they bring your sandwiches to the table.   As far as taste, I enjoyed my sandwich. The turkey is really good. The bread is a little thick for my preference but it was still delicious. They also have this crazy soda machine with a zillion flavors. I don't drink soda so I can't attest to the taste but it's pretty cool.   One thing...I have never waited SO LONG for a sandwich in my whole life. My goodness. I got a basic turkey, nothing special, and waited at least 10 minutes. And it didn't seem THAT busy."}
{"text":"So this was my second trip to firehouse. The first time I was not happy with my order. I got the sub with turkey and mushrooms. This time I got the smoke house cheddar sub. It was good, I put the house hot sauce on it which made it better. As of now I dont see it being that great. Though there are a few other items I want to try. The steamer looks real good.  Firehouse is a good alternative to a subway. But isn't something right now that I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"The best samich I've ever had. I'm hooked on the turkey bacon ranch sub. I love going here, they are friendly and never get my order wrong. I definetely couldn't work here, I'd be fat as I don't know what."}
{"text":"My wife and I loooove firehouse subs! They have a different way of doing things so you can't really compare to subway. This food is a lot fresher and tastier. Place is tidy and when you round up your change it donates to local firefighters. Cool to support locally in your neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and it was our first time at Firehouse.  Maybe our expectations were too high.  The service was good and the dining area was simple and clean. The sandwiches we had were average.  We expected more for the price. A medium size sandwich and drink cost about $9 for each of us. My wife thought it was unusual that all the types sandwiches were priced the same.  If you become a regular, you might discover the tastier bargains on the menu and make the deal a little better for yourself.    For service they ask for your name plus give you a numbered ID marker for the table.  When your order is ready they bring it out to you calling your name.  The place isn't that big.  We thought two ID systems were unnecessary.  We are not complaining.  The order was ready quickly.  Nice if you're in a hurry.  We might try them again sometime.  Oh wait, my wife says \"Not me\".   She can write her own review.  For me,  I would give them another try, after I win the lottery.   Go to Firehouse Subs if you have money to burn."}
{"text":"Great place! If you like fresh made, great tasting, with lot's of quality meat on them subs, Firehouse is a place you should try! Love the Turkey Bacon Ranch or the Hook and Ladder on wheat. All the Fire pictures, murals and gear are fun for the kids to enjoy seeing. Nice variety of beverages with the Freestyle machine and Tea."}
{"text":"Great subs! I had the Firehouse Hero which was served warm and had a flavor I know I will crave again."}
{"text":"Why the Hype??? My Husband said I should try this place because it was delicious. So when this location opened over by my work, I decided to give it a go.   First of all, I ordered a sandwich to go and it took 30 min. 30 min for a sandwich??? A sandwich not served by real firemen? You have got to be kidding me. This better be a damn good sandwich.   Secondly, they got my order wrong. But on to the real review.   I ended up with the Engineer, which is turkey, cheese and mushrooms.   So I start eating my sandwich, bread is nice and soft, turkey is warm, seriously lacking on the mushrooms and NO CHEESE.   Now I am kind of pissed. At least at Subway I watch them put cheese on my sandwich. 30 min for a wrong order with no Cheese. What was on the sandwich was good, but not worth the wait and doesn't live up to the hype.   The Cherry Limeade is yummy.   I wont be back."}
{"text":"Second bad experience.  Ordered a meatball sub for the wife who hates spicy food.  Said sweet, but it was spicy hot -so hot, that even I thought it was bad; and I like spicy food.    $9.20 down the drain, probably won't go back."}
{"text":"If you are want a sub, but don't want the monotony of your typical sub shops, head to Firehouse Subs and if you want I bet they will let you give  your best firetruck siren impression, too.  This place has the similar feel as any other sub shop, but just replace the cheesy subway scenery wall paper with firehouse artifacts.     The menu provides similar sub options, but the quality of the ingredients are much higher rated than what you would expect to find.  The real add on for me is the hot sauce.  They have a nice variety of different hot sauces that give any sub that extra kick.  The other thing I like is the 8 and 12 inch are really that large.  Seems like everyone now offers a 6 and 12 inch that really are 4 and 8.  Friendly staff and the option to create your own sub and personalize it with some pop make it a solid 3 star."}
{"text":"I have been to other Firehouse locations and loved the subs, but this one was not good.  I went at an off hour and no other customers were there.  One employee was sitting down and yelled \"Hey, you have a customer\" to the back.  The person who helped me was quite pleasant and cheerful.  She took my order and made the sub.  The sub, in a word, sucked.  The bread was obviously not fresh as it crumbled when I ate it.  There were almost no condiments, to the point that I had to add more when I got it home.  I have been to other Firehouse locations and the sub was so full I almost couldn't eat them all.  This one was about the same quality and freshness as the 3 day old refrigerated subs you get at a convenience store.  I'll go to Firehouse again, but not this location."}
{"text":"I literally opened a yelp account to document my service at this location. Do yourself a favor, and go anywhere else. There are five or six sub places within a half mile. I might even recommend subway?   Let me preface this by saying, I have enjoyed past experiences with firehouse subs at other locations on many, many other occasions. But those are not that story.   I got there after work, and ordered a large engineer at 5:56 pm. Had I known that it would take 16 minutes to make my sandwich, while they had a massive burst of three other guests, I might have gone elsewhere.   But it was the spot on rapping of one employee, completely free lance by the way, that really made my night.   Long story short, four employees. Filthy pretty much everywhere, three stood around, 16 minute sandwich. Awful."}
{"text":"Service at this popular sandwich shop has gotten worse with each visit. Came early to beat the lunch crowd, only to wait as the register was unattended for 10 min. Waited another 20 min for my sandwich. There were 10 people waiting at tables for the meals. Everyone was pleasant enough, but it does not make up for the poor service."}
{"text":"Go to Capriotti's if you want more bang for your buck. Staff didn't even say hello when we walked in. It took 10 mins for them to make 2 medium sandwiches. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Always my favorite place for lunch or dinner! I traveled all the way from North Dakota and the first meal I have to have is Firehouse! We had the Meatball and the Italian and they were both prefect.  I'm going to try make it back again before my vacation is over!"}
{"text":"Great subs! They are made well. Came in in Father's Day and it was buy one, get one! The staff is pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"I had finn this please a couple times when I was driving down tatum boulevard. so I thought that I would give it a try. 25 min wait for a sandwich on a thursday night...and the food is average at best :("}
{"text":"Holy Smokes!  I just picked up my phone order for a New York Steamer sub and now I wished I ordered a large instead of a medium!  It was the best tasting sandwich I have had in a very long time!  I try ordering something new every time I go in, but now I think I will be stuck on this one.  Clean and friendly, it's my fav place to take out."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by a great aroma. I had the steak and cheese with extra cheese and mushrooms. Don't know why it took me so long to try this place. It really hit the spot. Don't hesitate if you're looking for a tasty sub."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always delicious. Service is okay, hence the one less star. Girls are a little catty. And they never give pickles on to go orders. Last time here I asked for extra pickles and didn't get one. Even after I asked on my way out if there was any! Either way number 10 is amazing."}
{"text":"For a chain style Sub place its quite good.  food seems fresh has good flavors and service is very friendly and prompt.  Seems to be a lot of competition in the sub sandwich business but they hold there own quite well with other chains."}
{"text":"I'm  FOODIE and found this place while driving in Summerlin.  All of the employees were so kind, said hello when I walked in, and actually got my order correct.  One of my favorite things is the various sodas offered with just a click of a button.  Can't wait to see more FS locations in Vegas."}
{"text":"High end sub place.  Very, very yummy. More expensive than most, but if you are hungry, visit this place!"}
{"text":"One of my best friends always talked about how this place and after finally trying it, I know why.  Hands down, the best fast food sandwich place around.  Subway, Quiznos... NO WAY, NO MORE.  We could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Amazing my favorite sub place in town. Always go for the turkey bacon ranch! Friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Amazing great service. Turkey bacon ranch is my favorite. The brisket is also super good"}
{"text":"I order from this location usually once a week for lunch during work week through PostMates and the consistency of the bread whether wheat or white is almost always waterlogged by the time it gets delivered to the office (25 minute travel time) What makes the bread so waterlogged and soggy if oil is exempt from the order ?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Firehouse Subs in Buckeye so decided to try the new Goodyear location. Disappointed in the slow service at this location. Engineer Sub was okay. Nothing special. Took way too long to have my order taken and then just as long to have it prepared. It's clean and new which is nice. TV'S with the Olympics on was also nice. Just let down by the service."}
{"text":"Popped in at 8:54 P.M. 6/13, six minutes before close. I asked if I could get a quick one to go, the staff responded \"sure, come on in\". I've worked in restaurants and I know that at the end of the day as an employee, you are hoping nobody comes in so you can get out. The employees here were great. I didn't feel like an inconvenience at all. They cheerfully made my order smiling the entire time. The sub as usual was awesome. This is far and away my favorite submarine shop. Great staff and great food. If you haven't tried one yet, do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"Great tasting subs that my whole family loved! Each of us thought for sure we had the best tasting sub! My only complaint is that there wasn't a huge selection of ingredients to top the sub with.  I always prefer spinach to lettuce on my subs, but that's a personal preference.  The service was outstanding! Very helpful and friendly staff.  Thanks! We'll be going there again for sure!"}
{"text":"The best subs I have ever had in my life. The meat is juicy, the bread is just right the condiments are fresh and the options to choose hot or cold is great. I will never ever go to those other sub places again.!!!!"}
{"text":"We eat at this store...maybe once every other month. Food is always great. Service is always friendly. Service can be slow even though we've never seen fewer than 4 people behind the counter. The tables, floor and drink dispense area are \"always\" dirty. Have seen dirty store on a weekend, counted 8 employees and nobody is cleaning. When they do decide things are bad enough to clean...Have seen workers use same rag to wipe chair seats, then trash can top, then tables in that order. Manager's fault, poor oversight."}
{"text":"This place has the old firehouse theme nice and clean. Very friendly staff seem to live what they are doing. I got the hook and ladder. I forgot they put mayo on it I hate mayo. But I scraped it off and added mustard and hot sauce. It was quite good. I will be back here. I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I just ate here with my bud who recommend it from back east in Virginia.  I ended up getting the toasted \"engineer sub\" with the turkey and sauteed mushrooms and to say the least...IT WAS deeeeelicious!  My other 2 friends LOVED theirs as well. Another thing I thought was cool was their coke machine...its like those crazy coke machines in Japan with a touch screen with a bazillion flavors, pretty neat.  I've had a lot of sub places in the valley and this place is definitely my fav. Their other menu items looks scrumptious and so ill be back for more.  Gets my 5 stars."}
{"text":"SUPERB ALL AROUND!!!  I'm rarely one to take time from my day to write reviews, and NEVER write bad ones unless they negatively impact my life. Life is too filled with more important things, I say... BUT I truly believe in saying thanks, and sharing kind thoughts where they are due. THANK YOU!  The pleasure I consistently enjoy from the quality of these sandwiches is top notch. More importantly, to me, a consistent level of cleanliness and sincere welcoming kindness from staff keeps me going there. I met the owners as well, and appreciate their care in making sure their customers are happy. I'm one and hope others appreciate what I do. Again, THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Subs are good.  I think Jersey Mikes is better by far.  Ordering is confusing.  There is a person standing up front and you have to order somewhere else.  Found myself talking to someone but not really ordering.  Subs did not blow me away with flavor.  I could most likely make a better one."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but the service is less than par.  We have had 2 separate occasions where we have called to place to-go orders, been placed on hold and been on hold for over 12 minutes - long enough to drive to the restaurant, go inside and order and tell them that I was still holding to place a to go order - TWICE!!  Both times the restaurant was NOT busy."}
{"text":"really good food! i had the brisket and cheddar on wheat. meat was great and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Firehouse around,  we will definitely be back soon.  The guy and 2 girls working were friendly.  The place was clean. The food was delicious.  I love their Philly."}
{"text":"Fantastic subs and Amazing customer service! The young lady, Miranda, who took my order and Eric, who prepared it were all very pleasant and they looked as if they're having a grand time laughing and joking around making it a very welcoming first impression. They were very knowledgable of the menu and quick with offers and recommendations of their favorite subs. Eric's recommended the hero with a smirk-like guarantee I would like it. Hands down, he was right and the hero was outstanding. The new ownership of this Firehouse shines through all the employees and overall experience."}
{"text":"Simply the best!! The best subs I have had are firehouse subs! This particular store just opened and has stirred excitement in the community of buckeye! Great location  employees are professional and service was fast and food was off the hook!! I recommend the meatball sub it is by far the best meatball sandwich I have had! Yay for firehouse and the city if Buckeye!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches we ate ever.. Specially the meatballs are really tasty. The entire family love them."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop! Quick service and the bread is fresh.  Plenty of local hot sauces to choose from. Wish we had a Firehouse  where I'm from."}
{"text":"Great service great food!! Nothing more to say! Very consistent have eaten here dozens of times"}
{"text":"Firehouse is awesome. Always great sandwiches. A bit pricey but we'll worth it. This location is clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Went to this place at lunchtime and it was packed! The staff was very friendly and upbeat, great atmosphere.  Everything on the menu looked so good, but I ended up with the new york steamer, regular sized.  Don't get me wrong, the sub was delicious, but nothing I would go out of my way for.  However, their hot sauce variety was excellent- I forgot what it was called, but the hot sauce with chunks of tomatoes(?) was to die for!  I tried my friend's club on a sub which I liked better than the steamer.  I'll have to try a different sub and write a review on it next time."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Leanne on this one.   The establishment itself is very nice,  and the employees friendly enough,  but I wasn't impressed with what they offered.   Firehouse is supposed to be the \"up and comer\" of the sub chains,  but the quality of their sandwiches leaves much to be desired.    Their subs are indeed soggy,  and they use a lot of vinaigrette dressing to cover the bland flavor.   They certainly don't use higher quality breads or meats on their sandwiches like Quiznos. I'd swear some of this stuff was warmed up Oscar Meyer.  I've gone here on two separate occasions,  gotten a meatball and roast beef,  and the subs were the same quality:  below average.    Stick to Subway,  Quiznos or even Jersey Mike's.     Firehouse has a ways to go to compete."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try firehouse, but was very disappointed.  The quality of the food was terrible.  My engineer sandwich was dripping with mayo and the meet was low quality. The worst thing was that the mushrooms were canned and not fresh. Don't go there unless you are desperate. I am giving them a star because the chips in a bad were good ;)"}
{"text":"Really good Sandwich at a fair $$, friendly staff. Don't know of a better Sandwich in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Got a few subs there and they were great. The subs were filled with meat and the large subs were footlong size. That might be a problem if you're used to Capriottis or Jersey Mike's and their huge 18\" subs, but these footlongs were only $8 and there was a lot of meat in them. Definitely not like Subway where half your sub is veggies with a couple of spoons of meat.   The taste was good. The brisket sub was well seasoned and the bbq sauce had nice flavor. The bread was nice and they give you a pickle on the side. Very good quality for the price.   They also have a lot of different sauces in this rack near the counter and have an HDTV that was on ESPN which is nice if you eat inside the restaurant. It's in a nice neighborhood as well."}
{"text":"The food is great, but they no longer give the home town hero discount. Looks like they raised their prices, too."}
{"text":"Firehouse is a great sub shop.  The manager in there is awesome too.  She's so friendly.  I had not tried Firehouse until this year and I always go to this one.  It is the best in Charlotte.  I love steak and cheese and love the brownies and cookies too.  Oh and don't forget the cherry limeade.  YUMMY!!!!  PS - Right next door to a Coldstone Creamery.. BONUS!"}
{"text":"I used to like Firehouse subs until this location served me a sandwich with moldy wheat bread! Yuck!!! I called the location and they offered me a new sandwich, I also contacted their Corp office but never got a response! This place is going on my list of places NOT to ever go!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  The employees have managed to find that perfect balance- they're helpful and attentive without being intrusive.  The sandwiches are BEYOND delicious!  The bread is excellent, the variety is outstanding, and their hot sauce bar is brilliant!  We live less than a mile from Firehouse, so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great staff who always greet you as you walk in with a prompt \"Welcome to Firehouse!\" The subs are very good. They didn't get 5 stars from me because I prefer toasted to warmed bread, but that did not stop the subs from being delicious.   Both times I have been there, I had the Veggie sub with everything on there (I forget to ask for no mayo!) and both times the sub was great. I look forward to my next venture over there."}
{"text":"The limited pork and slaw was delicious. The Hawaiian bun made the entire sandwich. I'm not usually a fan of slaw but this was legit."}
{"text":"I am impressed! When we first walked in I thought well it looks just like a subway...but once I took my first bite I immediately took it back! This is no subway!!! So tasteful and original! It is a pleasant surprise! I encourage everyone to give it a try! I had the Italian it was flavorful, just right in spices.. My husband had the Hero and we both loved it!!!"}
{"text":"We go to firehouse once or twice a week. We usually place our order online and then pick it up. Went in on Tuesday to pick up our order and when we got home we realized they had given us the wrong sandwich. When I went in on Wednesday Amanda apologized without me saying anything and gave me a free sandwich for the inconvenience. We always get a warm greeting and the sandwiches are really good!"}
{"text":"This is not the first Firehouse I have eaten at. Give or take, all food should be the exact same at each location, so I believe where you make or break a franchise location like this, is in the service.  That being said, the owners here have done a great job of hiring. Every time I have been in here, I have been greeted and treated very well. Granted, I'm sure corporate has monthly meetings to remind everyone to say \" Welcome to Firehouse.\" It's easy to get someone to say that, but enthusiasm and a smile are tough to teach. With this location being right next to UNLV and the way it's managed, I'm certain that it will be around for a while.   Plus, if you haven't tried Firehouse, my favorites are...  The Italian, with no mustard. Hot Italian sandwiches are more rare than cold ones. This is a hot one, which I prefer, and a must have. It's probably my favorite Italian sandwich overall.  The Engineer, again with no mustard lol. Its a hot turkey cold cut sandwich with mushrooms. Very well put together.   Me and my fiance usually get one of each and split it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the second time I have received an incorrect order from this location. At first I decided to give them a second chance and again I was rudely disappointed. Not only was both my sandwiches wrong, they did it on both occasions. The food if made correctly can be great but not when a customer specifically requests items to be removed from a sandwich and they show a continued disregard for a customers wishes. Highly unprofessional and extremely reckless. Will never order from them again even after giving them a second try after my first order was mistaken by their staff. Less then one star would be more then appropriate."}
{"text":"Clean with good potential, if they could only get orders right. Visited for take out, made it very clear no mayo. Arrived home to discover missing items and mayo on the subs. Should have checked while in the restaurant but it wasn't busy so assumed I'd get what I paid for.  Won't return and don't recommend."}
{"text":"Tried this location a few times now and they seem to be well staffed, which I really appreciate - food served pretty quickly. Plus, we were happy to find that not only are the subs great but salads are also good, especially for a sub place. Would give it a 5 but they messed up one of our orders."}
{"text":"Stopped here after hiking Skyline Park recently and these tasty subs hit the spot! The staff is friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat, all of their sandwhiches are great!!! I love that they are all warm and served with a pickle. Never have issues at this location."}
{"text":"Arizona's technology sector is expanding yet again. With the presence of Motorola and Intel establishing the Valley's own Silicon Desert, the industry continues to aspire to be a preeminent center of innovation and design. Biotech has garnered much of the attention recently, but even now its perch has been threatened. Yes, in the midst of economic uncertainty, one new firm has no shortage of buzz.  Yes, the cutting edge is now a sandwich knife. Firehouse Subs has come to the state, and promises to revolutionize an American original: the hoagie, or submarine sandwich. Founders Chris and Robin Sorensen realized just like other foods, the method of cooking a sandwich should be just as important as the ingredients. And so, they decided to use a heretofor underutilized way in mass-prodctions sandwich shops: steam.  But if you worry that your glasses will fog up as you walk through the door, don't be. The seemingly endless row of hot sauces will likely cause more eye irration than the patented steamer devices used behind the counter. Bowing to their time the founders worked with their father as firefighters in Jacksonville, Florida, the decor is a mix of bright reds, whites, and blacks with a very clean and new feeling throughout. Employees are quick to shout, \"Welcome to Firehouse\" when anyone steps inside.  The menu hints at ambition but ultimately delivers something more staid. Creative names like \"Hook and Ladder\" and \"Engine Company\" conceal prosaic offerings like ham and turkey and turkey with roast beef. But as soon as you take a bite, you'll realize that the steaming does make a huge difference. And you'll also notice how fast you finish, given that their items are on the small side.  With all the focus on next-generation technology, the owners have yet to solve 20th century vintage problems. The first is the wait that is required to use the steamer. While it's not oppressive long, it does diminish the utilty of the sandwich shop concept a little bit. Contravening this is the staff's desire to be really nice to you, even if it's all very Stepford-wife as opposed to something family-owned. We can only hope none there has seen \"Westworld\".  Innovation, however, always costs money and you'll be keenly aware of this here. It's not that you have to shell out an unspeakable amount of money to dine at Firehouse. It's that you might feel for a simple sandwich, it's either too much (money) or not enough (food). But the restaurant's signature flavors still make it a destination, at least until the next big thing comes along."}
{"text":"Was going to try them for the first time. Found about 8 to 10 people waiting for food,three ppl a head of me with one cashier,  no time to wait ,guess I'll try again some other time, not impressed at this time."}
{"text":"I love.this chain. Everything is fresh and the price.isnt bad. Probably my favorite in Chandler."}
{"text":"First time trying Firehouse. Been waiting 20 mins for one sub. Everyone here has gotten the wrong sandwich. This place needs help. Or at least a manager."}
{"text":"First time ever eating here i was amazed. I ordered amake your own sandwich combo, i got grilled chicken breast, honey ham, cheddar cheese, onions, tomatoes, pickles and mustard. The sandwich was heaven on bread I'll be here again in a few days. I love this place the service was great with a nice clean restaurant. Please go try it soon"}
{"text":"I have been to a few Firehouses and this one is by far the slowest. I was the only customer in the store with two employees and I waited 15-20 minutes for my food. Even when there are more employees the wait is still around 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"Food was good. Would definitely go back, and try some of their other sandwiches. Pretty cool that I live close too."}
{"text":"They have very friendly customer service and their sandwiches are pretty good, but I just feel like their sandwiches are a little pricey."}
{"text":"I was really surprised when I saw that so far, no one else has had the problems that I've had while going to firehouse.   I've been there probably 4 times. I get the same sub every time. There's usually like, 8 people working. The first time I went, everyone greeted me when I walked in, but they seemed bored. Zombie-fied. Like they were automatically programmed to say \"Welcome to Firehouse\" whenever the door opened.   The first time I went, there was a group of employees talking to a girl who seemed to be cleaning on the other side of the line. They asked her what time she got off. She said, \"Nine.\" Well, when I got out of my care (parked right outside) my clock said 8:45ish. They asked her if she wanted to take a 10 minutes break. But...that didn't make sense, she gets off at nine...I guess it just seemed a little to...overstaffed. The feeling of having so many employees seems so lackadaisical when reflected onto the customer.   I will admit that an employ has never been rude, or made me feel awkward, and that's a huge plus.   Whenever I go, their drink machine is ALWAYS out of whatever flavored syrup I want to try. That have a cool machine that can make like, 300+ flavors or something. But whenever I get in line to get a combo I hear someone at the fountain going \"Oh, they're out of syrup\" \"It's mostly water today.\" \"Very watery, wonder if they're running low on supplies.\"   I don't think they serve any cold sandwiches on purpose--but I normally get either a steak or a chicken sandwich. Even though they're supposed to be warm, and there are like, 95320483209420394823 people on staff to get the job done, my sandwich is almost always either lukewarm or just barely warm. I don't want my sandwich to be mouth burning hot, but you know...I don't think I could change a mood ring's color with these sandwiches sometimes.   For that amount of people to be on a line, working on sandwiches all day every day, I expect them to be a certain tempurature--no, they can't determine what every customer's preference is. But you CAN wait for the sandwich to cool off. You CAN'T make the sandwich warmer, unless you're going home and are planning to put it in the microwave (can't do if you're on your lunch break, for most people.)   Personally, I feel like their 8 inch subs are a little teensy bit over priced for the lukewarm product I get at the end. I feel like I could get a perfectly warm sandwich at subway for probably a little bit less (footlong). But their bread trumps Subway's and Quizno's any day. It's a heavy competitor for JJ's. But that's no reason to raise the price a whole dollar and a half and then some.          TL;DR I like the place, but I feel like they're a little overstaffed and have some tiny kinks they need to work out. Including tweaks in pricing."}
{"text":"This firehouse sub location is great! Friendly staff, subs are amazing, clean safe store! Will definitely enjoy another sub from the S.Nellis store!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops in town! The Smokehouse Cheddar beef brisket sub is the best!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars but every time I do yelp thinks its fake.  This place is great and fast.  People are always very nice.  It's fast enough I can run over there and grab lunch on my 30 min break."}
{"text":"A must try!! Food is great very tasty. I really like the selection of hot sauces available. Service is Awsome that's what made this a 5 Star."}
{"text":"First time I went in for a to go order, they gave me the wrong sandwich. I called to let the manager know and he offered me a free sandwich. Went back the other day and got the Brisket and cheddar with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce (my personal choice at home) OMG it was amazing. The meat was so flavorful and tender, the sauce didn't cover it up at all. Beautiful foodie experience"}
{"text":"Amazing subs! Amazing service! Subs are big enough to share. 10x better than subway & 5x better than jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"When we walked into the store, it was dinner time, and nobody was there. Right away we knew that was not a good sign. There were only two people working and when we went to order the person taking our order just busted out laughing, which was very strange. We didn't want to take a chance with the food so we left. I don't know how good the food was but the service was terrible. But I assume the food must not be very good, because it was empty at dinner time. So overall, I would not recommend this to a family member or friend unless there is a brand new staff."}
{"text":"Went in to Firehouse subs today for lunch 6/3/14 and did not have a great experience.    There was a female manager running around scolding employees telling them where to stand and where not too.  She verbally reprimanded a person on the line for making a sandwich incorrectly (all within my earshot).  While she should have been worried about why it is taking 10-15 minutes for me to get my 1 sub.    Now onto the sub.. I got an italian sandwich, which had some kind of sweet sauce on it.  I cannot fathom why there would be a sweet sauce (think sweet mayo) on a italian sandwich.  Overall, really disappointed, will not be back."}
{"text":"When we want something quick, easy, and yummy Firehouse never fails. My favorite part is trying all the different sauces they offer. Staff here is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very good sabducted, tons of amazing hot sauces, freestyle machine for plenty of drinks, and very kind down to earth staff. Every location also has cool firehouse decor which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Love it. The meat is literally and figuratively a cut above. There is really no sub place that even comes close."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recommendation from a friend. I am a fan. The food is really awesome. The staff is so-so. I will be coming here again and again."}
{"text":"We've been twice and enjoyed delicious hot subs.  Love the hook and ladder sandwich. Clean dining room, friendly service.  A tad slow so maybe not if you need the quickest option."}
{"text":"We've been enjoying Fire House for years.   Definitely try their own Datil Pepper sauce."}
{"text":"Glad we have one in Surprise now, don't have to drive to 67th and 101 anymore . Best subs out of all the usual cast of characters in this town!!!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing no one else makes subs as good as firehouse or else I would have a hard time choosing a place. Firehouse subs"}
{"text":"This is the best firehouse I have ever been to.I am a future optimistic Firefighter and have experience and exposure to real fire houses.This place made me feel the way I have felt in a real firehouse,I got greeted, I was introduce to the franchise owner which in the fire dept is the battalion cheif, who was very friendly and the rest of the employees were working at a fast pace.Plus the place was clean and was continued to be maintained.Great food Great place can't stress it enough."}
{"text":"This is one of our tried and true sandwich places. We live nearby and come here often. I like the Turkey Verde sandwich - especially because they don't skimp on the meat. It's super delicious! The service is always friendly too."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh subs. I ordered the veggie sub with extra veggies. Our cashier did a very good job with our order and was very patient with us."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place in town love this place. I'm there at least once a week. I tell everyone at work if u haven't tried them u need too"}
{"text":"First off is Value, I took my two children here for lunch. $38.55 .  My first impression of my little basket of food was \" Is this a kids meal?\" I was shocked to see 3 1/2\" of meat in the center and 1 1/2\" of beard on either end of the skinny sub. I asked the lady that brought us the food if the order was wrong she said \"no that the medium size\" . It was okay,but nothing to brag about for sure. So for this guy I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the #1 combo in wheat bread! Really delicious, the more you chew the meat, the more you taste the flavor and cheese. Staff was informative. A bit pricey, but worth the $$$. Definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Their menu is great. The ingredients give the appearance and taste of something fresh (not frozen or processed). Or so they seem. At this moment, they are far above Quiznos and the garbage that is served at Subway doesn't even come close. Admittedly, I am such a frequent customer that staff speaks of me, \"Oh, he is always here!\" Nice to be recognized. My only detraction: I am a \"pickle connoisseur\" so you must do something about those wimply, limpy pickles.  LOL"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and nice atmosphere to dine in. Very clean. Much better than subway, Quiznos, etc."}
{"text":"My favorite sub shop and definitely the best location!!  The food is great size portions and alway tasty"}
{"text":"Paid $28.21 for two meals. Both my spouse and I became ill after eating there.  I called and asked for a resolution they said that, \"...if it was food poisoning there would be a lot more phone calls...\"  I was asking for my money back... they declined my request stating it was policy.  what I learned is... 1. Expensive; 2. Should you become ill after eating their food they have policy 3.  They will not refund your money. 4.  Any company that has policy that does not cover \"satisfaction\"  is not a company that will have my patronage.   5. I am disgusted with level of service that was provided for the money I paid."}
{"text":"Great, VERY tasty sandwiches!  Definitely coming back here!  Staff welcomes you as soon as you walk in. The best part is that some of the proceeds go to first responders."}
{"text":"Finally! The West coast gets smart! (Or at least Las Vegas!) A Firehouse Subs has moved in, and has given me new found love for my ol' city. Please, just go for lunch one day. You can write this review for me, it's that good. They offer about ten million types of hot sauces from around the world (hence the name Firehouse) and all work well with all of the subs. I like to sneak some of the hottest sauces on my boyfriend's while he refills our drinks. I'm scandalious.  I always get the beef with hot sauce, but my boyfriend calls me disgusting. I think he gets the Italian. If its not called that, it's the one with all the meats, and its HUGE! And toasted!"}
{"text":"You Guys have some really great Subs, I prefer your shop over any  of the other Sandwich/ Sub shops that are located in Buckeye"}
{"text":"This place is the worst fire house.   Days they close at 9pm. Showed up at 8:45 pm and the doors were locked and they still had their OPEN sign on. I wouldn't have even stopped but the sign was on.  At least turn the damn OPEN sign off so people don't bother.   Won't ever come here again."}
{"text":"As far as subs go, my family loves Firehouse!    My husband and I are able to share the 12 inch sandwich - which saves us some money.  The meat served at Firehouse is excellent - some of the best in town.  The sandwich comes with a lot of meat and less veggies - unlike other places in town who skimp on the meat by overloading the sandwich with veggies.  We love the Italian sub!  My husband - who LOVES HIM SOME SUBS - says the Ham at Firehouse is cooked in a special way and has a perfect sweetness to it for ham.    We also love the Kids Specials here.  Our little one gets a turkey sandwich and a Fire Hat - what else can you ask for!  As far as Kids Menu's goes, this is one of the best in town for a quickie eatery.    The restaurant is new and very clean and the staff are very polite and helpful.    We also love Capriotti's - but when the little kiddo is in tow - we pick Firehouse for their family friendly restaurant setting and excellent kids menu."}
{"text":"Just ate the Italian sub and give it 4 stars.  I walked in on a Friday night at 7pm and didn't have to wait to order and my sandwich was ready in about 8 minutes.  In and out in less than 10 minutes is always good.  By the time I drove the 10 minutes home and opened up the sandwich, it was still warm and tasty.  The only problem was that the oil leaked and half the bread was soggy - which does not make for a good sub experience.  Nobody wants soggy bread!  Since the sandwich was ginormous, it didn't really matter that I skipped the soggy parts - it was still plenty of food for one person.  All in all, a good sandwich deal in town."}
{"text":"Not reliable sub shop, ONe day I go get Tuna sub portion of tuna is good , another day I go and get Tuna sub Barely any tuna in it, I am thru wasting my time at this over rated sub shop...you have lost my business."}
{"text":"Got a large New York Steamer and it was delicious! Their Coke machine is awesome too, it's one of those new Coca Cola Freestyle and has hundreds of flavors of drinks that you can mix and match. Overall great experience and I'll be back next week! 5 stars! *****"}
{"text":"I came in on a week day around lunch time.  The store appeared clean and well staffed, however there was only one person in line ahead of me and no one behind me and it took 10 minutes for my veggie sub to be made.  Once I finally did get my order I was unimpressed.  The bread (whole wheat) was good and tasted fresh but the veggies were soggy and had very little flavor.  I wanted to like this place, but in the end the sub was just nothing special.  I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I use to love this place. Walked in no one greeted us when I walked in. Took staff two minutes to walk out of the backroom to take our order. Cashier didn't know how to type the orders in. Asked for for our order to go but the lady didn't remember. The coke machine was out of ALL flavors. When we got home our \"hot sandwiches were cold, bread wasn't toasted, and we asked for no mayo and deli mustard but they left it on anyways.  This is the 3rd time they have screwed up our order, we will not be going again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Twice I came here and was greated with friendly service. The first time I came here, I called in my order saying I never ate here before what do you suggest. Mo helped me decide. She says everything here is really good. This is now my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Firehouse subs location. Conveniently located across the street from Bettye Wilson so we stop by often after our daughter's soccer games.  Always greeted and overall great service. The owner of this location truly knows how to please his customers.  My favorite sub is the New York Steamer, I've tried several others but I haven't found one that tops it. I also enjoy the soda machine with all the different drink options, but I usually go for the Cherry limeade with a few fresh squeezed limes ;)"}
{"text":"Great subs great service!!  Full of meat, nice and clean quick service. Definitely will go back for more."}
{"text":"Was recently in town with a group of 20 and the hospitality and customer service of the staff was incredible! The restaurant was clean, the food was fantastic and the employees went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of. I absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Not impressed for almost $10!!! Sandwich at sprouts market is better for $3.00!!..the place is super clean,friendly staff..just a so-so sandwich..i threw my punch card away..i wont be back.."}
{"text":"Best sweet tea! Not too sweet, it's just right! Created my own sub and was delish! Love this place for quick lunch"}
{"text":"This was my first visiting a firehouse sub and I live down the street. The staff has great customer service and very welcoming. It's pretty tough to find parking when I went during lunchtime, but that's manageable. The sandwiches were good, but for the prices it should be bigger!  Definitely a place to go for a quick place to eat during lunchtime."}
{"text":"Delicious subs!  Definitely give this place a try if you're in the Frazer area.  It's my new favorite lunch place."}
{"text":"My first time trying Firehouse Subs today. (7/1) I was excited for the reviews and the meatball sub. Honestly, when I was kid, we got the best meatball subs from Sam's Club. I haven't found many places here in Vegas that offer a meatball sub since.   Consider the reviews were great, we decided to head on there for our Friday lunch. Walking in, people greeted us. Friendly, cool. Smells great in there too! I was a little confused on where we order but once I looked up, I saw the sign that said, Order Here. Pretty obvious. One person in front of us in line, didn't take long.   We walked up to the cashier, Kyra and wasn't even greeted. Bummer. I said hello and I got a mere smirk from her. She stood there while my husband finished deciding on what he wanted. I was set on trying the meatball sub. The whole time we stood in front of her, she didn't say anything to us. At first, I thought maybe we're doing this wrong? For a second I felt like a idiot. I've never been here before. I'm not used to this surrounding! What do I do?! Why isn't she helping?! Anxiety, over a sub. (How lame.) I decided to speak. I asked for the meatball sub. I was asked what size. Putting all my faith into a new place and the great reviews, I go for the large. My husband sets on a turkey/cranberry (yawn, boring.) We pay and we sit down. No thank you, thanks for coming. No nothing. Just a total of our change back.   It didn't take long for our food to come up. Not even 5 minutes, I'd say. The girl who gave us or food was a lot more pleasant than the cashier. Told us the meatball was on bottom and not to turn the bag any other way cause it'll spill. Thanks for the tip! Because my husband totally would've done just that! We got home ate our food. And it's was delicious! I ordered the large but she put down a medium which was a huge disappointed since the sub was so good! My pickle was wrapped in a little baggy, placed under the sub. It was a great pickle. I just wish it wasn't warmed up. I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the cashier. Everyone else was great. Even those working on the subs going back and forth, working on steamers was friendlier than her. She seemed to more perky with others behind us, which is what got to me. Like, why didn't we get service like that? Did I do something wrong? As much as I loved the sub. My first experience was a bummer due to her customer service. I hate to let one person ruin it for me but it did. I might go back after a couple months months  or so. But not anytime soon. Maybe a location closer to my work than home. Maybe better customer service? Because they seem to have some of it going on."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Firehouse Subs in the valley.  There is one closer to my house but will drive to this location because the food is fresh and the staff is super friendly.   It does not hurt I can grab it for dinner on my way home from TX Ranger spring training games.  There is a large variety of drinks which I love since I do not drink caffeine.  Next spring training game you attend in Surprise stop by this location.  It is amazing.  Plus try a lemon cookie makes a nice finish to a hook and ladder salad.  Yummy.  :)"}
{"text":"I was a first timer. Tried veggie. Got to say- sub was fantastic.  It tasted yummy with 95% hot sauce."}
{"text":"Last time I was in the sammich line was moving slow and it took nearly twenty minutes to get 2 subs off a line backed up with only 5 other orders.    I don't recommend for takeout as the toastiness turns into sogginess once the sub is wrapped up.    Sammich quality is goodish - I'm unsure about the meat quality but the chesse steak doesn't taste fresh. I'd rather spend money on Primos or something with good MEATs!  This place seems more focused on the novelty aspect rather than food.   PS the medium drink is LARGE and I've never wanted to see a large."}
{"text":"I walked up to the counter. Both employees saw me then was ignored. Stood there for 5 minutes before I was acknowledged.No other customers. Very disappointed. The employees could careless. Ended up walking out."}
{"text":"First off I'm going to say I've been living in las vegas for the past 12 years and have yet to find a good sandwich shop until I ran across Firehouse. I've tried subway, port of subs capriottis, They all suck honestly (especially capriottis due to their bad attitudes at all of their stores) So i came into Firehouse a few months ago and I'm HOOKED!! This place is great, These guys are always polite they know how to make a good sandwich without making it soggy and has lots of flavor from the fresh bread the REALLY good meat (i like the hero), The hot sauce bar is a nice PERK!! The restaurant is always very clean and organized, Bathrooms are spotless (no graffiti). Anyway back to my review of 10/5/2013   i'd been working in the yard alllllll day long 6  1/2 hours and had no interest in cooking dinner so we decided to just grab diiner at Firehouse and go sit in the hot tub and relax after working all day. i wakked into firehouse and was immediatley greeted with a smile and a hello by jennifer (give her a raise) i had already placed my order online and was just coming in to pick them up and then hit the hot tub, sandwiches were just being finished up, They handed me my sandwiches  asked me if I needed anything else/ Drinks? hot sauce? napkins?  So i hit the hot sauce bar and then headed out, After the jacuuzi and getting back home a few hours later and enjoying the sandwiches (that were perfect as usual) I noticed my answering machine blinking and almost just didnt check it and was going to just go to bed and check the messages the next morning but i decided to just check it anyways/  It was jennifer from Firehouse saying \"HI\" and she noticed that i left my wallet laying on the counter next to the hot sauce bar and she wanted to let me know she'd hold onto it for me, I was like oops!!!  I went down there to pick it up and say thank you to jennifer and the crew but she was no longer there but everyone else was and they were very polite and handed right back to me. I was SHOCKED especially in las vegas that anyone was honest anymore!!  I had $150.00 cash in my wallet and 3 different credit cards and EVERYTHING was there, Nothing had been touched. I just honestly cant thank these guys enough and i will be a customer for life!!  Give jennifer a raise honestly!!  Great food, Great service, Honesty, Good prices, If you want to have a great sandwich and know you can leave your wallet behind when you leave  ( LOL )  :-)   Go here!!  Cant say enough good about these guys!!!   AWESOME.  Thanks see ya soon"}
{"text":"I originally wanted to try Capriottis after hearing some people at work brag on it, but they were closed and I turned the corner and went to Firehouse. IT WAS JAM PACKED..and for good reason. My hot pastrami was sooooo good; juicy meat, extra soft warm bread, and not a lot of fluff on the inside. The 8\" sandwich is just enough to satisfy your hunger, yet have your mouth begging for more. Expect to pay more than Subway, but it is worth it. Ironically, Gilbert Fire Department walked in as I was walking out. Hey..its good enough for them!!!!"}
{"text":"Average sub shop with above average subs. Their hot sauce selection can add even more heat to their primarily hot sub menu. Sandwich sizes are satisfying and service is fast enough even when busy."}
{"text":"This Firehouse sub is a lot better than the Subway.  Everything is so fresh and tasty. Also, there are a lot more meat on the subs compared to the Subway. Once you try the subs here,  I guarantee you that you wouldn't want to go back to the Subway."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, friendly staff easy access"}
{"text":"Okay my first thoughts on the location was that the company is very well branded and people seem to like the subs. However I was hungry, so I ordered a  Smoke House cheddar and the cashier asked me if I wanted med or large. I said medium (thinking they were asking about the drink since the combo comes with a bag of chips). I was very disappointed to open the bag when I got home to see a small flimsy looking excuse for a sandwich... The taste was amazing but don't go here if you are hungry!!! too pricy for what you get. Service was nothing to boast about.. Okay now I have to go get some food cause I'm still hungry. This was one of the worst examples of a poor value I have ever experience, The picture looked bold and meat filled but the actual sandwich is worthless... Being a Chef myself I would be embarrassed to let such a small portion make its way to one of my guests!"}
{"text":"I usually go to a different location where the service is great. We went to this location around 8:30pm. The service was very slow.  The sandwiches hardly had any turkey in it.  We took it home so it was too late to say anything. Very disappointing.  Won't go back. No one ever said thank you either."}
{"text":"Very slow.  There were 8 people working behind the counters and it seemed to be mass confusion.  The subs were good; however mine sat on the counter for several minutes while my husbands  was still being prepared.  We will wait a while to return while they work out the bugs!"}
{"text":"The hot sauces add that extra KICK that differentiates Firehouse Subs from the other subs.  Sure they have great meats and the bread is fresh, but the different sauces allow you to dress up the sandwich in different combinations to prevent the inevitable food boredom.  My favorite is Gator Hammock... Garlicky mouth-watering goodness."}
{"text":"The staff members are absolutely amazing. Always greeted with a smile and, yes although I'm sure they're required to say \"Welcome to Firehouse\", they say it in a manner of personality. They take time to make sure they have your order right. The manager José was really friendly and helpful when we were ordering.  Our sandwiches were made right and for the quality you can't beat the price.  Great food, awesome service, and the atmosphere is clean and definitely kid friendly. I will definitely be back and recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan. You walk in and are greeted by a chorus of \"Welcome to Firehouse\". If it is your first time there, they will take the time to explain the menu to you. I have become addicted to their Italian grilled chicken chopped salad. It has chicken and salami as the proteins. The salad ingredients are chopped and always fresh. It is on their low calorie menu and is substantial and filling. I recommend it highly. I knew I had to expand my horizons so I ordered the Captain Sorenson datil pepper sandwich. It has a grilled white meat chicken breast and is covered in a spicy but not overpowering datil pepper sauce. It is amazingly tasty. It is also on the lower calorie menu and comes in at under 500 calories. I have been back repeatedly and will continue to return. Good prices, good food and good customer service. A great combination."}
{"text":"I have been going here for almost 2 years now and I really love it!  They make the best Italian Sub., Meatball, and Antipasta Salad.  In fact, everything I tried there was good.  The service is very good and friendly and their combos are very good.  If you want to try the best express deli or subs.,  this is your go-to place.  Even among other Firehouse subs., ( I have tried 3 others in Southwest Vegas), this location stands out!!!  Good job, everyone there!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, great atmosphere, nice folks working there......Sooo much better than other sub shops around.  The sub sandwiches taste like actual good food and not just the belly-fillers found elsewhere......"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I just don't think it's any good. For the money there are much better sandwich shops. The customer service was fine, the store was clean and nicely decorated but the food was just average to a little below average."}
{"text":"Owner Steven Teffs is one of the most unfriendly people I have ever met in my life. I came in for my free birthday sub which upset him and he told me I had to be a reward member and download the app to discourage me from eating here. I downloaded the app, got my free sub, plus purchased another. My sub came with no vegetables. Nor did they ask if I wanted any. When my sub came out with just meat and sauce I asked the girl who took my order about vegetables. I explained I didn't know how this place worked and asked if I could get some vegetables on the side. Again the owner got annoyed that I even asked. I told him he was not friendly to me nor his employees who were clearly afraid of him and walking on eggshells. I also told him I got a free sub, but I also bought one putting money into his franchise. Of course, he didn't care. I will be calling ths corporate office when they open and will not be returning here ever again. The owner does not know how to gain repeat customers."}
{"text":"Has the most awesome subs, love love love Firehouse, soon my family and I will b in walking distance oh ya........also I got my Sis craving the subs, she goes to the one near her!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today. The service was great, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant was clean and looked nice. I really like your hook and ladder sandwich, I put potato chips on it. Yummy. Thanks for the wonderful experience. We will be back. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Have since tried almost all the subs on the menu... This is still my go-to place for a toasted sub!  Size of the sub is great and they make sure you will not be left hungry."}
{"text":"Out in Chandler today and was excited to finally try this place that was recommended by some locals.  Wasn't sure what to expect for a sub shop.  Different concept as far as first impressions.  Place was packed and it was about 1pm.  . Every table taken. Fireman equipment and artifacts everywhere.  Right away I'm trying to break down the menu as fast as I can since people behind me are waiting and it's an order-at-the-counter place.   Staff was great.  Asked what I was in the mood for. Pointed out a few items.  I went for a sub w/ turkey, mushrooms, and Swiss.  I asked if the mushrooms were fried.  The employee explained how they have a special press that steams the meat and cheese together before it goes on the roll.  Nothing there is fried.    Sandwich was very good. Enjoyed the crispness of the roll.  There was a great amount of turkey, unlike most popular sub shops around.  I would have liked a bit more cheese and mushrooms.  A little more \"savoryness\" but I think that could have come in had I chosen one of their specialty sauces.  I'm definitely trying one of the sauces next trip! I think I needed a little more \"zip!\""}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of Firehouse Subs and this one is my favorite. Whether you're visiting at lunch, dinner, or half an hour before closing, the staff is always courteous and happy to serve you a great sub. I'm partial to the Hook & Ladder (fully involved) but you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"It took nearly 20 minutes for me to get my sub but overall great food and friendly staff. Ill definitely be back"}
{"text":"NY Steamer and Engineer Subs are fabulous. Good amount of meat and , bread is nice and soft. Service is great. Very friendly employees. I can always count on them to be consistently good."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place today for lunch, and sooo glad I did.  I got the turkey bacon ranch on wheat combo with lettuce and tomatoes...wow! A combo meal is ~$8, not bad. All of their sandwiches are toasted, and boy are they good!!  They also have an assortment of hot sauces that you can sample, and even little to go containers (perfect, since I took mine back to work).  Friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the fresh sandwich . Cheap Subs are not good . Quality at a good value . If someone wants low cost food McDonalds is across street ."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!   I do advise you to go when it is slower because thesandwhich will be perfection in this instance =)  The staff is welcoming and they have the same ppl during certain shifts so your face will become known and they make you feel special!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and I normally love the customer service. My husband and I showed up with our two dogs to have an early lunch at our favorite sandwich place and where not happy with our first impression. The tables where all chained up and my husband nicely asked to have them unchained so we could have a nice lunch with our dogs. Linda very rudely  said you will have to wait at least ten minutes. Thank goodness for carol or we would have left. She quickly removed the chains and took our order."}
{"text":"Great, fast service even when it was crowded at lunch time. Excellent food choices with lots of healthy options."}
{"text":"Love this place! Only been once but everyone was extremely friendly and the food was delicious. The meat is fresh and you get tons of it on your sub. Lots of options and they seem to overstaff!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Firehouse Subs restaurant and I loved it. The staff was super friendly, particularly the cashier Vicky who asked if we had ever been there, and then went on to explain the menu and options we had. Everyone else was nice too!  It was also very clean and the food was delicious. I got the sweet and spicy meatball sandwich and the cherry limeade and I was very happy with it all. Definitely check it out, the meat is a much higher quality than Subway, etc."}
{"text":"Me and my friend had the meatball sub before closing and both of us were sick like dogs for about a day and a half. Sad after I heard such good things about this place."}
{"text":"First experience with Firehouse subs and I was not impressed. The sandwiches were very soggy. Maybe they use them to put out fires. This made the sandwiches very unenjoyable. When we went it was very busy and they gave my order to someone else. Though in their defense, we shared the same name. Since it was very busy, I may give them another try next time I am in the area to see if they can redeem themselves."}
{"text":"First time at this location as soon as I walk in the dining room is filthy all the tables are dirty and the floors were the worst now I understand they might of had a lunch rush and were a little busy but there were 4 girls behind the counter I'm sure 1 of them could have swept or wiped tables.I always order the Italian and it was good as always. Out of the 4 girls working, there was only 1 who was very nice she took my order and gave it to me she greeted me at the door and everyone else who walked in after me, her name was Heather and I want her to know I really appreciate her great service it made up for the bad service we received from the other girl who worked there whose name I can't recall."}
{"text":"I LOVE Firehouse! I grew up with them and always missed them. Until, they opened up here in Vegas. They make the BEST Meatball Sub in town. Great prices and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Horrible sandwiches! Got our orders all wrong. And the bread was all soggy. Not recommended"}
{"text":"Best Sub Shop ever. If you live, work or just driving through Arizona on the 10 Fwy, stop here for a sandwich. We were driving to Mesa to visit my dad. I was getting hungry and just wanted a sandwich. My husband pulled off 10 Fwy in Buckeye. I looked around and saw the sign Firehouse. We stopped there and first thing the girl was so helpful and told us how they make the sandwiches. I had the Hero and my husband had the Italian. The very first bite you will be hooked. These sandwiches were the best I have eaten. We have tried all the other ones, but never again. Firehouse will be the only one I ever spend money on again. Seriously the best food and staff was very nice and knowledgeable. If I could give more than 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Visited this Firehouse Subs location today for lunch.  The restaurant was moderately busy with customers, yet service was adequate. Approximately 5 minute wait for food after order was placed.  I had the New York Steamer combo. Sandwich was good, and combos supplies a bag of chips and a soft drink. This location offers a Coca Cola Freestyle drink unit, a huge plus for me. I enjoy the Freestyle's almost limitless number of flavors available.  Perhaps in my old age, I am coming too value-driven (cheap), but despite the sandwich tasting good, it appeared small. Notice the presentation as pictured below. Not an impressive display for almost $10.  Next time I'm in the mood for a sub for lunch, I'll seek out a Sheetz location, as I note in another review."}
{"text":"Its one of those days that im working(hardly) driving around waiting for people and I get hungry...x( As I was asking my stomach what it wants and also being careful not to consume anything salty due to hereditary blood pressure problems, I come across this joint....again. Then my taste buds took over and forgot everything else besides salivating over and devouring the Smoked House Beef and Cheddar Brisket. I then Grabbed!! the 100% Pain sauce and started attacking this sandwich. As I was murdering it, I remember telling my self \"man! this is a good way to fill the void\" and at the same time the 100%pain sauce was making all my mucus membrane come out places where I never knew it could.  I'm sure theres lots of other sandwiches thats good but everyone should atleast try the 100%pain sauce. After trying the sauce, ill guarantee youll be able to handle any other spicy food out there.  Till we meet again brisket!"}
{"text":"I guess I have to spell it out. There was something wrong with this food and it made me ill shortly after eating it. I hope they have improved their food handling since launching this location."}
{"text":"I had to pick up food for a meeting, I have got to say the service is amazing. The crew is fast and convenient. Great job you guys, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Really delicious sandwiches, high quality meats!  My only complaint is that they did not list the large (12 Inch) price on the menu clearly.  Truthfully, we, probably, would not have ordered if we had known the price as we are on a strict budget right now and it got expensive for our family of five.  Otherwise, really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, however they always make a mistake the order every time. That's to bad Because I live down the street and would go more often"}
{"text":"This is a standard firehouse - good, warm subs! They also have one of those coke machines where you can pick flavors and such... The parking gets a little hairy so come early or just try to avoid peak eating times or prepare to walk from a couple parking lots away..."}
{"text":"By far this is my favorite hot sandwich place in town. To me, it's very different from subway/port of subs type of sub place. Instead of build-your-own, you choose from a menu of different subs offered. I'm sure you could add/subtract items from the sandwiches if you wanted, but I haven't found any need. Everything I have tried is delicious.  They have a bunch of hot sauces & one of the new soda machines where you can add flavors to everything. (My personal fav are the flavored waters) Usually they give my son a little plastic fireman's hat, which he gets a kick out of. Definitely check them out :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  A little expensive my sandwich medium sized and kids meal was $14.00.  None the less it was delicious.  Very clean and helpful friendly staff"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. Flavor was good. But the price was too expensive for what we got.  They charge $2.00 more for a foot long with double the meat. There was barely anything on it!   If these are franchises, this one better keep their quality control up."}
{"text":"Adapting to the life in Las Vegas Nevada, trying to know the neighborhood came across with this place with excellent sandwiches, tried 3 different kind so far and every single one of them is better than the last one, trying to try them all before I get to Phoenix AZ, hopefully they have some firehouse subs back home."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time eating Firehouse subs and I have to say I was very pleased! I don't normally like my sandwiches \"hot\" or \"toasted\" but I was willing to try their hot subs and see how they were. Let's just say I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I love Firehouse Subs.  Soooo delicious!  I'm a regular here because it's close by.  Even if I wasn't close, I'd still be a regular.  I haven't had a bad sub or bad service here yet (knock on wood).  Love the sub card they have, too.  I always enjoy it when a place rewards me for eating there on a regular basis.  They just added a touch screen fountain pop machine, too, which I thought was cool since I'm a computer nerd.  It's not the cheapest place on earth, but that's my only gripe."}
{"text":"Finally another sub chain to break the subway Monopoly. A little more money than subway, but when you bite into the sandwich, you taste Meat,and when you're done you are stuffed. Will return."}
{"text":"Food...pretty good for fast food subs.  Ambiance....interesting decorations and enough elbow room.  Staff...ok, I guess.  Verdict...it's a little pricey for what you get but if you're in the mood for a good tasting sub you wont go wrong here."}
{"text":"Have been here several times now and love the food.  Just tried the Hawaiian pulled pork and added some spice to it from the amazing selection of hot sauces they have out for use by customers.  Very filling and getting to choose a drink from their soda machine (especially diet) made it a very nice lunch...."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been in dozens of times and will say I've never had a bad sandwich! Fresh. Hot. I usually order the Hook-n-Ladder. The ham is better than you can buy at the store, so I treat myself to one of their combo meals at least once a month.   They also have one of those really cool drink machines. I get to try all sorts of drinks I normally don't find anywhere else.  I look forward to showing my ID on my bday to get my free sandwich. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love Firehouse. This is the best one I have gone to from the food to the service. They greet you when you walk in the door and just continues from there. The location is the only reason for missing a star. It is a little hidden upstairs unless you look up and see the sign. When you see it head on up. The quality food and friendly people there are waiting."}
{"text":"I went to Firehouse for the first time this past weekend. The place was clean and I enjoyed the decor.   The sandwiches were very good and fresh. The brisket and cheddar sandwich was really good. I also split the engine company sub with my fiancee and enjoyed the sandwich. The sandwiches were made within 5 minutes of the order.  I liked the crushed ice instead of the cube you typically get at most eating esablishments.   I didn't find the food too expensive. The cost for 2 sandwich combos was $16-17.  About what you would pay at Dilly's.  I expect I will hear \"Welcome to Firehouse\" in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always greeted when entering, and love helping out the firefighters.  The King Hawaiian Sandwich with pulled pork and slaw is awesome.  The pickles are awesome, and love the Coke Freestyle machine that they use.  Overall great lunch place."}
{"text":"I initially went into firehouse subs to a questionable experience, but I was quickly contacted by the store owner Ryan who wasted no time remedying that. My friend and I both got the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket and it was amazing. I'm a fan of barbecue food and you can really tell when a business buys quality meat and cheese.  I couldn't say anything better about my experience. I know I'm not going to subway or quiznos ever again after trying a real sub."}
{"text":"I love firehouse subs. Had one at my old hometown   and the price is good and the food is great. Meatball sub is my favorite along with hook and ladder."}
{"text":"Firehouse is the best sandwich shop in town, and the staff at the Lake Mead store is top notch.  The meatball sub is the best in the business!  The staff took care of my kids the whole time; special orders, firehouse hats, and continual checking to see if we are enjoying our meal.  They must be well coached."}
{"text":"I called in a order 10 mins before closing for a meatball sub on wheat. Great job, great tasty sub on very fresh bread. I was greeted with smiles and wonderful service. It's the intangibles that satisfy customers. Clean store, respectful and understanding crew. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"There are a lot of great choices for lunch in the UNLV area, it's hard not to find yourself going to the same dining spots over and over. Firehouse is usually an every other week or so lunch spot, and it never disappoints.    The staff here is very friendly and accommodating.  The food is served fast as can be expected in a busy lunch time restaurant.  Even with all the traffic in doors, the food is delivered direct to your table and staff checks on you and takes away your trays.  I will continue to keep this firehouse on my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I'm a sub sandwich lover - however, in all my 58 years of eating sub sandwiches, this was the worst I EVER had!  I ordered the \"Italian\" thinking it would taste like the Italian subs on the East Coast, New Jersey.  Anyway, the person taking my order asked me \"would you like everything on it\" my answer yes, thinking lettuce, tomato, onions, oregano, oil, and vinegar - that's it.  She said everything - Mayo, Mustard, oil, ....  I responded - Hell no? No mustard no mayo - not on an Italian.  I should have stopped there and left.  Anyway, they gave me their version of Italian - -- I can't even begin to say how disappointed I was.  The first bite was just God awful - like someone poured sweet sauce all over the sandwich - WTF - they used sweet vinegarette dressing, no oil  & white vinegar, no oregano, no cappicolla instead Virginia Ham, and artificial pepperoni instead of Genoa Salami.  The bread was soft and poofy - had no substance.  This was one sorry sub and even sorrier customer.  Never again. This was my first and last time at any Firehouse Subs ...."}
{"text":"This place is worth checking out atleast once. The variety of sauces the theme is okay.  Team looks enthusiastic about making sandwiches.  If you're tired of Subway/Port of subs try this place."}
{"text":"I have lived in the Valley for over 15 years, and alumni of asu, and I just enjoyed Firehouse Subs for the first time. The sub I had was amazing, I encourage you to try their Smoked Turkey Breast sub. The franchise owner, John and Linda, came over to our table to ensure that we were satisfied. Their customer service was exceptional. The down to earth owners, along with the franchise give them a lot back to the community.   I was hesitant at first because I thought mill was crowded in that parking would be a pain. I was very wrong, as there was plenty of parking pacifically for Firehouse Subs directly behind the shop.   I will be back and I encourage everyone else to as well."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  The Italian sandwich was excellent.  The staffs were very nice and the atmosphere is good. Will be back soon ÷)"}
{"text":"Service here is awesome! We had a surprise get together for a friend's birthday here yesterday and they were so fast. My friend dropped her sub and they gave her a new one for free, a really nice gesture. I had the Italian sub and it was great."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my work and so I end up going here often.  They have great sweet tea and the sandwiches are pretty tasty.    The workers are friendly and during the lunch rush they're fast and efficient.  The wait is never super long, whether eating there or having it to go."}
{"text":"Really great  brisket.  Manager was kind of rude to her girls about what was on the tv. Nice and clean dining room."}
{"text":"Worlds. Best. Subs. Yum. And you know what else? No matter which Firehouse you go to, it all tastes exactly the same. So, so yummy!"}
{"text":"Always good sandwiches, great service and delicious cookies! Great place for a quick lunch with lots of options."}
{"text":"Sooooo glad Firehouse is back in Gastonia!   Meatball sub is the BEST in town and they have made it even better with a sweet & spicy version.  Wife sticks with roast beef but loves it every time.  Steamer makes their sandwiches the best!  They have some interesting new choices too, so looking forward to trying those as well!"}
{"text":"Food is pricy and Genisis the cashier needs training on her customer service skills. Very disappointed with the customer service and they no longer offer the chicken salad."}
{"text":"Hands down the best experience I've had at a fast sandwich shop. The cashier knew all of the options and made sure to ask if each topping was ok and even suggested the lighter fare options since I mentioned I was not very hungry. I decided on the steak and cheese and it was out pretty fast. Fresh wheat bread, deliciously cooked steak & mushrooms, and perfectly melted cheese delivered right to the table. Even the Apple Pay was fast! Very clean restaurant and friendly staff. Wish it were closer to my daily commute!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for small portions. service was uniquely horrendous, i.e. server saying \"my b\" when messing up a name, and overall rudeness. it would be hard to imagine worse service, as well as the delivery time of snail. they could not have taken any slower. will not be coming back, which is a shame because it's so close to home."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, the healthy choice bread is not my favorite so I would recommend substituting it with the regular bread. Other than that this is a great place to eat. The variety of choices for hot sauce is fantastic. And the owners and staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"The subs here are delicious. They have a wide variety to choose from. Its a great spot to stop by and grab a quick sub for lunch."}
{"text":"Good food but very expensive bring the bank truck meatball sub , steak/cheddar are  very good subs"}
{"text":"I give them 1 star because the Hook and Ladder sandwich was delicious and always is, no matter what location you visit. Aside from that, this location was very bad. I won't return.  One lady with her elderly mom and two kids, was trying to use a gift card and held up the line. The employee openly smirked and eye-rolled directly in front of them and could only have been worse if she'd shouted in their faces. Then they took my order and was instructed to sit down and they'd bring my food to the table. My sandwich didn't come after quite a few minutes and when I went up there she said, \"Well we called your name.\" Then they brought the wrong food to the teens at the next table and when they informed the woman it was the wrong food, not only did she not apologize, she made it sound like their fault. As I was leaving, a couple was going over their receipt and saying they were overcharged.  Having said all that, I was only there long enough to eat and go. This place has employee problems."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs never fails to impress! Some cool things they are known for: 1. They have a Coca Cola Freestyle machine. (I am not a big coke drinker, so I always get excited to see these machines because I can get flavored water.) 2. They offer a menu of subs under 500 calories. (My favorite is the Turkey & Cranberry.) 3. They have a pretty large selection of hot sauces from all over the U.S. They are labeled 1-10 depending on how spicy they are. 3. The subs are great- around $10 for chips and a drink, but they are well worth it."}
{"text":"Yum! Went there today for the first time and loved it. My parents have been raving about the one in Las Vegas, so they were excited to take us there. The subs were amazing, and there were a ton of sauce options on the counter (which I LOVE!). I even splurged for a brownie, which I never do at sandwich shops, but it was so tasty!    The service was also wonderful, I could tell the staff was all happy to work there and they really made it a point to make their customers feel welcome."}
{"text":"I was exited when firehouse subs opened one on lake mead, I did not want to go to  the one on eastern the parking there can get crowded. I had the lg italian( genoa salami,pepperoni , ham , lett, tom,dressing , deli mustard and provolone cheese) on wheat bread , I wish they had crusty Italian bread.  The bread was soft, it had alot of meat. The sandwich was on the sweet side must have been from the dressing. I could only eat half of it to sweet , next time no dressing. Wife had the BBQ brisket and cheese . It was alright had a nice smoke flavor. BBQ alright maybe a little sweet.           I wish these sandwich places had french fries instead of chips.  The tables r arranged oddly so if it is crowded u can hardly walk w/ o bumping into someone. Wife went to get refills and found it easier to exit restaurant and walk around the building to return to our table. I hope she did not see me laughing , kinda funny."}
{"text":"There is absolutely no cooking going on here. They put very small amounts of meat in a steamer and slap it on a supposedly Italian roll along with cheese and/or lettuce and tomato sliced so thin it only has one side. If you want crappy food that is cheap, this is the place for you. There was so little meat on the sandwich that l cut the roll in half and put all of the ingredients on half. I left hungry, and will NEVER return."}
{"text":"I love this place....  People always friendly.   Great food for a great price.  Always clean too.  If you love sweet ice tea they have the best.   I go at least once a week"}
{"text":"These guys are the absolute best. The sandwiches speak for themselves but the service is the best in the valley. It's definitely the exception to the rule the way these guys go out of their way to help out and treat their customers right. Above and beyond - they have me as a life time customer. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Don't ever eat here. The service is absolutely awful. They screwed up my sandwich... No joke, 5 times. The staff, Gina specifically, gave me my money back without me even asking... And said \"we apparently can't get this right, so here's your money back\". I'm writing this review after just leaving the restaurant and cannot believe how rude and careless this entire staff is... I will NEVER eat at another Firehouse sub."}
{"text":"I love sub sandwiches so I totally expected to love this sandwich but it was a big disappointment from start to end when I opened up my sandwich it was Tiny so maybe 4 inches long and it was soaked in dressing the bread was all soggy it just tasted like a dressing sandwich i ordered the small veggie but I just thought it would be bigger than 4 inches so beware"}
{"text":"Great value for your money! Can't compare to Subway sandwhiches.  Larger variety of sandwhiches, fresh ingredients, and the cola machine that allows for a combination of flavors always gets a kick from the kids!"}
{"text":"what i have to say is short and sweet.. the best steak sub. i've had!! service was great !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a sandwich late one afternoon, and we were so impressed with the compassionate staff.  I was on crutches and couldn't believe how kind the staff were with helping me get set up with seating.  Rare to find such caring folks!  Our meals were also excellent! Thank you for being so kind."}
{"text":"Delicious and hearty subs, friendly staff, reasonable prices! Our go-to place for days when we need uplifted with a great treat! Editing this from 5 to 4 stars due to one consistent problem.... special orders!!! Almost every time we try to do a special order (e.g.-add jalepenos or no mayonnaise, etc) something INVARIABLY gets screwed up. Now as we usually order several subs in one order (lunch order from 4-5 of us at work), perhaps the problem is ordering in a group. We have even tried pre-ordering online (many times), but there is always an error somewhere in the order.  Again, delicious, big-ass, hearty sandwiches, but pls guys, keep the mayo off my brisket!! Yeck!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've used their app to order food from there, and it will for sure be the last! It specifically states on the checkout method that it will not charge your card UNTIL pickup. Well not only did they charge my card prior to pickup, but they charged the card THREE times. There's no way around checking out without adding a card. Other food order apps aren't like that. So essentially we were just charged almost $80 for two subs. Wtf?! NEVER AGAIN! Not to mention the \"manager\" Josh was a total prick.  When we asked him why we were charged three times prior to pickup, his answer was: \"and... what's the problem?\" Are you kidding me?! No customer service skills what so ever. He was even super rude on the phone prior to ordering. Maybe they should re-think their staff selection, especially when choosing a manager. The food is good, (actually the best subs I've ever had), but with that kind of service a $10+ sub isn't worth the drive or time. I'd rather give my money to cheba hut- or even subway. This place is a joke! Take your money elsewhere and get treated better. Edited to add: my sandwich was so soggy that it just fell apart. It was soaked clear through the wrapping. Super disappointed I paid $10+ dollars for a sandwich I can barely eat due to it just deteriorating in my hands. Not to mention the limes were basically rotten & brown & not on ice- which I'm sure is a health code violation since they were clearly sitting at room temperature for quite some time. Makes me wonder what else could be in violation here if something this small is being neglected?"}
{"text":"The steamer, pastrami and corned beef served hot, is very good. But the meatball sub is the bomb. Really like the funky soda machine, but sometimes its out of what you really wanted. Owners gave me a free soda on my next trip to make it up to me though, not usual for a chain store. But these guys are better than chains in lots of ways, high quality ingredients and generous portions are just a couple."}
{"text":"Always great food and service! Friendly staff!  Everything on the menu was really good. I usually split the steamer and the Italian with my husband. I like how you can pick out your own chips. The Coke machine with all the flavors"}
{"text":"Good food - served quickly! Amanda C. waited on us and was so friendly and efficient, kindly explaining our many options to us. Give the girl a raise!"}
{"text":"The food is good not great. The service is great tho. The staff is friendly and professional. They remember you from prior visits too. The establishment is clean and inviting. I don't really have any complaints. It's the crew and atmosphere that makes it a great place. The food isn't bad either. Definitely beats subway and Quizno's tho."}
{"text":"Walked down from my office a few blocks away to redeem a free sub card- the turkey salsa verde was really good! Nice people working in the restaurant, and didn't take too long. Looking forward to trying other subs."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm very upset right now. Very, very upset. It's Friday night and I wanted to get something a little nice for my parents and brother to have for dinner. I drive the 20 minutes it takes me to get to this Firehouse, I order, and the girl behind the counter tells me it'll be a 15 minute wait. There was no one there, but I let it slide. I had no where else to be. They're done on time, I'll give them that. But as soon I get home and give them to my family, I see that they didn't even make them right. I ordered a Hero with no ham. They put extra ham. It says \"No Ham\" on the receipt. I ordered 2 of the Cheddar Briskets with no mayo. The one has mayo, and they forgot the cheddar and bbq sauce on the other. Really? Seriously? I paid $10 a piece for those damn sandwiches. I drove out of my way to get them. It already took way too long for those girls to make them and they do it wrong. I hope they lose their jobs. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. They're probably the same age as me, early college years. I know exactly what it's like to work in food and customer service. If I had done that, I wouldn't have a job right now. I'm never going to that location again and I'm definitely calling there tomorrow to speak with the manager. All you do is make sandwiches. It can't be that hard to get my damn order right, especially when I'm far more than polite and understanding to you."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is very pricey I will say, but you get what you pay for. I like the club on a sub. the sweet ham compliments the whole sandwich perfectly :) everytime my boyfriend and I go I get that, he gets a new sandwich everytime. They have one of those new coke machines with different drinks and flavor combinations, I always get the cherry Sprite. Overall this is a very very good sandwich shop, but if you go be prepared to spend a lot."}
{"text":"Firehouse subs is supposedly another high quality all fresh sub shop among the others that have  Come on to seen in recent years along side jersey mikes and jimmy johns. Question is what they serve is it fresh and is any good.  Well I opted for a meatball and provolone with a sweet and spicy sauce . Sad to say this sub was less than pleasing . Let's 1st start off with the meat itself tasted like it came out of a bag not homemade at least from what I tasted .   no flavor in the meat just plain bland. Second the sauce was from a can obviously and didn't have any flavor or punch to it. Have no clue what they are talking about spicy . There was no spice to this sauce whatsoever.    And finally the provolone cheese . What little there was I couldn't even taste it. Talk about being cheap it , the cheese disintegrate as it covers the meatballs . You can see for yourself on the picture I posted. Sorry firehouse but maybe your the founders which are fireman should stick to putting out fires and leave the sandwich making to the other guys ."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service.  Best Philly Cheeze Steak sandwich I have had in a long time.  I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches as always. My favorite is the New York Steamer. Best Pastrami anywhere, for sure. Someone please open one of these in Flagstaff, we could certainly use one!"}
{"text":"I had the cranberry turkey sub.  Was more than I expected.  Lots of turkey and what surprised me was the turkey was warm.  Nice clean, friendly atmosphere. And if you are a fireman/firewoman the pictures and decor are outstanding.  Worth a trip."}
{"text":"First, let me just say that I believe Firehouse Subs is by far the best sandwich shop in the world, and the New York Steamer (with extra meat, twice toasted) is quite possibly the single greatest accomplishment that mankind can ever hope to achieve.  Also, I am in no way affiliated with Firehouse Subs, though opening up a shop would probably be the greatest thing ever. I would be in absolute heaven if I could eat a sandwich from Firehouse Subs for every meal, every day, for the rest of my life.   I am reviewing this location in Chandler, AZ because; 1) I am moving to Phoenix so I will soon be a frequent diner, and 2) the service is absolutely perfect. I have been to this specific location four times, though I lived next to one in Florida for two years and have consumed more sandwiches from that Firehouse location than most people would consume in their lifetime (at any sandwich shop). The staff is extremely nice (the gentleman that made my sandwich even remembered my name and sandwich order, after only the first visit!; granted I returned the same day, but still :P), and the shop was clean, and there was plenty of staff to take my order quickly.  My sandwich (the New York Steamer, which I usually always order; though I have had all their sandwiches plenty of times), was absolutely perfect and tasted just like I remembered in Florida. The sweet and savory steamed meat, cheese, and sauces lovingly placed between the two slices of toasted bread form a taste unlike any other. The bread is amazing; it's soft, yet toasted enough to where it crackles when grasping the sub, and the process of steaming the meat releases flavors that are unmatched at any other sandwich establishment. I have no issues stating that Firehouse Subs is the absolute best sandwich shop in existence. If you disagree, well, enjoy your inferior subs...more Firehouse for me!  If you are looking for an awesome place to eat, look no further than Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"Went in and got the steak sub. Gotta say this is one of the better subs I have had around here. Fairly quick service the bread was soft and tasty. I also love that they contribute to locals fire safety causes. I highly recommend trying them!"}
{"text":"Subs are good. Very disorganized. It appears staff need training. They messed up so many orders. Phone orders not ready. Totally forgot one women. Then they make subs twice for one guy. Call out names on people not there. And the poor manager who was great can't get them to do things right. Very messed up. I think training is Needed."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I usually get the same exact thing every time I come here.  Whatever their steak and cheese sub is called is so good.  Who would have thought mayo and mustard would be a good combo on here, but it is so delicious I don't change a thing!  It's not a philly cheesesteak, but it is just as good, in a total different sub type of way!  Their meatball sub is awesome too, although I think over ate it, because I used to eat it ALL THE TIME, and now I'm kind of sick of it.  Also one of the few places that has sweet tea in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is just as good as any other firehouse subs. I go with the Italian on wheat very solid sub. Not sure about the parking there I had the sandwich dropped off by a friend."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place next to my work office"}
{"text":"I love all their food they have here. When you go in the staff is all nice to you and the place is always  clean. If you want a good sub this is the place  to go . Plus it helps  out our firefighters."}
{"text":"Got a free coupon for free sub so we are trying it out.  I must say it's really good.  I'm having an Italian with no cheese and Big Mike is having the Steak and cheese.  I'm surprised with how yummy they are.  A must try for sure.  They also have salads witch is a plus."}
{"text":"Sub was decent, but the service was really bad. The staff was making other people's subs who came in after me before making mine and when I asked them about it, I overheard one of the workers call me rude."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever giving Firehouse a go. As soon as I walk in the manager spots me from the sandwich line and literally hurries to the girl at the counter yelling \"check her coupons!\" eyeballing me until I reached the register. First red flag. I pretend I don't hear, inform the cashier it's my first time visiting and all she says is \"can I see those?\". She eyeballs my coupons, which I didn't realize were expired (a co-worker gave me a freebie medium sandwich coupon raving I had to try this place) and tosses them on the counter in front of me smirking saying \"you can't use any of these\". No biggie, the sandwiches are 10 bucks or less so I go for a philly. As I wait for my food I'm literally stepping over pieces of bread on the floor, nearly sat on remnants of a salad, and had to wipe a seat down to wait on my sandwich to come off the assembly. In all, the experience was mediocre. The place was not at all crowded. One thing I can say about the infamous Subway, the service is more than likely to be great- even if the food sucks. Step up Firehouse."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Great services even my mommy-allergic son trips are successful here!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time we had been to a firehouse subs. We were impressed. The subs were very fresh and tasty. I like it better than Subway. Lots of guys eat here....."}
{"text":"I always love firehouse subs but this store is the best.   They went out of their way to let us know about kids eat free on Wed and Sunday's.  They also told us about the birthday club as it was my son's birthday.  They were gracious when I threw my sandwich in the floor.  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Just waited in line for 15 minutes, wasn't greeted nor asked what I wanted. Absolutely terrible customer service, I'll take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The steak n cheese and the oh em gee this thing is amazingggg cheddar smokehouse brisket is AWESOME! This place is amazing, we love the energy here and the food! The chocolate chip cookies are delicious!! The sweet tea with cane sugar is fantastic, and the variety of hot sauces is the bomb!!! Oh, I must admit the turkey sub is BLAH, I'm just keeping it real... They need to put a little umph in it! But for real, if you want to make your tastebuds happy, this is the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, better than Subway, little bit of a wait & a little pricey, compared to Subway, good change of pace.  Definite would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I very much like their Hook & Ladder Sub.  Very tasty and hits the spot on a lazy afternoon.  A huge array of hot sauces displayed at the counter adds a nice touch.  Lacks 5 stars due to:   1) Cost (a bit too pricey for what it is).  Much better deal to get a JJ Gargantuan at Jimmy Johns.   2) Slow service.  Waited 15min once.  Way too long.  They were pretty busy though. 3) So a large sub combo doesn't actually come with a large drink?  You want me to pay how much more?"}
{"text":"A local friend took us here for lunch while in Vegas-- Tastiest hot sandwich i have ever had.  Be wary of Daves Insanity Sauce though.  Hopefully they open one in California or else its back to vegas for more!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is a hidden gem. Club on a sub!! Super fresh bread and great deli meats. Up next, hook and ladder!!"}
{"text":"I've known of Firehouse for a long time and I go once in a blue moon. I love the #5. It's the Turkey Bacon Ranch sandwich. The sub is high quality (better than Subway), but the staff here lacks enthusiasm. Their \"welcome to Firehouse\" greeting is weak and there is no eye contact. Besides that, when I walked in here no one even greeted me. I was really shocked. I'll go to Firehouse, but not this location again."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and even asked if we had ever been in before so they could explain how they are different than other sub places. I had the meatball and it was delicious. I couldn't find a fork and knife at the soda station and someone must have known what I was looking for because one of their employees immediately brought me out some silverware. They kept checking on us to make sure we were doing alright. Great service and yummy food!"}
{"text":"First and last time today. Terrible bread, poor meats, puzzled look when I asked for my sandwich cold? Jersey Mikes a little better.  For the real deal  Italian sub go to Niccoli's deli or DeFalco's, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Not really a sub type of guy but this one hit the spot. I had the turkey breast on wheat and my best description would be if Quiznos and Subway made a love child. You could tell the quality of ingredients was high and everything was as fresh as it could be....amazing at what a difference that makes. If you have an appetite get the 12 inch, the 8 inch just didnt look like it would get it done for myself. The theme of the place is pretty cool and it really adds to the atmosphere when there are real firemen eating their lunch there.   Next time I am in the mood for a sub this will be my spot."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal at Firehouse Subs.  I got my standard Engine Company sub (turkey & roast beef) and the wife got her standard Engineer sub (turkey & mushrooms).  Both were wonderful.  I only wish they had a size about 3/4 of their smallest \"Medium\" sub:  the medium is just a tad too big and splitting one medium between the two of us (which involves a compromise since we want different things) isn't quite enough.  Oh, well.  Love the food."}
{"text":"First time here and was not very impressed.  I got the pastrami sub and theres was 2 little pieces of meat and all bun. Flavor was good if not for all the bun. But  I\"ll go elsewhere for my sub Fix.  I do like the hot sauce selection...Nice touch there"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Firehouse Subs I have been too.  Place is always empty, rude service and takes like 15mins to get a sandwich even with no customers.  I have tried like 3 times now with same situation each time.  This is not how the franchise normally would operate.  Feeling disappointed again.  Hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"Delicious and good location. Friendly workers and store is well kept. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect as I have never heard of Firehouse Subs.   First of all, they made this giant eye sore of an old building in our town look very attractive again.    Great decor throughout the building with a really cool painting on the wall. Being a new store, the people working there seemed to be having fun and enjoying themselves while making my order and accommodating my many questions I brought to them.    Food was the bomb too.   Overall, it was a great experience.   Get the Brisket, one of a kind sandwich."}
{"text":"I usually love this place.  Todays sandwich had onions, which I requested no onions, The top of the bread was saturated.  In know the sandwiches can be a little messy but this was awful.  Also It didn't look freshly made.  disappointing day in the land of $8 lunches for sure."}
{"text":"Just talked to the owner here at this location. I can tell you this man truly wants every customer to  feel like they have been given great customer service. I had a problem with my sub and he genuinely wanted me to be taken care of. Go to this location if you are in the area."}
{"text":"great sub!  i had the briskett..yumm  sauce packed with meat... will reccomend !"}
{"text":"I had the Turkey & Cranberry sub without tomatoes and I loved it! I would definitely recommend trying it, if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches but I don't understand why the long wait to get your food they seem to have plenty of employees working in the back counter plus the real good sandwiches you can only get them medium."}
{"text":"Bad experience.  Staff lost our ticket,  staff wrote down order and then put the order at the end of the line really.  Then food came and it was wrong except for kids meals.  Kids finished eating still no food.  I went to counter and they lost it again.  I stood at the counter to make sure it was done right.  They ran out of tomatoes had to cut more.  Had to get the sub to go.  No apologies nothing from staff.  Also no coke in machine. Total time 1.5hrs for a sub!"}
{"text":"The last few months I have eaten the entire hot sub menu, everything is good. You can't go wrong with the \"hook & ladder\" or \"club on a sub\". The bread is the best. Never Subway again."}
{"text":"The worst firehouse i have ever been to,the employee's do not have any enthusiasm like normal firehouse when you come in the door the management act's like you owe them something, food was cool and took forever to get then it was cooled"}
{"text":"First time here,and will definately be back! Great food, friendly staff and clean fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Yummy super fresh sandwiches.   Good service!! People are friendly prices are fair very clean store good drinks"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to stop and get a tasty meal, with tons of options on the menu they are sure to have something you'll enjoy. Definitely try the Meatball hoagie, that is my favorite.  Nice decor in the place as well, not a lot for the kids to enjoy though if you have young ones.  Worth a stop every now and then though."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse.   I eat here 1-5 times a week.  The staff is always kind.  And for some weird reason....they know me!"}
{"text":"Placed a Togo order and still waited 45 mins to get one sub. Absolute waste of time and money. I hope they replace the people who don't know what they are doing. Until then I'd rather have subway. A complete let down. So disappointed with this experience and I frequent here at least once a week. So long firehouse."}
{"text":"Guys I'm here to tell you that Firehouse Subs is a great place to go if you just want to eat a sandwich. The place was made by firemen so of course they know how to make a good sandwich because these guys aren't messing around! My dad was a fireman and I know that when you're putting out a fire or trying to help a guy that was run over on his motorcycle, you don't want to be hungry because you had a Lean Cuisine for lunch! You have to eat like a real man!  They've got a ton of sandwiches with basically anything you want, but they have mostly hot sandwiches, so if you want a cold sandwich maybe you should go somewhere else.  Also this location has a selection of over 20 hot sauces, and they're labeled with numbers so you know which ones are the hottest! So put a bunch of hot sauce on your sandwich and eat the whole thing because that's what you need to do to be ready for a fire!  This place is right across the street from a firehouse too so maybe if you're lucky you can see the fire trucks go on a mission but even if they don't, there's a mural on the wall that shows the firehouse so you can look at that too!"}
{"text":"Finally had Firehouse a few weeks ago... delicious cannot wait to go back and get another sub."}
{"text":"Subs are pretty good. Have to eat in. If you take it to go it is still good but the sandwich will be soggy because they steam it and then instantly wrap it up."}
{"text":"Sub was ok, not as good as quiznos, but the old bald guy could not get an order right!! Messed up twice so I just took the sub, then heard a lady complain about tomatoes right after........so, check it out if you want, but Quiznos is better, IMHO."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write a review, but after coming here two times in the past month and my order being wrong each time, I will never be returning to this location. I wish the owner was there so I could of expressed this to them, it was that HORRIBLE! My first visit was ordered for takeout, one sandwich in my order was supposed to have extra bacon on a #6 club, they screwed up so bad they didn't put any bacon on it. The second sandwich was a #6 with peperoncini's added, they were to lazy to cut them up so instead they used banana peppers, which I'm allergic to so I had to throw the sandwich away!  During my second visit, which was just 1 hour ago, I ordered three subs for dine in. I was the first to order and my to buddies sandwiches came out first. Thats just the start to this HORRIBLE experience tonight! My friend ordered which bread, he ended up with wheat. My sandwich ended up taking 25 minutes, and due to that the bread was cold, because we all know the bread going through the toaster is the first thing in the making process at firehouse. I was supposed to have black olives on it, not one was found. My jalapeños that I got on it were chilly cold, they didn't get put in the steamer with the meat, LIKE THEY SHOULD BE! And to top everything off, the hot sauces were not labled 1-10 correlating to the hotness level. So unsatisfied, very obvious that the workers, shift lead, and even the owner doesn't care about their customers."}
{"text":"The best thing about the place is the sauce, which they really talk up. The sandwich however is overpriced, small, wet and soggy. You're better off going to subway but, I wouldn't mind buying their sauce."}
{"text":"I finally got around to checking this place out today.  I'd heard alot of talk about it, but it's kind of out of my way.  With lots of other sub options more convenient to me, I'd been telling myself, \"It's a sub sandwich... HOW much better could it really be??\"  To my surprise, the answer is ALOT better!!  Upon entering, the dining area is extremely spacious and clean.  The staff greeted me promptly, asked if it was my first time visiting, and gave me a quick rundown of the menu and options.  When he mentioned all subs come toasted by default, I wasn't too impressed... with images of a toasted Subway sandwich flashing to mind... I could take it or leave it, but, in Subway's case, generally leave it.  Anyways, since is was Firehouse's default, I left it as toasted... and I'm so glad I did!  I don't know what they do differently here, but it wasn't the same sad attempt at toasting I was accustomed to - it was done to perfection.  I ordered the #4 Italian, and it came loaded with extremely flavorful meats.  I ordered the default toppings, which is referred to as \"Fully Involved\" - it was the perfect mix of veggies to add texture and flavor, but not drown out the flavors of the meats.  As for their default dressing that comes with it, it's superb and has a little kick with hints of horseradish or wasabi.  I will definitely go a little out of my way to come here next time I'm craving a sub sandwich!"}
{"text":"So good. So much better than Subway. I will definitely be going back. The sweet and spicy meatball sandwich is a family fave."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in awhile so I figured I would give it a shot. Now I know why I haven't had the desire to go there. 20 minutes for a turkey sandwich.... NEVER AGAIN!!!  The workers could care less that they had such long ticket times."}
{"text":"Second time at this location same experience, four employees goofing around and one wishing they could be but were bothered with making my sandwich.  Ordered the Italian and it had to have a bottle of dressing on it. Couldn't finish it and won't be going back for a third time."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse.  Been eating the Hook & Ladder every week.  Amazing.  Best sandwich in town!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was efficient and friendly.  My sub was super fresh and tasted great!  I will go back."}
{"text":"Been waiting 20 minutes already for 2 sandwiches. One lady just walked out after waiting 35 minutes for 1 sandwich. When she asked why it took so long, the manager just said sorry. Manager is currently yelling (yes, yelling) at her employees in front of a restaurant full of hungry people. Her employees appear to be working hard while she threatens to cut their hours. Several people got their sandwiches before us even though they ordered after us. We won't be coming back, especially if this manager is working. For upper management, she's a young white woman with blonde hair and glasses. I hope you find someone else to fill this position."}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich. It was good. I ordered a combo which was 10$. I paid for 3 people and it was 32$. The food is alright. You can go to Harris teeter and get a footling sub anyway you want for 5$. Never going to firehouse again."}
{"text":"This place DOES NOT deserve a long, drawn out review so here it is..  The bread was soft, almost soggy even. This was the worst food I've ever had! We had the Hook & Ladder meals and both were AWFUL!  Now, I don't know if this has anything to do with anything, but we went on a day that they were giving away free subs, a few people brought  in cases of water to leave in exchange for the free food, apparently Firehouse was giving the water to local firefighters (I think that is GREAT by the way), but now i'm thinking this had something to do with the quality of their food.. If it were always this bad they'd be out of business surely!  We left and went to Panera Bread- that wasn't much better!"}
{"text":"I love Firehouse Subs. I've been to many locations but this one. I walked in and it wasn't very busy. I was a bit concerned with the person working behind the register. She didn't know how to change an item that's been order. When I became the next customer I ordered a Medium Firehouse sub. I got a Small Steak sandwich that is not even remotely what I asked for. On top of that, given it was my birthday I thought I used my reward (free medium sub ). I was Told I wasn't going to be charged at the registered. Swiped my card for $0 payment and the receipt show nothing. The next day I was charged not even for the right sandwich at least. I'm disappointed in the customer service."}
{"text":"Great place to have a tasty sub! Firehouse theme going on with a friendly staff.I support local spots that help the community. They keep everything steamed so you know its hot and fresh when you bite into it. Props for the fountain drink coke machine, 120 + flavors. Average prices & well worth it."}
{"text":"First time here, and the New York Steamer was delish! Also, love their oatmeal raisin cookies! Nice place, looked clean and I ordered online, which was easy. Definitely, a new favorite,I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"$17 for only 2 sandwiches with no drinks? They aren't that good.  17 mins according to the receipt to make 2 sandwiches? Smh"}
{"text":"Subs are great!  Our favorites are the Engineer and the New York Steamer!  We recently tried their Sriracha Beef sandwich and weren't as thrilled as we are with everything else.  Along with good tasting food comes great service.  They are extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"Service was great food was delicious and prices are fair I would eat here more often than usual it is i would say 10x better than subway"}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Ate in this Friday and our wait time after ordering was 15 minutes to get our food which was mediocre. Got the meatball sub which tasted like frozen meatballs."}
{"text":"I'm a little late in reviewing, but wanted to give a shout-out to Josh and the team at this Firehouse location. When our company was preparing for our annual Christmas Eve Cookout, we were looking for an affordable solution for all the fixins for the burgers - lettuce, onion, tomato, etc.  We needed enough for 300+ people, and the deli party platters just didn't come with the things we wanted, because we were happy to buy some of the things, like cheese and pickles, from the store and dish them ourselves.  They worked with us on what and how much we wanted in each tray and had it all ready for us to pick up on Christmas Eve!   Now I'm not suggesting everyone call them for odd catering requests, but of course I can personally say their sandwiches are awesome too."}
{"text":"The sub itself is pretty awesome. We got a 12inch Italian.   The only complaint is that the employees leave the back door open and as you walk in you can see them smoking. I'm not the type of person to get mad over people smoking... it's just when you're about to prepare my food  and I can see you rushing to finish your cigarette before you fix my sandwich. It's kind of gross..  Tip for Firehouse: If your employees are going to smoke make sure the customers can't see them before they walk in."}
{"text":"Never had a Firehouse sub but have seen many in all our hockey world travels. It wasn't our first choice for a meal Sunday but since we were there for Chipotle we decided to try it. Man I'm glad we did! We had a turkey, chicken and smoked beef brisket sandwich. All three were excellent and the best part was the great selection of sauces to dip your sandwich in from a basic BBQ style to the extreme hot.   Well worth the try if you have never been to one!"}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of Firehouse. Their Club on a Sub is the BEST I've found. This location is always clean and friendly. Seemed like they were short staffed the day we went, so the service was a little slow but our food still came out perfectly delicious. We love the Wednesday and Sunday Kid's Deal - free kids entree with purchase of a sub."}
{"text":"Everyone greeted me when I walked in, super friendly and welcoming. The woman who put in my order helped me figure out what i wanted. The food, environment, and people were amazing. I will be back (:"}
{"text":"Brought family for dinner got fast service. Subs way better then subway. Loved the vintage fire equipment"}
{"text":"Food was good but took 30 minutes to get from the time we ordered.  This location is understaffed and the staff appear undertained. They would be better off closing for the day if they are that thin on help. I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"I like the sandwiches and custom coke machine.  The setup inside is backwards, after you get  your food watch how many people are really confused about where you are supposed to order.  The menu is over the 'end of the line' area and first time I was here i stood here waiting to put in an order and no one said one word to me.  Finally, i noticed 'order' was way at the other end away from the door - just odd.  Also, when you get to the 'order' area, it is now hard to see the menu..  Otherwise, the place is nice and clean, sometimes they seem disorganized in back.  Like it took around 10 minutes to get my order when there was no one else in there???  I don't like that they ask for a donation for firefighters when you order - it is getting old that so many businesses do this now.  I'm patronizing your establishment, don't run me off asking for donations."}
{"text":"They were good the first time I tried them. After that the wait times got longer and longer and the food prices are a little much for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Awesome subs!!! Meatball is the best... And it is super filling. The Philly steak is kind if chewy.... Love coming here though. I just wish that they would do something about the restaurant layout. It is kind of crammed where you line up to order and there is no real clear line or place to go. Kind of confusing and frustrating."}
{"text":"Had the Italian and the Firehouse Steak & Cheese. Both sandwiches came out delicious! Service was decent and the place was clean. Will definitely attend again."}
{"text":"The Italian sub and meatball sub is to die for. I love the huge selection of coke flavored in the coke machine. Great place I go there every Sunday."}
{"text":"Great food! My favorite is the Italian (#4). I like to get it cold (not toasted). But it's good either way. I love they have deals for unlv students; really helps us poor college students out lol.  The staff is really friendly and everyone greets you when you come in. They are also very patient in waiting on you and help you decide if you aren't sure on a sandwich if you've never been there before."}
{"text":"Love this place, my favorite place to eat a sandwich when I need bread. Lol. I  suggest it to anyone who loves hot yummy sandwiches."}
{"text":"Damn good subs.  Admittedly they are overpriced, but if you want to pay double the price for double the taste, this is the place."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!  I stopped by this location, which I've eaten at numerous times before, and had the worst experience today. There were only a few customers in the entire restaurant and nobody in line, yet I still had to wait for an employee to take my order. Finally after placing my order, I proceeded to my seat to wait for my meal where I waited 25 minutes for a simple chicken bacon ranch sub. No food, so I proceeded back to the counter, where once again not one employee could be found. After waiting AGAIN, I just demanded a refund. Unfortunately I will not go back to this restaurant again, as poor service is not worth giving in to just to eat."}
{"text":"i went in today to get my birthday sammich and it was delicious!! everytime i go i have either Courtney S. or Elvin C. pick my sammich and they never let me down!! and Tori is the best sammich maker ever!! i will never have a bad experience there as long as those 3 are working. :D"}
{"text":"Wow looking at the recent hot sauce comment and the harsh words about the owner couldn't be the farthest from the truth from our experiences. The owners are great people, always looking to have their guests have a great experience.  Along time ago they gave us cups for our hot sauce. Their staff explained that it was for the ease of use by the guest and health concerns after watching a child lick the bottle top and the parent just putting the bottle back on the rack. Never held quantity back from our requests. We know this owner represents the best of Firehouse.  They give back so much to our schools and our Town. Love this place. Great Job !"}
{"text":"I went to Firehouse Subs several days ago. When I went to order my food I happen to ask the young man behind the cash register how is was doing. The young man replied \"I have been sick the last few days.\" I told him I hope he gets to feeling better and ordered my food and sat down. A short time later the same young man walked to my table with my food and sat it down. As I started to eat I noticed that the food did not taste quite right, not bad just not right.  It was at this point I could not help to think to myself \"man I hope I don't get sick from the sick employee that just served me my food.\" I made it through about half of my sandwich and my appetite suddenly left me. I left the sandwich shop and did not think anything of it.  Later that evening approximately 5 or 6 hours later my stomach began to hurt. As I looked back on my day I realized the only thing I had eaten in the day was at firehouse. As the night progressed I became very sick, vomiting, stomach cramps and you can only imagine what else. When I looked up the symptoms online the two things I found was food poisoning and the Norovirus. I have been horribly sick over the last several days.  Is all I know is I walked into firehouse subs fine and several hours I was sick!  If your sick stay home, don't serve people food. As soon as I heard the cashier say he was sick I should have walked out! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and I felt very welcomed when I came in for lunch today.  All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.    I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a delicious and quick lunch to satisfy their midday craving."}
{"text":"Great customer service very welcoming first time ever visiting firehouse sub's I'm in love. totally worth the money."}
{"text":"I could eat the New York Steamer everyday and be completely happy.  My brother intoduced me to this place, and I have since been taking other people back to try them too. Long drive from Tucson for a sandwich, but worth the trip.  (Sorry Ma, this is the real reason I am coming home so often....just kidding!) Steamer is an amazing sandwich......I want one just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I have just finished my lunch and this is my second visit to Thai Kitchen. The service both times has been excellent and my meals have been outstanding! I had Chicken Noodle today and it was just as delicious as the Pad Thai I had on my last visit. I will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and won't go back. Totally disappointed. Salad was brown, had maybe 3 tiny mutilated pieces of tomato and pepper. 6 peppercinis and chopped up cheese. The chicken tasted like processed chicken meal, not whole chicken breast. Certainly not worth the $10 I paid for it. Nothing on the sub but cheese and lettuce. No offers of \"fixins\" The manager or whomever was in charge was sitting at a table chatting it up with some other folks and left a newbie running the register. He made a mistake and the poor kid had to find a cook? or someone to help him, who was totally inappropriately dressed in a sleeveless shirt and shorts. Meanwhile the \"manager\" or whomever sat and talked with some men. After the other kiddo fixed the mistake he came over to see if everything was ok, and then sat back down. I have managed a few different retail stores and never would have left a newbie without supervision. That isn't fair to them, or the customers. Just not a nice place to eat. Next time we go to subway."}
{"text":"Yabba Dabba Delicious!  I've only been here once, but I'll be back.  The Hook and Ladder is made with turkey, ham, and yum.  It's soft, it's fresh, it's warm, it's good!  Not much to write about as far as the layout and decor goes.  I guess I could tell you that it's a bit cramped.  The pricing isn't exactly cheap either.  It's a sub shop...and the subs are worth stopping for."}
{"text":"My son and I have stopped by for sandwiches here a few times and have enjoyed them...as Subway is the only game in town since Quizno's went out of business here it was nice to have another sandwich place. The staff is friendly (when you walk in you get a chorus of \"WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE!! :DDDD\" . I like their simple selection instead of facing a huge confusing menu, and the dill pickles are sublime. The choice of drinks is great too, my suggestion would be to offer some Splenda for the tea instead of just saccharine. It has great outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"It's all so good. All. All. Please try the best subs. I love the cheddar BBQ brisket and the Italian subs. I always get a cookie and a brownie when I come as well. Some of my favorite chocolate chip cookies. They steam the bread and I like the fact that there is more meat then bread in the subs."}
{"text":"never been here before I thought I'd check it out although the staff is nice and friendly the food on the other hand is overpriced for what you received. I ordered a large steak sub by itself which came out to $9.52. Sub was mostly bread with a thin layer of meat I was underwhelmed best part of the whole thing was the pickle that came with it."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse Subs and have been daisies with their service until I walked into this location. Steve G. Took my order and I always get a Turkey and Cranberry in a white sub.  Received a wheat Turkey and Cramberry sandwich instead. It is the first time at Firehouse that they got my order wrong.   When I explained to Steve that my order was wrong,  he said he needed to charge me more and he will make another sandwich. I kept the order and left unpleasant.  This was not the kind of customer service I was expecting."}
{"text":"All the speciality subs taste great! They look and taste like they were just out of an advertisement!"}
{"text":"Love this place...we go there at least once a week and the staff is super friendly...they remember what my favorite sub is every time I go in...i def recommend that you treat yourself to a fantastic sub at this fantastic place"}
{"text":"I really liked Firehouse! They served me to my first mind-blowing Italian sub. Firehouse gives discounts to active duty military and also to firemen/search and rescue. I left the 5th star unchecked simply because the price is a bit higher than normal Phoenix sub shops. I plan on going back monthly at the very least!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for subs! The ingredients are always fresh and the portions are great. I've had a variety of subs and have never been disappointed! The staff is super friendly and fast. Great atmosphere, great people, great food. Definitely a win."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular location several times enough to know that the owner of the store was sitting in the lobby and greeted me. Everything was fine until I returned from lunch and notice that my tuna sandwich was toasted. I explained my situation several times until the owners wife got on the phone. I was very frustrated at the time, because I explained to them that I have been asked before if I would like my sandwich toasted. The owner's wife mention that none of her cashiers would ask that question. So as customer in my opinion the owner's wife did not think maybe it has happen or maybe this customer has had other orders with the purchases before or this is not a first time customer of our store to notice who is the owner. I enjoy the tuna from Firehouse Subs, but I will never frequent that store again, and will let co workers also know about the experience. As a store owner take some responsibility that it is possible this has happen when she has not been the store. The overall experience was great until I had to call about my toasted sandwich. I have never had an issue with any previous orders from this location. The subs are good, but the owner's wife is why they receive 1 star."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse Subs!  The briskit and cheddar is the best.  I only wish they served fries and not just chips."}
{"text":"My go to sandwich place here in Vegas.  There are a few things I look for when I move to a city, and a sandwich place is one of the biggest.  The employees great you with a \"Welcome to Firehouse\" every time you walk in the door.  I usually get the hook and ladder.  I love this sandwich.  And then I usually get a nice hot sauce to add to it.  one little tip.  go on your birthday, and you will get a free medium sandwich."}
{"text":"Do not come today. The owner decided not to participate in the Father's Day promo. Cheap move man...  Owner contacted me and sent some coupons for free subs to make up for their mistake. Said the store was new and there was miscommunication with the staff."}
{"text":"I am posting this, so everyone is aware of what can be found in you sub from Firehouse Subs.  This partial piece of a zip tie was found in my NY steamer.  Unfortunately I did not notice it until I bit down and started to chew. It was very unexpected.  I contacted the store immediately, and the manager apologized. An hour later the owner of this franchise called me, and expressed how this could not have come from them, basically calling me a liar!  So I called the county health department.  Two days later I receive a call from an attorney representing them. He recorded our conversation.  Now the attorney and restaurant are claiming the zip tie did not come from there establishment, and basically tough luck on if this zip tie has caused any damage by pain or contaminate disease.  Please NEVER eat at Firehouse subs again, or this could happen to you.   Spread the word!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. They are open until 9pm, I got there at 8:55pm and they already had the doors locked."}
{"text":"I use to go here just about everyday for lunch when I worked in Chandler. The staff is nice and the place is always clean. I've tried just about every sandwich and by far my favorite one is the Smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket. It comes with a nice hickory and tangy bbq sauce. I always get mine with all the veggies.. Lettuce, tomato, onion and mushroom. It's delicious! I would have given this place 5 stars but I'm always waiting about 15-20 mins for my sandwich and the prices are a little too pricey. Good sandwiches though."}
{"text":"I ordered a sub with avocado which was .75 cents extra. Received the sub and it had the most pathetic amount of avocado lightly dusted under a mountain of lettuce. Complained about the avocado and they wouldn't add any more without paying. If I wanted that kind of service I'd go to subway."}
{"text":"First time at Firehouse Subs, greeted  promptly by Zach who was helpful with my questions, friendly and made two great subs for me. I will be back"}
{"text":"Sandwiches  are delicious.  Ingredients are fresh.  They have a good selection to choose from. Very clean and workers are friendly. It's a must try. They are expanding to California soon.  Round up your tab to the nearest dollar to donate to the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation."}
{"text":"very average subs,  I ordered online and they forgot to give us our chips even though we paid for them.  The meatball sub was ok, the bread is not very good.  I would equate this with a subway meatball sub and that is not saying much."}
{"text":"I do not know why I keep going back to this location.  Maybe it is the convenience or maybe I just hope they will get their act together, but they never fail to disappoint.  The food is good... when they get it to you, correctly.  We have a child with a wheat allergy so we always order his food without bread.  The last two times they have brought his sandwich with bread.  It is not like this is a large kitchen and the order gets misplaced.  There are three people working and all are within earshot of the register when I say \"no bread\".  The last time we went, there were only two other families in the restaurant and yet they managed to bring the wrong order to our table and set it in front of us.   Their prices continue to go up while their service continues to go down."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at firehouse! Never have been before and decided to check it out. Cool atmosphere, clean and I love the firehouse theme! The staff was very friendly and food was out super quick! I ordered the medium beef and cheddar brisket sub- delicious! Everything was very fresh!   I drive  by here all the time but never stopped! I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I had a #10.  It was thin sliced beef brisket.  It was amazing and in a non gay way I loved every minute of that beef in my mouth.  I keep thinking about that meat.  That meat is on my mind all the time.  Try it"}
{"text":"PITIFUL! I work in the restaurant industry................  I'd give no stars if I could.   The manager present was a JOKE. First of all, we walk in and there's 2 bags of lettuce laying on the table next to the soda machine. Sounds appetizing right? Completely unfriendly staff, texting on their phones AT THE REGISTER IN FRONT OF THE MANAGER. Trash everywhere, I wouldn't lick the floor for a million dollars!!   Not only did they incorrectly make our sandwich, but they also made the subs on the stainless steel counter with nothing underneath!! Judging by the cleanliness and standards of this place - we will never go back.   Lastly, after observing the staff and management - 20 minutes later the lettuce remained on the table!!! The chip display was sparse. The manager walked by several times and didn't even think to put it away and out of sight of customers. He was small talking the employees about a party..standing there...all of them doing nothing. Sweep the floor? Restock the chips? WIPE DOWN THE COUNTERS? Refill the soda area?   This place is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Wrong chips, wrong sandwich. Didn't deliver replacement. When I pay for a good and service, I want the good and the service and I want it correct. I will NEVER give them money again and will NOT recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good if they are done right. I have a tomato allergy and I say no tomato. Most of the time I get a sandwich there are tomatoes on it. Its like they make them just off the menu and don't take inti consideration what the customer is saying. However, if the sandwich is right it is good. I have had the hook and ladder both hot and cold. The philly like sandwich is also good. If you have allergies you have to make it very clear or they will just make it normal."}
{"text":"Came here to try out firehouse subs for the first time, horrible experience ordered to go wasn't that busy but I'm sitting here and it's been 30 min since I ordered still no food. Would like to talk to a manager about this experience I honestly don't think I will be back to this location or any other firehouse sub. The staff was not knowledgeable about their product and were rude and off putting about us being here. The way they are acting really makes me feel like it's an Inconvenience that we came in tonight. Save yourself don't come here, just go to the store and buy the ingredients  and make it at home because honestly it would probably be faster."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another chance one night when I was too tired/too lazy to go to a sit down restaurant.  I decided to forgo the computer call in order based on the lousy first experience and went up to the counter.  I figured I would cut them slack as I was with my sig. other.    I'm going to sound racist, but you will understand why it is important for me to distinguish the servers this way, (because I did not get their names) but the reality is, they provided great service and made really good sandwiches that night.   Two young kids were working the night shift.  There were no other customers in the shop at 8 p.m, but me and my buddy.  I looked around expecting the two kids to be clueless, lazy or uninterested.  Quite the contrary, the young African American girl who took my order was pleasant and sweet, and the young Asian American guy was friendly, energetic,  and tossed together an amazing Toasted Italian Sub and my sig other's warm Italian meat ball sub.  They were both hot and delicious.  The sandwiches, that is... The two kids were sweet, friendly, energetic, and worked hard even though they did not have to. I was pleased to see ethnic diversity.   good kids.   good sandwiches.   Customer service can make all the difference, right, Boss owner...   I will be back again and changed my review to reflect this.  I'm a fair person and I believe in Karma."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum! I went here for the second time just this weekend. I thinking it's probably a good thing this is not near my house or I would have to spend twice as long in the gym because I would eat here too often.   I had the Engineer Sub, Fully Involved. Bread was fresh, veggies were fresh, the sauces were fab and the meat, mushrooms and cheeses were TDF!  Plenty of seats, good selection, short wait during a busy time period, AND they have Coke Zero! Yay!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Quality ownership and overall good product.  There are a lot places to buy a sub sandwich these days, but I like going here.  Drink machine rocks!"}
{"text":"My favorite subs! Its all fresh and whats stands out is that they steam the subs which make them delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely deserve another star in customer service! Blown away by just how incredibly friendly and helpful each employee had been. I was smiling throughout my whole experience and truly believe this is how every fast food restaurants should be.  After help and guidance from three employees (first time) I ordered the turkey salsa verde from the lite fare. It was very flavorful and I would definitely come back for it again.   They also have a great way of helping our firemen by easily rounding up to the next dollar from your price. Or there's also a donation box in front of the register.   I hope the big boss reads these because they have to know this location has got me hooked! :) kudos!"}
{"text":"I called my order in because I was in a hurry. When I got there the employees were standing around and told me they would start it now which completely misses the point of me calling it in."}
{"text":"Today sucked there's five guys behind the counter and they can't make a sub to save there life. When advised to make my order to go because I waited a half hour the guys said \" we have lots of subs to make\". If you can't do your job then get out of the kitchen, isn't that the only thing you make, subs."}
{"text":"Awesome subs, the bread was fresh and tasty. The staff is very friendly. My kids don't eat sandwiches and tried them and loved them. They gave my kids a fire hat which they were really excited about. Friendly greeting when you arrived and a big \"Thank You\" when you leave. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and a wide variety of subs, hot sauce, and sodas. I had the hook and ladder light and thought it was great. Came hot and fresh and could tell the lunch meat was freshly saved and not prepackaged like some sub places. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh my God slow, like nothing I've seen in a long time, I don't recommend at all. There was no body there and it still took 10 minutes to make my sub, nothing special even."}
{"text":"Zero stars for this pathetic joint! You should be ashamed of yourselves for representing what firehouse subs was established for.  Stop hiring dumb young kids who don't have a care in the world!"}
{"text":"Firehouse isnt my 1st choice for subs. All the other locations the subs just have this bland taste and usually made sloppy. First bite into this sub (firehouse hero) and i looked around to make sure i was actually at firehouse subs. Hands down best sub and location from firehouse! My hats off to the day crew that made it! Thank you for this perfectly made delicious sub! Now some might argue it doesnt take all that much to make a sub, but it sure takes pride and this store has it!  Ive been in the deli business and know a thing or two about making it right. Thank you again you made my day!"}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Sunday night. Place was pretty empty, which probably enabled the staff to give me such great service. They were friendly and attentive  The menu is a bit confusing because the majority of the items was listed as a combo. I'm semi intelligent, so I figured it out in 10 minutes.   Ordered a large steamer sandwich; always  try the pastrami. That is the ultimate gauge for determining the worthiness of a sub shop.I paid under $10 for a large. I took a bite a and the meat was very flavorful with a hint of pickle zing.   This place will give capriottis a run for their money."}
{"text":"This is my third time here and I love grilled chicken so naturally I ordered a custom grilled chicken strip sub. It is amazing! And it tastes the same every time! Just don't get the deli mustard. Bleh... The staff is great also and they have all the hot sauce you could ever want!"}
{"text":"In Vegas last minute needed to find food for about 30 people at a small gathering. Hotel prices are insane for food. Ended up finding this company online they are accommodating & very helpful. Guided me as to the amount of food to order, trusted me to pay cash in arrival without a hold on a credit card and the delivery driver was so sweet. She wanted to help me carry everything but they would make her valet so I told her not to worry. They provided all the dressings, mayo, mustard, plates, utensils and napkins. My only suggestion is that they don't deliver the sandwiches in a pizza box so it's easier to carry."}
{"text":"Forget subway! Had the hook and ladder combo, turkey was warm and moist and full of flavor! The house sauce is to die for, just the right amount of spice. Lovely on a cold day!"}
{"text":"Slowest service of any sub shop around. If they want to stay in business long, they better hire more people to make sandwiches."}
{"text":"A family run location that treats you like your one of their own. The food is Great. Service with a smile. John, Beverly, Aaron & crew, thank you for making a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I got there during the height of the lunch rush and the place was a zoo.  The staff handled it well and pushed out sandwiches as fast as possible.  It still took about 20 minutes to be served.  I had the honey ham sandwich and it was well prepared.  It was interesting watching people trying to figure out the high tech soda machine."}
{"text":"This must of been the 3rd time we ate here. It's always delicious. But my eyes are always bigger than my stomach."}
{"text":"I love this Firehouse Subs and it's employees! Sam and his crew are the best. Rita, the cashier/order taker, is so friendly and knows us by name when we come in. I've not had a bad sandwich here yet and I've had quite a few! My favorite one right now being the chicken Caesar. This location also has the variety coke machine which means a lot of choices for your beverages. Definitely give this restaurant a try when you're by McCarran  Marketplace!"}
{"text":"Their subs are consistently good. You would think steaming a sub would be weird, but it melts everything together nicely. I am stuck on their Hook & Ladder sandwich. First one I ever tried, & can't bring myself to try anything else. Staff is always friendly when I go here. And, the place is nice & clean, too. Always recommend Firehouse Subs to people."}
{"text":"Miserable experience on 10/17/2013.  I specifically asked that a certain sandwich not contain any garnish:  nothing.  I just wanted the turkey, bacon, bread and you're done.  Prior to finalizing the transaction, the guy that took my order would say something like, \"so no mayo?\"  and I'd be like NOTHING other than what's listed on the board minus the dressing.  I don't want anything.  Then the sandwich preparer person, a female, barks that the sandwich also comes with onions.  And I'm like uh, I don't want ANYTHING on the sandwich.  I got home and it was loaded with tomatoes and onions.  I started picking them off but the sandwich stunk of onions so I said screw it, I want my damn money back.  So I drove back and asked for the manager and I told him how I thought this experience was a sick joke since I specifically told his subordinates that I wanted basically a plain sandwich and that I just wanted my money back.  He said that they could fix it and I said no.  That I would not allow them to fix it and that I just wanted my money back.  So this white older gentleman who was listening in to all of this whom presumably owned the place as he was coming and going as he pleased into the back of the restaurant comes out and hands me a $10 and says \"here, happy now?\" and I'm like \"I don't want your money.  I am not owed a ten.  Your staff made an error and I just want my refund back.\"  He proceeds to tell me that when I was there earlier that he listened to me making my request that I wanted the sandwich to be plain and that he hoped that his staff got it right.  So I tell him that then he should be a little bit more sympathetic for my frustration as I had to come back from my home, almost getting rear-ended in the process and now I'm having to deal with this.  He seemed  more agitated with me than with the fact that his staff couldn't get a simple order right.  When he came over to give me his personal $10 bill, he walked over to where I was and was right in front of my chest in a confrontational manner.  What a great example you set for your staff sir.  Way to salvage a customer from this bad experience.  I will never return nor will I ever recommend this place to any one else because of this incident.  Besides, I never really cared for their food and only frequented it because of its convenience.  Jersey Mike's kick their booty anyway but they are too far away."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out in Surprise to celebrate a couple of our grandchildren's birthday's. Our daughter took us all to Firehouse Subs Surprise. The staff was wonderful and the food was awesome. We will be eating here again next time we come out."}
{"text":"Had large steak and cheese sub.  Good sub, but let's face it, you can get subway at almost half the price."}
{"text":"My budddy loves this place and until recently I had never tried it, The sandwichs are good, I myself had the Italian and it was delicious the staff was friendly and I liked the items on the menu enough to want to try something different on my next visit."}
{"text":"I ate here a few times, just always forgot to review it. I just tried a different sub place so I thought I leave a review too for firehouse. First It is not a great sub place, but they do at least stand out. They steam their meats which at first I thought would not make a big difference but it really does. It really make the meats just stand out and it also melts the condiments  especially  the mayo so it spreads it more evenly I think. They do give a very good portion which I was suprise and their veggies are fresh as are most places and their condiments are typical which I wish more places put an emphasis on. It just makes the subs a little bland but I find it very common around here. No one ever spends a little time to make a special sauce for the subs, it is just vinegar, oil, spices(italian spices), peppers, etc. all the time. Their breads could be better, I had some that were good and some that were dried so that is not consistent but the majority of the time, it was good. I do recommend eating there or if you live nearby then it is okay as long as the meats stay warm. If they get cold, they become a regular subs or worst chewy meats. So eat there, so far this is the sub place that stands out the most to me."}
{"text":"Fire house subs is pretty good food. There is sometimes a wait but it's well worth it. Everything tastes fresh and service is typically good. Although the cashier wasn't knowledgeable about the product. I asked what was in the chicken salad and she said chicken but she didn't know besides that. Kinda annoying but no reason to stay away. The #1 thing that bothers me about this place is the straws always have holes in them. I've been here twice atleast and month apart of eachother and both times the straws were broken."}
{"text":"Spectacular taste! Their philly cheese steak is really good and they have a brisket sandwich that my husband loved! Great environment and everyone was nice!"}
{"text":"The food is adequate, but not outstanding. This is a step up from Subway or Quizno's, but won't satisfy anyone who has lived in a town with a REAL classic sub shop. I ordered the Italian and the Club on a Sub. Both tasted fine, but the Club came out smashed and dilapidated.  This location also seems to have a morale problem. During my visit, I noticed the manager chastising the cashiers about who knows what. Suddenly, everyone behind the counter had a tense and sad look on their face as if this kind of treatment happens often. They are walking on eggshells back there. I think it is customary for them to yell some kind of greeting when a customer arrives, but I could barely hear/understand the phrase because it was muffled in apathy."}
{"text":"A sandwich chain \"founded by firemen\" has many locations around the valley, with this one located in the southwest residential area. It is a quick drive from neighboring housing developments for a quick hot or cold sandwich, but it does not taste like a typical sandwich.  I ordered the BBQ brisket & cheddar sandwich on a white bun; wheat buns are also available. For an extra $2, you can get a drink and chips. The sandwich was well toasted, with the brisket soft and flavorful. It is more of a fast food sandwich shop, but not like Subway. When you place your order, the cashier will take down your name and call it out when it is ready, bringing it to your table if you are eating in. It is decorated with all sorts of firefighter related memorabilia, giving the place is comfy feel.  I'd recommend this place for any time of day because they have breakfast sandwiches as well. If you order a large sandwich, you'll have leftovers for your next meal!"}
{"text":"I ate here about two years ago and I ordered the meatball sub.  I was not impressed.  I vowed never to return again.  Three months ago, a friend of mine offered to take me to lunch.  She insisted that we go to Firehouse.  I tried to persuade her to pick a different restaurant, but she insisted that Firehouse was the best.  I ordered the engineer, and I was shocked at how good the sandwich was.  Two days later I went back and ordered the brisket and cheddar sandwich, also an amazing sandwich.  I have eaten there twice a week for the last three months.  I have not had a bad sandwich, in fact they are amazing.  I have not eaten the meatball sub again, but I am convinced I need to try it again.  It is definitely the best sub place in Vegas."}
{"text":"With only 2 other people in the store I would expect my order to be correct. They ask 20 questions about what you want on your sub, it's no wonder they got the order wrong.  Not coming back"}
{"text":"Awful awful awful .... Worst salad ever!! Lettuce was old and half of it was brown..  Husband's sandwich cold and dry..... This is the second try... No better than the first.  And might i add... We were excited to see a firehouse opening here.. We visited one in Germantown TN when there on business... And ended up eating there everyday for a week it was so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Workers were not friendly at all. I was the only one there and it took a long time. And the small sub is so small I laughed!  It was smaller than what I would expect a kids sub to be. Waste of money. The sub was good but way too small."}
{"text":"This location has really changed. Ordered 3 sandwiches by phone, I was given an estimate of 15 minutes, I arrived 30 minutes later they had just started making my sandwiches. The staff is rude they were obviously not well managed, I will NEVER return to this location."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and awesome food. Clean store inside and out. Jeff the store manager engages in excellent customer service.  He has a good sense of humor. I even saw him picking up trash outside.  This is the first time I had been to this store with my wife and dad. Thank you again."}
{"text":"This  restaurant is new to Newmarket, it was recommended by a colleague.  We stopped by today and ordered 2 medium subs, one turkey bacon with ranch, the other with corned beef and cheese, both were succulent and very generously portioned. Our daughter ordered the chili that was excellent with just the right amount of spice.  We took home some brownies with us and had that as a snack later, those were soft and chewy, yum. The decor is fun and looks like a mini firehouse, service was quick and the  staff very friendly.    The prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity. We loved it,  we'll be back."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time at the smiths location on eastern and horizon ridge. They were  professional and very classy huge place. They put things in your sandwhich which stand alone from subway and Jersey Mikes that tastes so good you couldn't make at home. Food quality is wonderful yet prices are the same as the rest.  I ran back there and they were gone. I'll drive the distance though for quality, freshness and taste. I love the treatment you get too."}
{"text":"The employees are horrible. They're rude, and unmotivated, and are the SLOWEST workers I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. It should not take 15+ minutes to make a sandwich. Even if I am the only customer in the place, it will take that long to get my food. The quality of the food is always really inconsistent, and I order the same thing every time. Sometimes it's good, other times it tastes bad, and sometimes it's soaking wet. They make a lot of mistakes too. If it's not on my food, I hear other people in the restaurant complaining about mistakes. It's a shame because I can see that the manager cares, but the rest of the employees look like they're there against their will."}
{"text":"awesome food great sauce and good service, I just wish they delivered lol"}
{"text":"Great place to get  sandwich in Glendale. Always great customer service very clean inside TVs are always on great channels. If you're ever in their area stop in or order out. Never had a bad experience here. Thank you Firehouse!"}
{"text":"It appears I'm the wet blanket on all of these previously good reviews.  I ordered and paid online and went to the store no sooner than 20 minutes later.  When I arrived, I gave the gal behind the counter my name and she pulled out a sheet of paper with our order on it.  She proceeded to type it into the computer as if I had just walked in and ordered.  It took them another 10 minutes to make 2 sandwiches.  It wasn't even close to busy in the store.  There wasn't anyone else waiting for a sandwich.    What is the point of taking online orders if you're not going to have it ready when the customer arrives?  There were 5 kids working with the oldest probably not much past 20.  This store needs some better management or at least supervision.  Another customer walked over to the chip rack and had to wait over a minute for the gal who was stocking them to notice that there was someone behind her.    Just 9 days ago, I experienced an issue with the North Scottsdale store as well.  I don't know if my business is just not welcome or what the deal is, but I think I'm done with Firehouse.  The sandwiches are good but the name of the game in running a successful business is customer satisfaction and they have failed in 2 straight trips."}
{"text":"I've been to the Gilbert AZ location many times and have always been satisfied.  Never a complaint.  I placed a group order (9 sandwiches) this past week for an office birthday lunch.    A few of them were not prepared according to our order which was disappointing, but the store owner promptly contacted me and offered to make it right.  He was very hospitable and clearly understands customer service.  Everyone makes a mistake now and then but the way that it was handled was first class.    The sandwiches are great and they cater as well!  If you have a larger order, call it in ahead would be my advice and ask them to clearly identify the special instructions on each sandwich."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place right now! I love the food especially the meat. Friendly staff! Good price based on how delicious the sandwiches are!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!  Very similar to Penn Station, but the firehouse theme makes it better if you're are looking for a \"Dine-In\" lunch.  (Penn Station's are kind of dull on the inside).  They don't have fries, just chips... but that is fine with me.  Good Food.  Quick Service.  Would Recommend."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, never been disapointed at any of the locations. This one has friendly service and the facility was clean. Steamer is my favorite but all of them are good no disapointments with any of them though."}
{"text":"Slow I mean seriously how long does it take to make a sub. Over priced not worth  $11 bucks for a combo.Wont be returning anytime soon"}
{"text":"Came in after a long day with a long night ahead of me. They were closing in 15 minutes, so half-expected some glares and huffs & puffs from young staff. However, this was certainly NOT my experience. I was greeted warmly and service was quick. The same was for the guy who came in 5 minutes before they closed. Will definitely stop by again.  Also, really dig the variety of hot sauces. Love me some peri-peri!"}
{"text":"Our Kahala Warriors baseball team stopped by after our first game for a quick and light bite to eat before our next game and the food was delicious and the customer service was outstanding.  Kudos to the staff  at Firehouse Subs!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. One of my favorite lunch spots. I order the turkey bacon ranch and love it every time"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are always good here.. I order the turkey, bacon ranch sandwich almost every time. It is my favorite and never disappoints. They have a great selection of chips and I love the coke freestyle machine. So many drink options."}
{"text":"If I compare my experience here to other fast food restaurants, it does fairly well, but as soon as I compare the Italian sub I had here with the one I usually get at Capriotti's it can't hold its own. I brought my nephews for lunch and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  The service was friendly and quick.  The soda machine was a huge hit with the kids, they loved putting some odd flavors together.  For me, I am not much of a soda drinker, but I do like cherry-limeade and here was quite disappointed.  The syrupy-sweet beverage was a brilliant shade of red, but didn't have much flavor besides \"sweet\".  I added 6 lime wedges to balance the sugar, but the improvement was marginal. My sandwich was fairly good and the roll was soft, but the filling was a little bland. If I was on the road and in a hurry for something to eat, this would certainly appeal to me before hitting a McDonald's, but for an extra dollar or two I would enjoy the superior quality of meat and cheese that are offered at Capriotti's."}
{"text":"The food is good, however, the service is poor.  I've been there a number of times.  Each time they have had plenty of help standing around and doing nothing, yet I've had to wait to order (someone could have gotten on the register) and then the order takes a long time to make."}
{"text":"We moved to Anthem this weekend and are still getting settled, so we decided I would run out and grab sandwiches. We've never tried Firehouse before. I ordered a meatball for me and an Italian for my wife. He said the Italian comes with mayo, so I asked that they hold the mayo because my wife really doesn't like it. I got home and hers was loaded with mayo. The meatball was pretty good, but not remarkable. If they can't get a simple thing like no mayo right on our first visit, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Best brisket sandwich in the area! I'm addicted and I go once a week at least. Not good for the waistline, but tastes so good!"}
{"text":"Best cold subs I know of.  Hot subs better than most, but Capriottis is tough to beat there.  Firehouse Subs has a much nicer dining room, though.  The soda machine is a little odd, but amazing once you figure it out.  Their variety of hot sauces is beyond amazing, but be very careful.  Some are hot pepper extracts, and are therefore much hotter than the peppers themselves."}
{"text":"Tried to order pickup (since this place takes FOREVER) and put on hold for 15min, called back and they tried to put me on hold AGAIN, I said no so she begrudgingly took my order. Still not ready when I got there (what is the point of pickup?) and waited for 5 more minutes. The worst service. No apology. They just don't care."}
{"text":"Prime lunchtime and only 1 worker doing orders AND making food. Good luck making it back to work in time."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches, service and positive attitude! My husband and I have gone to the Buckeye restaurant several times and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Since it's a chain, 1 review is pretty much going to be like every other review... All I can say is this: THEY NEED TO GET THAT HAWAIIAN PULLED PORK SANDWICH ALL YEAR ROUND -- cause that's my favorite sandwich but it's only available for the summer starting in July -- plus they have sweet tea which is a huge bonus"}
{"text":"My family and I are usually a fan of this Firehouse, but after tonight we will not be returning.  My mom and I both got the Sriracha Beef sub, our usual.  Right after the first bite, we agreed that the beef was sliced very thickly and the meat was so tough it was hard to eat.  My mom let the associate who made the sub know about this toughness.  All the associate did was say, \"Oh okay I'll make note of that.\"  We were not offered a refund nor were we offered the choice of having the subs remade.  Right after complaining we were given nasty looks from the all of the associates present.  Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"After my initial review, the owner of this particular Firehouse Subs reached out to me and recommended I come in and try it again, and that's always something I appreciate, so I said I would fairly soon.  That was about two or three months ago? Oops.  Well, I finally got around to making good on that the other day when I was making an emergency run to Wallyworld next door. I stopped in and got my order \"for here\" instead of \"to go\" this time. Maybe there's something to be said about that choice because the sandwich (a Firehouse Hero, I believe it was called) seemed tastier and fresher right out of the oven.  Still a little pricey for a sandwich, especially after upgrading to a combo (and forgetting to get my chips -- that was my fault though), but the meats were plentiful and the veggies crisp. An a-okay sandwich, if you ask me.  In the original review I went back and forth between three and four stars and eagerly wished for a half-star. So why the fourth star this time? Staff. The crew seemed really friendly and not like they hated their job. Being in the hospitality industry, customer service is make-or-break, and theirs was quite good. Plus, as I said, I always appreciate it when owners and management go out of their way to touch base with their customers, and that care was reflected in the crew at this Firehouse Subs.  Kudos to the Firehouse Subs team for turning a mediocre experience into a solidly good one."}
{"text":"Love this place everyone there is so nice ! The food taste great ! Amanda Eric and Chris were very helpful with my order. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Firehouse has great subs and service! I've come here a couple times now and each time I have had a wonderful experience. I forget the name of the sandwich I usually get, but all of the sandwiches I've had are delicious!   Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was good,  lots of meat on my sandwich.  However,  their prices were very high for just a sandwich.  Atmosphere was very nice & everyone was very nice.   If I don't go back is because it was too expensive."}
{"text":"Came around 7pm and there were a couple people waiting. There were 3 staff members, so they weren't shirt-handed by any means. Who would have figured that it would take almost 15 minutes for our sandwiches to be made! So if you're starving or in a hurry, this isn't the place to 'pick something up really quick.'"}
{"text":"This place was really good it has been a while since I have eaten at a Firehouse Subs but this really put them back on my list of top sub shops and I'm delighted that we have one in the Pittsburgh area.   I really liked the bread used with these subs, it is not heavy or doughy but a really nice and lighter almost airy type of bread. I'm not sure how they cook their meat but it was NOT some cold cuts tossed in a microwave. It was almost as if the roasted turkey was roasted fresh right there and served to me. Damn I'm getting hungry thinking about this place right now. I will warn you thought that it can take a little bit longer than Subway to get your sub especially if there are a lot of people in here. I have time and I hope you would slow your day down for something that is made with care for your belly.  Too bad there isn't one of these closer to the city."}
{"text":"We drive by this place all the time. Decided to finally stop in and check it out. I was thinking glorified Subway...DEAD WRONG..It was incredible. I had the beef brisket, AMAZING. Better than BBQ joints, even famous Dave's. you have to try it. You wont regret it. I agree with post below. When you walk in, Staff is like in fake Hello voice. Maybe it should be, Hi, Firehouse Subs,we are HOT!! LMAO   Seriously, try it. You will like it."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try for the first time.  I ordered the Firehouse Steak and Cheese with Jalapeno peppers no mayo, no pickle.  I ordered online, which stated it would be ready at 18:30.  I arrived at 18:28 and proceeded to wait and wait.  At 18:45 I asked the Manager how much longer.  He went around to check and it was actually just sitting on the warmer.  Okay, 1 bad mark.  I open up the sandwich, what I got was Steak and Cheese with 4 sliced pickles/or banana peppers, a host of black olives and 2 pieces of green peppers, and a pickle on the side.  My wife's order was not correct either she wanted lettuce and tomatoes, which she didn''t get.  Not exactly what we ordered.  maybe their motto is you take what we give you and like it.  I thought about returning it, but just took off the olives and ate it.  Nothing spectacular, not different from Subways, not impressed.  Ahh well, that experiment is out of the way, no need to go there again."}
{"text":"This is the 1st time I have eaten here and was surprised and delighted that the sandwich was so good! I ordered the beef brisket and cheddar with bbq sauce. I will definitely eat here again. The soda machine was very cool, I never knew soda could  come in so many flavors! The staff greeted us upon entry, and were friendly."}
{"text":"The staff here is awesome. They are friendly, patient and attentive. The subs are good and consistent. The only real problem here is the parking can be difficult during busy periods."}
{"text":"This is most definitely one of my favorite sub places!! It is a little pricey, but it goes towards our amazing firefighters. But the food is 100% prefect everytime!! And they have some great sides! You gotta try their chili!!  It's awesomesauce!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone is always ranting and raving about this place yet I don't seem to like it very much however it's one of the nicer sandwich places for the area, and a little well kept! I'd love to say I'd eat here but everything I get a sandwich here is soggy and the veggies are just to mass produced!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience and great tasing food! No complaints! Friendly employees. Clean restaurant. One of my fav places."}
{"text":"I admit I dig the hot sauce area but the sub I had was not so great.  As a retired fireman it saddens me to give only 3 stars because I had such high expectations coming in."}
{"text":"Holy smokes 35 min for one damn sandwich these guys are way to slow.  Not the sharpest tools in the box.   Don't stop here for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing. Any sandwich on the menu is worth it. Get the number 10 youll love it"}
{"text":"I literally came when they were closing and Brandon let me come in and had Medianna take my order. She was so nice and understanding.  John and Brandon were both there too helping make the sandwiches, and there was no rush like they were trying to hurry me out of there, they took their time as they would for any other customer. All three of them could not have  given me a better service than they have. They made me feel so welcome and definitely made the environment comfortable. They seem like such great people, and I will definitely come back because of their service. Thank you guys !!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place got three stars is because the food is amazing, BUT the service is terrible. The people they have working there have absolutely zero social skills and a severe listening problem. I'm ordering a sandwich, I don't need to give you a personal history and take a freaking survey to order my food. Listen to what I tell you I want and give me what I ask for. It's not a Wolfgang Puck 5 star restaurant.  I don't need you to go into the services you provide. I want a sandwich."}
{"text":"Myself and several others were on the corner of Litchfield and Bell advocating for education and gaining community support when the incredible people from Firehouse Subs brought us sandwiches and drinks. The food was delicious and we very much appreciated their support! I will absolutely return as a paying customer. Thank you Firehouse Surprise!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a sub. Very nice quality subs. Great people, great atmosphere, good prices."}
{"text":"I am a sandwich fanatic.  I am very picky and I usually believe that very very few can make a sandwich as good as me so this review is saying something.   Firehouse Subs is crazy good.  Excellent size, quality, flavor and down right satisfying with a very happy tummy effect.  This is not a over the top Guy Fierri Food Network sandwich.  This is a solid well made sandwhich.  Either 8\" or 12\" are available.  Size and proportion are top notch.  Moreso is the quality of meat they use.  The flavors of the sandwich I had (Fireman Hero) were out of this world.   As a novelty in the shop they have a rack of various hot sauces for your consumption.  There must have been over 20 different kinds to choose from.  Most important for me to mention is the Captin Sorenson's Datil Pepper Sauce.  OMG!  This sauce is off the hook good.  So good I footed the $4.99 for a bottle to take home with me.  CRAZY GOOD.   Service was friendly and quick.  Atmosphere of the shop was really cool.  Lots of firehouse memorabilia (go figure).  Top marks on cleanliness in the shop and the restrooms.   I AM DONE LOOKING FOR A SANDWICH SHOP IN VEGAS!  This is IT!"}
{"text":"The turkey and salsa verde sub is my absolute favorite! My mom doesn't have a firehouse subs back home so every time she is out here she goes and gets her favorite, the hook and ladder. I have one by my job and one by my house so needless to say I am always there! The locations I go to always have friendly staff and great customer service."}
{"text":"The combos aren't combos and the guy behind the counter looks like he's gonna cry.  D,:"}
{"text":"The service was the worst I've ever encountered at a firehouse subs. I waited 28 minutes just for one sub and my sandwich wasn't the best. Definitely going to stay away from this location in the future."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, just as ordered via app. Done quickly and accurately. Dining area was clean and bright. First time ordering and will definitely try again :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich no onions,  With deli mustard, tomatoes,  lettuce.  And got a sandwich with lettuce and onions only."}
{"text":"The girls working there seriously made my day!  Best customer service ever and my sub was amazing!  Such a fun and happy restaurant"}
{"text":"The first time I visited this location was right around when they first opened, so I didn't write a review because I figure like with anything new, there is a learning curve. The truth is, they did not put anything on our sandwiches except meat and bread despite the ingredients listed on the menus. No, lettuce, tomato, dressing, or cheese. Just meat and bread and it cost about $30 for 4 of us. Then today, I was out running errands early and the kids asked if we could go to Firehouse subs. We got there 5 minutes before the posted opening time, but the door was open so we went in. The employee literally shooed us away! With his hand, shooed us out  the door and said \"We're not open\".  Could have said-We open in 5 mins., or take a seat and we will be ready in a few minutes. Nope- We are closed and waived us out! We will not be going back."}
{"text":"My husband likes the subs here although I don't care for them. When I get the sandwiches close to my mouth I cannot stand the smell."}
{"text":"Having heard rave reviews about this place from several friends over the years, we finally decided to try it for lunch.  The Good: One if those awesome Coke machines where you can have 642,690,371,625,974+++ combinations.  The Bad: Reading my reviews lately, you would think I have a weirdly super-sensitive stomach and I really don't.   But yeah, this place made me violently ill as well. I had the Club on a Sub so I don't know if it was the mayo or what it was... but yeah.   Also - the staff was inattentive as hell. There were a minimum of 12 staff members there and it STILL took 35 minutes to get our food at about 2 in the afternoon on a Saturday. If this is the norm during the week as well, I would never make it back to work on time.   The staff were more interested in watching the baseball game and talking about each play than making customers' sandwiches. Someone had to go to the counter three times to ask for the ice machine to be refilled.   And fairly expensive as well, for a sub joint? We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a cute place to bring kids. They will get a fire hat and can take a look at the real fire suits and helmets too. They one thing that drives me crazy about this place is that you can't get a kids sandwich on wheat bread. So I always have to order the kiddos an adult sandwich since I don't feed them white bread. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and overall best Italian sub ever! I would recommend anyone trying these guys out!"}
{"text":"Love the food but service was bad. I needed 10 subs for a work function, I called 24 hours in advance, was told to call back at 10 am the next day when they opened. I called 10 am next day, was told I was supposed to call 24 hrs in advance. I told them I did they refused to help me even going so far to say they didn't have enough tuna for 2 sandwiches., Meat cutter wouldn't be in till after 11. It was like they didn't want my business. I went to another place and was accommodated immediately."}
{"text":"Ordered a chopped chicken sandwich on wheat. I got bread, a little mustard, tomato, a LOT of letttuce, and mostly fat I couldn't chew.   I've been here before and it was good, but I'm not sure I'll go back.  On the upside the staff was very nice and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Driving out from Red Rock Canyon we were hungry and were looking for a place to eat. We tried RR but they even at 1:30PM they had incredible waits and well... we were hungry. So we pull up the Yelp app and there with these great reviews is Firehouse. So, we get out of RR and drive over, park and look at the menus in wonder. We are hungry, so we order.  I'll be honest, I'm not a sub person. I just think they are bread sandwiches with nothing else. But this is a beautiful sandwich. From the fresh and soft white bread to the pastrami that was just the right temperature. It was tender, tasty and all four of us looked at each other and agreed that this is a great place.  They have these great fire hats for kids and they graciously gave us one even though we didn't have a child with us. This is a very excellent choice."}
{"text":"Great subs, but no vegetarian options. Don't bother asking either...they have no idea what to put on it. Haha"}
{"text":"Love the hook and ladder or meatball sub. The staff and owners are always fantastic. Your sub takes a bit longer to steam and toast but it is worth it. Store is CLEAN too!"}
{"text":"I've been thinking to stop by forever so I finally did.  I'll keep this review short and simple. It's OK. If you're around, give it a shot (there's not much in that side of the 101) but don't drive more than 2 miles for that. Just saying."}
{"text":"My husband and I get subs from this Firehouse subs frequently. It's always clean, the staff is nice and the food is good. Every once in a while they get the order wrong but it's not that huge of a deal. We keep going back there so their doing something right."}
{"text":"Tasty but nothing to get terribly excited about, and sheesh are they expensive.  3 sandwiches, one of which was a medium, cost us $32.00.  The medium was actually quite small, it would have been at home on a plate in Barbie's Country Kitchen."}
{"text":"I was expecting something special for the price I paid for 2 subs. I'll be going back to the other sub place where all the extras you want don't cost more money"}
{"text":"I went here to get 3 subs and 2 drinks. And after being here multiple times I think I have the ability to speak honestly about this joint. First of all, Firehouse subs sponsors Cimarron Memorial High School. Meaning, most of the men and women that work there are teens. So, most of the time you're going to come across rude staff that more than often. The first time there, I was given a nickname by one of the staff, and they laughed with their coworkers. 4th time, the cashier was rude and sarcastic. Other than that, the only reason they're getting stars is because of the excellent food. Even though I paid $30 dollars for 3 subs and 2 drinks, it filled me up and it was absolutely great. Unfortunately, I won't be coming here often. I'd prefer Subway or Port of Subs."}
{"text":"I had a couple of gripes about this place, that left me unimpressed. For one, it took them 20 mins to finish our order...this seemed long for a sandwich place with ~4 lady's working.   But, my major issue was when I got home I saw they had switched up our order too, totally wrong sandwich for me and they put mayo on mine despite my specific request to not have it.   I know mistakes happen so...I called them about it and the worker who answered the phone had no phone etiquette. After hearing my complaint she shouts to her coworkers \"who made the firehouse sub? You messed up, ya, you give her the wrong sandwich. (Loud sigh) let me talk to my manager, hey this lady is calling cause we gave her the wrong sub, ya I know it was ___ she knows she messed up.\" SO Awkward. I decided to not go back after that weird interaction even though they offered to replace it."}
{"text":"I am so happy about the service that I received today during lunch hour rush! Not only was I taken care of quickly and efficiently, but when I had a problem with my potato chips, Mychelle handled it with class and even included a coupon for my next visit for my trouble. This is a well run franchise by people who care about what they do."}
{"text":"First time visit. I had the veggie. It was a nice experience. I wouldn't mind eating there again."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches but starting to get expensive. $11.99 for a 12\" sub is about twice the price of Subway, Jimmy Johns, etc.  My wife & I just spent $29.97 for 2 subs, 1 small & 1 med drink. No chips or combos  I think they have just priced me out of going there anymore."}
{"text":"Wow! Is all I can say about this sub shop. I just ate a Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket for lunch. 1st visit to this place by the way. The only complaint I can make is to myself for not getting the bigger sub. This sub was Saweeeet! The meat was cooked just right. The cheese was melted perfectly. The sauce  Mmm Mmm Mmm good! The fountain drink dispenser was a first for me too. Coca Cola exterior with a Touch Screen beverage selection, too cool. I will be going back to try a few other subs this place has to offer, but one can't go wrong with the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket.....Scrumptious!"}
{"text":"I love firehouse. The food is good.  100% of the time my food has come out wrong here. Today I asked four times (bot a rough ask,) just please no mayo.    Please find a different system.  The order and they make just doesn't work.  It's a broken system but the food is so good.  I would love to just have it be right."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Super fast and friendly people. Very delicious food! Great service. I was able to call in a large order and they finished it before the expected time. This was a VERY clean place. I do recommend to any one who wants a amazing steak sandwich to go in and order it. I love the food. The staff was super friendly. They knew who I was when I walked in. Go in and check them out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really was craving a roll! So I was glad to run into this place! We got take out and I'm glad as it was packed inside! Good busy atmosphere and good for groups, casual. A lot of passers by, come in off the road to stop for food! We got a cheese steak sub and veggie sub and both were delicious! 4 stars as it was pricey but very tasty!"}
{"text":"Tried the new hawiian bbq.. Bomb!! And always enjoy the collection of hot sauces. Although this location seemed to have less than other locations I've visited and no extra hot ones lol but still very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sub shop! Everything is made to order, fresh, and the employees there are always friendly. If you like BBQ brisket I recommend the Smokehouse brisket. It's my favorite! My husband always goes for the New York steamer- fully involved. Kids love the meatball sub, it's a pretty good size and it's very good, plus they get a fireman hat, which the kids love! If you're over the age of 10 and want a hat too, just ask!!  The place is clean, awesome soda machine, and decorated nicely to go with the \"Firehouse\" theme. Normally it only takes about 5-6 minutes to get your food, but if it's really busy and it takes a little longer just be patient.. It's worth the wait!  Can't wait until they open the new location on Decatur closer to our house."}
{"text":"Good size subs.  The online ordering system is so easy to use and the subs are ready on time."}
{"text":"It gets so frustrating when you have to wait 15 minutes for a sandwich to be made. Every time I go to Firehouse the wait is ridiculous. Their subs are amazing and their prices are great, but if I only have a 30 minute lunch then it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Work nearby and stop by weekly. Shannon and her team are awesome. Friendly and welcoming. They seam to enjoy their jobs.  Mediterranean chicken sandwich is delicious."}
{"text":"I visited this location this evening and was politely greeted by two gentlemen when I came through the door. Tim took my order -steak and cheese, no mayo- and repeated it back to me before I was charged. Tim continued to make conversation as he was preparing my food, and it was warm and just the way I'd ordered it when he brought it to me. The manager on duty, Ross, also came by to ask how my night was going and check on the quality of the food. The restaurant was clean, and I used the bathroom on my way out, which was fully stocked and very sanitary. Overall very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Firehouse is a very efficient establishment. You order st the counter and they bring you food to your table. The subs are very tasty. I recommend the Hook and Ladder. It will satisfy your taste."}
{"text":"Been to three different locations....but been to the Goodyear location several times, and I'm a boring guy who gets the same thing...New York steamer and its consistently good as is customer service. One thing that I have noticed is the usual trend from chain restaurants, prices go up and portions and quality goes down, as of now just portions are smaller...or is it me?"}
{"text":"I don't know what these other reviewers are referring to, because my husband and I were first timers yesterday and had nothing but an awesome experience!! We are both very picky with customer service and food and we were not disappointed at all!! We will definitely be back frequently!  Nada helped us and she was so great!!"}
{"text":"Overall it was a nice first experience. I came for lunch today with a friend of mine, a fellow firefighter himself. The staff seems inconvenienced to pay us any attention. All the employees seemed to be in their own world. As others walked in they would mumble \"welcome to Firehouse Subs\" so softly that the only reason I heard was because I was standing 2 feet from the register.   They took our order, asked for our names, said they would bring it out when it was done. We took the closest seats from the register and the soda machine. When our order was done, I could hear a faint mumble of our names because in 5 minutes between our order, them completing it, and only a handle of other customers in the place, they didn't know who we were anymore.  Now I've worked in several fast food restaurants over the course of my work time, and I honestly can't say I've forgotten who ordered what with a small crowd that was occupying the place. The woman who brought us our food obviously wasn't paying that close attention to us when we order since she was chatting with another employee and walked the opposite direction we sat in when trying to give us our food.  The lack of customer service aside. Their food is good. I got the 8\" Italian with all that it comes with, chips, and a drink. The soda machine was getting stuck so there was a pile of ice in the part where you stick your cup in. The machine is one of those new ones that you can pick from a variety of Coca cola products on a touch screen. I had to pull the lever back in for the ice to stop dispensing. Besides that I was able to get my drink.  The sandwich was messy. You can apparently add extra like with Subway or more like Jimmy Johns. They had a moving square menu that had what you could get but I didn't realize that until after I ordered. So maybe I'll add extra's next time? I try to avoid Prospect Ave like the plague especially during lunch or dinner because traffic is just terrible, this time I only went because my friend suggested we go and I wanted to try it out.  Their chip selection is that of Subways so if you have had their subs before I'm sure you have a good idea. The sandwich was filling but I couldn't finish mine. My friend finished his 12\" meatball sub with ease.  This place is much like any other sub shop in the area with similar ordering styles but with their own flare. They do take donations for help first responders which I admire but I only know that because I read it on their cup. They didn't ask if we wanted to donate our spare change or give a dollar or 2 to help the cause."}
{"text":"Really wet ( but delicious ) sub that I seriously doubt was 450 calories. My god, there was a whole turkey under that bun.  Not as clean as I'd like and the staff was entirely put out by us \"newbies\".  Sorry I'm a subway girl and used to pointing and grunting at my veggies. Tasty so I'll give a different location a try again."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I started going to Firehouse Subs after being fed up with Subway for the last time (Subway=poor service at nearly every location, unpredictable quality). I couldn't ask for more polite cashiers and staff. They all appear to be very eager to please. I guess you could say I'm boring because I've only ever ordered one item from their menu, which is the Hook & Ladder sandwich. Also, if you like soft drinks, they have one of those really cool fountain drink machines with over 150 flavors. If you're a fan of hot sauce, they have about 30 to choose from.  The decor is detailed and the restaurant always seems to be clean. My only suggestion would be to put something else on TV besides sports but I guess that's the main type of customer that Firehouse attracts. It's not enough to keep me away, though. I'll continue to come here as long as they keep up the great service and excellent quality."}
{"text":"Excellent!. Steak n cheese sub was great, the have a lot of salsas and people is great !. Place clean and fast!"}
{"text":"45 min and still waiting.  The managers are no help in expediting. When asked how much longer The crew replied no idea. There have been 3 tickets in front of mine for 15 min. Customers  are asking for money back and leaving. oh goody, the manager is handing out coupons and apologizing  for the wait. Looks like she's starting with the customers  that just got here. meanwhile still waiting."}
{"text":"Had the Engineer Sub and it was really good. FireHouse Subs has a verity of sandwiches and they are big and really good. Friendly helpful staff must try if you haven't been yet."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for it just being a sub place. The inside it super cute and they have great customer service. A gentlemen working saw that my hands were full and opened the door and they don't make you wait long for you food either. They offer 120 drink choice and their own unsweetened tea. It was my first time and I loved my experience !!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Firehouse subs for years, but this was my first time at this location. I always order a kids meal, ham and swiss, lettuce and mayo, pretty uncomplicated sandwich. The kids meal comes with chips and a kids size drink, which is perfect for people trying to portion control. I have NEVER had an issue with my order at any other Firehouse, except this one. The cashier, who wasn't very friendly and appeared to be a manager, said that if I get any toppings on my sub I have to buy the small sub, which doesn't come with chips or a drink. She told me it would only be $1 dollar more so I really didn't think much about it. It's the same size sub, with the exact same toppings as the kids meal that I always get. I was expecting to pay $1 more than my normal $5 kids meal. I was surprised when I went to pay and the total was almost $9! The small doesn't come with chips and a drink so it made the price go up $4. So basically, I got charged $4 for lettuce and mayo. If I hadn't got the lettuce and mayo, I could have ordered the kids meal, like I always do. I was really disappointed, not only in her insisting that toppings require me to order the small, but in the way she was willing to lose a customer over lettuce and mayo (which probably cost them pennies for the amount that is on the sub). I won't eat at this location ever again, and I hope that the manager rethinks not only her policy on toppings, but the way she treats her customers. I'll go to the Firehouse by my office, they never question my order and always have a smile!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Friendly people. It has been a while since we had eaten at Firehouse. Visiting from out of town and wanted to get some quick good food. One place that has a great veggie sub. My husband had the Ruben. My veggie was great & he said his was !*#*in awesome!"}
{"text":"Always a good choice and love the friendly environment they bring to the table. Prefer the meatball sub but everything looks great and yummy! Gotta love the personal service they also have"}
{"text":"Great sub shop considering it's a giant chain. I normally get the steak and cheese or the Engineer. This location is always busy for lunch but even so, they pump it out. Sandwiches were at the table in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"the place at 3:30p.m was filthy no tables to sit at. Garbage all over the floor. I couldn't eat the sandwich because if this is how the front looked, I can only imagine what the back looked like."}
{"text":"Love, love love their ITALIAN!!! Not a fan of the seating arrangements because the place is small inside , but sandwiches are awesome. My daughter loves the meatball, its just like its supposed be \"big and messy, full of cheese\"! YUM !!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for the best sandwich that is consistently amazing and full of flavor and actually full of ingredients this is the place to go! Our large family has lived in CA, HI prior to relocating 2 years ago to Vegas. We were in search of a \"new favorite sandwich place\" and it didn't take long for us to find this Firehouse location. We eat there weekly and the manager Peytand staff has made us feel like family every-time we stop by. This location has the feel of community. When we come in we often see many of the same people there and it is always clean, consistent and most important friendly! They always know our order and smile and it's always busy so you know that's pretty awesome! Recently, I put together a \"thank you\" luncheon for our Teachers for \"Teachers Appreciation\" week so I approached Peyton to see if they could provide lunch since our school is located in their \"community\" the response I got was amazing! They provided lunch for our teachers.. it was ready on time, every sandwich was cut perfectly into serving size portions, wrapped, tons of pickles on side, condiments and variety! They even threw in some coupons which went with each sandwich for the teachers to return. It made their day to receive the love and support of a local business. Thank you for supporting our Teachers! Peyton and Staff you guys rock!! Thank you Firehouse Deli for supporting your community!"}
{"text":"I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of a Firehouse Subs close to home for awhile, and had high expectations, they did not disappoint! The store looked great, and was very clean. The people at Firehouse Subs are very welcoming,and friendly. The food is amazing, definitely the most delicious sub I've ever had! I ordered the Turkey and bacon sub,it was fantastic,the bread was fresh,great Turkey,and a really good ranch sauce. Definitely worth the drive from anywhere!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of all these sandwich shops popping up on every corner, but Firehouse is doing something right, because I haven't had such a good hot sandwich in a long time. They also have the best sweet pepper hot sauce of all time."}
{"text":"I always have great service with this location. The staff is friendly and the subs come out quickly. I love the subs here."}
{"text":"Great tasting sandwiches. The staff is wonderful. We love Sam and Diane - they make your visit very enjoyable. The store was busy at the time of our visit, but the sandwichs were fresh and tasty and were prepared in a very timely manner and of course with a friendly staff member delivering them to the table. Staff was also very attentive to cleaning up vacant tables and getting them ready for the next party.  Love the soft drink machine, great variety.  Location was great. The physical suite is great with all the windows and very good parking.  We will definitely be back to enjoy the experience again."}
{"text":"Its like a Subway with personality.   I had the \"Firehouse Steak and Cheese\".  It was good but so much like the steak and cheese at subway - the mustard was the only difference. The prices are even the same. Theres a little more meat per sub."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times! Store is clean, always great service, friendly staff and wonderful subs!! They also have a rewards program which has good benefits."}
{"text":"Best subs ever! So incredibly happy this place was opened. Super friendly staff, correct prices, great food! The to go menus say subject to change due to speciality items. It's says it on there! I even spilled my drink everywhere right before they closed and they were super helpful. I felt so bad... But they made me feel better about it and told me no worries. Thanks for opening up a firehouse over here. There isn't much this way and now we don't need to order from uber eats and have our favorite sub delivered from Ellsworth!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sandwich! Everything about it was perfect, the bread soft, the meat fresh sliced to perfection, all the veggies fresh as well! Hook & Ladder sub is what I had. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great subs.  This is defiintely way better than Quizno's.  I ordered the New Yorker and got the Meatball sandwich for my husband.  My sandwich was good and it had a good amount of meat.  My husband said that the meatball sandwich was also good.  I've never seen a computerized soda machine before.  It's pretty cool because you can get a whole variety of sodas, once you figure out how to operate it."}
{"text":"My husband and son stopped by this location yesterday for subs after a football game in the blazing heat. They specifically asked for cold subs. There was no line and they had to wait for over 15 minutes for their to-go order. Once they got in the car and on their way home they realized the subs were hot! How do you get that part of an order wrong? Needless to say, this was a waste of $20. We've never had an issue at this location before but this particular visit makes us never want to go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE their sandwiches and have never had a bad one yet. They are refreshingly different from your standard Wawa sandwiches, and have always tasted very fresh. We are so fortunate to have a Firehouse just up the road from our office, so any time we have a meeting , we purchase sandwiches and they never fail to impress our guests. Huge, meaty sandwiches smothered in yummy sauces. Messy, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Firehouse Subs in Strongsville I leave happy and am never disappointed. Great good, great atmosphere and all around great experience."}
{"text":"Always great quality and service. I get two small sandwiches because I like to try multiple sandwiches. I always leave fulfilled and satisfied."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly, but we waited 19 minutes for one turkey sub and one steak and cheese sub during lunch. I dont know if we could return for lunch due to unreliable wait times..."}
{"text":"Out of this world sandwiches no microwave just steamers the King's Hawaiian pulled pork sandwich should be year round sandwich there. One of my favorites double brisket cheddar cheese light barbecue sauce unbelievable, don't forget to get a pickle"}
{"text":"Slow service.... I was expecting Subway type of service. I will try this place again when we are not pressed for time."}
{"text":"Very very slow- the place was not crowded for a Saturday afternoon. One couple ordered before us and it took 15 plus minutes to get the two subs we ordered. This is not the first time I  have been there and waited a very long time for my food. The sandwiched were OK - not that great.  I would go back simply for convenience but seriously they are the slowest sandwich makers out there!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I would come back if I was hungry and this was an option.   The staff was friendly and pretty quick, probably because they forgot the bacon that was supposed to be on my sandwich hence the three stars.   The restaurant was also clean except for the bathrooms. I know there are heathens out there that abuse bathrooms but you've got to stay on top of them."}
{"text":"Even if I was drunk I would avoid this place like the plague. Every time I have gone in they have messed up my order, without fail. Tried to place a little bit of faith in them after the first two times, but that was a huge mistake. Honestly, when I am ordering a simple salad and having to repeat myself 3 times to the cashier each time and then getting my food and having it be a sub is more than ridiculous. Not to mention the manager gets very defensive even though it is clearly THEIR ERROR. What a joke. I will definitely find something else nearby."}
{"text":"So disappointed with our experience at this location today. Came in to pick up lunch for takeout and waited 30 minutes from order time to walking out the door. They were busy and apologetic, and we were a little irritated but as a person who works in the restaurant business I understood. The inexcusable part same once we got home. We had ordered 2 subs and one of them had NO TURKEY! How does that happen after taking that long to make!! On top of that they didn't put the cookie or brownie included in the price of our combo in the bag. So frustrated, and still hungry."}
{"text":"1st experience here was amazing!  Everything was fresh and delicious!  Our service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Having lunch with a girlfriend, and came to the another place to eat in the same area  that had closed.  We decided to walk down and check out Firehouse subs.  We walked into the place, and the very 1st thing I noticed was the YUMMY smell.  The staff was very friendly, and happy to suggest their favorites.  I decided to give the turkey sandwich a try.  I have to say that it's the first time in a while that I had turkey on a sandwich that actually tasted like turkey.  Most places it has a generic vague flavor and all the meats basically taste alike.  NOT HERE.  Both of us throughly loved our sandwiches.  I also checked out the super cool soda machine.  Couldn't believe all the options.  Plan on eating here again!"}
{"text":"Flew into Charlotte today and needed a decent quick lunch.  Found this Firehouse Subs via Yelp of course.  Service was fast and the medium tuna was tasty!  I normally try to avoid \"national\" chains when traveling, but Firehouse Subs gets my business because they make great sandwiches for reasonable prices.  Parking can get tight when they are busy."}
{"text":"mmmmmm still very good.  Medium (8\" sub) meatball sub... Cooked perfectly... Meatballs are MUCH higher quality than Subway or Quizno's!  They also have Coke products!! YAY Diet Crack erm... I mean Diet Coke!!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at this place, and I was not extremely impressed. I had an 8-inch italian sub, and it was just alright -- something like a quizno's sub, and kind of small for almost $6. I personally prefer subway, in terms of both choices and value. They have a very large (dizzying, even?) selection of hot sauces to add to your sandwich, which is sort of cool but didn't add much to my experience."}
{"text":"The first clue should have been when we waited to order in awkward silence while the cashier held a full on conversation with the sandwich maker...only to turn to us with an irritated look and say, \"I'm ready for your order when you are.\" - I bit my tongue and proceeded to order.  I ordered the medium brisket combo and honestly it tasted great. I finished the first half and picked up the second half when my wife pointed out there was a human hair that had been resting under the sandwich...left there presumably by the person who made the sandwich.  When I returned the sandwich to the counter I noted that the hair most likely came from the manager as she had long dark hair and was not wearing a hat, visor or hair net as required by law. She offered to remake my sandwich and became irritated when I asked her to have someone else make it. I then pointed out her health code violation and she replied by telling me she's not required to wear anything on her head.   NRS 2-402.11 (A)  Except as provided in ¶ (B) of this section, food handlers shall wear hair restraints such as hats, hair coverings or nets, beard restraints, and clothing that covers body hair, that are designed and worn to effectively keep their hair from contacting exposed food; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles.  (B) This section does not apply to food employees such as counter staff who only serve beverages and wrapped or packaged foods, hostesses, and wait staff if they present a minimal risk of contaminating exposed food; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles.  Now I understand MAYBE she thinks she's exempt under sub section B so I took the trouble of looking up the definition of a Food Handler as described by the Nevada Revised Statute and found the following:  NRS 446.030 \"Food Handler\" Defined  Note: The 2010 Regulations Governing the Sanitation of Food Establishments defines food as raw, cooked or processed edible substance, ice, beverage or an ingredient used, or intended for use or for sale, in whole or in part for human consumption, or chewing gum.  \"Food handler\" means any person employed in or operating a food establishment, whether that person is an employer, employee or other natural person, who handles, stores, transports, prepares, manufactures, serves or sells food, or who comes in contact with eating or cooking utensils or other equipment used in the handling, preparation, manufacture, service or sale of food.  The term does not include a person who: Only handles, stores, transports, sells or otherwise comes in contact with food that is sealed and packaged for sale directly to the consumer;  If the food is potentially hazardous food, handles the food only occasionally and incidentally to his responsibilities or employment, and such handling is not part of his regularly scheduled responsibilities or employment; or   Is providing services as a cashier, salesperson, stock clerk, warehouse or dockworker, delivery person or maintenance staff or providing services in a similar position with limited food-handling responsibility. [Part 1:116:1943; 1943 NCL § 5319]--(NRS A 1969, 803; 2001, 1505; 2003, 595; 2007, 2175)  Bottom line - YOU MADE MY SANDWICH - YOU ARE A FOOD HANDLER - AND THE LAW APPLIES TO YOU.  As if contaminating my sandwich by violating health code wasn't bad enough, following up by lying about it makes it worse, not to mention the other employee who was openly eating in the food prep area while he observed our conversation, and the employee who replaced my sandwich not washing his hands in between changing gloves...Three health code violations in plain view in a matter of a couple minutes. Imagine how many more violations there are to be found here.   I left my car in the parking lot and came back later after shopping. Looking in the front window I could clearly see another blonde employee making sandwiches without any hair restraint.  Enjoy your hair sandwiches if you eat here. That should be their new motto.  I'm contemplating a call to the health inspector, maybe they can get these employees sorted out because either they are unaware of proper food handling/serving methods or they just don't care. Either way my health is more important. I will NEVER visit this location again."}
{"text":"While I have not been in the store, I can review the catering service for this establishment.   I have now had the pleasure of experiencing the catering service two times that was provided from this same store.  It is head and shoulders above anything else I have experienced.    The first time IT was a wonderful dessert platter of brownies and a variety of cookies along with lemon-aid (which was wonderful) and tea.   WOW what a wonderful presentation and delivery service was top notch.   The second experience was cold sub sandwich platter.  The sandwiches were fresh, filling was plentiful and tasted delicious!    The best part of it was you received a lot of fresh meat on it.  Not like Subway where you have to look for the meat.      Thank you Firehouse for coming to Las Vegas and giving us a new choice in wonderful sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The food here is always great, the staff is always friendly but the are still so slow and I don't understand this all the other sandwich places are faster and from what I have read here on Yelp that other Firehouse subs are faster this place is at least a year old by now but still no team work. I just don't know.  Also you guys are one of the more pricey places so not cost friendly 2 sandwiches drinks and chips $26.75 ow  This is my third post for them and have spoken to management."}
{"text":"We've been 2x one was at prime time lunch every table was full & they had been open a couple of weeks. My sandwich was made correctly & the wait was short. So 2 thumbs up for first visit. If this were based on that first trip I would have given 4 stars for sure. We went again today after lunch (1:50 p.m.) to make the table issue a non issue & there were maybe 7 people already seated so plenty of seating available YAY! I placed my order with Angie & she was helpful, quick & got the order correct. I'd like to say that my sandwich was correct but it wasn't. I ordered 1/2 Hook no mayo, no cheese, add peppers & pickles. It arrived with pickles along with mayo & cheese but no peppers. We waited 12-15 minutes for both sandwiches to arrive. So I didn't want to wait again so I just sucked it up buttercup as it wasn't an allergy just a preference. I saw a teen that ordered behind us return his sandwich & he had to get it to go because it took so long & his buddies were done already. Such a bummer when an establishment can't get some sammies done correctly or in a decent time frame when not busy.  I really do like the staff friendliness & willingness to help you maneuver through the giant menu. My hubs really enjoyed his Sicilian so I'm sure there will be a 3rd try against my better thoughts. So wish me luck. I'll update appropriately after. I just hope it's another happy trip because the sammies are yummy & the staff friendly goes a long way."}
{"text":"We love Firehouse Subs and have them regularly. This is the closest location to our home in Summerlin so imagine my surprise when we entered and were greeted rudely by Rayna  (8/4 @ 4pm) who not only didn't smile or seem happy to be here, but said loudly as we stood in front of her deciding what to order,  \"Can I leave now?\" Then, when we told her that one of the sandwiches was supposed to be free from an agreement that one of the supervisors  (Amanda) had made with my husband due to a previous botched order, she stared at us blankly and mumbled to one of her coworkers the situation. After  about 2 minutes where she just stood there silent,  I asked her if the discount was going to be applied or not because I was fine with paying for the sandwich if I had to and then would take it up with Amanda when she came back to work, she rolled her eyes and just said, \"Wait.\" Finally, she said I could swipe my card to which I responded with,  \"I guess that means yes?\"   The unfortunate part about this whole incident is that the food at Firehouse Subs is  really good. However, even the best restaurants and fast food diners know that customer service is important.  I just hope that they train their employees to be much more engaged  and to realize that being communicative is imperative. I was surprised by how much she seem to hate her job and not want to help people. Maybe this isn't the right industry for her, but that's not my problem. I hope that they can fix the attitude of the employees we  had to deal with today so that we can continue to enjoy our dining experience with Firehouse Subs at this location."}
{"text":"What a joke that's all I can say $10.00 for a meatball sandwich  20 min wait and a shitty attitude awesome I have to look into buying a firehouse. Franchise"}
{"text":"Never had a Firehouse Sub before but I was in the area and thought I'd give them a try. Great stuff! The staff was also awesome and friendly. The mushrooms in my Philly tasted canned, which was unfortunate, but otherwise great experience and I'll be checking back to try another sub soon."}
{"text":"Went here because I wanted a quick lunch and man was I ever wrong.  It took 30 minutes to get our sandwiches that cost $10.00 each.  This place is certainly not worth the wait or the money.  The sandwich was just so-so but the management here has a lot to be desired.  The gal running the cash register was a robot.  She didn't smile once and talked like a computerized droid.  She seriously hates this job!!  The soda machine stopped working and it ran out of ice.  The bathrooms needed restocking of everything.  I think who ever owns this franchise needs to spend some quality time on site during lunch rush.    Seriously!!  30 minutes for a sandwich is just not acceptable!!  Get with it people."}
{"text":"Having visited many fire stations for work, I know firemen can cook. Since the chain was started by firemen and claimed to have great sauces, I had to stop by even if the temperature outside was triple digits.  I ordered the turkey, roast beef with monterey jack cheese (engineer ladder I believe).  It came with lettuce and tomato. Simple, but very clean and filling.  The bread was nice and warm, the meats and cheese were melted just right.  I love their sauce collection and choices.   The sandwich itself is about $5-6 bucks. Great place for lunch.  It sure beats the other chains."}
{"text":"Not bad as sandwich joints go. They have a limited menu but off the option to create your own. The schtick here is all the sandwiches are served hot. The decor is obviously firehouse themed and is very adorable. The service was extremely helpful and very attentive. Prices are standard for deli sandwiches. Nothing great, nothing bad, I would come again"}
{"text":"Like real fire stations this chain of sandwich shops are popping up all over Las Vegas, so this afternoon after picking up a \"friend\" from a long working night and driving by one of them we decided to give it a try. It was lunch time so the place was really packed, so packed I'm not sure they were following the maximum capacity imposed by the real firehouse, but this place was really on fire!   The outside looked really plain, but when you walk inside it's really cool it looks like a real fire station lots of red, diamond steel, firemen memorabilia all over the walls and Dalmatian color tables which creates a fun atmosphere while you enjoy your sandwich.   Sandwiches were good, nothing special that sets them apart from all the other sandwich places except that you can pick your level of fire since they carry more than fifty kinds of hot sauces, chances are they have your favorite (sorry no Del Scorcho).  My friend was so impressed with the theme, she told me that she should get together a group of her colleagues and start a sandwich chain Just like the group of doctors that opened that other healthy sandwich shops and now this group of firemen opening this chain. I had to tell her and burst her bubble at the same time that maybe it wasn't a good idea  to use her type of profession as a theme for a sandwich shop, I mean.. what are you girls going to call it? Hooker's corner subs?   All in all firehouse is a good place to take your family and have a good time and good food. The new dial a soda machine is real cool! I just wish people would stop playing with it, Is not a toy! Is a soda machine and that's what all the people behind you want....a soda! Will I be back? Sure! I kinda like their sandwiches ..unless my friend opens her own place, then I would probably be eating hers.....but for now, any sandwich shop close to my friend's corner is good enough for me."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They have a new crew in there that move 1/4 of The speed of any worker I've ever seen in there. Messed up my sandwich after 15 minutes of trying to make a tuna sandwich. Then when I asked is it going to take another 15 minutes for you to make it over again they said no and worked even slower than they did on the first one. I just got a refund and I will never come back to this location again. Too bad because I've been here probably 50+ times. I had the same issue last time I came where they hired some young kids that can't even make a damn sandwich. Hire better staff!!"}
{"text":"Very professional business owners, I'm impressed by how they handle their franchise. Continued success!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give them zero stars. The owner of the restaurant said that he could not honor a corporate coupon that had no expiration date. The woman, Marilyn, that helped me with my order was rude and loud. This store has lost all of my business and all of my company's business."}
{"text":"Just had subs here for the first time. Ordered a tuna sandwich with everything minus the hot mustard. They left out everything and put hot mustard on my sandwich. My husband had the beef brisket, he was not impressed. The people there were friendly. But, I would not come here again because they messed up my order."}
{"text":"It took about 20 minutes to get 3 medium sandwiches to go. When we finally got our food, we got into the car and opened the box to find a half naked sandwich with bread, tomato, and lettuce on it. (No meat, cheese, toppings, ect. )  So, we walked back in and told them they've forgotten the other half of my sandwich. They slapped the turkey, swiss, and mushrooms on top of it and sent us on our merry way. A couple minutes later we had realized they had also forgotten the pickles that are supposed to come with every sandwich!   What the heck guys!!! :("}
{"text":"Always good hot subs. My favorite is the New York Steamer, followed by the Meatball and Steak & Cheese. Our kids like the plain cold Turkey & Cheese subs, plus the fireman hats."}
{"text":"This is close to becoming my favorite sub store...I am a HUGE fan of their steamer....being a creature of habit I have not really branched out to anything else to offer any opinions on.  My wife and daughter usually create their own and dont live on the wild side so I cannot offer any opinions of theirs because they are usually quite bland.   The rewards program is great and adds up fast, however make sure you do it while ordering because I found it VERY difficult to add on after the fact, losing out on quite a bit of points when we catered twice and when my wife picked up the subs without putting in the rewards number.  Take a break from your ordinary sandwich shop and stop in and give them a shot!  It will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Actually good subs...$8.50 sub, chips, and soda...Not Bad..They could use a beacon lamp in there, as well as a brass pole (not stripper like) Me and my helper ate there and thought it was decent! Very clean, as well as a good staff..."}
{"text":"I tried this place recently after going to subway for years. The turkey and the meatball are unreal and needless to say I'm probably not going back to subway after trying Firehouse. It's that good."}
{"text":"Love Firehouse Subs, switched things up and tried the Turkey Bacon Ranch, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"First time here.  I wanted to see how much different THIS sub place could be compared to all the others out there.  Um, yeah, IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME.  I split the large Italian with the man.  The meats just tasted so fresh and not too salty like some other places, and the melty cheese, toppings and sauce just made it sooooooo good.  It for sure did not taste like a fast food sandwich to me at all.  My new favorite sub place by FAR."}
{"text":"Full Steph, during rush hour, and it is just the slowest, most unmotivated bunch of employees I have ever seen. Two of them were more focused on stocking napkin containers and finishing potato chip bag stocking, that when the team leader is asking one of them to join, multiple times, both are acting like they can't hear her. Eventually, all four of them are behind the counter and it is still the slowest sandwich assembly line I've ever witnessed. But I don't know, maybe they are the original crew that opened that day, and are just exhausted. I'm just telling you what happened."}
{"text":"I love firehouse subs and frequent the one off Rainbow. Ordered online for pick up twice now at this location and both times orders have been wrong."}
{"text":"The Steak &Cheese were first rate, lots of meat & cheese, good bread (ordered 2 large). The Smokehouse Cheedar was good but very heavy on BBQ sauce, so if you don't want a sandwich overwhelmed by  & dripping of BBQ Sauce I recommend you tell them to limit it or eliminate it. The sandwich was full of meat and otherwise excellent. The Oatmeal Raisin cookie is entirely too sweet for my taste....too much brown sugar in that recipe.   I returned the next day. I tried the large Pastrami Sub, it was loaded with meat & cheese, but was also topped with a healthy helping of lettuce and tomatoes.   Unfortunately, while the sandwich was very tasty (and filling!) I became ill a couple of hours latter and spent too much time in the restroom for the balance of the day. Since this was my only food for the day, the lettuce and tomatoes become suspect (since they were the only change to the sandwich I'd had the day before which was meat and cheese only).  The two other sandwichs were a repeat of the Steak & Cheese with onions and those guests, loved them and had no illness problems (neither sandwich comes with lettuce or tomatoes).   It's been good enough for me to return, but it'll be \"meat & cheese only\" from now on for me.  These subs are about $7.50 - $8.00 for a 12 inch. You really can't compare them to a Subway Footlong, since the Footlong is often $5 and the $2.50 - $3.00 additional cost at Firehouse should be expected to buy a better more meat/cheese filled sub (which it does).  BTW, on my second visit, the very pretty cashier repeated my order back to me three times...incorrectly, I really expected something would be wrong when I received my food,  but in the end, she got it right :-)."}
{"text":"Yes, only 2 stars ... why? I was craving Firehouse Subs. I had been to the Rainbow location before - and well, not just for the cool soda machine, but my sandwich was excellent - service was excellent. OK ... so, back to this BRAND NEW Durango location: sandwich - very good. staff - very good and accommodating with our special request. HOWEVER, this store is DIRTY! Maybe it was the end of the night, maybe a little of the dirt and crumbs were because of that, but there was a lot that was old. Also, on the table that holds the napkins and silverware - there was a bucket with wet towels, soaking in a cleaning solution - just sitting out in a service area.  Firehouse Subs is also known for their selection of hot sauces. They had a huge selection, including their signature sauce. Every bottle I opened to try had a crusty, dried up ring around the pour area. In otherwords, they never wipe down these bottles. Discusting.  Lastly, I had not noticed the mural on the wall until I read the previous review. This is VERY disturbing! I wish I had taken a picture of it. It is a yellow Clark County Fire Truck - a fireman holding a hose, and - wait for it ... water coming out at full force at a fox. The poor fox's body was bent in half from the force of the water! I am sure it was meant to be fun, however (and this is coming from someone who does not get easily offended), this was straight up cruelty.  Would I go back to Firehouse, sure .... would I go back to this one - no."}
{"text":"This place really is a hidden (not so hidden) gem in Oakville. Me and some work colleagues decided to give this place a try on our lunch break and we're happily surprised by the quality of their sandwiches.  I don't know how they did it but they have outdone any sandwich place I've been to so far.  They're theme is all  about  and firefighters, with clever names for the samdwhices and salads it was really tough to pick something to try.  I had the salad which came in a HUGE portion, And my colleagues had the subs which they absolutely loved because it was mostly meat and less veggies ( as they should be)  I'll definitely be coming back anytime I have time to pass by this place!  Oh and the manager can be found everywhere between the kitchen, the prep area and the tables making sure everything and everyone is doing  great"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are always good. However the staff is a little unhappy today. When a guest request for something and if you don't feel like doing it...all you have to do is say you can't do it or give a reason that you cant. But don't say yes and roll your eyes. And talking sh*t while the customer is still in the restaurant adds icing to the cake and that's the way to go. Staff attitude sucks. Smile...if you don't like your job...then just quit. Find some place where you don't have to deal with people if you're gonna be such a nasty person. No one likes an unhappy staff. Makes you lose your appetite. Sheez!! I don't owe you sh*t!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Club on a Sub. Tasted excellent! Ordered through Uber Eats as they didn't deliver. I just wish it came with some napkins."}
{"text":"Who knew they smoked their own brisket here, and for 10+ hours?  Not me. If I'd known that I would have asked the hub to get me a sub, instead of a chicken salad salad, which was fine and homeade.... BUT the brisket, well, he was raving.  Even so, he let me have a bite and I had to agree it was great.  I gave 5 stars for the sub, and 3 for the salad...so if you are getting subs it is really 5 stars all the way.  He ordered the Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket Sub. It came with tasty bbq sauce on it and very fresh bread.  Now the dude wants to buy a franchise."}
{"text":"Every worker here is extremely rude, I have come in multiple times and never once has anyone here had a smile on their face. It's as if we the owners are in the back beating all of them before they send them out to make a sandwich. I come here quite often and I just hate that it takes so long to pick up an order and NO one, not one person, is enthusiastic about their job. You're luck if you get a half ass welcome to firehouse on top of it. Your attitude speaks volumes about how well you're going to prepare my food, let alone other people for Uber eats, you treat those drivers like their scum. I watched one of your employees give a driver straight attitude the moment he walked through the door. Fix your shitty demeanor."}
{"text":"Wow, I  the customer service by the manager and crew. My first experience with Firehouse subs. Cashier Manny recommended the Italian sub and it was so good. I have always been a Subway person because I am ex-employee. But this Italian sub sandwich was so good. The locations is clean and I am glad they have huge select of diet sodas. I would highly recommend this location and the sup/crew were very welcoming. I would come back and have already recommended others to come here as I ate here."}
{"text":"I love firehouse. I go here a lot, but usually I eat at the restaurant. Today, I ordered to go. They asked if the pickle slice on the side was ok, and of course I said yes, because the pickle is the best part. I got all the way home just to discover they forgot my pickle on the side!  :( Maybe don't offer something to someone if they're going to forget it anyway."}
{"text":"I am supremely disappointed. I walked in today at 6:30pm after driving across town to eat here.  Upon entering, I noticed four young employees behind the counter. Only one was making subs for the seven guests inside waiting for their food. I stood there thinking one of the other employees would eventually join to help the young woman. Instead, he started making jokes and the two of them began laughing together, delaying the process times even further.   Why would I stay to eat here?  I do not know if I will return to this location. I love the company and frequent two other locations in Las Vegas. Not all locations are good for the company. This location just added itself to the bad column. Today's business brought me to this part of town, so I decided to eat here again. I've been here a few times before, and it was never like this.  If the high school kids you've hired are not mature enough to run your business efficiently while you are away, perhaps they should not be left unattended."}
{"text":"Love the staff here. I come here sometimes to get my lunch and they remember my name and are so friendly. The food is great and they always have smiles on there face. This is probably the best location."}
{"text":"This Philly Cheesesteak is so damn good I didn't even finish it before rushing to the computer to type up a quick review.  I was extremely impressed by their collection of hot sauces, all rated 1-10 based on intensity.  Glad I finally stopped in to try the place after driving past it so many times..."}
{"text":"I think these guys have one of the best hot subs around. I differentiate hot and cold subs because they are completely different sandwiches. There are places in town that have great cold subs but Firehouse has one of the best hot subs around. I don't think there is a bad one on the menu. I love the Italian and the New York Steamer with corned beef and pastrami but the meatball, turkey bacon ranch, club, Engineer are all great. Every time you walk in you are greeted. Now granted sometimes are more exuberant than others. Sometimes you get WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE! and sometimes you get WELCOME to fireh... but you are greeted. Even after that they still remain friendly. They will explain things if you have never been there before or if you have questions. It is always nice and clean and the soda machine is never running low. The one little knock against them is the price. It is a little expensive but so worth it. So much better than some $5 piece of junk. Every once in awhile you get a craving and it is a nice indulgence. It also makes you feel good to round up your order and donate the change to firefighters. I like that little touch too and think more people should do it. Sure it is just change but it is going toward a great cause. I will keep coming back and have a hard time picking which sandwich I want because they are all so good. They get an extra point for having a Coke Freestyle machine. Those are the best."}
{"text":"Went in today to find a quick bite. 2 teenagers working and 2 customers waiting. Girl tells us they're super busy and won't be able to help us for at least 15 minutes. Ok, bye. Where is a manager? Why are kids working without supervision? I wouldn't trust the place anyway. Pretty filthy. Blessing in disguise."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. So much better than regular delis and sub places like subway and doesn't have a bad smell like subway. Prices are reasonable for what you get and great quality meat as well.  They have both hot and cold subs too. Pickles are amazing here and they have tons of hot sauce choices!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for fresh tasty subs. Well run and friendly staff, great value. I like this place much better than Subway. A little hard to find the first time, but worth it."}
{"text":"I really like this place, no matter the location the food and service is always consistent. Their meatball sub is amazing! full of flavor and the meatball to sub ratio is on point. The steak and cheese sandwich is okay, i don't like they use canned mushrooms but that is my only complaint with that sandwich. I have also tried their club and i was skeptical at first because it's not the traditional way a club sandwich comes but I was happily surprised at how good it was. They have a variety of sauces on the counter for you to put on your sandwiches which is nice and the cherry lime aid and fresh limes to add is a nice touch. They always give you service with a smile and even bring your sandwich to you when its ready! I would recomend if you have not been here to give them a try you will not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sub shops. The buns are so very good. The staff is always courteous and greet everyone as they come in the door with a great big, \"Welcome to Firehouse.\" The food is always delicious and warm, since it's made after you order it."}
{"text":"My first time going to a Firehouse Subs,  :) I really liked it, they had a fancy shmancy new drink dispenser that has over 150 beverage options, which is pretty cool. the Steak and Cheese sub was great, i really liked the fun and happy atmosphere and the attentive service I received."}
{"text":"So I was looking for a SUB on a Saturday for lunch, and I remember seeing Firehouse Subs because it was by the Sprouts grocery store that I go to.   I went to the website, and I decided to order online. I am glad I did because for some reason the Subs take  about 12-15 min to make. I understand they steam the meat, but still.  I thought that the online ordering process was a pretty cool feature. It had a lot of options to customize my sandwich. It definitely got me ready to have a SUB feast at Firehouse.  After checking out and spending almost $13 for a Large  (Steamer) SUB, and a sandwich plus a cookie. I was finally ready to pick up my order.  I decided to dine in to get the full experience. My order was ready when I got there, I got my soda, and used the Soda fountain to customize my soda which was cool.   The SUB was mediocre at best. Imagine a sub like Quiznos or Subway, but they \"steam the meat.\"  That does not necessarily make it better though. They steam the meat so much that the meat was actually soggy, and the bread was meh. The cookie was a basic cookie, nothing special. The best part of the meal was actually the soda.  I would not recommend this place unless you want to pay high prices for a typical non gourmet franchise SUB.  The place looks and feels like Quiznos on roids, and with 5 people behind the counter it shouldn't take this long to make a SUB on average. I think that if you compare this to other sub franchises that it has an edge with all the cool hot sauces to choose from, and the Soda fountain that is not like anything else I have seen in a store like this, but the prices, wait times,  and mediocre SUBS hold this place back."}
{"text":"For what people say about this place, I just don't see it.  I tried it and will not be back.  Too expensive for what is offered.  The wait is way too long and it didn't taste that great.  I would pick subway every day over this place."}
{"text":"At first i was not a firehouse fan! I had gone and did not like it what so ever! From the Sandwich i got (hook and ladder) to the long line! It must of just not been my day because I got dragged back by a friend and now i love it! I get the Italian and Steamer almost every time! You could not ask for a better sandwich! I also throw the Caption Sorenson sauce on! It is crazy good! I was a hater now i am a lover!"}
{"text":"Everyone is so friendly.  The food is excellent!  I have gone a couple of times now and  I always get lots of tender meat.  There is a great variety of sandwiches  something for everyone! I highly recommend  Firehouse . You will have a great time and a great meal ?"}
{"text":"Meh. Had The Steamer and the Engineer. Both were  average. Not certain the steamer had both types of meat on it- but had never eaten it before so who knows. Only one other table with customers who already had their food. Two orders behind us. Pretty slow to make the sandwich. Tables needed wiped off for being that slow. Just lackluster experience. Ok customer service."}
{"text":"We went to Firehouse Subs for the first time, today, at this location.  BRAD was our cashier. Brad was very knowledgeable of the entire menu, has a sweet personality that shone beyond, what could be perceived as an intimidating, outer shell and a warm welcoming smile.  She got the Hook And Latter, which looked only ok but was one of the best subs I've ever tasted in my life (The sauce with the melty Monterey jack and the warm deli thin heaping layer of meat on the cold ripe tomatoes and perfect amount of very thinly shredded lettuce within the warm white bread....OH! The Bread! The bread was the best part of the sandwiches. This is the most delish of all chain hoagie breads EVER! Hands Down. Must have.) and I had the meatball, which looked SO good but the sauce and balls highly lacked in seasoning. It had Italian seasoning but that was all. I need some onion flavor, some garlic flavor, a little heat, something MORE. I wish I would have gotten what she got. We were so impressed with Brad that I will return to this location but next time I'm ordering a different sandwich."}
{"text":"I would generally give this place 4 stars, but I think I would like to add an extra star for the friendly service I received. The two times I've been here I've had the meatball and the beef brisket sandwich- very yummy. Overall I think for the price point the sandwiches are delicious and tasty. They have a lot of interesting sauces you can try for your sandwich. The overall experience is great and I will be coming back for my yummy sandwiches. This would also be a fun place to take your family to have a sub and enjoy some subs."}
{"text":"I stopped By Sunday For dinner to go nothing good then a Hot sub for dinner better then Jimmy Johns or Subway after a trip to strongsville. One thing i notice is how a sub is not completed with out a Pickle and how i never got a Pickle the Strongsville store is the closes fire house subs to me then going any where else. I contacted you guys the next day but got no response. Anyway I would recommend firehouse subs to anyone."}
{"text":"Believe it  or not this was my first time at a firehouse Subs. The atmosphere was friendly, clean, lively and at the same time relaxed. Easy menu and good service! My wife and I split  the large tuna sandwich it was good enough for the both of us, they anticipated and served it in two separate baskets, delicious. My son had the medium brisket sub and of course daddy got to try some, I am telling you it melts in your mouth. If you're into hot sauce, this is hot sauce heaven. I recommend the Georgia peach onion hot sauce, but try them all. Great place to go if you're in for a sub."}
{"text":"Went in with an online order and the manager (chubby dude with shaved head) refused to check me out at the online order register and I asked him why he was being a d*** and he replied with \"I will be a d*** and not give you your food.\"  This was my second interaction with this manager and the last time was equally as negative, I told him to cancel my order and walked out, plenty of other options in the area.  I called today to put in a formal complaint and asked for a manager and was refused because they were in a \"rush\".  Disappointed and will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Just got a sub here for lunch with the rest of the peeps in the office. Not bad! IMO no sub will beat Jersey Mike's but this one was decent. I got the turkey salsa verde. The bread was soft and flavorful. The meat was tender. The veggies were really wilted unfortunately. It had the right amount of sauce and was only 430 calories. They have one of those crazy pop machines with 120+ drink choices so having more option for diet pop other than coke is great. It was the perfect size too."}
{"text":"This place is horrible I've contacted the corporate office and complained. The owner of this place called me on my cell phone said he wanted to make it right. He offered to send me a free lunch. I said it's OK you don't have to, he insisted and then never follow through. It's firehouse subs it's owned by fireman and part of its thing that makes them different is they offer dozens of different kinds of hot sauce.  But this one for whatever reason won't order the good ones I guess it just cost too much. Just like their sandwiches they cost too much. LOL that was a joke. The truth is it's way too much money for bread there's barely any meat on the sandwiches. And there's nothing that makes them unique a.k.a. hot sauce. Save your money and go someplace else. Buy your own bottle of hot sauce and go to Subway I guess."}
{"text":"Love this location, although this chain is consistent in several other locations I have been to in AZ.  Great quality ingredients means a higher quality meal and you get what you pay for.  Have tried several different subs and liked them all. Never a bad meal here or take out."}
{"text":"I got the steak and cheese sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised. They didn't skimp on the meat and the cheese was melted all over. The sandwich was a bit pricey but I'd have to say it was a worth it to have a hearty sandwich for once. I also enjoyed their selection of hot sauces that they had since I'm a huge fan of spice."}
{"text":"Firehouse subs welcomed me with great service. Their unique steamed meats and toasted breads made a great sandwich combo! My favorites are the Italian and the Club on a Sub. I love the hot sauce rack with over 50 hot sauces of all kinds to try out.  This is definitely the GO TO sandwich shop on state street. They are even open late on friday and saturday nights for the bar crowd which is awesome. And now they even deliver during the week on certain times.  Would recommend this shop to anyone in the capitol area, students and adults alike."}
{"text":"Had a firehouse hero sandwich and it was quite delicious.  It was a very flavorful sandwich, the prices were reasonable, and the people there are friendly."}
{"text":"I'm giving this two stars over one only because the employees were friendly and the place was clean.  I got a cheesesteak sandwich, which was almost cold...the cheese only barely melted.  The flavor was not good.  The mushrooms, canned.  I truly would expect a better tasting sandwich if I were to buy a frozen sandwich.  Very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Came here after a wedding rehearsal for a quick bite to eat. Wide variety of subs but I opted for a salad. The salad was really good and affordable. They also have about 50' hot sauce options which is a huge plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I have visited this eatery a few times now and I like it. The subs are tasty and huge. Definitely a meal you could share if you like to. There is always a ton of meat, which can be a little too much for me but that's probably the best part for most. Ingredients are generally fresh tasting but nothing that knocks my socks off. Would love to see a few more fresh ingredients and maybe some more salad options. But then again it is a sub shop."}
{"text":"I'm always down for a good sub and this place did NOT disappoint.   The firehouse meatball was really really amazing. Definitely recommend the sweet and spicy version of it.   Their service was amazing! My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed it for our first time. The cashier even came by to ask if everything was okay, as well as picking up our empty trays.   2 big thumbs up."}
{"text":"No bacon on my sub and received the wrong chips. I paid a premium - what a rip off! If you are going to charge almost $10 for a sub, at least look at what ingredients go in it! Will not order again."}
{"text":"I like it much better than some other sub places. Place is clean, service is friendly, food is fresh, simple and nicely portioned. It's a great quick fix lunch or dinner for a decent price."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place ever. I love every sandwich I've had so far at Firehouse. So much flavor in every bite and I love that they don't hesitate when putting on the meat.  As per this location- amazing. I always go this location as it is convenient and the staff is very friendly. I am always greeted with a smile and \"welcome to firehouse!\" when I walk in. The sandwich is delivered to my table and I am asked every time if I would like anything else and to enjoy my meal. The place is also kept pretty clean including the bathrooms as well. There always seems to be enough staff to keep the line short and the service efficient.  The only negative I would say is that it is a bit pricey. Nearly $7 for basically equivalent size of a 6 inch at subway and that's only the sandwich.  I will definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Their service is great n sandwich is really awesome. I have eaten in this place many times n the quality is consistently good. The freshness of veggies, melted cheese and slice of pickle makes it mouth watering!   Yum....  Probably due to the way they prepare their sandwiches they take more time than your topical sandwich shop like Subway.  I only wish they had more outlets everywhere like the subways."}
{"text":"This place has some of the worst service I've experienced.  And all they do is take the order and deliver the food.  It's the way they do it.  They aren't polite at all!  Barely look you in the eye when you come in.  Witnessed a customer have her order delivered.  Order was wrong, customer complained. THE EMPLOYEE had the nerve to grab the order from the line drop it at the customers table telling them they were wrong and walked away.  I've had enough of this place.  Not coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Firehouse is giving Jersey Mike's a run for its money as top chain sandwich place in town.   The place is very open, and there is no cramped feeling, even if there was a ton of people in there.   I ordered the NY Steamer sandwich, and is a very high-quality sub. I did get the sandwich \"Fully involved\". The brisket & pastrami combo was outstanding. The cole slaw on top was the icing on the cake! I did get the foot long Large sub, which is $2.00 more. Well worth the couple bucks.   The famous soda machine has over 120 soda styles. I did get a peach-cherry Mello Yello. Peach soda is awesome!  Will be back soon, and will order the brisket & cheddar large sub next time."}
{"text":"Hungry at the mall and loved the idea of a sandwich instead of the burgers, japanese food, etc.   A nice, well-made sandwich--that's all the girl wanted.   Asked for the small italian-no mayo,no mustard (as it already comes with an italian type of dressing).  Paid, walked over to a table and THEN.....  I opened the styrofoam box that had the sandwich in it.   The styrofoam box and the napkins inside the bag had red grease stains.  It was the grease dripping off the pepperoni.  The heat their sandwichs so this was the result of the pepperoni melting in the sandwich--grease.   Inside the sandwich, the meats were scarce. Lettuce was plentiful.  A few slices of tomato and a pickle.  I did not enjoy this mediocre sandwich and am surprised that this stand has survived among the competition at the Arizona Mills Mall.  Never eating here again.  What a waste of $$."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 simple subs to go before 5 other parties. 20 minutes later and after everyone else revived dinner I got mine. Food is great service was poor."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Firehouse Subs, I knew I had to give it a try. I invited a friend of mine to join me for lunch and she confirmed that she, too, had heard only great things about it.  Now, I'm a huge fan of a good sub sandwich. It takes a lot for me to get tired of eating sandwiches. I was raised on delicious Jersey subs, so it's basically a part of who I am.  To keep an unexceptional story short, both myself and my friend were sadly disappointed by the Firehouse Sub experience. The food was not nearly as good as we had come to hope based on what everyone was saying.  I ordered the Cheese Steak Combo (medium) and my friend ordered the Engineer sandwich (also medium). We split the chips and drink included with the combo, but our total still came to just shy of $30 before tip.  It's not that the food was bad. It's just that, with truly outstanding options like Capriotti's and Which Wich so close by, you leave Firehouse Subs with the sense that just paid a little too much for a characterless, undersized sandwich.  You get way more food for your money at Capriotti's and Which Wich. You also get better tasting food, in my opinion. Ambiance is comparable between the three. Service at Firehouse Subs was just-ok (whereas service at Capriotti's is outstanding).  Again - there was nothing WRONG with Firehouse Subs. I just don't think I prefer them when other, subjectively \"better\", options are so close by. I probably won't bother returning, but neither would I turn anyone away."}
{"text":"Ordered out tonight and for the most part was great ! Called in the order and our sandwiches were done in 10 minutes and everything was completed per our order!!   4 stars just because the greeting coming in was not as welcoming as usual ! We come here often and will continue!! Love the sweet tea and all there sandwiches are good !! I had the tuna on wheat and it did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Just recently tried Firehouse Subs for the first time, and we've already had it three times! Really delicious sandwiches that really seem to have great ingredients that are top quality. I've tried the steak and cheese, meatball, and the new york steamer. All were really good and unique from some other chain sub places.  This location is close to our house so we went there to pick up sandwiches recently. It took forever! There was plenty of people working and not a ton of people in the shop, so it shouldn't have taken 20+ minutes to get two sandwiches made, but it did. I also didn't find them to be that friendly or helpful. We ordered by phone another time, which proved to be a better experience.  Hopefully, this location will get the service down and then there will be nothing stopping it. With delicious sandwiches for decent prices, Firehouse is our new favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"FireHouse Subs delicious!!! Yummy . Lunch with my son enjoying Fuel Under 500 Hook and Ladder sandwich ! Come on go get a sub , it's always fresh and great tasting !"}
{"text":"Lovely place and lovely staff! Great value for the price and big portions. Subway is definitely quaking."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch,  as people around me were craving to go there. Don't know if CA have Firehouse Subs, but it was my first. I had #1 Hook and Ladder. I guess the big thing about this place is that they steam the subs (?) . I didn't see this place being that special. although it was good, maybe little better than Quiznos. The funny thing was that the local Firefighters were there for lunch. They must get discounts or something. Lol"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to have Firehouse Subs one evening, and it was really delicious. We ordered online and it was ready to be picked up in 15 mins, we ordered two Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket with Bacon, and although we really couldn't taste the bacon, it was due to all the delicious flavors of the beef and cheddar. We also had a Turkey Bacon Ranch and a Corned Beef Brisket which my father-in-law loved and said it was the best sub he's had. Can't wait to try something new from here!"}
{"text":"Went into the New Firehouse sub restaurant tonight and the food was a 5, service was a 5, very friendly, helpful, polite, fast service. My problem is how can you open a new restaurant and have old menus for viewing and charge a different price than what shows in the menu, not a good impression. It was approx 2 dollars more than the menus said, sorry but I would not have those menu out, it can only piss people off too see one price and get charged another,  they do not have a sign posted or cashier saying prices wrong in menu...I question 2 different charges on my bill and she said yah the prices went since those were printed well then throw those out until new ones come in. This was my 1st time ever in any Firehouse sub place, I'll go back but not hurry in, I can get a 3.50 sub at another place for same size, just as good, sorry"}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs works in a pinch.   I stopped here for lunch while in the area and basically Firehouse Subs is what you would get if you were to mix Subway with Quizno's and added a high tech soda fountain. I went the healthy route and ordered the Turkey Salsa Verde; Smoked turkey breast, Monterey Jack, salsa verde sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, wheat roll and nixed the mayonnaise. At 400 calories it is pretty hard to beat.  This was a pretty damn good sandwich considering the caloric investment featuring fresh Turkey and a great zippy kick from the salsa verde sauce. I was impressed! Adding chips and a soda for less than $10.00 didn't hurt either. I will unquestionably try Firehouse Subs if I run into another franchise again."}
{"text":"Service is slow & food is overpriced. Cute place. Virtually no one in the place but they were obviously filling to go orders before my order."}
{"text":"Great place!   Clean Good service Fresh rolls Good prices Fast service Great selection  It was busy on a Saturday. Had plenty of people Woking. Line moved fast with three cashiers. Food came out quickly!  Had the Turkey Salsa Verde sub. The sliced Turkey was THE tenderest, moistest turkey I've ever had on a sandwich. The bread was fresh and delicious!   Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was the dirtiest restaurant I have even eaten in!    My wife told me how good firehouse subs were so while going to California she wanted to eat here.  We went in and were greeted fast and no one was in line on a Sunday at dinner time (should have been my first clue!)  We ordered our sandwiches and went to get the fountain drinks.  The floor was filthy and had multiple layers of spills on it.  The counter in the drink area also was dirty and had several old spills and trash on it.    I went to try the drink machine and could see lemons or limes inside the drain and other trash in it.  The drink machine needed a wiping down and it also had spills all over it.    We were able to find a table that didn't need too much wiping down so we could eat.  This place was slow and only had one other table with dine-in customers.    I counted 9 employees working and they were not busy.  I can not believe the management or health department could let this place stay open with it being this dirty.   The food was not that good either!"}
{"text":"Had heard quite a few people brag up Firehouse's subs so much, my wife and I decided to try for ourselves and see if the food was worth the hype. Needless to say, I won't order a sub from anywhere else now. The food is absolutely incredible, the subs you get are packed with meat (unlike some establishments where you get 20 percent meat and 80 percent bread), the prices are comparable to Subway (extremely reasonable for what you get here), and the customer service is always top notch at this location. Example, a few weeks ago, circumstances went down beyond their control as they were making our subs and by no fault of theirs, it took a tad longer to make them. However, as I went up when our order was complete, the cashier Bri was extremely apologetic (which she didn't need to be, they have no control over machinery not working) and comped us each a drink and chips. Above and beyond customer service like this along with great subs made us buy into the hype so to speak and now we are Firehouse regulars."}
{"text":"I have visited the Firehouse Sub in High Point, NC, several times, and I was always happy with my sandwich. But it's been probably 4-5 years since I've been to a Firehouse since.  The sub was even better than I remembered. I got the Italian on white with no onion, and from the first bite to the last, it was wonderful. The meat is obviously high quality, the seasoning (especially on this specific sub) is perfectly balanced, but by far the best part of the sub was the bread. It was warm and tasted like it had just been taken out of the oven. One of the best subs I've ever had.  My friend ordered the Hook & Ladder on wheat and enjoyed it too (that was the special of the day, and I almost ordered it myself because it looked so good, but I have no regrets - my Italian was heavenly). She also liked the chips; she said they were very crispy. When she had finished her sandwich, she told me, \"I'd come back here again.\"  I ordered a third sandwich, the Club on a Sub, to bring back to a friend at work. She asked for it to be cold, as she doesn't like heated sandwiches. So after the sandwich was made, the cashier let me know they had put it in the cooler to keep it cold until we were ready to pick it up. I had not asked for that; I had simply told her I needed it to go, and that my friend wanted it cold. I thought that was very nice to go the extra mile. My friend pinged me and told me she thought the sub was very good.  In terms of friendliness of the staff, a couple of them greeted us with \"Welcome to Firehouse\", and everyone was very nice. I also liked that the sandwiches all seemed to be proportioned well; the meats and condiments were evenly spread out over the length of the rolls, which isn't always true for some other sub chains.  I am not a fan of Subway or Quiznos, but I do eat at Jersey Mike's and Jimmy John's when I get the chance. I'd recommend them both. But if you're looking for a hot sub served on bread that truly tastes freshly baked, I would definitely recommend you try this Firehouse.  Update: My Club on a Sub friend liked her sandwich so much she stopped and got another one last night. Not at the same location, but she enjoyed it just as much. :-)"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I loved it! Staff at this location is so wonderful and helpful. The Italian sub was put together perfect and the kind employee noticed we were sharing and split it for us into separate baskets. Love it but parking is confusing"}
{"text":"I agree, this location is bunk.  First time ever trying firehouse subs and I won't be to another because this one ruined it for me.  Hot sauce selection was pathetic, most bottles were empty and they were ALL dirty.  The person taking the orders was completely distracted and mumbled.  The place was practically empty and it took forever for the one guy to make our food.  The drink machine was out of about 80% of it's options including the limeades they're supposed to be famous for.  My sandwich was a joke.  I've seen better from a convenience store.  Tiny and bland.  I ordered the large and it was so small, I thought i was being punked.  I was pretty mad when I left that place considering how much we spent.  I hope they keep getting one star reviews.  Anyone who gives them 5 deserves to have a nasty sub thrown at their face.  I don't care if some of the money goes to firehouses, I pay taxes, so my conscience is clear."}
{"text":"good subs, the sauces are awesome! they have so many to choose from, it makes the sub!"}
{"text":"My sons an I ate at Firehouse subs last night for the first time and it was great. The decor is really cute and keeps the kids entertained. I had the Italian and really enjoyed it. The owner was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Awesome place and right by my apt, would recommend anybody here if you want a nice meal and break from Subway,"}
{"text":"Delicious but the girl at the front might have been the least personable I've ever met. Dk what you can have against someone when you've never actually talked to them. Saw her doing it to other customers too. As someone in the service industry I know how it is to have a bad day. I have A LOT going on outside of work. But if you want people to come back or maybe even tip you, don't act like a jerk. I've seen it first hand with other employees that don't know how to act, you eventually get less service, less tips. It's a lose lose for everyone involved that works there. It's just as dumb as someone repeatedly coming back to a waiter to order lunch and not tipping, while still expecting quality food. Or delivery to repeatedly have someone use gas and wear and tear on their own car to bring you food, and expect it to have quality consistency. They're lucky I'm giving them 3 stars because I'm extremely empathetic."}
{"text":"This was my first time to firehouse subs which i have been wanting to try for awhile.  First impressions were great very nice and clean establish me and friendly staff. So my hopes for the food were high, i ordered there limited addition Reuben that comes with pastrami, swiss, thousand island and coleslaw. All of which sounded amazing since i was starving.  I had to order it to go, took about 5 min to get the sub which was not bad. Rushed back to work to eat and opened what seemed like a light box and there it was the worlds smallest medium sub, only slightly longer then the pickle it came with. Oh and the lack of filling was impressive it did not even go to the last inch on each side of the bun and there was no coleslaw on it.  So overall very disappointed, will not be recommending this place or revisiting!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here, and have been here several times. This location is showing its age and a lack of attention to detail. My wife's water was discolored (brown) and the staff couldn't clear it out of their system. The pickles served alongside our sandwiches were limp, soggy, and looked like they'd been gnawed on. Lastly, a customer at a nearby table complained about her pants being stained by an old chair whose seat cushion was cracked with age. Management needs to refresh the place and spend a few bucks."}
{"text":"They have awesome subs!  I prefer them over Subway or Quiznos.  I enjoy either  the steak & cheese or smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket.  Those are my top two subs."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place around. Good service and good food in a clean environment. What more can you ask for in a \"quick food\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there today after yelping for a new tasty lunch spot and stumbled upon a few reviews that made me immediately get up and go.  I followed the advice of several others and started with the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket, and it was sooo worth it.  It was the freshest, most flavorful sandwich I've had in a very very long time.  The steaming does take a little longer then the typical Subway employee but it is sooo worth it, and really not that long of a wait.  I've waiting much longer for late night fillie bees and never been as satisfied.  My boyfriend had the club on a sub which was also amazing... the meat tastes so much better steamed. It literally melts in your mouth.    I would of given 5 stars, but the pickles tasted a little weird, chip selection is so so and the signiture firehouse cherry-limeade... definitly pass.    Overall though, I didnt come for the sides, I came for the sandwich, and the sandwich was amazing.  Even if this place is out of your way you need to at least try it.  My money says you'll be back =)"}
{"text":"Slowly becoming a staple in the lunch rotation, consistently FS offers happy service and a very good sandwich.  My last go around I went with a club on a sub.  I chose a large and I am happy for having done so.  A medium always left me wanting more.  The sub was awesome and ingredients were fresh.  There is an assortment of different hot sauces to compliment your meal.  I have yet to find anything to unbearable and everything has so far complimented the meal.  Beware....lunch time can get a tad busy.  The tempo doesn't seem to cause a slow down in the sandwich making process but the inside can fill up making it difficult to find a spot to eat."}
{"text":"Love their subs. Wait time is excessive in my opinion. First visit 25 min to get two subs. They improved to 20 min my second visit."}
{"text":"I'm VERY glad this place opened up around this intersection.  To be completely honest, this intersection in Chandler/Gilbert is the least attractive to me as an eater/foodie... I've tried EVERY eating place at this intersection and the few we ever return to (though not lately since I prefer to just cook my own foodie obsessions at home) are not even anything special.  Having said that, I have eaten here maybe 2 or 3 times already (during the weekend, when momma doesn't feel like cooking so much) and I REALLY love their Italian sandwich... like, I've craved it very often since having it the first time.  It is warm/toasted, plenty of Italian meats (though I do suggest if you don't like the sweetness of their honey ham, you can have them add less and more of another italian meat.. which they gladly do).. and I love biting in to the crispy yet soft bread and getting melted mayo and italian meat juice all over my face :P  It is the stuff of cravings for me.  The staff here is friendly, chipper, nice... they have a bajillion soda selections (though I don't drink soda.. haven't for years...) and you can donate a bit of your bill to the local Fire Station.  I definitely return here."}
{"text":"well this was my first trip to a firehouse subs and I was here with Rand H (another newbie to firehouse subs} well the sandwich I had was the BBQ brisket and cheddar and it was an easy 5 star sandwich. The service is also very friendly . I counted ten of them in this location and only about 8 customers.when we were there i read and took a menu with me because they have lots of great sandwiches I would like to try on return visits and yes I will return. Firehouse subs is in my books , the best subs."}
{"text":"They do a great job at this location. Even the owner of the location or who I thought was the owner came over to check on me. Employees are nice and helpful. My only complaint and its not even a refelction of the staff or food is the other customers. Because of the location you get some weird people in there. One guy was so high he couldn't speak or almost stand. But they do get a lot of police, military, and fire fighters I can see when I'm in there during lunch so you feel good when you're there."}
{"text":"My husband recommended we stop here after his taste buds were lit up by the ads showing your Firehouse Meatball Sandwich. It didn't disappoint! Good size portion, moist & tasty meatballs, perfectly melted cheese and spices. I enjoyed the Hook and Ladder Light (under 500 calories) with a generous helping of meat, toppings and tasty bread. The atmosphere was bright, inviting and very clean. The team was energetic and working well to serve the customers. Thanks for a great experience. We'll be back! P.S. I enjoyed reading about your history and how you support your communities. All the best as you press on in the competitive world of fast casual dining!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat... great service friendly people. Defently recommend. Get the hook and ladder or hook and ladder light delicious"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time recently and it was pretty darn good. The staff was very nice and friendly and the establishment was very clean and well kept.   I ordered a #5, the Bacon Ranch Sub and it was very good. I wasn't as impressed with the bread as I was with the filling and actual flavors.   I will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that they added another Firehouse Subs up here in the northwest and as expected, this one doesn't disappoint. The only reason  I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that they crowded this small space with too many tables almost making it like a maze to move around inside. Other than that, I'm very pleased in this new addition."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a sub sandwich!  The staff is friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, the staff is very friendly. Always welcoming. They make you feel like family...  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Seriously the best service I have had in years. Food is amazing, the staff is very friendly. Always welcoming. They make you feel like family...  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I got a large sub from here and it was incredible. Also got a nice warm welcome from everyone, definitely going back when I'm back in AZ"}
{"text":"i'd give this place a 3.5 star review for our first visit.  i'm not a fan of too many sub sandwich places, so my hopes were not very high. every time someone tells me to check out \"this place\" or \"that place' because they think it's great, i leave a little disappointed in the food and in the person who recommended it.  thankfully, i thought Firehouse Subs was pretty good.  i tried 2 sandwiches - the New York Steamer (terrible name) and the Capt. Sorensen's Datil Pepper Grilled Chicken. both were very tasty. the Steamer had maybe too many sauces for my liking (mustard, Italian dressing and mayo) and the pastrami was a little lost in the mix. it was still pretty good though. the Datil Pepper Grilled Chicken was better but impossible to eat as the sandwich just fell apart due to the shredded lettuce (which should be abolished). the flavor of the pepper sauce was very nice and i was tempted to go up front to get more at the condiment bar.  The prices were a little high but whatever.  I can see going back again sometime. it was better than Subway, Penn Station and maybe even Quiznos."}
{"text":"Great subs if you don't mind waiting more than 20 MINUTES to get a sandwich. At one point I wanted to go back there and make it myself. How in the world does it take 20 minutes to make a sandwich!!?"}
{"text":"I've got to say. I am incredibly incredibly disappointed in the customer service and overall service of this restaurant. I have been a patron of Firehouse Subs for years and on many occasions gotten corporate platters and even for family reunions placed very very large orders to the restaurant. I will continue to eat at Firehouse. Never again will I go to this particular location. it is this location at Santan Valley Parkway in Gilbert that is the issue. Without going into details suffice it to say the owner gave me terrible terrible customer service.   If I were you - take your money elsewhere. There's there are two other locations for firehouse down the road.   Gilbert Road in Chandler  Stapley and baseline in Mesa.   Go to either of those instead"}
{"text":"Tried Firehouse Subs again since a new location opened up by my house. I ordered and Italian and all it had was a sweet taste and was soggy. I was not expecting a sweet sandwich and could not finish it because it was way too sweet. I looked at the ingredients to try and figure out what is sweet on the thing and the only possible thing is the Italian Dressing which I'm not used to being sweet."}
{"text":"Why does this place get such good reviews? Had a Pastrami \"fully involved\" and it was a soggy, tasteless mess. Had no flavor at all. My wife had the Mediterranean Chicken and she said \"there are way too many liquids on this it is all soggy\".  The worst part...the Chili was NASTY and I couldn't even eat it. Watered down, no flavor and the flavor it did have was not pleasant. I've had better chili out of a can. Wendy's Chili is 1000 times better then this crap.  Give me Jersey Mikes, Jimmy Johns or even Subway over this. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered large and medium subs to go. Sina was extremely helpful and patient in assisting me in figuring out what to order. Once home, our food was absolutely delicious. Although certainly not the cheapest option, for $24.00 we had a great lunch with subs, drinks and chips. Food was high quality.  Go and see Sina---you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food, but the service at the order/checkout was the worst I have encountered in several years.  Big-time attitude from the \"manager\" and another employee when I arrived for an order I placed at 11:06 a.m. for 11:45 a.m. pick-up.  When I tried to get my sandwiches, the two employees told me they \"just got the order.\"  I was made to feel like I was causing them serious problems, but I just stood there dumbfounded.  Change the attitude ASAP or you are going to have a serious downturn in business!"}
{"text":"To me all the fire house subs places taste the same which is good for consistency.  The things that separate these types of places is the people.  I stopped by for a quick bite to eat.  The food took a bit longer.  When I asked about it they had made a mistake.  The young man working there offered me a free bag of chips or another dessert while they sorted it out.  I passed because I wanted my sub.  They got my sub to me about 5 minutes.  It was good.  It took a few minutes for them to get some traction, but they got it.  I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"So not good that this is less than 2 minutes from my house! Really great sandwiches at fair prices. My favorite is the italian. I liked the meatball but I make better! They are always really fast with getting the sandwiches out and the people at the registers are all really nice. I love their soda machine. I feel like a kid in a candy store trying to pick my drink with all the fun buttons and options! Only complaint is they are not out and about cleaning the tables quickly. Twice I have asked for something to wipe one down to get a seat. No biggie, they are busy and I usually take it home anyways. I did go 3 times before they told me about the punch card as well but I have one now and will use it."}
{"text":"After drooling over their TV commercials for years I finally got to try Firehouse Subs. I was starving and in the area so I made my way there. After studying the menu for a few minutes I chose the New York Steamer toasted combo. It features corned beef brisket and pastrami, melted provolone cheese, deli mustard, mayo, and Italian dressing and your choice of chips and fountain drink.  There was one guy ahead of me that was picking up a to go order of sandwiches for him and his co workers so I had about a 10 minute wait for my sandwich which was weird to me as there were multiple people working. I don't see why one of the other workers couldn't make my sandwich for me.  Once I finally received my sandwich I realize that I made the mistake of not asking for lettuce and tomato as I thought that they would be automatically added to my sandwich as that is how it is pictured on the menu and I was not asked if I wanted them or not.  I must say that the sandwich was worth the wait as it was stuffed with meat! The corned beef brisket and pastrami were delicious and the melted provolone cheese was the icing on the cake.  If only Firehouse would come to the eastern suburbs..."}
{"text":"Have not even had one yet. But took the time to order both on line and in person. Neither went through was hung up on. Went toCapriottis instead. Will go in person next attempt since close to home."}
{"text":"That's one kick ass sub!    I can honestly say I'm stuffed after eating here.  The subs area great,l the people are great and there are many choices of subs to order.  I happened to be passing through and had never tried Firehouse Subs before and I'm wondering where they've been my whole life!    The restaurant is clean,  organized and offers outdoor seating, which I took advantage of.     One of the benefits is they offer a first responders discount, I think its 15% which is always a bonus.  If you're between Phoenix and CA, stop by and eat here"}
{"text":"This particular experience is a 5 star experience. This was my first time ever eating at Firehouse Subs. The people were extremely polite, the food came out fast, the Italian sub my girlfriend got was delicious (I had a bite) and my meatball sub was phenomenal. The soda machine was a super nice addition, the restaurant was clean and well kept. Our food was brought to us and the girl came and took our trays and trash from me before I had a chance to get up. Ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff here is nice. I've never had a bad experience there And I've notice every time I'm there someone takes the time to make sure everyone's dining experience is okay even if their waiting for food. The hot sauce selection is always clean and never dirty. I have ran across times where they've ran out of certain meats but none the less this is the best one I've been to so far."}
{"text":"Located in Concord Mills, this seems like a good option for lunch. It was just ok. I feel like all the food in this mall is over priced- like there's just a $2 up charge fee for being in the mall. I had a small philly cheese- and boy do they mean small. It was more like kid/snack size. They do have their own seating, so you can eat in a quieter environment than just in the food court with the masses."}
{"text":"The subs were amazing, price a bit high but worth it. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place because there are a few things about firehouse subs that stands out from the rest of the other sub places. First of all, i've always had great customer service, the employees are always helpful and not so rude like some of the people i've seen at nearby sub places.   The subs are flavorful, I actually want to go get one right now because just the thought of it makes me crave them. I always get the italian sub, they put in the works and boom you got a juicy sub with lots of flavor. There is just some kind of sauce in it that drips while Im eating it, whatever it is, its delicious. Don't miss out on these great subs my fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place 5 stars. The food has been very good each time I have visited but the problem is with the service. Inside has been dirty on the last few visits and I don't know how many employees actually work in a shift because there were several employees sitting in the dining area eating and the guy who took my order was eating a brownie. This dude actually had the nerve to finish his brownie and get a drink before taking my payment. The counter was covered in crumbs and trash mostly around the cash register. I also placed a phone order and when I got there they said they accidentally gave it to someone else so I had to wait for them to finish eating so they could re-make my food. The employees here really need some training because I love the subs here yet have been going down the street to Subway since they have been not necessarily better tasting but just more consistent and clean than Firehouse. I don't get the amount of employees that were hanging around eating and tossing stuff. It was like a middle school lunch room or something.  The food is good. I like the firehouse meatball a lot. It's got good flavor and the meatballs are very good. I ask for it sweet and spicy and it doesn't disappoint. I recommend this sandwich to any meatball parm lover. They have other sandwiches that my wife enjoys but I just get the meatball. Especially good in the winter when it's cold out since the sandwich us toasted. They do have a nice size patio if you want to eat outside.  MSG FROM OWNER: Not long after posting this review I heard from the owner Ryan C that said the following.   \"Thank you for letting me know about this situation. Could you provide a name so I am able to address this situation correctly and according.\""}
{"text":"I love me some Firehouse Subs!!   What's not to love, fresh well portioned tasty sandwiches served up by a friendly staff.  I have been going to Firehouse Subs for years and have tried pretty much everything on the menu many times...never a disappointment.  I love the hot sauce selection so much, but I swear I love their house sauce the best. I keep some at home at all times and use it in many recipes.   Bottom line.....consistent goodness, a great place to fill the belly."}
{"text":"Had Firehouse Subs for the first time today. Nothing exciting. Kind of like better than Subway but worse than Jersey Mike's. Also I've had a better sandwich at a grocery store deli.   They use the type of stringy lettuce that should only be used as a bed for your real food. At least subway has spinach. The meat was bland and I was looking at SO MUCH CHEESE and for some reason still couldn't taste it.   The cups they give you for sides of ranch are also the cups they use for communion. But they don't mind giving you more when you ask, nothing worse than people who try to regulate your condiment intake."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch to try Firehouse for the first time. I was impressed by their dining area.  It was very clean and well maintained.  The decor is pretty much dedicated to the men and women of fire departments of course.  They also had a Henderson firemans gear on the wall as well.  I have a lot of respect for their profession!   On to the food- I ordered the medium steak and cheese sub.  Pretty decent fillings of steak, cheese, provolone, onions, peppers and mushrooms.  I would say it is comparable to its competitors but not above and beyond. They have a huge array of hot sauces you can add once you've received your order.  The sauces are numbered on a hot scale to choose what level of spicy you like.  It was good but not over the top.    I realize it's not like Subway where you see them prepare, pay and leave.  Although we seemed to wait a while for them to finish our order. It wasn't too busy so I thought it was odd.  When you are hungry and start to get 'hangry ', every second that passes seems like an hour.    That being said, I still wouldn't hesitate to stop in again.  The food was decent for another go!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location quite a few times.  I always get the hook and ladder and loved it.  I always thought it could use a little something else.  Well to my surprise.  They have a section with bottles and sauces.  I was like damn.  How long as that been there of course I did not notice until I was leaving.  The next time I am here I will try one of the sauces to kick the hook and ladder into little bit of a inferno.   Like this place and recommend it."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pastrami sandwiches.  Hands down the worst pastrami sandwich i have ever had.  There was hardly any pastrami.  The pastrami reminds me of the $1.00 bag of lunch meat you get at walmart.   Absolutely flavorless.  Good luck finding the provolone cheese on your sandwich."}
{"text":"Am ashamed to say I have filled up my punch card, twice.  Usually get the Hook and Ladder.  But the main reason I keep going back...the magical Coke machine of Awesomeness."}
{"text":"Subway, Mr. Sub and Quizno's, might as well pack up and move to the other side of Oakville!  Brisket sandwich, awesome.  Don't make the same mistake that I did the first time, go with the \"large\".  Service, cleanliness and efficiency, top marks!"}
{"text":"Food is good but this sandwich shop needs to pay more attention to the little things . For example,  no ice in the drink machine,  completely out of sweet tea, one of the entrance doors was not working.   We told the person at the counter  but he didn't do anything about it.   Granted it is lunch time,  but the place really needed so cleaning. Tables are not wiped down,  trash on the floor. A little more attention to details would really help."}
{"text":"I was in Vaughan for the first time socially in awhile and was hungry. I whipped open Yelp and searched hot and new and Firehouse Subs came to the top! It's tucked in the back of the Fortinos plaza near major Mackenzie and Jane.   Walked in and immediately liked this place. Very cool design. Like a real fire station.   They have a set up similar to subway or me sub but with a higher end sandwich shop like when Quiznos first came to Canada. There are 10 specialty sandwiches on their menu with the most popular being #5 - Turkey Bacon Ranch and #10 - the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket, which is what I ordered.  I had the medium which I ordered as it is to get a true sense for the flavour. The thinly sliced beef brisket reminded me of an Arby's Beef and cheddar - except not with that immediate urge to defecate or vomit. Not in this case it was actually quite well done and tasted pretty good and fresh with minimal cheddar but more BBQ sauce - which was more of a sweet sauce than a smokey.   They seem to be growing rapidly in southern Ontario with 10 or 11 locations and growing. As an added bonus they ask you at time of payment if you'd like to round up to the next dollar to support first responders and their families. Really cool guys. Much respect.   Eatcrest out.   I liked the general look, feel and vibe of this place and the sandwiches were pretty good too at a fair price. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of subway and Quiznos, but firehouse subs is a cut above them!   My favorite here is the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket, I usually get a large sub and fully involve it, which is adding all the extra ingredients.   The staff here is very nice. Everytime I have been here I am greeted when I walk into the door and they even deliver the food to your table! Unfortunately they can't take tips which is unfortunate because I feel they do so well."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. Sandwiches are always deliciously prepared and the staff is always friendly, and it's reasonably priced. I recommend the turkey bacon ranch sub. It's quite good. Also quite good for takeout."}
{"text":"I think their subs are quite delicious.  Better than Quiznos or Subway.  Price is comparable to the former but slightly more expensive than the latter.  My daughter loves getting a fireman's hat, too.  Decent service."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a firehouse subs; as someone who isn't a sandwich guy this was among the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. I got the Italian on white with bacon. The guy at the counter was very knowledgeable however the girl making my sandwich messed it up. I can't help but think of how much better my sandwich would have been if it had only been made as I asked. The girl making the sandwich was kinda rude too.  Restaurant was very clean and everyone else was friendly. I'd have filled out a survey instead but I lost my receipt and this location doesn't appear on the firehouse website to leave feedback.   Update: fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I gave this place a second chance after almost a year and I'm even more disappointed than the original visit.  Rude staff. Order is wrong. I ordered an Italian and the bread was cold and not toasted and the sandwich was basically all lettuce after I requested double meat...  There was somehow dried tomato sauce or red sauce hardened onto my sandwich bread and Togo container. You can't make this crap up.   Avoid this location at all costs. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be sick from the half a sandwich I ate before realizing the old crusty red sauce on my bread. Literally nothing could get me to give this business another try."}
{"text":"There are all sorts of sub places. For hot subs, I prefer Firehouse by far. Maybe it is because they steam their sandwiches.  I really love most of their subs."}
{"text":"This place has great sandwiches! The owner Joe is more than friendly and all about customer service. I had a problem with an order and he called me personally to deal with the issue. Today, when I went in everyone was very nice and they completed my order how Joe had noted. It was very smooth. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"New sandwich shop on the block! Firehouse just opened a couple days ago right in the strip mall couple doors down from the Walmart Super Center.  The inside is pretty spacious and deco themed like a firehouse. Cute table tops decorated in Dalmatian print.  Service wise, order and pay first, cashiers taking your order are cheerful. Another server will come by to serve your food. No long wait in line, food came out promptly.  I ordered the Pork Sandwich. It's featured prominently on the menu on the wall.  The Kings Hawaiian bread is what attracted me to it.  Sandwich reminded me of Kalua pork sandwich, with slaw and mayo dressing. Good amount of meat filled my sandwich. Pork was tender, had a smoky flavor to it. Did not taste any spices though. They must rely on the hot sauces for the added kick because there is huge selection of hot sauces for your sandwiches. The combo comes with chips and a drink.  Oh the drink fountain was pretty unique!  Lots of soda flavors to choose from.   My first impression overall it's a cool sandwich place to come by for lunch or a quick bite to eat  when you are shopping here."}
{"text":"Super friendly employees, delicious subs. They were very understanding when we came in at 9:20 and they closed at 10.  They were quick and accommodating and explained their menu and options. Seth was very kind and we will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"This place sold me when i saw the soda machine, how terrible. No really, so its one of those like at five guys too, where it has a touch screen, and i dunno like 12 soda choices, then once you choose one, you can then choose an offbeat flavor,like peach in your sprite or strawberry.  On to the subs-I always order italian with everything on it, and if you get a combo you get a fabulous soda and pick a bag of chips. I freakin love italian subs, and being that this place is in my work complex, well i just can't stay away!!! a bit pricey, but with the stellar sub and awesome soda variety, i just don't care!!!! XD"}
{"text":"As a retired Volunteer Fire Fighter I give the ambiance five stars.  Like the decorations and accessories.  Thought the food was good.  Enjoyed the Chili.  Did not think they were firing on all eight cylinders.  The tables could have used a good washing, condiments organized and salt & pepper on the tables.  Could use a thorough cleaning. A firehouse is usually a fun place to visit.  We have never met a stranger and always make guests welcome.  Could be some lessons there for the restaurant."}
{"text":"For almost $7 the sub was equivalent in size to two Arby's sliders and comprised of unchewable corned beef grizzle. The most underwhelming sandwich experience of my life."}
{"text":"I moved out of the area 6 years ago but when I came back to visit my sister introduced me to this place. Every time after when I came to visit it was a must. I recently moved back to the area and am so happy to be so close to this store. I always have a satisfying visit from the great service and wonderful food. The workers are so welcoming and quick. The selection of sandwiches and chips are always stocked full."}
{"text":"First time eating Firehouse Subs and I thought it was good. Staff was nice and service went quick. Sandwiches looked great and tasted great! Variety of choices but did not notice a chicken sandwich. Will definitely double check next time."}
{"text":"We have friends that live in Mesa.. We are from San Diego and they brought us to this place. We had never heard of it. We fell in love with the food and were sad when we went back home to no Firehouse. Then....one popped up close to us, then another even closer! This location started it all for us. Great food and smiling faces. Always a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Alright, I am giving this place a 5-star based off one sub - The New York Steamer. Holy crap this was good.  I actually didn't even get to eat this sub fresh as some stuff came up before I could stuff my face. Still, one of the best subs I've ever had in my life despite the slightly soggy bread due to me having to nuke it.  So, I actually ordered this delicious little morsel online. They said that they would email me when it was ready, but that it would at least take 30 mins. I never received an email, but instead a phone call. I rushed over there and snagged it.  The one problem I had with this was that I had some difficulty finding the place. The main display/sign and door faces away from the road. I actually passed by it a few times and ended up further down the road. Just know that it is only a few hundred yards from the road."}
{"text":"I just love this place. My girlfriend induced me to place. Staff is always friendly when i go. My daughter loves the firehouse hat they give her. Kids get to eat for 99 cents so thats always a plus. Subs to me taste better then subway."}
{"text":"I felt like I went back in time where life moved slower... a lot slower...  I placed my simple, simple order of an 8\" meatball sub on wheat with cheese, jalapeños and black olives (so good if you want to spice up your reg meatball sub!). At the register the teenage boy read my order back and said \"white\" instead of \"wheat\" so I corrected him.   Luckily my uncanny ability to I pay attention to back ground noises paid off, because I overheard the line cook say \"meatball on white\" - I look to the teenage boy to see if he will correct her since he was standing three feet from her - he did not. He just stood there and said/did nothing. So I pipe up and ask if that was for my sub (just in case it wasn't). Low and behold it was my sub, so I politely mention that I actually ordered wheat.   From this point on it feels as if time had stopped, because I kid you not, it took over 15 minutes to complete my order.   I cannot possibly understand why it took that long to slap on some pre-made meatballs, add my three items, pass it through the toaster and call it a day. But that's how long it took.   I'd understand if there was a mad rush of people, or if I had ordered a really complex sub, but there had been one person in front of me. There were five ppl working, it just didn't make sense.   So I won't be back to this weird little location any time in the near future.   A meatball sub is pretty much a meatball sub no matter where you go. But service this slow just isn't worth the time or money."}
{"text":"I went for the first time a few days ago and tried the sweet Thai Chili pork sandwich. It was great and I don't think I will be able to pick another sub place other than firehouse from now on. The staff was very friendly and brought the food to my table.  I recommend trying firehouse subs if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Can't go wrong with the Hook & Ladder. Love the free kids meals on Sunday & Monday at this location."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of firehouse subs. Order online to get it even faster! Their limeade is delicious and each location has a Coke machine - fun! My favorite is the turkey bacon ranch."}
{"text":"First time at Firehouse Subs! Have heard a lot about this place and was stoked to see they moved one into the shopping center nearby. Got 2 subs and a kids meal to go. Hook and ladder, NY Steamer (tragically named) and a kids meatball meal. We didn't realize until after we left that they didn't give us the full kids meal. Sub and drink only, no treat as pictured. Oh well he didn't need the sugar anyhow so we gave them a pass. The NY Steamer was good, not like the picture at all. Sort of a smashed down version about half the size of the picture but OK. Hook and Ladder was awesome.... until we found the very long black hair stuffed into the middle of the meaty goodness. Our eating froze and everyone began inspecting their food. Bleh. We ended up throwing the other half of the sandwich out. Called the store to tell them that they should think about some hair nets. Lady that answered just said thank you.... silence... No offer to replace, refund or anything. Sad =( Food was good but maybe not the cleanest place. Bummer."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is so clean and the people are so nice. All the menu items look delicious, but I always order the number 8. I love that they donate to the local fire departments."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this franchise. They serve their sandwiches hot unless you ask for them cold. This was new to me and I'm glad I didn't switch it to cold. Very friendly staff. At least three different people greeted me and explained what I need to know. I'm so glad to have them here in surprise, especially after my last got sub place Quiznos left the area!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and every time I go in I have had lousy service, everyone working looks miserable and acts slightly rude.  Subs are ok"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the kids today and they each ordered a kids meal-- sub, drink and some Oreos-- for four bucks. Good deal. The food was good. They transposed the kids' orders (supposed to be a plain ham sub and a turkey/cheese/lettuce sub-- but they gave us plain turkey and ham/cheese/lettuce) and were immediately helpful to fix the mistake, and then gave us a coupon for a complimentary sub in the future for our trouble. Very friendly staff, clean restaurant, good prices, fresh food. Glad to see them open up shop."}
{"text":"Turkey bacon ranch is my go to. My absolute favorite is the salt & vinegar chips with the raspberry chipotle sauce lol. But I like that there are many options for beverages. Always a clean place."}
{"text":"First time trying Firehouse after hearing their radio ad. Ordered through ubereats and lets just say I'm never ordering from Firehouse through ubereats again.  Soup was delivered upside-down and half leaked out.  Added salt, black pepper, and oil to my BLT sub.  Good size sub but could not even finish half of my sandwich.  It was drenched in salt and totally inedible.  Might try again another time but definitely going in and going to a different location."}
{"text":"Wayyyy Better than Subway and the staff was friendly. Was at the Walmart and wanted some different food other than the strip. Would definitely stop by here again and have something else on their menu."}
{"text":"Not that great...better then subway. I was expecting s bigger sandwich for the price. Sandwich cost about $9. I had the sirancha sandwich....not hot at all. From the name, thought it would be spicy....but not at all. I like how you can round up your dollar amount and donate the change to help firefighters."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this establishment.  I have literally been going to this Firehouse off and on for almost 2 years the customer service is usually fantastic however just past experience has made it to where I probably will never eat there again I ordered a beef & cheddar brisket they did not put any barbecue sauce so it was basically meat and melted cheese.  Mind you this is my lunch break I don't have time to go back and take the sandwich with me in order to get another sandwich that is made the right way I spoke with an employee of course I did not get her name which I probably should have but she told me to just come back in if they were put my name up for a free remake of the same sandwich I go in the manager said there would be no remake of my sandwich without the old sandwich which I threw away he did not even try to remedy the situation that is not good customer service to me and also the food was disgusting"}
{"text":"Honestly I do not like hot sandwiches BUT MY GOD the Club on a Sub is SOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Service was fast and friendly! My first time there, went with coworkers, and was very impressed!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazingly good!  But I will say they are a bit pricey. I got the #10 (the sweet baby ray bbq sub) and I fell in love. Service was great, the place was clean. If the prices were lower, I'd be 100% satisfied. But the food quality is definitely mouth watering."}
{"text":"Typically you can't drag me into a sub shop, and I will say the first time at Firehouse, I was like \"meh\", not much sandwich for a pretty steep price $8-$9 (combo). I think it was the hot melted that made it go down so fast it wasn't very filling. Then I had another opportunity to go in and ordered a cold sub, the tuna on white with the fixings. Quite Nice. I coupled it with a wonderful combo drink from their nifty beverage machine mentioned by other reviewers, namely 3/4 minute-maid lemonade with 1/4 Minute-maid strawberry lemonade a squeeze of fresh lime and now I am even happier. Plus bonus, the Cheetos get stashed for a late afternoon snack. Count me amongst the converted."}
{"text":"How can one give a Firehouse sub less than 4 stars? I've never had any problem at this location or any other location.  the only reason I can see Firehouse having issues is if they are just opening. Trying to train a bunch of 16yr olds how to make subs on a line is difficult and things are going to go wrong. This location is new so maybe that was part of their gowing pains!  Can't go wrong with many of these subs, FTW!"}
{"text":"I simply don't understand some of these reviews below. People are knocking the place because they steam their meat instead roasting/braising it? C'mon. So you can't handle something different or what?  So for this review, I'm comparing it to Subway and Quiznos.  First off, Subway and Quiznos build the sub right there in front of you. At Firehouse, this is not so much the case - you order at the register and then the workers prepare it. For this reason, your sub will take slightly longer to make than either of those places and this is mainly because of how they cook the meat.  Now to the complainers saying that the meat is soggy or whatever, I've never had this experience. And, besides that, not all subs are cooked the same at Firehouse. Maybe before discarding the place, try more of the menu? That is just me though! I've tried many of the subs - Firehouse Meatball, New York Steamer, Italian, Club on a Sub, and the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket. My favorites, in order, are Italian, Steamer, and Beef & Cheddar. On a slightly odd note, the Italian makes *great* leftovers if you can't finish it.  Nobody really seems to have mentioned this... but the soda machine is freaking awesome. I don't know how many flavors it has, but it is pretty much the craziest thing you will ever see. It has a touch screen where you scroll through and select your flavor. And when I say select your flavor I mean if you want a Lemonade.... do you want it to be lemonade, raspberry lemonade, lime lemonade, or strawberry lemonade. It is nearly the same for every beverage selection you make.  I definitely prefer Firehouse over Subway or Quiznos. Sure, they may be a little more pricey, but I still like it. I will have to check out Jimmy John's, which everyone seems to rave about to see what all the fuss is about and round out my review for all 4 places."}
{"text":"I find it tough to review sub shops. Specially the larger chain sub shops. They definitely are not as good as your local sub shops. I even find Harris Teeter to have better subs then most of them. Therefore, compared to your other large chains...Penn station, Jersey Mikes, Jimmy Johns, Blimpie, Quiznos, and Subway, I find Firehouse somewhere in the middle. By no means is it bad, but it is also not anything special. They are definitely better then Blimpie and Subway, but below Penn station and Jersey Mikes. Jimmy John's is probably slightly better as well. I think Firehouse has good options and a really cool soda fountain. However, the sandwiches are forgettable. Maybe it is just me."}
{"text":"Establishment is very well kept and clean. The subs are excellent . My husband gets the healthier ones like the hero with no mayo and I love the meatball . The meatballs taste like they were homemade. The reason I am not giving them a 5 star rating is because of the service. They are usually friendly but sometimes I feel rushed to make a decision and they lack enthusiasm . Other than that I would recommend this pace to everyone. Also they donate to the kids and even sell their 5 gallon empty pickle buckets to do so!! I'm always ready to support local deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here and I was surprised this place has good subs. I've always been a fan of subway but this place is up there, too. The subs also taste healthier. It's a nice restaurant with a fire station theme to it which is neat. The pricing isn't too expensive but it is more than subway but it tastes good. The subs here have that fresh taste to them."}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch after getting a massage. Being in a sandwich phase recently, I knew I wanted to like it more than I did. I'd probably almost give it 4 stars.  The staff was friendly and made my sandwich my way. I tried the Hook & Ladder on wheat bread, no mayo.  Price was pretty good, too, 8\" sub for $6. They told me that's their most popular sandwich. Maybe I'll order a different sandwich next time. Generously portioned, I enjoyed it with a dab of their hot sauce. I did appreciate their rack of hot sauces they provided there, numbering each different bottle 1-10 on their level of hot spiciness. Different, don't really find that at sub sandwich places. But the taste of the sandwich still didn't wow me. It was just decent.  I'd go back to Firehouse, but at the moment, having an Italian Capriotti's excites me more."}
{"text":"The subs are fantastic, but it's not clean. The bathrooms are nasty,  the drink station is a mess. There are teenagers working this place, and not an adult in sight. It's also very expensive.  I'd go back, but not until they clean up this place."}
{"text":"I like to eat a lot of subs.  I tried Firehouse for the first time, and was really impressed with the quality and quantity of food.  So now I have two favorite sub places - Firehouse and Sidewinders!  The soda machine at Firehouse is really awesome, too!  The sodas that come out taste the way they should - just the right mix of syrup and carbonated water.  I would give them 5 stars if they served draft beer.  I guess we can't have everything!"}
{"text":"Besides the sandwich being a little soggy (I got the \"hero\" medium to go) it was pretty good. Good service, patient and they are different enough from other sub places for me to consider going again."}
{"text":"Not bad, pretty good tasting subs. The veggies that you can add to the sub taste fresh and they work fast. Not my favorite cheesesteak to be honest, but way far from the worst. Good bread too. Over all, I'll definitely give it another shot. However, next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Samantha is amazing! Highly recommend this location the sandwices are bomb and Samantha's customer service is incredible."}
{"text":"So I read the 2 reviews before coming here and figured it was going to be a slooow lunch. I got here, was greeted right when I walked in and the cashier girl was super friendly and bubbly. I ordered the meatball sub combo and it took less than 5 minutes for them to bring it to me. It was hot, fresh and tasted great! It's close to my job and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best food I've ever eat thanks so much I will come back love the employees and everything about it sauces are bomb bathrooms were clean what's more to say about this place"}
{"text":"yummy! i don't really even like subs, but since my first visit here i constantly crave the firehouse italian. salami, pepperoni, ham, provolone, and  italian dressing on toasty wheat bread. the meat is high quality and flavorful. the spiciness of the salami and pepperoni compliment the perfectly sweet, smoky ham. the bread isn't anything special, but it works as it doesn't overpower the tasty sandwich. i like the fact that they have sweet tea, and it's above average.  i would give this place five stars, but i'm not crazy about the atmosphere. the firefighter theme is fine, but the fluorescent lights make the place feel cold and harsh. the crowded layout forces you to sit close to your neighbor as well as everyone standing in line. luckily they have many tables outside you can escape to on nice days.  i definitely recommend this place if you like hot subs. yeah it's a chain, but the vibe is more mom and pop. i'd be an even bigger fan if they offered homemade potato salad and coleslaw as an alternative to chips."}
{"text":"Wow, first time in and the subs were awesome!! We tried the meatball and the engineer - both were great. Fresh, hot, toasted bread, and quality meat and cheese. A little on the expensive side, but more than worth it- you are served a hefty serving of meat and the cheese is quality and flavorful.  Also really cool they have a rewards program, donate and help local first responders and you can even donate 2$ for one of their empty pickle buckets. Also, the potato chips were really good! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar.  Very good subs and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Everyone is always so friendly here. They bring the good to you. They say goodbye and hello every time. The food is excellent everytime as well."}
{"text":"The italian is better at Capriotti's, they haven't given me excellent customer service either. It doesn't seem to me that they try as hard as they should. Place is clean but that's all. I haven't been in a while, I hear they've changed ownership, so hopefully it's better."}
{"text":"Over the last 24 hours I was really at my wits end with why I was told to stand in line when I placed an online order and after asking where the separate pick up window was for online orders I was told there wasn't one. After some negative feedback I was addressed by the owner who wanted to make it right by asking me questions about what happened, who told me this, etc...    After going back and forth over messaging the owner informed me that he will address what happened to me at the next staff meeting because what happened should never have happened. He also wanted to provide me a free sandwich on my next visit. This was not why I'm revising my review.   When I came into the restaurant the guy at the register asked me what was wrong with my previous order because he knew I was getting comped a sandwich. This act alone made me consider revising my review. Most people do not care why something went wrong so they don't ask. This guy did. He cared. He really did.   As I waited for my sandwich I watched the other employees. There were about 4 others... all hustling and working their tails off. One by one as each called out the name associated with a sandwich they all hustled around the corner and handed each sandwich to the waiting customer on the floor. They were to go orders. The employees could have easily waited for the guest to come to the counter on the way out. They didn't. They went to them. All of them.   I look for the small details when I go somewhere. It's the small details like these that make the biggest impact. It's like an engagement ring... it's very small, fits in your palm, but for the woman who sees that ring is for her, it's as big as the universe itself. No words have to be said in order for tears to start flowing.   To the staff at the Surprise Firehouse Subs location... I'm impressed. I'm not easily impressed. Well done. Keep making a difference."}
{"text":"I am happy. It ALWAYS smells so good in here and Kayla welcomed me. I gotta say. I had one bad experience, I haven't seen that employee again and every experience since has been exceptional.   The food has always been very good considering that in this strip mall alone there are like 6 other places to go including that nasty Sub place that has foot long nastiness..but I digress.   Great sandwich, clean shop, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Still lovin that New York Steamer.   Can't review anything else on the menu since I am stuck on that hot and savory pastrami and brisket sub.  If it ain't broke,  not fixing it.  Happy to be hooked."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cant go wrong with any sandwich. Great Service!!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! We walked in looked at the menu and were unsure of what to order. The cashier came up to us and explained how everything is made. We got the number 1 and the number 9. Both were really good!! Each sub was only about $6.00. I gave this place a 5 because there was no downside. Friendly staff, great food, and great price!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to any firehouse sub. As soon as I got to the register I told the cashier this and she recommended a couple sandwiches. I let her known don't eat any pork products and she suggested a veggie sandwich or anything I could do to my sandwiches. I choose to have the New York pastrami steamer. It was delicious.  Good customer service and a good product. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"When this place first opened up on 67th I was so happy a new sub place. At first this place was amazing the food was so hot and fresh and everyone was joyful. Now this place is quite and the foods okay. I felt like they put more effort back then. Now they just don't care. They don't talk to you or anything. Also the price is ridiculous. Not bad. I recommended Jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the Firehouse Subs off of Bell are in Surprise. Below is the email I sent to the franchise owner, who has yet to respond outlining why I give them a poor review.   I wanted to reach out to you and first say how happy I was that there is now a Firehouse Subs in Surprise. I am originally from Georgia and have spent some time in Jacksonville, FL. So, I am all to familiar with the Firehouse Subs franchise. My girlfriend and myself have been to the new location off of Bell Rd a few times, we were even there for your opening night. Since the opening of the store we have watched things progress and change and have been mindful to give the employees time to learn the ropes and get all of the processes in smith working order. Unfortunately the speed at which 90% of the cashiers can take an order is less than graceful. The majority of the time when we go there always seems to be someone new \"learning the register\" and we along with the growing line of people behind us must now wait as the chaser learns the system on their own. I completely understand that they have to learn. But, the fact that most often than not there isn't a knowledgable person shadowing them as they crawl their way through the system is painful to watch. I have also been in a few times to see all sandwich makers literally standing around talking and watching the line grow all while a second register is unmanned and no one is making a move to help the register. I have been in twice this week, only to walk out before ever getting the change to place an order all because there were literally two people in front of me in line and I could already tell that the wait for those two people to get taken care of was a longer wait than was necessary. Another item that I wanted to bring to your attention was that on the second night, that I walked out without ordering anything, I waited to order only to find out that the store was out of meatballs. Again, I understand it's a new store and things happen. But, to wait in the excessive line to only then be told that there weren't the ingredients needed to make a standard sub was my breaking point. At this point I wish you good luck in your endeavors with the Firehouse on Bell Rd. But, I have no reason to return without some assurance that these issues have been addressed."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the food, in fact I love Firehouse.  I will not be visiting this location again.  Manager (Older balding man with glasses) was extremely rude, while i was on the phone with a customer. (I run a small business)  He seems to think anyone parked in the lot of this retail center either needs to be visiting his business, or have thier car towed."}
{"text":"My wife didn't want to try Firehouse because she had it at work and didn't care for it. I finally talked her into trying it again as I had not and wanted too...we were not disappointed!!! We each had a meatball sub and I had the chili, it was amazing! I ordered online and it was packed when I got there."}
{"text":"Prices are decent.... but personally  like Jimmy Johns better. The last time I went they were VERY limited on everything they put in my sandwich. Was as if I was just eating the bread. But overall it's not too bad. Guess it just depends on who is working when u get there!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today at reques of daughter. Was pleasantly surprised with every aspect of place. Soda machine awesome, choices galore. Turkey sandwich was a bit soggy but the meat and cheddar was perfect. Will try again only different location."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to try this Firehouse Subs location twice and was definitely impressed the first time, and just slightly less impressed during my second visit.  I have fallen in love with their Firehouse Hero, but I make a few little changes.  Both times I have ordered this sandwich online and it was PERFECT.  Tonight I ordered a sandwich in person and the girl taking my order LITERALLY had to ask me to repeat EVERYTHING for my order....and it came out wrong.  It wasn't drastically wrong, so I didn't call to complain after I got home, but I will stick to placing orders online from now on.  Less trouble and they seem to pay more attention.    The inside of the store is clean and they have an awesome Coke fountain machine that lets you customize just about anything you want to drink - a HUGE plus, but I still go to Sonic (across the street!) for my drinks.  The other reason for the missing star?  The artwork depicting a LVFD fireman turning the hose full blast on a coyote chasing a rabbit.  Not sure that they want to be condoning cruelty to animals, especially by a firefighter!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much with a chain sandwich shop, but the food was very good plus they have a cool soda machine.  Service was fine but nothing special.  Food: 5 Service: 4 Total: 4.5 Rounds Down"}
{"text":"Cannot see the reasoning behind a sandwich shop where 2 sandwiches  (average taste, where sometimes bigger is better?) Still... With 2 bags of chips, single serving, not even an endless chip offer.  Where some nicer, tastier just as expensive will offer you endless fries with that.  A soft drink and water with a medium size cup can honestly justify a price tag of just over $25.00 I don't care how big they are.  I was warned tho by the double price sign $$ I menu.  It was a decent since building.  Over decorated and over staffed for 3 or 4 people occupying 2 tables.  That should be a DEAD GIVEAWAY TO STAY AWAY. WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN A BETTER DEAL NEXT DOOR AT McDONALDS.  I Don't like McDonald's either.  It was empty enough to carry on a private conversation tho.  I/could have gotten much better deals at a bustling tiny place called \"SUBWAY\" NOW there is a great place to get a good sub sandwich.  My first choice has been a sandwich shop inside a gas station.  Jimmy Johns is worth it even for the entertaing way one can relieve number1 in a bathroom visit.  Well been here, but not coming back.  If I did I might have STUPID written all over my face.  Duh NO way not again.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"The food is great but the staff still needs a lot of training.. I have been there 3 times in the last 2 weeks. Each time I have waited at least 20 mins from the time I paid till I got my food. Then 2 of the times my order was incorrect causing me to wait while they fixed it. And they got it wrong again. I love Firehouse Subs!! Surprise location you have some work to do."}
{"text":"Managers sitting at table on phone the entire time I waited for my food, I knew she was the manager because she got up to reprimanded one of the staff in front of all the other staff and customers while I was waiting. Not impressed with her poor leadership and mgmt skills. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not loving this particular location. Never could understand how someone could buy an awesome franchise like Firehouse and totally leave it in the hands of kids or students, with no experienced management around during peak time. The dining area was dirty, drink dispenser ran out of ice, and service was extremely slow during the dinner hour. The Hawaiian pork and slaw looked NOTHING like the ad. I won't post a pic of it, just too disappointing. Think I would rather drive way over to Boca Park than stop here again."}
{"text":"This seems to be a problem for the chain of restaurants.  I have previously reviewed a Firehouse Sub in Frederick Maryland.  And I'll repeat that review.   SLOW!  I ordered a sub and FINALLY got it 25 minutes later.  It was only a so-so sub.  Kind of dry, they didn't seem to use any mayo or other condiments.  At almost $8 I thought it was overly priced.  I've had so much better than this place.    Is it better than Subway?  Definitely.  But Jimmy Johns is a FAR better sub, FAR quicker service, and a better price."}
{"text":"There are a lot of sandwich places in Vegas, but this one is really something special.   The food here is absolutely amazing. I've tried the Steak and Cheese, Meatball, and Chicken Bacon Ranch and my goodness were they good in their own right.   But the other nice thing is the atmosphere the place has. You walk in, and it feels like a fireman could actually walk out any second. There's a huge mural and fireman gear littered on the walls -- all of which look pretty cool.   If all of that wasn't enticing enough, they have a really cool 100+ drink maker dispenser. The one that gives you almost every single flavor coke product you could ever want.   AHHH I WANT MORE. X3."}
{"text":"The nastiest service staff I have ever encountered.   I walk in, say hello, no greeting whatsoever.  So I ask why no greeting and they respond, \"maybe we don't like you.\"  Seriously?  Luckily it happened before I ordered, so I did the only obvious thing and turned around and left.  This was at 1:00 on a Sunday afternoon, with children around!  Perhaps this, in part, explains their poor sanitation rating."}
{"text":"I gave them another chance after a long time from a horrible customer service issue. I got the turkey bacon ranch with no bacon- it was pretty good morning I would order it again. We were the only people there and it took a little over 10 mins to get. I know they steam and heat etc but if you're wanting a quick in quick out then save this for a time you have extra time."}
{"text":"Best Sub place I've ever been to! The bread is soft and yummy, the meat warm, the vegetables fresh. I love their BBQ sauce. I always get the Hero- Roast Beef, Ham, and Turkey. YUM-O! Its always busy at lunch time. They ever have Sweet Tea!! Better then Soda any day!!   Everyone is comparing them to Capriottis, but they are two different types of sandwiches! I dont like Capritottis at all. Their sandwiches are too thick that i cant even put it in my mouth. And usually soggy. Firehouse is the perfect amount of meat and vegtable."}
{"text":"I love firehouse subs and this location is great! The service is wonderful and subs always taste fresh. Try the cookies. They taste so soft and chocolatey! The best is the meatball sub with hot peppers. Can't be beat! Best subs around. Can be crowded at lunch but order online or on app to speed process"}
{"text":"Stopped in and talked to the owner while deciding what to order. Very friendly owner and staff. The wife ordered the Engineer and I ordered the brisket sandwich. Both were very good. We will be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse sub I have ever had.  One piece of ham and one piece of turkey .  All bread.  Never again.  Too many great sandwiches around Rivergate ... Harris teeter even.... Come on Firehouse.. You used to be great.  Fire everyone in that store and start over unless the mirror is looking at you ... The owner"}
{"text":"I went to firehouse subs for the sole reason that you get a free sub on your birthday.   There, I said it, I am cheap.  The location on mill and baseline had only been open for a week and the moment I opened the door I was greeted with hellos and joyful shouting.   A little much...but it brought a smile to my face.  I got the hot turkey sub and it was good.  I mean, it's a sub sandwich, I wasn't expecting my socks to be blown off.  But the staff was so nice, they didn't even blink when I asked for my free sub, and they have a huge variety of hot sauces.  Thanks guys,  you know how to show a birthday girl a good time."}
{"text":"If I could I'll rate them a zero. The girl that worked there said they closed early (8:35pm). How can you close before closing time . ?? They pre cleaned early ! The girl was rude and she smiled like it was funny"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've not been in a cleaner restaurant in Henderson. The food is great and the employees are very helpful. From the time we walked in the staff greeted us with beautiful smiles. I would prefer their food and service to any of their competitors."}
{"text":"Other than flavor being decent we would give this zero stars. Between two 12 inch subs the total meat was not even 6 ounces.   Bread was stale.  Each time we go to this firehouse sub it gets worse.  Better off spending money at subway - get more meat and more fixings for less $$."}
{"text":"I came here after work to get my usual large firehouse steak and cheese sub. Normally whenever I come here it is after 5pm but I got off early today and there is a male manager here today. When the cashier put my discount into the computer after I showed her my ID card, he leans over the counter asked me where I work and then tells me that he can't give me the discount. I explained to him that I come here three or four times a week and he has never been a problem. So then he tells the cashier to ring everything up regular price. So I told him no thank you. It is a principle thing for me. Every other time that I have come here and it has never been an issue because I have my valid Department of Public Safety ID card.   The food is great here at Firehouse but if your staff are not going to consistently enforce your policies, it creates a headache for your customers. Especially the regular ones. They have definitely lost a customer in me."}
{"text":"Love fire house came here during ciaa and as always great food and friendly  service   It wasn't packed  the females were on point and smiling"}
{"text":"Over the past couple of months i've seen a huge improvement in the energy of the staff and management. The constant has been their food, it's always phenomenal no matter what time of day or day of the week."}
{"text":"The service was friendly but very slow. The sandwich I ordered, a light hook and ladder, was the tiniest sandwich I have ever received. It was probably 4\" or 5\" at most and they really skimp on the meat/toppings. Terrible value! If thats how to make it light, dont even bother. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for a cheesesteak sandwich.  I got the large- the bread was rubbery, the steak was hard, and the sandwich was small for the price (which I was okay with since it wasn't good).  It was a situation where I felt bad that I wasted my calories on this meal.  If you're in the area, I'd recommend Opa Life Greek (their Philly Steak Gyro is VERY good) or SomeBurros."}
{"text":"Great place for a sandwich.  Consistent food and friendly employees.  I love how they steam the sandwich to warm the meat and cheese.  Coke machine has so many options!"}
{"text":"The bread is awesome and they have baked Lay's potato chips which I haven't seen in a long time.  Plus they have the super powerful salt & vinegar chips which I like when I need a punch of flavor.    So far I've only tried the standard ham and turkey but it was so good I'll be back for more.  Can't wait to try the club or Italian on the next visit. 8 bucks for a combo is higher than Subway but on par with Jimmy John's, and a lot less fuss than Quizno's."}
{"text":"Had the Turkey bacon and it was delicious! Friendliest staff and the greeter was on top of her game. Much better service level then any other Firehouse I've been to."}
{"text":"First time there and it took 18 minutes for my son and I to get sandwhiches...his was white bread with turkey and mayo only. There were also only two people who ordered in front of us. Won't be returning with hungry kids again anytk"}
{"text":"Close to the house very low cost and better then Subway.  The sandwiches are tasty and filling.  They lose a star because their claim their meatball sub is the best in the world is false!!! My sister makes the best meatball subs I have had in the west coast, best ever was some mom and pop shop in Medford New Jersey i went to once and still dream about. Firehouse's meatball sub is still damn good with big ole fat meatballs, but still minus 1 star for not living up to the gigantic poster in the store proclaiming best meatball sub in the world."}
{"text":"Come for the Coca cola freestyle.  Leave with a decent sandwich.  A little pricey for what you get..."}
{"text":"My friend went and picked us up subs for lunch one day after raving about how great these subs were. I decided to get a steak and cheese sub.. but was disappointed :("}
{"text":"Far superior to subway and holy cow is there a lot of meat on the sandwiches.  Haven't eaten a bad one yet.  And they have a rewards program on their app."}
{"text":"The best sub chain. The team at this location is learning quickly and already very busy. The food taste fresh and full of flavor. And the portion sizes are prefect to fill you up but not waste any.  And they has tons of sauses you can add to your sandwhich.   The shop is clean and they do a great job of cleaning tables as people leave. Right now it looks like there doing donation drive and there walls are covered. I am a sicker for a company that gives back."}
{"text":"Wow, just opened and completely slammed, but service and food quality still impressive. Employees here very nice! Great to have one in this area finally. Wish it was a little bigger, but I get it, they had to make due with the size of space they were given. Love the food!"}
{"text":"I love coming here!   I eat the firehouse salad with turkey, no dressing, add oil and vinegar. The people here are friendly and they always greet you, even when they're busy.   This is a great place for our family, for date night, lunch, or whatever.   This location is usually pretty busy.   The wait is worth it... The food is tasty, and fresh."}
{"text":"WOW. My favorite subs in the area, it beats out Primo, and then Wawa and Subway by far. The only problem is that it's very expensive comparatively, the menu obfuscates the prices so you wont know what it all costs until you order. Two large 12\" subs for us was 17.50, you can get 5 or 6 dollar large subs at Wawa and Subway but they're  half the girth that Firehouse subs are. Firehouse subs taste way better than twice as much so it's worth it, but if I went here every day I'd go broke. I get the Turkey Bacon Ranch every time, I'm scared to buy a new sub cause then I would be missing out on getting my TBR again. :(  They also have the Coke Freestyle machine in there, so if you wanna go nuts trying out soda combinations then there you go. But really, a soda and a large sub there is gonna be 10 dollars so be ready."}
{"text":"Not a bad Sandwich spot for a quick lunch. I generally don't eat at sub places but we were on the run and and needed a quick bite. I ate the Firehouse Steak and Cheese, I must say it was really yummy. Warm and melty I added some hot sauce, I was happy. My husband got a large meatball sub, he enjoyed it and it was HUGE!  It's not the most well kept place in the world but it was good and quick. Just what you need on your lunch at work!"}
{"text":"I love firehouse subs and this location is great! I am glad that moving from Huntersville to Matthews I still managed to have a great Firehouse subs right down the street. The service is wonderful and subs always taste fresh. Try the cookies. They taste so soft and chocolatey! The best is the meatball sub with hot peppers. Can't be beat! Best subs around. Can be crowded at lunch but order online or on app to speed process. This location is very clean inside."}
{"text":"Have never had a bad experience. Always a welcoming environment. Service is quick and friendly. Only down side is that it's a bit expensive for a sandwich but nonetheless the best hot sub spot in Vegas in my opinion."}
{"text":"Loved it  The staff is professional and friendly ..  Always welcomes you.  Ordered the meatball and it was really delicious"}
{"text":"Good subs, awful service at this location.  Don't call in to order, every time I have placed on order they put me on hold for 10 minutes and I'm in their parking lot by the time they get back on the line, then tell me it'll be ready in 15 minutes.     It's ridiculous!  Never coming to this location again"}
{"text":"have had a hard time deciding between 3-4. had the large smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket. It was about $8. had good flavor and a nice sauce to it. They have over 50 different hot sauces to pick from and have labeled them with useful \"heat index\" and I tried one which was great. I got my food to go, but I would go back just to write down the name of the sauce. I would again place the order to go, because this place is that its about as easy on the eyes as a spinning bulls eye. Get ready to be slapped in the face with their slogan \"Founded by Fireman\" before you step through the door. My initial impression is that the place relies so heavily on America's love for Firemen (i.g., a slogan with no relation to food) that it completely distracts from the food. I love Fireman, but there is no subtle or clever references to the theme. Instead it's a garish commercial display that robs the restaurant of any authenticity.   That being said, the food was still good. I would go back, but i'm not itching for it. Seems pretty on par with Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Best subs ever. The bread is amazing and this place left me disappointed with the fact that i ever soiled my pallet with subway."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have had the brisket, the beef and cheddar, and the pulled pork. All of them were so good that I thought about them the next day. I wish they had one closer to my house. I also love supporting firefighters and rounding up to donate to their charity. Thank you for serving good food!"}
{"text":"It's not your typical PA style messy sub but man it's the best sub I've had since I've moved to Ohio. The soup was thick and full of broccoli and the subs were stacked tall. My pictures only show half of what was left because half is all I could manage to eat. I highly recommend this place; I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So I'm generally not a sandwich guy, but I took an exception by going to Firehouse Subs.  This location has a long hall with small dining area in the back end.  I ordered the meatball combo; took around 7-10 minutes before order was ready, tad slower than I expected with that many people working.  The drink machine was out of Dr. Pepper ;_;  so I made do with Orange Coke (freestyle machine).  The sub was overall good.  The location was slightly messy, especially at the drink machine area; at one point something was burning inside the restaurant (smell at least).  Overall was an okay experience."}
{"text":"Sandwich is good but the bottles that have the sauces in them really need to be kept clean. Drippings and caked on sauce on bottles is not appetizing!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Customer service is always great and foods always delicious . Usually my to place go when I'm feeling in the mood for sandwiches. Today I went and tried the ruben which was phenomenal. But the reason I'm giving them a low star is because while I was eating the cook yelled out the customers name for his meal. The customer grabs the meal and about 3 minutes later he comes back and says I got the meatball sub not the Italian.  The cook says okay sorry and grabs his correct sandwich.  The part that was extremely disgusting and unprofessional is that he grabs that Italian sub and give it to the correct customer.  Really the other customer put his hands all on it and you guys still gave it to another customer. How dirty and unprofessional.  Makes you think what else they do. Went in today around 12 30 PM"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub chain. Way better than Jimmy Johns. My wife's fave is the Hook and Ladder light and mine is the meatball which is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I would say that Firehouse Subs is not bad... And perhaps my experience wasn't the greatest as I took my sub to go.  This was my first time going. I had a free coupon and it's right next to my office, so decided to give them a try.   The employees were all pretty nice and greeted me/helped me. I saw one helping another girl to her car with a big bag of food. If it weren't for their great customer service I think I'd have rated them lower than 3 stars.  Their sub was soggy at best. Of course, I did take my order to go but since I work within 5 mins of there, it only took me upmost of 10 mins until I had the sub open. They stressed when I was there how their subs don't get soggy - but this was probably one of the soggiest subs I've ever eaten. You can ask for your sub cold, but they will automatically heat it for you if you don't tell them.  Overall, I don't think I will proactively go back. If someone else in my office goes, I may order something as it wasn't bad... but I didn't *love* it."}
{"text":"My co workers and I completely avoid this place now. After several attempts, I have found re-occurring issues. The front staff are very slow and will often ignore you for long periods of time. Every meal I have ordered has taken AT LEAST 15-20 min, which doesn't bode well for mall employees; especially when their orders are often small. At one point I stood there for 20 minutes with no one in front of me and no one took my order. It's a shame because I love Firehouse Subs, but the service and lag at this location is unbearable."}
{"text":"Today I went to my favorite sub place \"fire house subs\". Worst experience ever might I say. So me and my mom got two subs we got home and they both were made incorrect! Made very sloppy missing the pickle missing toppings. I went back and explained everything he gave me a full refund that was the best thing and they remade the food. But when I got home my sub was still missing items. This has never happened before but I will never go back to this location again..."}
{"text":"Where to start with this place. Everything is delicious, the ingredients are top notch and fresh as can be. The prices do reflect that but the quality of food makes it worth while from time to time. The 3 meat Hero sub and brisket are a couple of my favorites but everything is good, you can't make a bad decision. Bottom line is, if you like subs and haven't been here, it's a must. Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"As I am an ASU student in between classes I decided to check out this firehouse subs, I tend to go to jimmy johns that's across the street but today I wanted a hot sub. I knew that firehouse made hot subs so I decided to give it a try.  After walking into this firehouse subs location I was greeted with two employees bickering about work, talking about how the coworkers they work with don't do this and don't do that, as I figured out where the front counter was I decided to walk up and look over the menu, but as I walked up she had asked me immediately \"do you know what you would like to order?\" However the time in which this was said suggested that I was interrupting the conversation she was having with her coworker. I ordered my sub and proceeded to the restroom as the two employees continued their ever lasting conversation and bickering.   I came out of the restroom and took a seat in the middle of the restaurant to wait for my much anticipated hot sub but noticed again that the two employees were still going on about work and were still having their tumultuous conversation. The tv in the restaurant was on ESPN with the Colin Cowherd show so I tried to tune into what was happening but I couldn't as the two employees were talking loud enough that it trumped the TVs sound.   My sandwich was placed in front of me within 2-3 minutes of sitting in which I was excited to bite in, and let me tell you the food that firehouse subs had is amazing, very well balanced ingredients gave my steak and cheese sandwich the kick it needed! The problem was that the two employees did not shut up. They continued to talk the whole time while also complaining that their manager didn't get his bonus and was being an ass to the two employees. They also commented as they only had received a .25 cent raise and seemed very disgruntled about this.   Being that I work in food and beverage that coincides with customer service for over nine years I was a little irritated by the lack of customer service or there of at this firehouse subs location. It looks as if I may only go to jimmy johns here on out even with the amazing food that firehouse subs offers."}
{"text":"Here's the summary/too long didn't read:  Bread: wheat or white and both are very soft  Meat: they have your typical selections and they all taste great. Much higher quality than their competition.    Cheese: many choices that compliment the meats rather well. I suggest a warm sub with melty goodness  Show me what you got: they heat up the meats in a sous vide style process that enhances the meats flavor and makes it more moist.  There's also a wide variety of hot sauces ranging in heat from 1 to \"oh god why did I do that?\"     As a large (fat) man, I have a great appreciation for sandwiches. The same way others seek out fine wines and chocolates, I search for sandwiches.   I remember first finding Firehouse over ten years ago and was floored. I seriously ate here at least once a day for two weeks straight. I'm probably the reason they don't have stamp cards anymore. I had no idea that Firehouse was a chain until other stores opened up later. I'm typically not a fan of chain restaurants as they feel stale, boring, and use subpar ingredients.    The bread is soft, fresh, and flavorful. The meats are flavorful and much higher quality than the cat food served at Subway. The cheeses are creamy and melt perfectly over the meats. Their mayonnaise and mustard compliment the entire package and bring it all together. To top off your amazing sandwich they have 30-40 hot sauces for you to put on your sandwich.   Thank you Firehouse for making great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"These subs are DELICIOUS!!!! If you are hungry, find the closest firehouse sub to satisfy your hunger. If you are not, go get one anyway and save it for later or you wish you would have!!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered two sub platters for a party I'm having tonight. Oddly, I was surprised at how easy it was... normally when I get party packs from restaurants there's always some mix up or problem. Firehouse made it so easy. They had everything ready when I came to pick up and the sandwiches tasted great - as usual. I realized as I drove away that I've never been disappointed by Firehouse subs! It's always consistent, it always tastes great - and the customer service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is most certainly in my list of top 3 chains to go to for a sub sandwich! (The other two are Quiznos and Jersey Mikes! DO NOT GO TO SUCKWAY oops Subway or Jimmy Johns they are horrible!) Anyway, if you see either Firehouse, Quiznos or Jersey Mikes it be well worth the stop! Might be a little bit more then Subway- but your getting a better sandwich!"}
{"text":"We REALLY REALLY REALLY Need a Firehouse Sub in the Tacoma/Puyallup area! Very good subs, and they are on my short list of national Sub chains I like (Firehouse, Quiznos and Jersey Mikes) They beat Subway and Jimmy Johns hands down! Prices might be a little higher then Subway, but they are not skimpy on the meats! I really like the idea of the Coke Freestyle machine there, specially since I dont like Coke, but there is plenty of options in that machine that is good, including a cherry Limeade one there is highly recommended to try if you come here! The service here is very friendly, and prompt! And they are diffidently a place I like going to!"}
{"text":"Map is wrong, it's on the west side of the road. You have to repeat your order 4-5 times and there is only 1 soda machine that served 1 person at a time. Reason that's an issue is because this guy was filling up his 6 cups and took forever. And then when it's your turn you feel rushed because you don't want to be like that guy. Food is great though! Make sure to listen for your name, 2 other customers names were called out wrong."}
{"text":"We got take-out from this place for lunch today, and I was pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a Quiznos-esque experience (which isn't bad, but isn't overly exciting either), but Firehouse exceeded my expectations.   I ordered the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket Sub, which is JUST as good as it sounds:beef brisket topped with melted cheddar cheese and sauces....mmmmm! I devoured the 8\"...at the risk of sounding like a pig, I might get the 12\" next time, just because it was SO tasty I seriously couldn't stop eating it. One of my coworkers who frequents Firehouse a fair amount claims that everything is good...so my only dilemma next time is choosing between the already-proven-to-be-great Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket Sub or something else that (apparently) will be equally as good...so many choices!!!"}
{"text":"I will keep this short and sweet. Firehouse subs has great sandwiches! There is a menu with a variety of choices all themed around the firehouse. Half of their sandwiches are under 500 calories. Paired with some baked chips, you have yourself a healthy meal. I didn't even get to the best part yet... THE HOT SAUCES. Their shelves of hot sauces put the \"fire\" in Firehouse. I try a different one every time. The hot sauces must be regional because I had Firehouse up in Washington this summer as well, and they had a completely different array of choices. Mmmmm. (Can you tell I love spicy???) I'm crossing my fingers that we get a location close to home!"}
{"text":"I have the pleasure of letting all know that this location of Firehouse Subs is marvelous!!  I ordered the New York Steamer and it was delicious. The help was attentive and polite plus the place was very clean.    Stop by and enjoy anything on their menu when your in Surprise.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The meatball sub is the only thing worth ordering.  Everything else is rather blah.  If I'm paying more than subway prices, I expect something tastier than subway."}
{"text":"Subs aren't bad. Nice different choices. Love the coke machine with 120+ flavors and the chips variety. The seating sucks barley fits two people and the tables are barley apart from eachother so every seating is made awkward because you're sitting close to a person eating his sub. The tv makes the place a little bit more better and the workers are nice and friendly. Overall this place is good."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and amazing customer service! The manager Eric, and Elizabeth who took my order, took great care of me. They were so friendly and attentive. I will definitely be coming back here! There's many sandwich places closer to my house but with food this good and workers that are this friendly it was worth the extra couple minute drive. :)"}
{"text":"Staff and overall cleanliness is great. The subs themselves are pretty good too. The only downfall is the price. It's very expensive for what you get. I want to return, but will be a while till I dish out that much money for a sub"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Their smokehouse brisket is so tender and yummy. If you havent tried this place, GO GO GO! :)"}
{"text":"Good quality sandwiches. Tastes better than subway or other sandwich shops. Friendly and fast service.  I have not found a better sub sandwich in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location tonight and it was superb. The young girl working the cash register was very pleasant. I ordered the Club on a Sub and it was delicious. Yes, it is a little pricey but, I feel the quality of food and service is worth it. I will return."}
{"text":"Good quality food, but waiting 20 minutes for a small sub when there's only one other person ordering in front of me is insane. The team seemed way more focused on completing online orders than in getting me out the door."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Staff is great, restaurant is always kept clean, and the subs are definitely a cut above their competition....a few dollars more but worth it.  Having the new Coke beverage machine is an added benefit, have come here a few times just for that.  After 10 or so trips here haven't had a complaint yet."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.   Finally.  A sub shop that is a different in the way they cook their meats. Not just your average ham and cheese place, lots of steamed, hot, specialty meats and toppings. Specially like the 'Hero' (3 meat combo) and 'Engineer'  (Turkey). Your combo pricing is a bit higher here, but it seems like you get more food though. Oh, and their salads are pretty generous, they have A LOT of meat on them as well! (Your choice of meat , I believe). Nice and friendly staff, very clean place every time we go.  I just feel bad for the workers that are required to say, \"Welcome to firehouse\" every single time ANYONE walks in.. it can get old after a while."}
{"text":"I'm very familiar with dining at Firehouse Subs. However, I decided to try a new, closer location to my home. After ordering, we waited patiently on the patio for them to deliver out food. All was well! The staff was courteous and friendly and the food, enjoyable. My point of dissatisfaction came when we realized the owner of this franchise, Scott, came outside and began to tidy up the patio. There was another couple dining, two tables away. We were pretty much finished eating when my husband and I heard him walk to the couple, ask them if they enjoyed their food, if they needed or wanted anything else, and proceeds to ask to clear their table. I was surprised by this offering, because he never said a word to us. He then thanked them for coming, walked away, looked directly at us with a smirk, and walked inside. Why was this upsetting? You clearly see two table dining and you approach one and not the other. I've never seen management do that. I was slightly offended and began to offer to him directly, upon leaving, my feeling on that. I decided to do otherwise. I have contacted corporate and decided to advise fellow yelpers. I am a flight attendant in the very core of customer service, and I have never snubbed any guest on the aircraft in such a way. Maybe I could just sum it up to he didn't see us on his way to the door leading inside. Or maybe, he just didn't care to see us at all. I abhor intentional horrible customer service and frankly, I will take my firehouse subs patronizing elsewhere. Great going, Scott."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this 5 stars, but 4 stars fits.   Compared to other popular sub chains in the area (daves, JJs, subway), the meats here at firehouse are of a much much better quality.   The choice of bread compliments it perfectly, and the veggies appeared fresh.   Now to the bad, but this is strictly personal preference. The condiments I received on my sandwich were mayo, mustard, and Italian dressing. Overall it was very sweet, almost off putting. I don't think it was the ham, maybe the Italian dressing. Regardless, definitely too sweet for my taste.   Overall I'll be back, this time to try something else"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service the guys there are really nice go there time to time when doing laundry next door having dinner there with my 10yr old"}
{"text":"Been here three times each time food was fresh, made exactly to my order and not sloppy. They listen to what you want and they're friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"My favorite sammmmmmich joint!!!!   New york steamer 5/5 Italian 5/5 Grilled cheese 4/4  I love the freshness of these sammiches! Definitely my go to if im feeling like a nice toasty party in my tummy kind of sammich.  Fairly priced. Friendly and fast service. Before they moved to vegas i used to eat it all the time when i was on business trips to florida... so glad it found its way to the west side.  Yummmm yummmmy"}
{"text":"I got a turkey bacon ranch sub.  I was surprised that the sub was hot.  It was a nice surprise.  However the ice tea I got was far too sweet. I got the unsweetened tea however it had sugar.  If you like sweet tea it would be fine however it was unexpected."}
{"text":"Loved Firehouse Subs!  Super cute décor, but at lunchtime, the place is packed.  You're kinda sandwiched it... get it?  \"sandwiched?\".... ok.  Anyway...  The staff was super busy, but were quite efficient and got the food out pretty fast.   I had the turkey cranberry sub and I was pleasantly surprised how moist the turkey was!   It was a really great sandwich.   My friend had the Italian sub and he is such a fan now, he goes several times a week.   The parking out front is a bit tight, but there is a big parking lot to the west, so it's not bad.   I would say it's worth stopping in if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Food is great, staff is super friendly and the restaurant is clean!  Definitely a place to stop again. Especially because I'm tired of the same old burger joints!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are really delicious but the time it takes for them to make a sub is extraordinarily long."}
{"text":"Excellent service from friendly staff who always have a smile on their face. Been in store and ordered through skip the dishes many times and I have never had an issue. The taste and portion is superior to any Subway or Mr.sub ever! And you get a yummy pickle. Their brownies are to die for and always soft. They also have one of the coke fountain machines that offer tons of different juices and pops. 10/10."}
{"text":"Favourite sub spot at the moment! Ingredients and bread are all fresh and you can tell care is taken in making your sandwich!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large Hook & Ladder to go - when we opened it at home there was barely any meat - mostly bread & lettuce.  There was no turkey and maybe a very thin layer of ham that covered only 50% of the large bun.  Needless to say, very disappointed.  It's like they stretched the meat from a small sub onto a large."}
{"text":"I've had Firehouse before from our patients delivery, never did a sit in. We arrived at this particular location. The young ladies seem more interested in chit-chatting instead of a greating. I believe the owner or manager was on shift when we went in. Our sandwiches were ok, bread did taste a little stale and hard. Cant really enjoy your food when you have a staff member sweeping literally by you lol. . . hmmmm  Other then that this place is just ok. . . ."}
{"text":"Way better than Subway or Blimpe. Best meatball sub I've ever had. Affordable too"}
{"text":"Best sub in town. Can't even fathom going to Subway after it. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Italian sub with no onion was all I asked for and I get  a sub with nothing but meat no veggies"}
{"text":"Good food, nice people. I come here every other week, and haven't found a reason not to return. They have an array of sandwiches so I never get tired of the same thing twice!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great service and food. We go once a week. Definitely recommend the Hook and Ladder and cookies."}
{"text":"Just like someone else wrote, the order was completely wrong. I'm on the phone currently with Ubereats, and Firehouse, spent 30.00 plus delivery, and we are missing chili, pickles, the brisket is now cold,the sandwich was sloppy made, and the young manager offered to give us a \"chili\"...ummm really?! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Worst sub, and experience ever. Bottom line, sandwich ($11 hero sub) was horrible! First, the bread was disgusting as it was soggy. The ingridients were very simple, no tasty sauce or special zest or special veggies, also lettuce was old and yellow. Meat looked old. No cheese. I couldn't even eat half and ended up throwing up! I heard one of the girls say \"I feel sorry for ever gets that bread\". If you want a great sub 9 out of 10 times, stick to Capriotti's, subway, and port of subs."}
{"text":"My first time at Firehouse Subs.  Ordered small meatball combo.  $8.36.  Three meatballs and some cheese on  toasted bread.  Good but nothing special.  Two customers in the place.  No one was friendly. No one greeted me as I came in, thanked me when I left, or said one word to me while I ate. Place was clean but no one seemed to notice my existence as a customer."}
{"text":"Amazing. First, let me say this place only had several customers in it when I put in my order. After twenty minutes of trying to wait patiently I went up to the counter to inquire about my food. I was told \"it is going to be two more minutes\".  So I waited another ten before I went to the counter again. No sandwich. I requested a refund. While the woman was counting out my change she said, \"if you want that sandwich it can be ready in just a minute\".  This really ticked me off, it was supposed to be ready in a minute twenty nine minutes ago. So now I am late and still hungry. I go into another food shop only to find out that the woman that gave me my change gyped me by $.85.  Needless to say, I will never go there again. To be honest I am not sure I went in the first place, their food is way crazy overpriced.  You have been warned.  Oh, I should add that the woman that initially took my order was nice. She deserves a better place to earn her money."}
{"text":"The employees here are so awesome I along with another couple came in two minutes prior to closing now we all know about people coming in right before the food place closes or the retail store closes if you were the employee you'd  be like what the heck!!! but these employees welcomed us and greeted us, they took care of us in the most professional way even though it was almost their time to go home you do not see that at a lot of places the crew who worked closing today 7/27/2016 are AWESOME!!! Recognize them   -PJ"}
{"text":"unless this place is closed, we will never go to another sandwich place again!!  I had the kids meal cuz my kid eats a grown up meal and it was amazing and just the right size!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I checked out Firehouse Subs last night. I had read the reviews before we went and wasn't sure what to expect. But I have to say was very pleased with our visit. I had the Steamer sandwich and it was DELICIOUS!!!  The pastrami was very moist and the bread was very fresh. We will be returning for sure. The staff was very friendly and explained how the sandwiches are made."}
{"text":"Well unfortunately, I have been duped yet again....  yet again another BAD experience at this location when ordering more than (1) sandwich.  I just don't get it, if you're founded by firemen, I would think you would leave no ingredient behind or better yet, how about not leaving a sandwich behind.  But as always, when I call in and order something from this location something is always missing.  I can (somewhat) deal with an occasional missing ingredient request, but yesterday finally broke the camel's back when I had to return to the location to retrieve my sandwich that was M.I.A.  Now I know what you're saying, \"well dumbass you should have checked your order\" and I agree with you, I should have, however sometimes you may forget to check your order and think afterwards that, \"hey, it's OK, I am paying for a service that should be complete\" well unfortunately not at this location.  When I called about this missing sandwich, a very flamboyant person picked up the phone and says \"OOooo JEeesstthhuuss, she forgot to give you the other bag, why don't you come back in and we'll make it right\".  Well I go back to collect what is mine, and they had it ready right away for pickup, but what cracks me up even more is their attempt to make it right.  They had stapled 2 coupons on the bag and as I sit in my car, CHECKING my order and reading the coupons, I read that 1 is for a free sandwich combo and the other for a free cookie.... COOL!  or wait not COOL! They are EXPIRED!!  SERIOUSLY I was going to go back in and bring this to their attention, however, I finally just laughed it off and thought to myself...... you can't fix stupid.  One plus of me not returning to this location is that I won't have to hear (in a VERY flamboyant tone) \"Welcome to the firehouse!!  HHHEEEEYYYYY!!\"  Good riddance!"}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment ZERO stars I would do it. I will never come back again. I have been coming here for years and have NEVER been so upset and felt so disrespected. For starters, Daniel took our order. He was so rude to me, my daughter and husband. I should have just walked out then.... but I didn't. I ordered a  brisket sandwich that was mostly bread and bbq sauce, very little meat and mostly fat. I took pictures so you could see it. Ultimately, Daniel continued his nastiness and began to throw things making loud noises making my family and the one next to us very uncomfortable. I guess he wanted us to leave and it was only 8:30pm. No excuse for disgusting unprofessionalism. Wish I could undo my visit here and to have gone somewhere else they appreciate you spending hard earned money there and treat you like a respectable human being and feed you something even they might want to eat."}
{"text":"This location is a relatively new one. The food is standard Firehouse and is executed well.  The owner is really friendly and professional and it shows in his choice of staff also. The night we went in there were 4 staff members, all very friendly,  prompt and professional. When we entered the boy had to check to make sure they weren't closing down as they were all cleaning and it could have been end of the night, they all very happily assured us we would not be keeping them open at all and we had a great meal. The location is very well kept and the staff aren't slacking in any way. Definitely adding to the list of regular eats."}
{"text":"Manager working could care less about the customer. Ordered and paid for a combo, was not given a receipt or even asked for a receipt. Walked away and realized manager had not given me a cup with the combo i ordered. I go back and wait in line and explain that i just ordered and had a combo but was not given a drink. Instead of apologizing, or just outright offering a drink, manager put off an accusatory tone and stated that she could not help me unless i had a receipt. Needless to say i will not be back at this location. Its a shame how much one poorly trained manager can effect a resturaunt."}
{"text":"So I love sub sandwiches and ever since I found out that OTHER place had fake ingrdients well I stopped eating them . This past week I met up with a friend and I was super excited to try Firehouse subs. I would see the signs whenever I was out in Whitby but Sunday was the day I finally go to try their location in Vaughan.  Atomosphere : Esthetically the store was nice and clean; loved the layout and the designs.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and didn't rush me as I decided.  I got a medium hook and ladder sub with jalapenos. The variety of hot sauces had me undecided for 2 minutes.  Sandwich :  So good , nicely toasted  with fresh toppings . I chose the sparkling limeaid and added 2 lime wesges. Always get the limeaid !!!  I can't wait to go back with the mister to try a different sandwich."}
{"text":"Today was my first time back at firehouse in quite some time. Here's a couple things I liked: -the staff. They were wonderful and so nice! The gentleman did a quick run through of the menu and what's available, and the kind lady suggested some favorites and also mentioned the soups and salads they offer. A very helpful staff. -my food was hot! But not too hot to eat right away. When it's your lunch break, you have a limited amount of time to eat and enjoy. This is a huge plus to me, especially for ordering my meatball sub (which was delicious) -they open at 10am! I work at 5:30in the morning, so my lunch is on the early side. Finding a place to sit down and eat this early that's not serving regular breakfast food is nice. What I didn't like: -the price. It seems a bit pricey for their small sub, drink and cookie (which was incredibly soft) I could see $6, but $8 I think is pushing it.  Obviously it didn't bother me enough though, if I stayed and ate...and to be honest, I will be back for that sub.  Anyways, I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This is one of a handful of restaurants in our line up we frequent on a regular basis. We've tried several sandwiches, all good, but the Beef Brisket with BBQ sauce, mayo and cheese is our favorite.  I call ahead and pick them up. Service is excellent.  I've mentioned in other reviews that it is hard to find a decent restaurant here in Vegas, fine dining or fast food. Moving from California where everything is awesome with lots of choices, and plenty of good food, that hasn't happened here yet. Most places in Las Vegas reheat food and send it out on the next order. Firehouse Subs prepares food fresh to order.  Restaurant is clean. Another thing to note is the choice of sauces on display to buy and take home. We'll keep coming back.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Man o man the pastrami sub was to die for!!     Delish  Looking forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"The staff here is unusually friendly and hospitable.  They seem just as excited about my sandwich selection as I am.  I love the fact that they have the Coca Cola Freestyle machine.  We've enjoyed everything that we've tried here, and the bread is perfection.  This is a favorite stop for us when we are too far from Bronze Cafe."}
{"text":"Firehouse subs has a cute decorative theme and decent sandwiches but the sandwiches are a light on the meat. They have a really nice soda machine and the prices are  fairly reasonable. Friendly staff. Because of the portion of meat they give you in the sandwiches I would not give this place a thumbs up but I wouldn't give it a thumbs down either. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this location! I work in the same complex, so I'I here about 5 times a week. On top of the subs being tasty, the staff is super friendly and welcoming. They even greet me by name and have my order memorized! 5 stars all around"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, great customer service, I had the brisket, delicious, my only suggestion would be  crusty bread , the bread was a little soggy but I would definitely will  go there again"}
{"text":"We were excited to see this new location when it first opened and decided to check them out. I'm a sucker for HOT SAUCES and they definitely have a large selection.  Inside is a little crazy and the seating area is a bit tight. Just order at the counter and wait for your sandwich to arrive. TICK TOCK!  Not sure how long it should take to make a sandwich. Actually I do know and twenty minutes seems longer than normal. How hard can it be?  Ordered the New York Steamer with some Elvis Burning Love hot sauce on my first visit and then a Large Italian with a side of Mango Habanero sauce on my second.  The sandwiches were good and pretty expensive. Even my wife thought it was a bit pricy and she is the queen of sandwiches.  Service was mediocre and it took longer than we expected. Maybe it was just this location or I'm just not that crazy about their sandwiches. The best part was the selection of Hot Sauces for me.  Give them a try and see what you think. I can make several sandwiches at home for the same price and everyone should know that Hot Sauce is my middle name. A-OK ALREADY!  2.75 STARS"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good sandwich shop, especially in Phoenix. Based on a friend's recommendation I decided to check out Firehouse Subs. Upon entering I let my cashier, Cyara, know it was my first time there. She was extremely helpful and let me know about all of their menu options. I decided on the Italian sub, sans onions. I also asked what Cyara's favorite sub was and she recommended the brisket. I picked up one for dinner. Having eaten both, these were awesome sandwiches! I'm not a fan of cold sandwiches, so I was very pleased that everything here was toasted to 250 degrees, putting the name fire in firehouse. Founded by firefighters, all first responders get a discount, so that is a nice touch as well. My only gripe with my visit was the cleanliness of the restaurant. There was trash left out and the drink station was in disarray. However, this did not have an impact on how delicious my food was. Defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"These subs are the best around. Definitely try the meatball!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best staff. Best subs. Speedy service. 5 stars every visit. We eat here once a week. Something for everyone"}
{"text":"Never tried any firehouse.  Husband went in for takeout.  I got tuna on wheat he got the engineer.  His was toasted and better than mine but the bread was too much and tasteless.  Mine was the worst tuna sandwich ever.  The hunks of tasteless wheat bread were not edible.  Who wants to eat 80% bread?  Not even good bread.  And tasteless provolone on tuna?  Subway is by far much better with any bread and I don't think subway is particularly that good.  Jimmy johns has a much better sandwich than both and their bread is really good.  We will never be back to any firehouse.  Also it takes them a lifetime to make a couple sandwiches.  My husband said I don't think they started working till I started pacing almost ten minutes in.  Unfortunately he had gone in while I was still reading the crappy reviews that said they didn't get the rave review.  I agree with those people."}
{"text":"Capriottis is like one thousand percent better.  It's not that this place is bad, it's just Cap's is waaaaaay better.  I kinda think people just like the fireman gimmick. People love firemen...they can sell anything and people will buy it!   I had the Italian and it had no kick. It was lacking flavor.  My husband had the cheese steak and he really liked it, but he likes anything. It's a cool place with great decor but it's not a sandwich mecca.   This is far for us to go for a sandwich and since it didn't knock our socks off, we probably will not be returning.   Like I said Cap's is better."}
{"text":"For a sub shop Fire house ranks supreme. The best part about Firehouse are the choices of hot sauces."}
{"text":"3 buddies and I stopped here after playing golf at Play-A-Round which is in the same shopping center. We had no clue what to expect.  The greeting of \"Welcome to Firehouse!\" was fun but only just the beginning. The service was fast and the place was very clean.  The sandwiches that we got, were hands-down, THE BEST sandwiches that we have ever eaten. I really was pretty speechless about how good it was and so were my friends. I got the #10.  I rarely ever need to go out to Malvern for anything, but now I'm dreaming up reasons to make the trip and stop for lunch.   I highly recommend this place. BTW - the drink sizes are out of control. Most people would be ok with a small - Trust me."}
{"text":"Always come here when I'm in Vegas. The staff is always friendly and the subs are so good. I definitely recommend this place to everyone. I wish we had more of these places in Long beach."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of delicious hot and cold sandwiches. Also there is a excellent collection of hot sauces to help spice up any sandwich. I enjoy the quick friendly service and the devotion the employees have to making your sandwich exactly as you desire. Also this location has the new Coca Cola machine that has 120 different combinations. I am not a huge Coke fan but when I tried this same soda machine at the World of Coke in Atlanta, I really enjoyed the multiple combinations"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sub shops in the Las Vegas area. There is only one location and every time I go there I forget what I ordered last time. So it is like I go there for the first time every time. All the subs are large and they all look delicious. Don't forget to try out some of their variety of hot sauces. You can't have a firehouse without a fire!!!"}
{"text":"I'm wondering if perhaps the negative reviews come from the hiccups that new restaurants typically experience when they open.  Wait time from minimal and the sandwiches were great!"}
{"text":"I love Firehouse Subs, and I was so excited to learn that a location was opening near my home. This location is NOT your typical Firehouse Subs. The wait time is unacceptable, the staff have no sense of urgency, and they cannot seem to get an order right. This location needs to take the lead of its sister locations and have a manager on the floor full time. In addition, if you get someone's order wrong and they are forced to drive back to the restaurant, the least you can do is offer a complimentary cookie or bag of chips, maybe an apology for the error?"}
{"text":"Struck with a sandwich craving and wanting to try a new place, I wandered on over to this sandwich shop that had been catching my eye for awhile now. And sadly, I really wish I hadn't.  There are two things that were good about this place: 1) The Rat Pack firefighter mural on the wall. 2) The selection of hot sauces with convenient little to-go cups.  I'm still not quite sure what to make of the service. Everyone was sorta zoned out and just going through the motions. No friendliness, no excellence, and quite the air of \"you are annoying me, please go away\".  But really warrants the 1 star is the food. I had the chili, steak and cheese sandwich, and smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  The chili looked good, even though it came topped with strips of cheddar cheese and rings of onions (not shredded cheese and diced onions), but it was runny and bland. It was almost inedible.  The steak and cheese sandwich was absolutely inedible. This is essentially their version of a Philly cheesesteak. The menu describes it as sautéed sirloin steak, melted provolone, sautéed onions and bell peppers, mayo, and mustard. The only flavor that I could taste was mayo. Overwhelming mayo. And it wasn't good mayo. There was no mustard and very few onions and bell peppers. Barely any cheese. And the meat was completely flavorless. All served on some horrible bread.  The smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket was an improvement, but only achieved barely edible status (once dipped in hot sauce). The meat was tender, but flavorless. The cheese didn't add much to the overall sandwich. And it was rather soggy.   This pretty much wins as my worst eating experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"What an overpriced sandwich for an Italian sub.   But you get what you pay for. Not sure if $14 is going to be a model cost structure for an Italian sandwich but what the hell if you can get it collect it.  I found the cold Italian sandwich outstanding. Would I pay $14 again for this No, let me to say hell no.  For the overall value not even worth it. For the overall taste experience why not? Try it once. Skip the mortgage payment, it's a good sandwich.   Make sure you add the red pepper stuff to add on it's delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich shop! It is clean, community-minded and fun. The staff is friendly and efficient. Their menu is diverse and the food quality is stellar.  I also learned they are partnering with various delivery services - so give them a call if you need a delivery."}
{"text":"I had never been to firehouse before, but I went on my birthday because hello, free food. And they didn't even make me sign up for anything. They just gave me a sandwich and it was delicious. I regret not coming in sooner, because whether the sandwich is free or not, it's a pretty darn good sandwich. And on top of that everyone is very nice. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This location has beyond the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The manager Jeff was extremely uncourteous when we brought our service dog in. The first thing he said was dogs are not welcome here pointed and then paused while serving a client and said unless it's service. There was no greeting. The greeting was us being rudely attacked when my dog was wearing a vest. I respect the rules of service dogs in Arizona but personally felt discriminated because I look extremely young and unknowledgeable where I can and cannot bring my service dog. It was extremely disruptive to the client he was also servicing as he stopped to yell across the room that we could not bring him in without having any clue that he was service. I have dined at many locations and I've never had an assumption or been yelled at for bringing my dog who has a harness saying service dog on it. It was extremely disrespectful. When I put my dog in the car with my acquaintance I went back into approach Jeff and ask him if he understood the rules of arizonas service dogs he said he did and that I shouldn't bring him in there. He was extremely sarcastic and narcissistic and because of that I will never return to that location even though it is 10 extra minutes from my house. Kyrene and chandler should either a get a new manager who doesn't discriminate against service animals and is actually enthusiastic about his job... or research the laws in Arizona about service animals. I will continue to complain until Jeff does not have his job as he was extremely disrespectful to the customers in the dining area and an embarrassment to someone who has a service dog to cope with pain."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great Steak, good meatball. Very clean fresh ingredients. Very friendly staff. Love the soda machine. One of our new favorites."}
{"text":"I've only been twice, everyone is very friendly but I was disappointed with the lunch hour  When you only have an hour lunch you should be able to be in and out. My order was screwed up and was disappointed I had to run my card twice. Other than that their subs are delicious"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, I was kinda excited to come eat.   My husband had an Italian sub. Which was good. Tho, he was confused why they toast it after they put the veggies on, everything got soggy. My kids had the firehouse sub with no cheese. Which they put cheese on anyway. My 6 year old would eat at all, she said the food was gross. I had a salad, dressing on the side, as they brought it out they said, you wanted your dressing in the side but they put it on anyway. I said I just didn't want my salad swimming in dressing, she replied oh they don't put it on heavy. As you can see from the pic, it was swimming.    Overall, this place is mediocre. Jimmy johns is way better and for the price you're better off going to Cracker Barrel across the street."}
{"text":"This Sub is on Fire!  Best fast casual sub shop of all chains.  Pastrami is awesome, smoked beef brisket is yummy. All add-Ons are free. Giant chip selection. Plus Freestyle machine.  Sweet tea is great.  6 combo options!Free firehat 4 kids.  They just do things better than the rest!!"}
{"text":"Free sub on Tax Day!  I Love the IRS... Irresistible Robust Subs!!    I got a huge refund and a huge Pastrami Rueben today.  Could be the very tastiest Firehouse sub I've had.. oozing w/ juices, Swiss & coleslaw drippings!   I itemized my deductions but they didn't deduct 1 item from my sub - got all the toppings.   So don't forget to claim your Charitable Donations on ur 1040 and claim Firehouse's charitable portions!  Not to mention they do a lot of donating themselves."}
{"text":"I really like the meatball sub. They are delicious and there are a ton of colon cleansing hot sauces with varying degree of \"da'burns\" to choose from.  The only criticism I have for firehouse is that if you eat the meatball sub in the reataurant it is 1000 degrees and they never put enough sauce with with the meatballs."}
{"text":"Super excited to go there. Did a u turn to go back. One inside it was not the same atmosphereas as the other locations I have been too. Manager was rude when I asked a question. (No) was the answer and went about his business. When I said I would share my thoughts on the survey he said go ahead I don't care. Wow. Food was not very warm but did not want to deal with the person that didn't care."}
{"text":"To start this out with, let me make it clear I have experience with Firehouse Subs. I'm from the East Coast, where they originate. I had one one block away from my campus housing while I was in college, and another resided in the same building as a friend of mine's condo during that same time.   With that out of the order, Firehouse is good. Very good. A large combo is a little pricier than a deal at Subway (a large combo is ~$10), but it's definitely worth it. The medium combo is ~$7.50, but the large is, I feel, well worth it, as the sandwich is so much bigger.  For starters, your sub is steamed. STEAMED! The way God meant meat and cheese to be prepared on a sandwich.   This comes at a price, however. Don't expect the 'have it your way' mentality of Subway; you have a choice of ~10 subs, each of which comes with a selection of meats and cheeses. Some of these can be served fully involved (mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato), others can not (I'm looking at -you-, Steamer. You'd be perfect if you'd just loosen up a bit and take some extra condiments like a good girl). Well, you might be able to explicitly ask if they can be served that way, but it's going to be up to the server; the ones that are to be served fully involved (if you want them that way) say \"Served Fully Involved\" on the menu.  But my God, even with these limits is it worth it. These sandwiches are large, filled with meat and cheese, tasty as hell, and Firehouse provides a huge assortment of hot sauces to include on it. USE THEM! Find one you like; it really does make the sandwich taste better. I nearly cried when I found out a friend had been eating at Firehouse but had never known the hot sauces were there to be tried and experimented with by the customers, and so had never had the joy of a hot sauced sub.  Now, the reason this isn't 5 star...because of what has been done to the Firehouse Subs brand hot sauce. Yes, they have their own. Back in GA, it was -amazing-, best hot sauce there. Mild enough you could slather it on like ketchup, spicy enough to give it some heat, and tangy enough to give it flavor. I'm not sure why the one here was different (different mixing location? Different (bad) batch from those I've had in the past? I don't know), but it was a little bit spicier than it should have been (making it so my usual habit of slathering it on made the sandwich a little more spicy than I like. Still good, still edible, but not perfect), and less tangy.   Still, though, try Firehouse the next time you want a sub. It's so much better than those other, lesser, sub shops."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and wonderful customer service! Tried the beef and cheddar brisket and it was delicious. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Not please with the amount of mayo they put in my sub. I got a medium size and I literally scraped out 2/3 cup or more of mayo and ranch. It was so great and my bun fell apart .  Is this how the south is..everything covered in slime we call mayo?"}
{"text":"Near my crib, so i came and had dinner here. It was good. I had the steak and cheese sub with all the xtra toppings. Hands down I will be back.  Staff was friendly and cheerful."}
{"text":"The Good: + Their subs are tasty, and although their whole \"steaming the meats and cheese\" thing seems a bit gimmicky, it works for them. It definitely makes the bread better by softening it a little when the meat is in there.  + They don't skimp on the meat in the sub, unlike some other sub chains.  + They have about 20+ different hot sauces, rated on a scale of 1 - 10 on heat. I'm a fan of the Scorned Woman Chipotle & Garlic Pepper Sauce (Heat 7) and Dave's Hurtin' Habanero Sauce (Heat 8). Both have flavor and a little bit of kick.  + They have a dial-a-drink soda dispenser, so feel free to make your own custom beverage from what's there. My favorite is a mix of Cherry Coke Zero and Lime Coke Zero.  + The pickle spear is a nice touch. Not enough sub places give you pickles with the sandwich.  The Bad: - Wait times. Average wait times to get my order (1 sandwich) has been 10 - 15 minutes. At the lunch rush, that can go to 20 - 25 minutes. At best, it's taken about 5 minutes to get an order. While decent for a sit-down place, their average is a bit slow for a fast food place.  - The meat steaming diminishes the flavor profile a little bit, like some of the flavor leaches out or blends together with the cheese and bread. I'd say it raises the flavor to above-average, but prevents it from going higher than that, if that makes sense.  My Firehouse Sub Picks: + NY Steamer: pastrami, corned beef, provolone. + Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket: beef, cheddar, BBQ sauce.  Verdict: Decent subs - better than some, but not fantastic. It gets points for the sauce selection and dial-a-drink machine. Jersey Mike's makes a better cheesesteak, Jimmy Johns is much faster, and Capriotti's has bigger flavor. I'd take Firehouse over Subway any day of the week, though, and when I'm in the mood for their NY Steamer or Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar."}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it ! Christina was so sweet and her smile never left her face ! Great service !! Definitely coming back here !!"}
{"text":"went there because we saw the commercial for the  pickle bucket donation where you get a pickle bucket for 2.00 dollars , will the #7 store at 2208 S. Nellis blvd. had no pickle buckets to sell and wouldnt sell us the smaller ones on display for less than five dollars. disappointed and felt  like it was a false advertisement situation. we werent informed on the commercial that it was if they had ant pickle containers empty of pickles to sell. my sandwich had to be re-done because it was so soggy that everything fell off the bread and i had to go back in to get another one ."}
{"text":"My meatball sub was great. Plenty of meatballs, tasty sauce, extra oregano and fluffy bread. I love that they have a whole shelf of hot sauces all numbered to indicate heat. It made me sad that I didn't use one due to my sandwich choice.  The cherry limeade was good but may be the sweetest liquid i've ever consumed. I could feel the impending diabetes. I was stealing sips from Jake B.'s cup, which was good because no way could I have finished a whole cup.  I can't ignore the fact that while I was sitting eating I saw two other parties get their sandwiches with an error. Firehouse Subs is certainly a place I'll return but I'll be sure to keep my order simple."}
{"text":"What great hot subs! The barbecue sauce they make is fantastic and oh how I love all the hot sauces they have!!"}
{"text":"What great hot subs! The barbecue sauce they make is fantastic and oh how I love all the hot sauces they have!!"}
{"text":"Firehouse subs are always so good and much better than Subway or the other common chains. The sandwich was great and the service was fast. I think the store could be a tad cleaner and the tables wiped down better, but overall a great experience with a great meal."}
{"text":"I am a very serious sandwich lover. So whenever I find a sandwich that I really like, I know that I will become a regular. I visit the Pittsburgh area nearly every month. I always stop in the Robinson Mall area after leaving the airport and before going to the airport to grab a quick bite. This week was the first time I stopped into Firehouse Subs. As a sandwich aficionado I knew there would be some \"kitschy\" thing they used to try to differentiate them from every other sandwich shop. In this case, it was the firehouse decor - very nice assortment of hoses, firemen apparel, lights, etc. I was hoping that there was more than just decor that made the differentiation. My hopes were realized when I ordered the New York Steamer. The brisket and pastrami were as good as any New York deli - very tender and flavorful. The addition of melted provolone with mayo, mustard and Italian dressing made the sandwich extremely creamy and delicious. I felt it was definitely calorie worthy. Because Firehouse Subs is a chain I will most assuredly start frequently the three locations nearest my home. Another benefit is that the firehouse decor is more than just a \"kitschy\" collection. The company actually was started by a firefighter and provides assistance to firefighters. You have the option to donate when you make your purchase to help support their efforts.Their non profit is called Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation if you'd like to check it out. A nice example of doing good by doing good!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I eat here at least twice a week and they are consistently good. I'm a vegetarian and they have a great sandwich for me in addition to the ones with meat which my boyfriend loves."}
{"text":"Listen I love fire house but the service my friend and I experienced from one Sam was truly atrocious! First she asked to see my shirt. I showed her it said Vegas strong. She said \"it's kinda over done\" I laughed it off and walked away. I apologize if I sound sensitive but what happened in October was something that is very near and dear to my heart. She also made comments to my friend that were unacceptable. When he ordered his sandwich and asked for a large she reminded him that the medium was on special, which, by itself would be perfectly fine. However, when he said that he still wanted a large, she continued to press the special by saying it is only 4 inches less. When he finally confirmed that he wanted a large and continued by ordering another sandwich, she said \"oh! I guess there's more now.\" Before totaling the order. This was unacceptable. Please re-educate your staff on how to speak to customers. The food was good."}
{"text":"Typically, we LOVE firehouse and usually the service is amazing. Although it's obviously a type of fast food chain, we still have a few expectations especially since we used to have great food and service at the previous location we would frequent. This location however has the least interested staff I have ever seen. They clearly hate their lives or their job (or maybe both) and they have no problem showing it. It's just downright annoying and we have stopped going there altogether because of not only their poor attitude, but they can't even get our good orders correct. Definitely disappointed!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sub shop!  I am not even sure I would have found it had it not been for the firehouse dogs (teens dancing is a) handing out promotional coupons at the intersection. The staff is very friendly, as all customers are greeted with a \"Welcome to firehouse\" when walking in the door.  I was extremely impressed with the high quality bread and meats used for their subs.  Additionally, the boss was very friendly  and spoke to use specially about our experience.  They offer 50 types of hot sauce ranked on how hot they are (one was a PSU brand).  Most importantly is that there are opportunities to donate money to firefighters and equipment for fire departments."}
{"text":"I LOVE firehouse. The steak and cheese is so good. Anytime I'm craving a good cheese steak, I come here. The employees are very nice (mostly) They usually smile and greet you when you walk in. This place beats any sub restaurant in my opinion."}
{"text":"What can I say except you can never go wrong with Firehouse Subs.  We walked in and the place was clean which is usually a good indicator of how the service will be.  We were promptly greeted with smiles all around.  I ordered The Italian on wheat and he ordered the Philly Cheesesteak.  Both arrived at our table  in a timely manner .  The food was fresh and delicious! I would definitely recommend this location to anyone. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is a really good choice if you're looking for subs that are fresh and tasty. The portions are serious massive!! One large sub could easily feed two people. I got the Italian sub and it was delicious. I'm pretty sure they make their bread too. They also have an assortment of hot sauces which they number based on hotness.   The employees here are all really friendly and hardworking. My only gripe is the parking situation. I came on a Saturday afternoon and there are not enough parking spots!!! Also, getting out of that parking lot was a serious headache.   Can't wait to try more subs the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse Subs and I eat there often. This location in Dana park was ridiculous. No one said anything when I walked in which was fine, I'm not the queen or anything. I stood there for five minutes  while no one looked at me. All employees looked like zombies that were miserable at work( I mean no one wants to be at work but still).I called my order in and was told 15 minutes. I got there 10 minutes later, not a big deal I can wait five-ish minutes. I grabbed my chips and went to the soda machine which was filled with different colored stained ice in the bottom tray part. And of course there was no ice left in the machine. The counters were dirty. There was no more than 10 people inside half of which had no sandwiches yet. I waited another 10 minutes for my sub to be ready. I did get a free little fire hat for my son so that is cool. When I originally ordered my sandwich via phone I repeated 3 times no onions please. But of course there's onions! That sat marinating on my sandwich for 30 minutes while I drove to work. I've never had an experience like this at different locations for Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"Not worth the $$$. Highly over priced ......not enough meat on the bun.  I will not be back . Friendly staff though."}
{"text":"I would have given five stars as the sandwich (#5) was delicious.  The young girl at the counter was pleasant and the gentleman making the food was very polite.  I did not give this location 5 stars because the woman manager in duty should not be managing people.   She is demeaning, condescending, and down right rude to her employees in front of customers.  She needs to either be sent back to training herself or removed from the position.  She does not possess the necessary skill set to manage people."}
{"text":"I tried Firehouse Subs today because I had a hankerin for a good steak and cheese.  I've tried many of the other sub places in the area and they are good, but the REAL good authentic type philly cheesesteaks are closer to or in the city of Pittsburgh.  Ok, so let me get to my review.  It was just okay.  We ordered the New York Screamer, Italian and Cheesesteak.  The Screamer was good and the italian was the best out of all three BUT the cheesesteak just didn't do it for me.  It had mushrooms, green pepper and onions but tasted nothing like the oooey gooey cheesy beefy goodness that I'm used to.  So if you want a rating on the cheesesteak...I say 2.  Places like Peppi's make a better cheesesteak and Jimmy John's makes a way better italian.  It's hard not to make the comparison when those places aren't extremely far away.  I want to like this business because they support our local firemen, but not sure I'll return.  I just don't think $18 was worth the satisfaction of just 1 sandwich.  :("}
{"text":"First time I've been to firehouse subs. Upon arrival there was no greeting and no one behind the counter and a very stale environment. After looking at the menu for a min or 2 finally an employee came out and acted like he didn't want to be there at all. I get it it's Memorial Day weekend but hey thank God you have a job. Anyway the price was on the higher end for $1=1\" of sammich! The taste was great and temp was good. Customer service was just seriously lacking for me. Probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I walked into the restaurant and no one greeted me (they greeted everyone else). This didn't phase me, until it took 25 minutes to make one simple sub. It was supposed to be \"fully involved\", but they only put me turkey and mushrooms. No lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, etc. Just the damn turkey and mushroom."}
{"text":"Always good service. Occasionally hear employees talking about their lives but.... They make my order correct & no attitude with service. This is my favorite Firehouse to go to."}
{"text":"We are excited to have a Firehouse on the west side of Cleveland.  We moved from Charlotte, NC a few years ago and had a few locations close by the house.  Can't wait to include this location into my lunch and dinner routine.    Hook n ladder is a must try."}
{"text":"Firehouse subs are always good.  Excellent good service at this location."}
{"text":"Firehouse Sub's commercial for the Meatball Sub sounded so good we had to try it and were not disappointed. Best Meatball sandwich I ever had. Then to change things up one time, my husband decided to get a brisket and cheddar sub and that was the bomb-diggity too! Now we get 2 big sandwiches of each and trade halves. What a treat!"}
{"text":"I love it when the guys behind the counter yell at me. In this case, they shouted a hearty welcome when we came through the door of this bustling Malvern toasted hero house. The staff was dressed in schticky shirts with labels like \"Steamer Crew\" on the back. Sort of like the Joker or Riddler's crew on a classic Batman episode. Holy Hoagie Hotspot, Caped Crusader!  I am a hard core hoagie biggot, so I was afraid I was bout to be hosed when I saw their Italian was served with Mustard and Mayo. I decided to jump without a net and order the combo, just the way they make it, with the House Special Cherry Limeade, served with real limes from a too cool for school soda dispenser. My buds all got the Hook and Ladder. A couple of us ventured into the signature hot sauce collection to turn up the heat.  Service was snappy, prices and just about everything else were about what you expect from a franchised toasted sub experience. I ate every bite of the sandwich, and while it was no Italian Hoagie, it was a pretty good lunch, and I will go back for sure, if nothing else, just to be yelled at when I walk through the door."}
{"text":"A little surprised..  Lunch on a Saturday and everyone that works here looks like they are hung over.  Giving food to the wrong people and not making food at all...  Great food and nice place but I will steer clear of this place for my good at catering needs..."}
{"text":"We really like the subs at Firehouse...but when you spend almost $40 and the sandwiches aren't right it gets extremely frustrating. 2 weeks ago we called to a question and were put on hold for over 10 mins. We actually walked into the restaurant while on hold and asked if they were ever going to answer our call. Then today they didn't even read what we wanted on the sandwiches and just put everything on one of them. Had to drive all the way back and now have 2 sandwiches that are cold and one they re-made. The manager was apologetic and gave us a free sub. Really hope they can get it together in there and start paying attention so they don't lose business."}
{"text":"Hands down Firehouse Subs is the only place I will go for subs - WOW!  Two of us slipped into Firehouse for a quick dinner.  Being our first experience, we planned to get different subs and share.   Wonderful menu options accommodating anyone's preference without being overwhelming.  We both instantly choose the New York Streamer which includes a combo of pastrami, corn beef and beef with cheese and Italian dressing.   After each of us devouring 1/2 the sandwich we were full.  Very grateful we made the same selection as the second prize was devoured later in the evening.   Staff is friendly, efficient, and extremely clean!  Oh bonus -- free Fireman's hats!  Yes, we both wore them out of the establishment!  Don't wait another, check it out yourself!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here a few days after they opened to give them a try. We visited around 8pm so it wasn't too crowded. I got the 'Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket' and my wife got the 'Turkey Bacon Ranch'. While my sandwich was a tad messy, it was well worth it. We both got meals and it was around $19. A tad more than some of the other sub shops but the quality is worth it. The soda machine is a Coca Cola Freestyle that has like 120+ different combinations of drinks. My wife said the root beer was a tad too syrupy but the regular Sprite was fine. I went with the sweet tea (different machine) which was barely sweetened.   One cool thing is they have fire gear from the local fire department hanging on the wall which gives it more of a local feel. There is also a hand-painted mural with a fire truck and what appeared to be the city building in downtown Champaign.   Definitely looking forward to grabbing a bite to eat here again in the near future."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience ever!!! We ordered lunch for our office 2 weeks ago and everyone got violently sick!!!  Steer clear of this location not sure if it was a cleanliness issue or just bad product, either way it was a horrible experience to have our whole office sick with food poising.  Not to mention the food itself was underwhelming.  Hopefully nobody else gets sick!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype about this place so I had to try it out. It definitely lived up to it. Sandwiches were very tasty and the homemade spicy bbq sauce was delicious. I overheard someone in line call this place \"a trip\". I'm not sure what that means, but it certainly was a lot more interesting then other sub shops in town."}
{"text":"Saw an Employee, Preston dealing with an old unruly lady. He handled it like a professional. She's a douche. Keep making great sandwiches"}
{"text":"Best Sandwich shop in Summerlin. Food is always served as per order and fresh. Love their wheat bread served warm with a slightly crisp light crust. My favorite sandwich is the Hook and Ladder fully loaded with some of Capt Sorensen's Datil Pepper Hot Sauce. Favorite drink is their very own Cherry Limeade. If you haven't tried this place yet, give it a try you will not be disappointed. Also, Firefighters get discount at all locations. As I travel across the country I can always count on a good meal at the local Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. Usually my go to was Belly Busters back in Toronto. But this place is the icing ontop of an award winning cake.   Their meats are so fresh and sliced to perfection. My favourite is their honey ham. It's sweet and moist. Most of their subs are cooked with melted cheese on a panini press but also come as cold cut if you want. I always get the extreme turkey bacon cause it has honey ham on it also.   The toppings are delicious also, my favourite their pickles. Especially crunchy and fresh. The subs come in a cute box and are GIGANTIC !!!   The price point is on the high side, although it is well worth the money for the quality you get."}
{"text":"Never coming back to this Firehouse EVER. the worst customer service I've ever received. The guy taking my order John gave me attitude before I ever ordered & took 20 mins to deliver my food. Go to any firehouse but this one. Save yourself the trouble"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great services. The staff goes out of its way to ensure a pleasurable experience. All around nothing was bad and I will being coming back here again!"}
{"text":"No free birthday sub. The woman at the counter asked if I'd like to buy a meal to get a free sub. Nope. That's not the deal as it clearly states on the website. Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"WOW... It hasn't been that long since I wrote my last review for Firehouse Subs, but I have to write an update already!!! The customer service here is absolutely AMAZING!!! I've become quite the frequent customer here, coming by for lunch once or twice a week, and the employees are SO friendly, polite, and attentive. I wish more places were like this! Many of them know me by name, they know my order, and if I step out to the grocery store and return, they will walk my order to me at the door! WOW! I don't know anywhere else that will do that.  The manager and I had a great talk today, and he even read my Yelp review! :)  As always, the subs are delicious, warm, meaty, and well-prepared. I am definitely hooked on Firehouse!!!"}
{"text":"Love the subs and the staff is very friendly. Also the rewards program that they have is pretty sweet, always end up getting a free cookie. Does take a while for them to make the sandwich but worth the wait"}
{"text":"I ordered 15 minutes ago at the counter. I'm the only person in here with 4 workers who are all a I'm STILL waiting as we speak for my ONE sandwich. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Holy moly...I am a sammie lover so much, I prefer making them myself at home. So when we tried this place I was blown away by how well the sandwich was made, how big it was and how good the meat and flavor came out because of the steam cooking. There was a nifty coke machine BUT the service by the idiot waitress dinged this place. She was asking us what we ordered when she gave us our order, then when we told her, she disregarded it and put the sandwiches in front of the wrong person and said she didn't even know what kind of sandwiches they were.  On the 2nd visit, same waitress (Red headed, tall and with some tatos..she slurred a bit) let the food sit on the counter. When I asked her for water and napkins, she just walked away, and she clearly heard me."}
{"text":"Your standard firehouse subs with great customer service and always love watching some ESPN while I eat food. Wish they had some wifi because I would be there all day if they did!"}
{"text":"Great chain, well-trained employees, and fresh tasting ingredients are just 3 of the reasons I love this place. Went in and right away felt great vibes from a very cleanly restaurant. The cashier was knowledgeable, flexible, and understanding even when the customers behind me seemed difficult. They really took their time to ensure they made a great sub that's worth the price and I didn't mind waiting...it's not fast food and I don't want anything to change!"}
{"text":"If u want a real subway sandwich you'll have to forget subway.  Come to firehouse.  I was definitely impressed with the  fresh ingredients service was fast to."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place. The Engineer is like the best thing ever. So yummy."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Robinson at the Point.  I had the Italian Sub ( Medium ) I think the sandwich definitely was loaded with meat and it was very Tasty the only thing I would change would be the dressing instead of a Mayonnaise based one I would prefer an Italian dressing.   After all it is an Italian Sub.  Will make a return trip in the near future."}
{"text":"I had the NY sub. The flavor combo was good. I wasn't impressed with the service. The food was over priced for the amount of meat that was on my sandwich."}
{"text":"Good quality subs, staff very friendly, lots of choices. If you're really hungry I'd recommend getting the large sandwich.  I got the medium beef and cheddar which usually fills me up but I was still a little hungry afterwards. There was a mistake with my order but Mirabel was very understanding and didn't make me feel like my complaint was invalid, she quickly got it fixed. My sister ordered the #9 which was the same price as my sub but meat wise mine was much smaller. Maybe they could ensure the weight of the meat was same for all subs. Its disappointing when I'm comparing sandwiches, wishing I had ordered a different sandwich. Now that I have been there I know what to order. I will return because of the great customer service and good quality food. People compare this place to subway, this is way better than subway."}
{"text":"Gave our order away to someone else..offered to give it back to us if the other people returned it.  Made us wait 20 more minutes... then wouldn't accept a coupon that we bought from the local school.  This was our first visit and we will not visit again.  Sandwiches were tiny. (Meatball & NY Steamer)  Nothing like the pictures."}
{"text":"WOW, WOW, WOW!!! Really those three words say a lot more....  So the first WOW explanation: I have been going to this Firehouse for several years. I am completely in love with their subs. I also love the fact that they give money to Fire Fighters. I personally always add some extra to my order to donate. I remember once I guess it became obvious about how much I donated, that they gave me a personalized thank you card for my donations signed by all the staff. What an awesome company.    The second WOW explanation: Every time I come to this location they make me feel like part of the family. If I am having a bad day for other reasons by the time I leave Firehouse I forget why I was having a bad day. The staff is always very nice and friendly.  The Third WOW explanation: This one really has me saying wow in a kind of upset way. Not upset for anything Firehouse has done but more for what some of you other people are saying about Firehouse. When you post something on Yelp remember it is public and you should not use Yelp as your venting platform because your having a bad day due to something else. When did we become a society where we complain publically instead of talking to the manager, 1on1 for an agreed resolution.   When did it become okay to bully a company because they made very small mistakes. As I have read all of the reviews about Firehouse I keep thinking to myself that all these people complaining about petty mistakes must be perfect people who make no mistakes at all. I am also thinking about all the reviews that people say things like normally they are great but this one time this happened. So now you think they deserve a 1 star review even though you never posted a 5 star review for all the great experiences. Also to the people who leave this great company a negative review based on your experience with an employee but you lack the true knowledge of what Firehouse subs is about. I assume your the type of person who blames the employer when an employee steals money. Claiming the employer should have had better locks on the safe.   If your reading this, believe me when I say Firehouse Subs is a great business with integrity, character, honesty and great morals. Employees are humans and last I checked humans make mistakes. Before posting a public comment try to resolve your issue with management. I am sure they will make it right if given the chance.  There are a couple negative reviews on here I agree with and Firehouse tried to reach out to resolve and or fix the error however the review remained 1 star. When did we become so jaded that after an apology was given and the issue was resolved we did not forgive the mistake.   A personal note to Firehouse Subs, I believe in all of you and I will be a customer for life regardless of what other people say. All of you are awesome. Thank you for providing great tasting food and a friendly environment. Something to consider people are 10 times more likely to leave a negative review then a positive one. So consider how many customers you serve on a daily basis, I am sure if surveyed your negative ratio would fall under 1% of your customers. Keep up the great job. Truly I mean this when J say Thank you....."}
{"text":"They make the best hot subs around. Got to meet the owner and chatted for a few minutes. Really nice guy. The place was busy but they kept things moving along."}
{"text":"This location is pretty quick with your order. I've been working at the airport for almost a year and they are pretty quick.  There sandwiches are always fresh and full of ingredients. My favorite is the roast beef. The sweet baby rays bbq sauce compliments the rest."}
{"text":"Subs are good.  Service can be slow sometimes when it's not even that busy.  Seems a little unorganized compared to others I've been to."}
{"text":"Nicest & most helpful employees & manager! This week, I went in to grab lunch to go with my two little girls. Unfortunately, my car keys came up missing while I was in the shop. After I notified the employees, they went into action trying to help me find them - searching bathrooms, the service floor, trash cans, and exterior patio to no avail. Note, this is an extremely busy location and this happened during the beginning of lunch rush. The cashier politely asked for our contact information & I was told they would call me if my keys came up. Less than an hour later, the store manager called, & my keys were turned in!  This was our first time trying firehouse subs & even though because of our own crazy circumstances we waited 2 hours to eat our subs, they were delicious! We will definitely be back & know that the subs will be even better fresh! A HUGE thank you to the manager Miciah & the rest of the staff!! Your efforts, kindness, and awesome food are greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie sub with no cheese,  no tomato. Pay for it. Get home and guess what. I have cheese and tomato,  and it was heated. So, i drive 4 miles back to the Northlake location and inform this worker that my order was wrong. He begin to argue with me that there was no cheese on the sandwich and eventually throws it in the trash and says, \"fine, i will make you another one.  I declined and asked for my money back. Went to Subway and they made my sandwich the way i ordered it.  I will not be back. Also like to add that the veggie sub was 7.99. Subway was 4.99 and no attitude."}
{"text":"A firefighter themed sub shop.  The decor was nice, and the place was very clean.  I ordered and Italian sub as this is a good standard that ALL sub shops should be able to get right.  Well....that's that problem.  My Italian sub was pretty much the farthest thing from what I expected an Italian sub to be.  First off, the bread was really good.  I'll give them that, but that's about all I can say about this sub.  They gave an abundant amount of ham, but it was a honey ham and the sweetness totally threw the flavor off for me.  I was also expecting things like cappicola and salami, but didn't notice them there.  Perhaps they were, but it was hard to tell from the sweetness of the ham.  The Italian dressing that was put onto it also lacked any of the \"zip\" and \"tang\" from an oil and vinegar based dressing.  It sort had a creamy sort of taste to it.  They do have several other options that looked really good, and I completely wish I had gone with one of those.  I'm not saying I'll never come back, but I will never order the Italian sub again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Compared to Subway, there is no comparison! You just have to try it, and you will never want to eat at subway again!"}
{"text":"A sandwich is a sandwich is a sandwich. It's ok. Taste good. High priced. Kids love it. I only go for them. Takes forever even when you call ahead. Been here about 10 times since opening. Love the soda machine."}
{"text":"I was hungover and asked for a \"pastrami sandwich\"... \"make it happen\" i said, \"everything on it\" and still i was asked a bazillion questions about what i wanted, which you'd think would be fantastic customer service but like i said, i was hungover and i couldn't think strait, that's why i said \"Pastrami sandwich, make it happen\" but NOOOOO. I'm being way too critical, i know. The sandwich served to me (about ten minutes after i ordered it) was good and was everything i was hoping for. I truly feel this is 3-star valued sandwich shop but the amazing assortment of delicious hot sauces bumped it up to 4 stars. Cheers friends!!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! My husband and I went there for the 1st time when they were collecting water for the blazing AZ heat for those in need. We were in AWE! We actually are big sandwich/sub people, and are a bit picky. But Firehouse Subs...HOLY HANNA, they are a step above everyone else. I dont know, they just have these flavors that meld together to create PERFECTION! We think about doing there often, and will be back again & again. They are a bit expensive(for us), but like they say, you pay for quality. Oh, and on a non-food note, their staff is WONDERFUL! They are so nice, kind, friendly, patient, and helpful. Overall, WAY TO GO FIREHOUSE SUBS!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Live their subs.  Make sure to tell them hot or cold.  They make it hot it seems, if you don't ask for cold.  Fresh and big portions. You may order a sandwich and take home half. Nice service too!"}
{"text":"Don't know what's happened to this place in the last month or 2 but, wow, have they hit the skids. The \"Welcome to Firehouse\" is a bit much, but when no one says it, you wonder what's happening. Was there at 11:20 on Sunday..after seeing the people behind us in line eating their order, I went and asked if we'd been skipped..was told it was coming right up (not an answer..customer service- 0)...My wife's turkey sandwich was still smoking hot 15 minutes after we got it, meaning it had gotten cold and was slapped in the microwave...bun was completely limp and soggy...tables were dirty, a stack of at least 10 baskets on top of each garbage can..don't know what happen to the original gal who was the manager as she was great (came from Lake Mead store) but haven't seen in a month or 2...this store was 10 minutes away, but may have to drive the 30 minutes to Lake Mead if we want Firehouse"}
{"text":"I have been to two locations, the one on Eastern and the one on Marks.  The one on Eastern wasn't half bad, had a large selection of hot sauces, and seemed a bit cleaner.  The one on Marks was underwhelming and disappointing.  I ordered a sandwich and when it came, it was extremely messy and half of it wasn't even on the bread.  My sandwich was also extremely moist, like dripping with some liquid, even though the only thing that was supposed to be remotely wet was the tomatoes.  When it comes to taste my hero was just alright.  Nothing special at all.  I have personally made and have bought many sandwiches which blow these out of the water.  I am also a bit mad about the hot sauces.  I went specifically for a certain hot sauce and it was nowhere to be found.  I had to settle on another similar sauce which worked but hardly did anything to cover up my underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having firehouse subs and I'll probably never try it again; the customer service at this location is HORRIBLE, the cashier was talking to her friend while taking my order. It's like I was bothering them. I'm not sure if the friend works there and was just in her street clothes but she was right next to the register eating chips. I'm giving this a 2, my sub its self was good but it wasn't what I ordered. I ordered an Italian sub to go & when I got home...my sub is just ham!"}
{"text":"Okay cute place,  they definitely pull of their theme! I'm the type of person who really loves a great sandwich.  And they happen to make very good ones here all the elements to a delicious sub-soft bread, savory meats, and fresh cheeses.  The reviewer that complained about variety of toppings must be easily fooled on the quality of other places, because Subway may have the toppings but the meats do not compare.  I had the Italian this visit,  actually my first to this location... but, I've been to others and will be back again! If you come,  the hardest thing is deciding which sub to choose.  Oh I almost forgot to mention they have like twenty different kinds of hot sauce!! they vary in heat level and flavors. Yummy and fun exra element that helps this place be original."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. It must have been Opposite Day at Firehouse today. Our office ordered sandwiches for lunch online and everything on our sandwiches was wrong except one sandwich. Example: I ordered pastrami with cheese, no mayo, no onions, no pickle. I got a pastrami sandwich with no cheese, Mayo on both buns, a pickle, and onions. The bread was soggy so I only ended up eating the meat. Waste of money and time!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the place is clean. But the sandwiches...oh dear, they are so so yummy! I honestly don't think I've had a better sandwich than the ones at this place. The one I get is the Firehouse Hero."}
{"text":"Our sandwiches were not made correctly and were not edible as a result. The staff was rude. They refused to honor a valid coupon. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Went to the Firehouse for the first time today on my lunch break.  Very friendly staff, quick service and YUMMY subs!  Because the sandwiches are steamed they are sooo soft and juicy.  They totally don't skip on the meat, though I would have enjoyed extra veggies.  I will for sure go back again."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. The sub, which radio advertisements guarantee to be the best you've ever had or your money back, can easily be compared to the taste of the subway equivalent.  Though this one did look nicer, it wasn't worth the extra 6 bucks.    They've got the drink machine with a bunch of options (200+) , cool if you're into that."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! Bread very fresh herbs the meats are amazing! Love their cheese too."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a hot sandwich, this is my go-to place!  It's fast, tasty and served with a smile.  I always get my favorite Turkey Bacon Ranch sandwich.  It's always to go, so I rarely take advantage of the meal deal. On occasion I have had the ice tea (sweet, of course) and it's really good."}
{"text":"This was my first Firehouse, and man, I'm kinda taken with the basic roast beef sandwich. Instead of just slapping flaps of roast beef on they kinda chop and mince the meat up in a unique way. Improves the experience, I feel. Served warm on wheat with everything (plus full pickle spear) and Jimmy John's has some serious competition, especially at a $5 price point (sign says that's a limited time promotion but it's been going on for some time now).   Rest of the menu looks good and doesn't cost much more but I haven't tried anything but the turkey, which was solid but didn't hook me like the roast beef did.  Almost never busy, either ... seems like they're always more busy with catering orders than with people walking in"}
{"text":"Two trips to Fireshouse and probably no more. First one waited 30 minutes for our sandwhiches. I ordered the meatball and it was similar to Subway. My girfriends sandwhich was soggy.  The second time the service was much faster and very friendly staff. The brisket sandwhich was so dry it was almost unedible. We took it home and put bbq sauce on it to make it better. It is new and maybe it will get better but we will probably pass."}
{"text":"The  employees act like they loathe thier job. Like hate. Corrina and who knows. Can't eait to taste the food. I just heard a loud ugh i hate my job uggghhhhhhh"}
{"text":"Always good subs here.  My wish is that one day that have sliced pickles.  Other than that, it's good stuff.  Love the hot sauce bar!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite fast food sub shop. Ingredients are everything, and everything I see and taste here tells me that they're using top-grade fresh ingredients. The brisket sandwich is probably my favorite... and it's the one my wife ALWAYS gets. Unlike her, I often bounce around the menu to try different things. Definitely a step up from Subway, Quiznos, Jimmy Johns, etc in my opinion. As with all of my reviews, I grade each place relative to what I perceive to be its peers - so five star compared to them."}
{"text":"Simply the best sub shop around. Military and first responders get free medium drink with a sandwich. I have had all their subs and salads Top quality every time and friendly staff. Five stars all the time."}
{"text":"First time here, had the turkey bacon sandwich. Our food was really good I don't think I'll need to have subway ever again. The staff was really really nice."}
{"text":"Despite all of the sandwich chains here in the southwest (Subway, Quiznos, Jimmy John's, Port of Subs, Eddie's...), it's hard to get a hot vegetarian sub without negotiations beyond what I'm usually looking for in a fast food experience.   (Exceptions: Quiznos and Capriottis, who both have hot veg fare on the menu. However, the local Quiznos always gets my order wrong and the local Capriottis always has some bizarre problem where they can't make my order at all, or when they do it's a 20-minute wait, so I've disqualified both by never bothering to go there again after the first half-dozen disappointments.)  Tonight I walked into the very clean, very bright, VERY friendly Firehouse Subs and ordered the hot veggie sub straight off the menu. Melted provolone? Caramelized *and* sliced onions? Mushrooms? Peppers? Glory!  If I'd wanted to tweak my toppings around a bit, I'm sure I could've; my husband changed the cheese on his steak sandwich without any fuss. The woman taking the order was happy to accommodate him.  My sandwich was delicious and my husband, the guy who makes sad noises in the car when I suggest a sandwich place for dinner, only stopped chewing long enough to sing praises.   Throw in one of those way-cool Coke Freestyle machines (120 flavor combinations!) and this establishment sits above the bar that others strain to reach. I mixed up a slightly misguided Sprite trinity: vanilla, raspberry, cherry. (The vanilla was the surprising highlight of the concoction.)  Suggestions to get this from 4ish to 5 stars:  The bread is decent but unremarkable. I'd like to have some options with cheese or sesame seeds, not just \"white or wheat?\"  Tiny sample cups for the Coke Freestyle machine for a small surcharge. Otherwise, people will stand there trying their mix, adding to it, trying it again, which could become a health as well as a queue concern.  If you offer me a pickle, don't forget to include my pickle. My mouth was all set for a pickle. :(  The only cheese on the menu seems to be provolone, but in fact Firehouse Subs offers cheddar, Monterey Jack, and Swiss. This needs to be advertised somewhere.  Because Sonic's cherry limeade is certainly known around these parts, the cherry limeade at Firehouse should include some sort of notice on its poster (next to the Coke machine that dispenses it) that it's a \"flat\" drink, not carbonated. Poor hubs made a sad face.  It's not the best sandwich in Las Vegas, no, but if it's after 5 p.m. (when Baguette Cafe closes) and I don't want to drive far or stay long, Firehouse Subs has earned a spot on my shortlist."}
{"text":"I just had my first Firehouse sub. I took the recommendation of the cashier for #4(Italian).  The bread(wheat) was the first thing I noticed-soft, moist and a temperature that seemed to enhance the upcoming experience...meat that wasn't skimpy, dressing not overdone or without enough, and the ensemble as a whole made me realize, \"no wonder there's a crowd!\". Yes, a Saturday, but now I think Subway has to retire."}
{"text":"Love this place, love the sandwiches, choices of everything. The staff were kind, helpful and speedy. They forgot the bacon but came over minutes later with it to add. Apologized and we hadn't even noticed. I appreciated that so much. Just heard of them recently but would go back. Plenty of places to sit, donates to firemen. Just a good sandwich place to go. Will go back."}
{"text":"WAY better than Subway.  Just as good as it was 10 yrs ago when we lived in Florida."}
{"text":"My wife and I love eating here for lunch and dinner! We always experience friendly service and smiling faces. Definitely come here ready to get full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"The manager treated me as if I was dumb. The customer service is horrible... But the sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"This is yet another sandwich shop in the Southwest area - with Subway, Jersey Mikes, and Capriotti's within a close distance to this store. This is my first time going to a Firehouse Subs and I was really impressed with the sandwiches. The store is  fairly large and very clean with a lot of seating. As you enter, you are immediately greeted by the staff with a \"Welcome to Firehouse.\" The sandwich selection is pretty extensive with just about everything you could possibly want. I think they specialize in hot sandwiches as most of the sandwiches are done this way - which differentiates Firehouse from many of the other sandwich shops. I settled on getting the Firehouse Hero sub - Premium roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted provolone. It was a good sandwich and I got it with the combo (chips and a drink). The soda machine is pretty cool as well with your opportunity to customize your soda as you want. They also have an extensive selection of hot sauces for your tasting pleasure. I tried the Firehouse hot sauce which is actually quite good and goes well with the sandwich. I'm sure I will be trying out a few more of their sandwiches in the future."}
{"text":"The BEST subs I've ever had, hands down. The bread is always perfect, the ingredients are fresh and the staff always welcomes you when you walk in. While the wait is a little on the longer side(I'd say on par with Cheeba Hut) the time waiting is well spent. The menu is extensive, and I would recommend getting your sub \"fully involved\" which means that it has all the fixins."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a sub stacked high with meat, toasted to add a little crunch and mayo or mustard to taste?  A great place for lunch or dinner or whatever.  The one recommendation I would have is to eat it there.  Trying to take a toasted sub home never works out as great as you think it will."}
{"text":"K. So, very polite people. Food is delish. The only complaint I have is the slooooooow service. We ordered 2 subs, nothing special,  and it literally took them 22 minutes to get the food out to us. I guess that is all i can say that is negative."}
{"text":"I've only been here once. Even though it's preferred to order party-platters ahead of time, I ordered a party platter for my work on the spot which usually takes more time. But the manager went ahead, no hesitation, and promised me a decent wait time (15 mins). Party platter comes cold but it tasted delicious, they use gourmet condiments. I can also speak for my co workers because they were stuffing their face and satisfied. Ok. I was stuffing my face too. Guilty. They have tons more signature hot subs on menu that I'll be back to try. Indeed.  A couple of plus':  2 flat screens that were playing current sports. Also, these kids that work here are genuine and very helpful and patient with new customers such as myself.  The place has a large seating area that allots probably 30 people. And tables can be moved to combine for larger groups. Come thru."}
{"text":"It was my first visit too Firehouse Subs someplace that been on my radar for sometime. I got the extra incentive when my roommate raved about the beef brisket and cheddar sub. I always perceive this place as Quinzos sub. Talk about SO much better! The menu is not that big or diverse but can appreciate any restaurant focus on one thing and does it well! In this case Hot Subs! I ended up getting the beef brisket and cheddar sub. Ironic? It was great choice! I felt the thinly deli cut slices of beef brisket had amazing flavor combine with melted cheddar cheese. Awesome. Even the deli pickle that comes with any sub had nice crunch and really good. They do have other things on menu besides subs chili or pickles chip, etc.   I enjoyed the decor everything is theme too fire house station. The moment walked in the entire staff was extremely friendly with welcome too Firehouse Subs. The soda machine admit that its pretty cool! Or where else do you find big red machine that dispensing all choices from one press of button? On the devil advocate if busy probably not the something too look forward too. The have hot sauce area another thing pretty cool about Firehouse Subs. Over 30 different bottles that you can use if kick up sub a notch. They had lot of people on staff so got my sandwich pretty quick. The combo its great deal for quick lunch. Sure be back too try more Hot Subs!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich chain I've come across. This location in particular is the one I go to, and after 4-5 visits I am very pleased not only with the quality of food but the service as well. Always receive a friendly greeting as soon as I walk in, people are smiling and seem like they enjoy working there. When I order take-out the food has been ready in like 5 mins and I have a 10 min. drive, and when I forget to call ahead, i have yet to wait more than 5-10 mins even on a busy day. When we we eat in, I notice the that they have a person come around to make sure that we are enjoying everything, which is a shock coming from a chain, but It's a great touch and shows they care. I love the meatball sandwich and the New York Steamer, both are just plain awesome. The sandwiches are always hooked up on the goods. Good cookies too.  I don't even mess with Subway or Capriotti's anymore after coming to Firehouse Subs. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in today's order. I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich with yellow mustard only and a hook and ladder salad to go. When we get home the sandwich has everything on it and I have a plain salad no ham no turkey."}
{"text":"This location has excellent customer service. Brooke Zack Dolton and Chis as the shift leader were all very courteous and helpful. My sandwich was special order and with their informed knowledge of the menu helped me have the best experiance possible. Thanks guys!!! I wd recommend this Firehouse Subs on Tatum and Greenway rd in phx Az to anyone intested in having a good time and a Tasty ;) sandwich."}
{"text":"REALLY REALLY REALLY dissapointed. Got here and went through the line, ordered my food then sat down for a while. A looonnnggg while. I got up after getting impatient to check how much longer until my food will be ready. They said 30 more minutes. ARE YOU SERIOUS. Maybe if this place didnt have only 3 employees working during primetime lunch time when there is a convention center down the street filled with 14,000 people then it might have been just a little faster. Never coming here again, such an inconvenience on time. If you want to be waiting an hour for one sandwhich then this is the place for you, if not then just go to subway or in-n-out where they are always ready for quick n easy service. Never coming here again.  Update: the food was great. Will come back in the future just hopefully not while theres an event going on though"}
{"text":"Best subs hands down. I like to keep it simple with their hook and ladder. The quality is on point and the service is great. You really should think about checking this place out."}
{"text":"The best sub I ever had.The staff were awesome and friendly.                                    I love this place!"}
{"text":"My second time here this week. That have Great customer service and exceptional tasting sandwiches. This is now My new favorite place!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time ever.  Right away the manager stopped us, and asked if we had eaten there before. When we said no, he spent time going over the menu. He included his favorites and the local favorites. I got a number 8, it was great! A lot of flavor, toasted perfectly. I will absolutely go back !"}
{"text":"I've had Firehouse 3 times now and have yet to be disappointed.  I've had the NY Steamer, the Club and now the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket.  The Brisket is the best sandwich I've had so far.  The BBQ sauce was warm & tangy with ample amounts of cheddar & beef.  Today was the first time eating in their store and the staff was very much on top of things and the store was very clean.  Of all nationwide chains, I think I have to rate Firehouse Subs right up there if not the best.  I took a bite of my wife's chicken salad sandwich and it was just as good.  That will be the next sandwich I bless my stomach with."}
{"text":"This is the first Firehouse Subs I have ever been to.  Hard to fathom, I know.  But I did some research online and ordered the sweet and spicy meatball, which appears to be a semi-secret off-menu item.  It was pretty good!  Nice amount of spice and yummy melted cheese on top.  However, this location's claim to fame, so to speak, and the reason why I went to this location specifically, is the soda machine (see pic).  Very high-tech, but when I actually used it, I realized that they just have a bunch of flavored syrups which you can appropriately, or inappropriately, mix with your favorite soft drink.  Some combinations are pretty gross, in my opinion.  Who wants a vanilla-flavored Sprite?  I appreciate that they have non-caffeinated, no-calorie sodas like Sprite Zero and Dasani Sensations.  But keep in mind that if you add the flavored syrup, you will not have a diet drink anymore.  Plus, it is hard to figure out what you are getting, if you are a drink nazi like me.  For example, Dasani Sensations with Lemon - is that the no-calorie version or is it with the lemon syrup that has calories?  Finally, people get enamored with the damn machine and stand in front of it, taking sips of every possible combination.  They only have one machine so it gets super annoying.  But enough about the drink machine.  The cashier and food prep people were friendly, the food was good, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and a polite and attentive staff. I'll be eating here most Thursdays when I'm in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Recently we went to the Firehouse Sub sandwich shop.  I presented a coupon for here dollars off I printed from the internet.  The clerk stood there and looked at me.  Two other ladies came to assist her at which they advised us the coupons were only good in Colorado.  I asked if they would honor them and she muttered something about Colorado and turned away.  The cashier stated that would be $17.47.  It amazes me that  a little $3.00 coupon cost them a customer.  Subway looks better and better and they give me a senior discount.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. Wow it's delicious! Not sure why people would rate under a 4 star. Would give it a 5 star but they where out of ice. They did refill it fast."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great subs. New location. Yum."}
{"text":"I thought the pulled pork brisket sandwich was all I would ever need, but then someone mis-ordered the engineer sandwich, but it was so good, that I now have a new favorite... The Engineer"}
{"text":"The map is wrong on this, it is just south of germann off of gilbert rd on the east side of gilbert rd.  The food is pretty damn tasty. The white chicken salad sandwich is good. Prices are reasonable and they have an awesome pop machine that has over 100 different sodas or something crazy like that.  The old man who works the register, at least during lunch the last 2 Thursdays I have gone, should be in a home. He is so over matched by the entire ordering process that it is painful. He has gotten my sandwich wrong both times even though I knew he was struggling and tried to even point to the menu to tell him what I wanted. Luckily they can remake the sandwiches quickly but I've seen multiple people turn their sandwiches back in, I'm guessing for the same reason.  If you own this place, PLEASE let that employee go or find him a new position, he is NOT able to handle the register. All 4 of the other employees made sure to welcome me when I walked in but he is the one that has to ring me up? When I brought my incorrect sandwich back and told them this was the 2nd week in a row he did the same thing, they laughed and said he is a good guy. I bet he is, just not a good register person.  I love the help the firemen angle and $ going back to their charities and all, but please hire a competent register worker."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and my last! I am not a subway fan so I figured I would give this place a shot as it is near my house. Never have I had so big an issue with ordering a sandwich. When I walked in I took some time to look around the store and the menu to see what they had to offer. Big mistake! The lady at the counter gave me this look like I had spit on the floor or something. After about 5 mins of looking at the menu I decided to order the firehouse hero sandwich. Their prices are way more than I expected but figured if the sandwich was any good then it would be worth it.  As I paid for my sandwich and went to sit down I heard the counter lady say something like this guy needs to be going to Jenny Craig not here! I could not believe she would sit there and talk about a customer like that. Her personal feelings aside (btw aren't sandwiches supposed to be a healthy food option?) She should have kept it to herself. Or at least said it once I left. I am a big person but that has nothing to do with how I should be treated. As for the food I have to say I was not impressed. The Virginia honey ham was way to sweet for me. It had this weird almost maple syrup flavor that overpowered the rest of the sandwich. After 2 bites I was done. Bad service, high prices, and even worst food earn this place a nice spot on my never again list."}
{"text":"Best subs in the entire world. I dare you to find a better sandwich shop.  Well worth the price."}
{"text":"Firehouse is right by my YouFit so I stop here fairly regularly. Employees are super friendly, I've never walked in and not been welcomed to Firehouse. I've only had the meatball sub but it is tasty enough that I haven't thought to try their other items. I've never had much of a wait for my sammy here either. I'll give 'em their 5 stars, they've earned 'em!"}
{"text":"Overall a great sand which! Personal favorite is the turkey bacon and cheese on white bread. They also have those awesome Coca-Cola machines with hundreds of flavors.  Last but not least, the wide variety of hot sauces to pick from! Love me some sauceyness!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for dinner. My husband and I walked in the restaurant and, even thought the restaurant was empty with 3 employees behind the counter, no one greeted us. Since this was our first visit we looked over the menu. None of the employees offered any help or asked if we had any questions. After standing at the counter for about 5 minutes finally one of the employees said they could take our order. We ordered our food to go. The sandwiches were very good but the customer service could use a little help. Since we did like the food we will give this place another chance."}
{"text":"I always go to Subway but since me and my son was in the area and seen a Firehouse Sub commercial that day, it was fresh on my mind to go in and check it out for the first time. I ordered the Italian Sub and my son ordered the meatball. Both were great!!! Me and my son always eat each other food just to see what we will order the next time and we both decided the meatball sub was the best. Sooooo, yesterday I was to tired to cook and asked my son 'What do you want to eat\"? He said \"lets go back and get that Firehouse Meatball sub\". I said no problem. However, there was a problem. Our sandwiches did not look and taste like the ones we had a few days earlier. The meatballs tasted like very old meat. The wheat bread looked like it was sitting there all day. It was not burnt but very dark with spots on it. So I ended up just picking through my food. I didn't complain because I know they can do a better job because they previously did. I also came around 9:45 pm when they were about to close. Maybe they were so into getting off that they felt they didn't have to put a lot of energy into giving us a memorable sandwich.   I am only making this review because I want all businesses in Vegas to succeed. These teens need to know we can tell if the food is old and half ass. I am looking at some of the meatball sub sandwiches others posted on this page and our sandwich did not look that good, colorful and full of life. Our's was dark and old looking. We did not finish it. We will give this place another try, however, I will only come on the weekday in the afternoon because that shift got it right the first time around."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying YUMMMMMMM! We happened to be in the area and stopped in to give it a try, the employees were very friendly and greeted us immediately. I ordered the Italian (#4) and it was probably the best hot Italian sub I have ever had all the way down to the dressing that had a hint of sweetness to it. The sub was perfectly assembled the bread was crusty and warm but still soft and fluffy, the variety of meats was layered nicely topped with veggies and melted provolone(yumm). My fiance had the New York Steamer (#3) which was very tasty as well, it was stacked with corned beef brisket and pastrami topped with melted provolone and then touch of mustard just enough to give it that zing! We will definitely be coming back here!!!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome sub joint. The firehouse decor is fantastic and the food itself is delicious. It costs a bit more but they use quality ingredients that make the price worthwhile. The service was quick and I was treated as one of the guys by the staff."}
{"text":"Great subs!!!! Every time I want a sub I have to debate between Firehouse and Subway. I personally think Firehouse is better because they have an appealing firehouse theme, while Subway only has decorative pictures of sandwiches on the wall. Also, Firehouse offers one of the new Coke machines with the touch screens. This allows for more drink choices. I guarantee there will be a sub for every type of person:)"}
{"text":"The taste is great and gives subway and Quiznos some competition. It is a little pricey but worth it if you come with a big appetite."}
{"text":"Since I just referenced Firehouse in my review for Planet Sub, I thought I better come on over here and write my review.  At Firehouse the food gets 5 stars.  The rest of the process is what makes it a 3.  Their brisket sub is mouth-wateringly delicious and the brownies are perfect perfect perfect, but every time I go there it's a total C.F. and really crowded and I'm more stressed out when I leave, so I save that one for when I'm already stressed out and sweaty.   I've been there several times and still don't understand the flow of traffic in there and then you'll have a family of 8 who all goes up to the register and the soda machine (stroller in tow) and basically brings everything to a halt.  I'll still patronize Firehouse, but I'll take a shot of whiskey beforehand because I feel like I've been working on the floor of the NY Stock Exchange when I finally get out of there.  I've even tried going at non-peak hours and it's better, but still a slightly frustrating experience."}
{"text":"My son and I were starving after Scouts tonight and we wanted to try something different ...  Burgers - Tacos - NOPE we went SUBS!  We saw Firehouse Subs and wanted to give it a try.    Food: We split the meatball on wheat.  It came out hot and smothered in sauce, cheese and seasonings.  Hmmmm.  I would say it was a good sandwich not epic. My Son loved the 120 different soda choices ... it was almost too many.  Analysis peristalsis.    Environment: Bright, fun and firehouse themed!  It was clean and very well organized.  The mens room stunk a bit.  But other than that it was a welcoming place.  Service:  When you walk in the door they YELL \"welcome to the firehouse.\"  It was sort of cool .... But lacked a lot of enthusiasm and seemed a bit forced and fake.  The young woman that took our order was extremely helpful and walked us though the menu, newbie indoctrination of a sorts.  Her co-workers did not seem as engaged and a bit distracted.  It did not effect us directly just hard to watch.  If you are in the area and want to mix up your meal, I'd say give it a go.  If you are looking for an epic sandwich experience keep looking.  - AEC"}
{"text":"Good food! Random girl dressed in purple with her hair down made me worry about cleanliness of my food though. She just seemed to be wandering around behind the counter."}
{"text":"My job chose Firehouse Subs to cater our last meeting. Everyone gave rave reviews about the tasty subs. :) A few weeks later, my hubby and I stopped by here  for dinner when we were feeling too lazy to cook. Although our subs were AWESOME the service was mediocre about best. We had to wait for about 20 minutes before our order was ready and we heard the employees asking questions like: \"Who's doing the turkey sub? Did you start that yet? What order is that?\". Luckily we weren't on a schedule and could afford to wait but a couple in front of us stopped in to pick up an order and they had to wait just as long as we did! If we're in a dinner jam again we may stop by here and give these tasty subs a second chance. Too bad the service wasn't better."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the service is fast. The only annoying thing is that if you eat in you have to listen to the employees greet EVERY customer that comes in. It just gets old fast lol"}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great and took a while to get sandwich.  That being said the sub was pretty good.  I would return, hopefully service will improve."}
{"text":"A friend cut our lunch plans as soon as he saw Firehouse on the side of the road.  He said \"You gotta try this place.\"  I went in and had him order for me and it was true.  The pulled pork sandwich was amazing!  Simple, but great!  So if you don't like sub sandwiches and think Firehouse is just another Subway or a Quiznos.......it isn't.  Firehouse is much better!  I have only gotten the pulled pork sandwich, but that is all I want.  Firehouse, also has those 30 different hot sauces, which I love to use to spice things up."}
{"text":"So this newest location is found in the Waverly shops on Providence Rd. On the same end of the property as Starbucks just a bit further back.  It's a clean and very nice store. The line had five or more employees working so the process of getting a sandwich \" should\" be fast ... \"should\" however being the one word that would suggest something but it just was not happening . The employees are all lethargic and seemed  unhappy . No one had energy or urgency to serve. The entire process felt painful. It's as though they all seemed to wish they weren't there.  The employees serious expressions had neither joy or concern for the pace in which all the customers standing around waiting were being inconvenienced.  The food was good - the service was in desperate need of motivation."}
{"text":"Placed an order on Uber eats the process is simple so the execution can't be rocket science u see a order and fill it didn't go that way driver went back but I reached out to the store the girl who answered the ph was just as unresponsive and problem solving as the manager I will never go to this location again and I live up the street I will drive to the pineville location now that's where the service is exceptional at"}
{"text":"Overhyped is the easy word. I would get more elegant with how this place was portrayed as a really good sandwich shop with original takes on old classics while coming to the table with new stuff that would have me coming back each week for more. This, however, proved to be wrong. Oh so wrong. Firehouse Subs, unfortunately, turned out to be nothing more than a glorified Subway and a not very good one at that.  I had heard so much about this place that I thought I was going to walk into a deli counter with a guy in the back running a meat slicer. Not so much. It's a counter just like any Goodcents or Blimpie's you have ever been too. Menu selections on the wall with picture representations? Check. Um, long tables with seats around them a la Subway. Yeah, got those too. I am so confused!  Alright, alright. Let's eat something. The New York Steamer. Beef brisket, pastrami, provolone, mustard, mayo, and Italian dressing. This seems pretty straight forward. Oh, and a bag of chips, how original. Receive my meal and the first bite is the same as my first step into Firehouse Subs. Underwhelming. The meat and cheese worked pretty well together but then the bread came in and ruined the party. We all know how good bread can step a sandwich up a notch. This bread kept everything status quo. I really don't have much else to say. It was, well, a sandwich. Nothing special.  Could I have been over hyped and then simply let down by the results? Possibly. I still go with an \"A-OK\" even with that factored in. I would give Jimmy John's an easy 4 stars above this because they simply make a better sandwich than Firehouse Subs especially for the money. I suppose I would go back if that is where everyone else is going but if my vote were for FIrehouse Subs or the aforementioned Jimmy John's or Goodcents, I am with the latter two of the three all day long."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time a couple of days ago. We will return. Prices are fair and the sandwich was definitely yummy.  The place is spotless and the staff is helpful and friendly.    We each had the veggie sub and I would recommend it to everyone. One tip.  The large sub is huge. Order one large sandwich and split it.  Even a half sandwich is plenty. By yourself?  Order a small sub.  You will not be hungry when you leave."}
{"text":"This place opened recently and I couldn't wait to try it. I got the beef and cheddar brisket sandwich, and oh my it was delicious. The brisket was smoky and flavorful, and the combination of the melted cheddar and BBQ sauce put it over the edge. One of the top fast-casual sandwiches I've had. I looked at some of the other sandwiches they had and cannot wait to go back and try some new ones. I will be back... probably within the next week."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday because it was my birthday.  Usually one can get a free sandwich at Firehousesub on your b'day but no more.  They've become money hungry by raising their prices and cutting out the discounts that use to be offered to military people.  They have no appreciation for the military so I will no longer go to Firehouse sub any more.  Ordered the no. 5-turkey, bacon, and ranch, got the turkey, bacon and watered down ranch dressing which ended up all over my tray, napkin, shirt, pants, and floor.  This sandwich shop will close as did the one on Flamingo because of really poor service and product."}
{"text":"The meatball sub is the best I have had in a long time. I also was talked into the Smokehouse Brisket and it was amazing. The problem here is they only have one register open at lunch time and aren't staffed to open another one. Lunch is a timed thing for me as I have to get back to the grind. Help us out and hire another person STAT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Watched the guy making my boyfriends sub slam it down hard on the counter and said \"here\" low class guy and a low class store I tried to tell him not to go in there because of the location but what the guy did just proves my point. Not friendly he had his hat on and hood over it giving us dirty looks also the guy didn't toast his bread or double meat it after he paid for it.. it's basically as if he paid for a subway sandwich. The girl had huge bites on her arm! Stay away from this low class firehouse find one in a different area!"}
{"text":"I have come here with my husband multiple times for lunch and it is always good. The staff is friendly and food is made quickly and is always delicious! They give a 10% off Red Ventures discount if you work there!"}
{"text":"Great subs and great service. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Being fairly experienced in the culinary field, I would say I would be surprised if this place doesn't close soon.  I was drawn in with the 4.99 sandwich special. Being that everything else in the local area averages 7-8 for an entree, I was looking to save a buck. Mistake.   The place is a little dirty for being very slow day. It had a weird smell inside like rotting food. I'm assuming the place is losing lots of business because so many other new places popping up in the area that are fresher, cleaner, same price, and more tantalizing to the taste buds. Subs are kind of plain, in my opinion. So, the only reason I went here was for the price but the 4.99 sign is deceiving. I admit, I was fooled because subway has the same size sub for LESS, so, I assumed I would be getting something more for that price. Nope. And, the meal deal ( chips and a drink ) hit me in the gut when the total came to be 8.59. Really!? A large drink that I can refill myself and a bag of air for 4 dollars more. Robbery.   There's nothing that ruins a meal than feeling like it's overpriced. And, being surprised at the last second is even more of a hit. Ugh.  But, I was hoping the sub would knock my socks off so I held my breath even though I've been here before and knew it wouldn't. Honestly, it's decent because it's a warmed sub that's full of meat but I really hate being deceived at the register.   I took my cup and went to the mega selection touch screen soda machine only to find that there really isn't a lot of choices like the other fountain machines have but I did notice that they have a signature lime berry drink...the only problem? The limes in the bin were all rotten and when I opened the lid, the smell of rotting citrus hit me like a Mike Tyson uppercut. There are directions ON THE DRINK MACHINE that specifically say 'add lime to flavor.' How can you when they are rotten?   The server does bring the food out, which is nice but I'm very capable of picking it up at the counter if its gonna be 4 bucks extra for that. And, giving the extra large drink when I'm eating in doesn't help either. Personally, I don't even like a lot of drink when I'm eating because it uses up space in my stomach that I'm saving for substance. I might've stayed longer after I finished eating but that weird smell I couldn't get over. The fact that they give me the big cup kind of indicates to me that they know people feel robbed but...they do it anyways. Bad call in my opinion. There are just too many other good places around. The location isn't that great. And there's really no reason I can see to go through all of the other great places to go here so, like I said, I'll be surprised if this place doesn't close soon.  Also, the cashier asked if I wanted to give my change to donate. When I said no, it's almost like she was annoyed by that. Makes me wonder where the change actually goes.   The only reason I give 2 stars instead of 1 is because, SUPPOSEDLY, they support first responders...if they are, that's great but maybe focus on staying afloat before doing that."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Polite and courteous employees, very helpful and kind. Food was amazing, and the jalapeno cheddar chips!! To die for. Mmmm mmm my taste buds always thank me when I go here. They have a drink machine that lets you make a billion different combinations of drinks. I love it here."}
{"text":"GOODBYE SUBWAY! Hello firehouse subs (:   Came here the other day, based on a friends suggestion. Boy, was she right!  Coming here I didnt have many expectations except that she said they're delicious hot subs, but are  a bit pricey.  I will admit, stepping into the sub shop I was impressed with the firehouse deco. it was very modern, catchy and cute. My year old was impressed and wanted to run around. Um, i dont think so little one! There was fireman gear on the wall and floor. Huge murals on the wall that caught your eye instantly.  It took us a while to decide what we wanted. I was caught between the Turkey, Bacon Ranch sub and the Firehouse Hero sub. Both looked hearty in the picture and i was hoping I wasnt going to be disappointed. Like subway in their commercials theres tons of meat but in person you get only a slice or two. My husband knew he was going to get the beef brisket and cheese sub. Smoothered in bbq, it looked mouth watering. I didn't get it because I knew i could sneak in a bite from my hubs sandwich, hehe.   Finally at ten minutes I decided to get the turkey bacon ranch. Just the sandwich for 5.79 and added the chili which was another 2.89. Kind of expensive but i had to try the chili if I was going to write a review for YELP, right?   My daughter got a kids meal which was the grilled cheese, apples and oreo bites. (included drink) I thought that was kind of expensive but when it came I was surprise how big of a portion it was. Enough for an adult in all seriousness. Worth the money. She couldn't even eat it all. It was 5 something if I remember correctly.   Took a little long to get the food (10 mins) but i waited patiently..  When our food arrived, I was in awe. Worth the wait! The small sandwich was 8 inch. Not like. subway where its 6 inches and I'm left hungry. After eating my TBR, I was left satisfied and full.  There was an enormous amount of turkey on it. I don't know how they do it with food costs but i was impressed. I hate that subway gives you two slices and its wimpy. YUM! Chili was hearty. Lots of beans, onions, celery, tomatos and ground beef. Perfecto. I would def come back for the chili as well. Took a bite of my husbands bbq sandwich and it was very good as well. Not overwhelming bbq sauce and very cheesy. Another great amount of beef. He said he would def get it again.   We were a little bummed that the 120+ drink machine was out. (the carbone motor broke) But the manager was very nice and said we could have all the bottled soda we wanted. Next time I will absolutely try the machine. Having all those different flavors and options makes you feel like a kid in a candy store  Cant wait to come back! :))"}
{"text":"Since I work cross the street from Firehouse Subs, they've become the eat-at-my-desk solution.  I typically opt for the Firehouse Salad which is very good, comes with Kalamata olives, peppercini's, chopped lettuce, tomatoes, diced mozzarella cheese, and a generous helping of chicken (or your choice of protein).  Excellent salad and pairs well with the brownie sitting on the checkout counter for a paltry $1.29-who can resist that?  I've had their sandwiches and they're good although honestly I'd rank them behind Subway and Jimmy Johns.  I recommend getting your sandwich \"fully involved\" meaning loaded.  I love the Firehouse Lime-aid which is dispensed from the coke machine-mix it with Ice Tea for a real treat.  Solid 3.25 stars, very clean, very friendly customer service-give it a try!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS subs, made fresh to order, able to customize, very friendly, helpful staff."}
{"text":"Subs are good, I like them better than Subway or Quiznos. This one in particular is pretty busy and I love the flavor mix soda machine."}
{"text":"We love Firehouse.  I always get the Italian and my daughter the Hook and Ladder.  And love the Peach-Sprite"}
{"text":"I used to eat at one of the first Firehouse Subs in Charlotte about 12 years ago. The bread is very fresh. I like the Hook & Ladder.   The turkey, roast beef and ham are tasty. I like he toppings and the sauces that you can try out.  I like the soda machine...so many flavors that you can select.  Employees are nice and fast.  This is for the Arboretum location."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, it was big open dining room, clean and inviting !Was greeted by a welcome! You order at side, did not feel rushed! I had pastrami and hubby had steak sandwich! The bread was nice and fresh and soft, I was not impressed by the amount of Pastrami! I guess at $23.00 for two combos it would be a bigger sandwich! They have 3 sizes and we got medium, chips and a drink! But we did like what we received! I do think other sub shops give you a better value! Guess I will stick with them!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and one of the employees helped me out with my otder and answered all my questions. I ordered the turkey bacon ranch and it was hot and delicious. Good quality meats. I like it way better than subway. Employees are very courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"I think there is a point where a customer has to feel gouged at a restaurant. This is the feeling we walked away with. The subs were mediocre.  I have eaten at upscale resorts for about the same price. If the food was off the charts, no complaints, but when the subs are just so-so, it's frustrating to shell out that kind of dough. I appreciate that they donate a very small portion of the purchase to first-responders, but I would rather make a direct contribution and feel like my money was doing more. Will not be a repeat customer. We drove right by a Subway to pay about 40% more......live and learn."}
{"text":"Not sure who's slower, this place or Which Wich? Also not sure what I was waiting for as no one else was ordering except me. I swear I thought I saw my bread going through a toaster but when I unwrapped it it was warm and a little doughy and not toasted. I'm getting tired of paying over $10.00 for below average food and service from these \"new\" Sub shops..I can get much better quality over at sprouts for less$$ and that's probably what I'll do..."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area from San Diego and decided to try this place for lunch.  Wow, our sandwiches were delicious and so much better than I expected from a \"Sub shop\".  When I told the young man at the counter that it was our first time at a Firehouse, he very patiently went over the different sandwiches and options.  He made suggestions based on our preferences and he was spot on!  I have since found that we actually have three of these shops at home in San Diego, however, none of them are close to where we live.  After my 100% satisfying visit to this Gilbert, AZ shop, I will seek out the closest one to us here and give them a shot.  I'm never going to be able to eat a \"Subway\" again, I'm spoiled!"}
{"text":"Firehouse is a new hot sub concept where they steam heat their meats and stuff. I've had a few subs from this place and they've all been great. In a strange way the steaming makes the meat taste kind of fluffy, not soggy or wet, but light and fluffy compared to other meats. I think you have to try it for yourself.   I'm kind of on the fence about the round up for firemen thing. It's a great business model because it leads to tax write offs that their customers pay for. It also makes it so that the employees cannot collect a tip. But it's for a good cause so there's that too.  Overall I definitely recommend this place and will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The subs were delicious like always, except i was less than impressed with the level of customer service. No one ever said hello or smiled. It was if they were in hell or just didnt care. I didnt like that one bit. I would rather go somewhere with crappier food if the waitress' or cashiers have outstanding personalities or give us amazing service.   I wont be back to this one."}
{"text":"I tried the New York Steamer at Firehouse subs today - wow, that was a lot of flavor.  They start with a soft-baked roll, 8\" or 12\". They pile it high with corned beef and pastrami, melt some provolone on top and then dress it with mustard, mayo and Italian dressing.  I recommend getting those toppings.  They add just the right zing and juiciness. A dill spear arrives on the side.  Even with a full house, my lunch was ready in eight minutes. Yay."}
{"text":"My Capt Sorenson sub was good.  Unfortunately my husband had a sandwich that had corned beef on it that was mostly fat.  It looked disgusting.  He took it up and they were supposed to replace it.  I finished my meal and we still hadn't received his back.  I go up to the counter (yes, I will not put up with this type of bs from a restaurant).  Several of the employees look at me like I'm crazy. And I was nice about it to boot!  Then I get \"sorry\".  What does he want on it.  Really?  Didn't you ask him 15 minutes ago?  Maybe if they take out the TV's things might go a bit smoother.  As I'm standing there for another 5 min or so I watch a young man making a sandwich but seems more concerned with watching the football game.  Yes, he keeps looking up at the TV as he is trying to make the sandwich.  Customers should be the top priority.  Get things straight."}
{"text":"Very welcoming. Never been to a firehouse subs before, and they didn't hesitate to explain what they specialized in. Comparable to a quiznos or subway but better in my opinion. Prices very reasonable for filling food. Good bread, quality product. Could beef up the meat a bit more, but still a very good sandwich. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and have mixed feelings about their food. The first time I ordered a BBQ Brisket sandwhich (not the exct title), and it was amazing, but completely full of sodium and the calories are out of the roof (over 1500 calories for the sandwhich). I know most people will say they don't care and it's delicious, which is true, but please keep that in mind when ordering most sandwhiches here. I decided to go with the Hot Pastrami sandwich the second time, which was around 1000 calories for the 12 inch, and it was a major dissappointment. I probably won't be returning as often unless I am looking to pig out that day, because it seems their best sandwhiches are the ones I wouldn't want to eat a couple of times a week for lunch. I am not a health nut by any means, I just don't like having to order a super unhealthy sandwhich to get the most flavor."}
{"text":"The children's menu is highly over priced, especially the grilled cheese sandwich that I could make for half the price! However their under 500 menu is good!"}
{"text":"I love Firehouse Subs but the service here was terrible and I would never recommend this location to anyone and I will never return!"}
{"text":"Just recently discovered this place and have yet to order something I don't like. Their seasonal Pork BBQ and coleslaw sandwich on a Hawaiian roll is amazing! My kids love the soda machine where you can mix your own flavor soda. Staff is very friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"They have really good subs. I suggest eating them there. They are better warm. The only problem I have right now with them is that they are so busy they have run out of soda cup lids and some of the different sodas that they offer. They are pretty clean considering that they are so busy. Friendly staff will fix problems pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Amazing experience here! The food was tasty but the service was outstanding. I came here with two small kids and they really made sure we all had a positive experience. They helped me carry the high chair, brought the order to our table, grabbed us some bags of chips after we had forgotten to get them, and helped me clean up. You can't beat service that makes you feel welcome and that your business is appreciated. Kudos to the staff at this Firehouse Subs!!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant in general and this particular store in particular. They are always friendly and helpful and the store is always clean. We visit often, worth the money... Delicious food."}
{"text":"i get a thrill turning my friends on to my fav sub place. not one complaint yet!! i am working my way through the healthier fair they are serving now and yummmm!!"}
{"text":"Awesome subs! Friendly staff. It gets annoyingly busy at lunch time, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it's due to the fact that they have such good food! The sub makers are quick, so there's not typically a long wait, even when they're packed."}
{"text":"NY steamer and coke freestyle machine = perfect lunch any day!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day.   I ordered a large firehouse meatball sub. The large is definitely large, and I will be making two meals out of it. The bread was nice and crusty, and the meatballs were better than I have had at some Italian restaurants.   There was a HUGE hot sauce bar (50ish), and the restaurant has a definite firehouse motif."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about firehouse subs so me an my freinds ordered 3 subs a large meatball which was very bland i can get this sandwich at anyplace, large Sicilian which was made very sloppy one bite half the sandwich fellout on my freinds plate and the large steak an cheese the bread was soggy like a fireman's hose hit no but sort off i wont ever order from here again nothing special also at the end of the last bite of the Sicilian my freind found a stem from the hot peppers that if swallowed maybe could of caused him to choke to death"}
{"text":"Worst sandwich ever!!  Over $7 for a medium size piece of bread and not much else; be a lot more generous with the meat will ya!  If you want a great sandwich for around $4 go to Sprouts.  To Tiffany with Guest Services...it's not the price that's the issue, it's the lack of meat in the sandwich.  I'd have no problem paying over $7 for a sandwich with some substance."}
{"text":"This was my first time at any Firehouse Sub.  It was ok.  It's way better than Subway.  Staff was very nice. Asked if my sandwich was good, cleared my tray, and were just an all around pleasure to eat there."}
{"text":"we have eaten here twice now.  Tonight we took my in laws.  My father in law is die hard subway, and my guess is he will stay that way.  Although he liked his sub he is old school and likes the other place.  The meatball sandwich here is way better than subway as were the other sandwiches, however, when it comes to value then the price advantage goes to subway.  Both times here I noticed people constantly cleaning around the establishment.  The staff has always been courteous and smiling.  There is only one soda machine and when this place is busy it takes forever to get a soda.  The layout is weird when it comes to ordering and picking up and the soda.  Based solely on the price mainly a majority of my business is still going to subway."}
{"text":"Loved this place from the very first brisket & cheddar sub and kept coming back...bacon turkey ranch is great.  Veggie is great...never had a bad experience.  Told people at work about the food here and now everyone orders their lunch here."}
{"text":"Good bread and ingredients. Be sure to ask what is added to your sub. Barbecue sauce shouldn't be on everything."}
{"text":"Excellent new sub shop in town! The decor is attractive highlighting local firefighting lore. The dining room and restrooms are spotless. Subs rival competition in terms of size and amount of meat. They're not all veggies like some... Upon entering, you're greeted with a team welcome and service is attentive to guess needs. The pop machine is awesome- 120+ flavor combinations. Tried the turkey bacon ranch and the NY steamer. Both on my list of must-haves. Will definitely be back and looking for more to come to the area."}
{"text":"Quick and solid - a good place to grab a Sandwich and a Lime Coke"}
{"text":"Very good food! We come quite a bit for lunch. They usually have a decent amount of people inside dining as well. I always get the Italian sub. So delicious!!   Today when we came for lunch, the girl who was sweeping the floors where everyone was dining, was blaring rap music from her phone.. I like rap music and so does my fiancé, but we both agreed that it was obnoxious to listen to while eating out and inappropriate. Even one of her coworkers from behind the desk called over to her and she couldn't hear them over her music.   On the other hand, there was a wonderful older woman behind the counter that asked us how our food was after we finished and she was extremely sweet!   Of course, we will be back and recommend!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER order food from here again!  Twice I have given explicit instructions on what I want on my sub. I get it home and both times my order was wrong!!  I'm done with you FHS!"}
{"text":"Firehouse opened in this location, which is very near where I live, about a year ago. While I've not been avoiding it, exactly, I have a favorite sub shop in Jimmy John's, with Quiznos a close runner up, so just never felt the need to come here. That changed yesterday when I got so caught up staining the fence in my yard that I failed to notice lunch time had arrived. With my faves both a 20 minute drive away, I headed over to the closest choice.  I like the lively decor of this sub shop, with its bright red walls and chairs, and black and white dalmation themed table tops. The staff was prompt to greet and serve, and I ordered up a large turkey sub for Doug and The Engineer for myself, which features turkey, provolone and mushrooms, with the usual lettuce, tomato, onion, mustard and mayo (they ask if you want all of these things). They offer both white and whole wheat bread, and I went for the whole wheat. My sandwich was fine, not great, with a sub roll that was a little too soft for my taste and canned mushrooms, which would stop me from ordering this particular sandwich in the future. They do heat the subs, which I like, and they pack in the ingredients, so no complaint on that front. I still think Jimmy John's and Quiznos are better."}
{"text":"This is not a good example of Firehouse Subs. At every other location the workers greet everyone with a loud \"Welcome to Firehouse Subs\". At this location (1616 S Stapley Dr #101) they mumble something that resembles that but never audibly (not sure what they are saying, can't hear them). Sandwiches are also inconsistent from one visit to the next. Huge well made sandwiches one visit Then small soggy sandwiches missing ingredients the next time. Firehouse makes a decent sandwich,  but not this one. Also it took 20 minutes for 2 sandwiches and I there was only one other customer in the place, Keep driving past one"}
{"text":"The subs are great. I'm unlv student and had little time to eat. The employees are so friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the manager reaching out- I'll give it another try; maybe it was just a bad day there."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight and enjoyed the \"Firehouse\" experience.    It's kind of hard to describe or appreciate the exuberance of the employees as you come in and hear, all of them say in unison: \"WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE SUBS!!!\"  LOL  It's overwhelming, but a nice touch and all the employees are extra friendly. As for the food, it's very good and makes you want to come back for more.   We had the medium Meatball for $5.99 and the large Italian for $8.19. We made the Italian a Combo for $2.49 more. Though admittedly, $18.00 might be pricey for two, but we enjoyed ourselves and the bread IS very tasty.   One note before ordering, read carefully what condiments they put on their subs. They tend to add Mayo, Mustard, or both, to sandwiches you wouldn't expect. Pastrami & Corn Beef, or the Italian for example. LOL  So Three Stars \"A-Okay\" and yes, we 'll be back."}
{"text":"Went to this firehouse subs for the first time been to the other locations the customer service here is bad placed my order and when it was ready they called out the wrong name and I didn't know it was my order the lady said my order was ready I said Dan is not my name all they did was laugh not going there again"}
{"text":"First time at this Firehouse. Arrived at 12:45 on a Monday. There were four tables eating already so there was no line.   I ordered my usual: New York Steamer which has pastrami and corned beef. I added a medium drink and chips for $10.94 after I donated a dollar.   My lunch came out in five minutes which is pretty much standard across all Firehouse locations.   One thing that always bothers me: \"Welcome to Firehouse\" from every employee in the place. Most times it is completely insincere. To hear it from six people at once adds to the plastic feel. Just have the cashier say it, since EVERYONE has to go thru the cashier. Much more personal that way."}
{"text":"I've been to several Firehouse Subs in the valley but this is the first time for me at this one. Business took me to the West side today.   I ordered my fave: a #3 Steamer which has pastrami and corned beef on it. The crew did their usual efficient, friendly service and my lunch was ready in six minutes, despite the nearly full restaurant. The steamer tray they use at FS makes the meats hot without drying anything out.   My meal was the perfect contrast to a rather difficult day at work. The bread was fresh and soft, the meat, juicy and abundant and the toppings crisp and fresh. FS always offers a huge selection of hot sauces to sample. I'm a big fan since I like fiery sauce.   Try Firehouse Subs for a delicious, quick bite."}
{"text":"First time at this Firehouse Subs. Been to several others throughout the valley over the years. This one is a new place.   I arrived at 11 on a weekday and there were four tables filled and two more in line. I ordered my usual: The Steamer. It has steamed corned beef brisket and pastrami on a soft roll with provolone, mayo, mustard and Italian dressing. It comes in medium and large.   Usually adding chips and a drink brings it to $11-12 for a large lunch. Some of the proceeds go to the firefighters fund plus they sell pickle buckets for $2 for the same. They also ask you to 'round off' your tab to the nearest dollar to help the fund, which I always do.   I recommend Firehouse Subs for a tasty, hot sub sandwich that makes you feel good inside for multiple reasons."}
{"text":"First time here with the family ordered the steamer and the hero and was not disappointed at all. Very generous portion for the meats and very tasty. Staff is also very friendly. Definitely adding this place on my go to places."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken salad sandwich.  After I got home, I opened my sandwich and was given some kind of sliced chicken breast sandwich.  You can't really see them making it like Subway due to the high counters.  It was too late for me to return to have it replaced, but it was a complete waste of money!  I didn't eat it and threw it away, then had to go back out to get something else to eat.  I don't understand the incompetency and miscommunication.  I know that the location is new, but I would have rather been asked for the order again if clarification is needed."}
{"text":"I was just introduced to Firehouse Subs and having been a fan of Potbellys and Subway, figured it would be essentially the same thing ..... WRONG.  I had their Turkey Verde sandwich and it was DELICIOUS.  For under 500 calories, I assumed I would still be hungry after and WRONG again.  I walked out completely stuffed.  Fresh ingredients, fast service, and helpful staff.  Next time someone wants to go to Subway or Potbelly's, I'll be taking them here instead :)"}
{"text":"Amazing staff! Such nice people and very friendly! Shared the New York Steamer on Wheat with my little sister. Both LOVED it. I would very much recommend this place again! :)"}
{"text":"Great sub sandwiches. I gotta say i honestly wasnt impressed by their famous meatball sub. But I cannot get enough of their bbq brisket sandwich. With bacon. Sooooo goood! This location gets pretty busy during lunch hour. Call ahead if u in a rush. Great food great service. Oh and they have those fointain drink machines that make like hundreds of soft drink combinations, love those machines, i make my fav cherry vanilla coke, they need em in every restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is a review from my visit last night 1/21/13 around 8:00PM.  This is my second visit as I visited this location when they just opened up.  I don't remember what I ate that time but what I do remember thinking was that it is just like any other sandwich place in Vegas...well I would like to take that comment back as a result of my visit last night.  I recently stopped eating meat...again, and I'm sure all my fellow vegetarians can agree that it is difficult to find good places that are veggie friendly.  I mean don't get me wrong, places TRY but all they really do is just eliminate the meat from their existing sandwiches.  Well my only option here was their Veggie sandwich.  I didn't read the description as I thought it was going to be the typical lettuce, tomato, cheese sandwich.  Well to my surprise my regular sandwich was loaded with grilled onions, grilled green bell peppers, grilled mushrooms, and ofcourse the lettuce and tomato.  I was so happy to see that they made the extra effort in creating a veggie option rather then just removing the meat from an existing sandwich.  What I also liked about this place was that they have over 20 different types of hot sauces ranging from 1-10 in heat.  I had some sort of raspberry hot sauce with my sandwich which made it all the better!  I will definitely come back...Great job guys~!"}
{"text":"I'm always here. I work near by and I love coming in. The new owner is very sweet and helpful. Shes definitely improved the store. The staff is awesome! They always put a smile on my face and the food is great. I usually get the #5, it's always spot on! I recommend this firehouse to everyone :)"}
{"text":"I got the cornbeef sandwich. One of the tastiest sandwiches I've had in a while. Just the right amount of meat. I don't like too much meat or too little. Everything tasted fresh and good. It was so good I had to come back the next day. This time I ordered the sweet and spicy meatball. It reminds me of a pizza but in a sandwich. :)  Customer service is excellent. I was greeted immediately with a smile. The place looks clean too.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great food! Takes forever to Make the food. They forgot about my order on one visit, then on another visit they had my food ready but forgot to tell me my order was ready until I spoke up. Great sandwiches but slow bad service"}
{"text":"Very casual and chill place to go to when you are craving for some yummy subs. I tried two of the subs which were the beef brisket and cheddar sub and New York steamer. I wanted to try the beef brisket because its cooked for 16+ hours and was topped with barbecue sauce and cheddar cheese. I'm not really into barbecue but it was a good combination. However, I must say that I prefer the New York steamer better with its beef pastrami and the sauce that stuck out was the deli mustard with the provolone cheese. It was tangy combined with the flavourful beef pastrami. Must try. Plus++++++ one thing I really love this place is that it serves a purpose! It gives a generous amount of its funds to the community. Why would you not support this place? :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sub place to eat at. The barbecue brisket sandwich is a must have. Easily shareable with two people for lunch with a drink and chips under $10 is a great value. Food is always fresh and taste as it should, eat here often you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Came in and there was literally only 3 people in here and they asked if we could wait to place our order because they were backed up. While we waited and were being patient someone else walked up and ordered. I liked this place and previously gave a 5 star but with service like this I might not come back."}
{"text":"Of course the sandwiches are great, there's no question about that but what a fun filled staff they have working here too. Not only did they all welcome me as I walked in the door, they also didn't rush me while I was trying to order. As I waited for my sandwich I watched one of the employees helping a little boy into the fire men boots and then she helped his brother into the fire men's jacket which gave the parents a few moments of peace so they could finish their dinner"}
{"text":"My favorite sub place! Better than the rest...lots of meat and the sandwich isn't dry like the other places!"}
{"text":"Soooo I walk to the door at literally 8:54pm and the door is locked. A lady employee runs to the door to let a customer out and tells us that \"they close at 9:00\" and closes/locks the door. Uhh okay???? It's not 9:00 yet!!! Won't come back, and to think I actually considered this place better than capriottis at one point?!"}
{"text":"I think I've discovered a new addiction. I had never tried Firehouse Subs prior to the opening of this location, but boy am I glad I did! As a fan of hot sandwiches, this was the perfect place for me. On my first few visits, I ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch, and it was delicious. My only wish for it was for the bacon to be \"crispy\" as it says in its description. On another visit, I had ordered the same thing to go. Same taste, but was a little disappointed in the fact that by the time I got home (10 minutes later), much of my bread had turned a bit soggy due to the dressing they put on it. Maybe next time I should ask for the dressing on the side.   In an attempt to branch out and try another sub, I ordered the New York Steamer Sub (hehe). Again, YUM-O! The meats on their subs are definitely not sparse, as they pile their meat on a lot more than the bigger sub sandwich chains in town (ubway-Say and ort-of-subs-Pay) :D.  Also, their meats are very juicy! Any time you can describe something as meaty and juicy is GREAT in my book! ;)  Oh, and any place that is equipped with the soda machine that they have, has automatic brownie points from me! 120+ flavors of beverages out of one machine?! My only desire was to have the ability to sample each flavor in one sitting! I absolutely love the Peach Sprite. Mmmmm...  Closest thing to Earl of Sandwich in my opinion, and definitely more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I took my wife after I had visited one time before. My wife would rather go here than go to Subway sandwiches. I think I have created a monster. I love it too. I usually order two large sandwiches, one for there and one to take home. The Associate's are courteous, the eating area is very clean. I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends & family."}
{"text":"Meh at best. This place is always pretty slow and now I know why. Over priced and not that good. Do yourself a favor and go to Jersey Mike's!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love firehouse subs. Once I had these subs in college, no other sub shop compares. Hot and fresh. Offer an assortment of hot sauces (which I love). Wish I could open up my own franchise."}
{"text":"First time at this Firehouse. I placed an online order (first time doing that) and the mobile site wasn't friendly at all, so I switched to desktop mode and it worked fine.   I ordered the Steamer - tough to go wrong with corned beef AND pastrami. Even tho I ordered all the regulars plus banana peppers, they ONLY put on the peppers, so it was very dry. Unfortunately I was at work and had no condiments. Not much parking around the place tho but they get a lot of walk-ins.   The bread was fresh, which is always dicey on take out, since it's too late to argue once you get back home/to work. But it was very good, toasted and soft.   The meat was good but, as I said, needed the requested mayo. All in all, Firehouse usually puts out good food. A bit lacking today."}
{"text":"First & last time eating here! Service was absolutely horrible. Food took forever because staff was messing around. We were the only ones in the restaurant.  Make sure you check your order! We got the food to go and every sandwich was wrong and didn't have the condiments we ask for. Place is a joke."}
{"text":"Last month we stopped in to order the family some subs to go.... We noticed the sign on the wall stating they received a \"C\" rating and below said under new management????? We lost our minds I guess and went back today to place an order if all things \"looked right\"..... Noticed no sanitation grade on the wall. When asked they stated it fell off the wall???? I will say this will be my last visit to this location! Will go to other locations nearby as we enjoy the food and atmosphere.... Thanks Mike"}
{"text":"I don't understand how hard it is to comprehend food orders, apparently extremely for these people. I have ordered the same thing every time I come here and it is always wrong. When I ask for no mushrooms and no mayonnaise, I expect there to be no mayo and no mushrooms. What do I find when I open my sandwich? The very things I asked not to be on it. I keep wanting to like this location since it's close to my house but I have had enough of the inept ability shown from the employees at this location."}
{"text":"Nice subs and really friendly service... they all greeted me when I walked in and while I was eating a guy came out and asked whether everything tasted good... like in a high end restaurants... the italian sub is delicious unlike dry subway italian sandwitch..."}
{"text":"I had a great experience last time and this time at this branch same thing!!!! They greeted me when i walked in... everyone is smiling at me and the subs are huge i can barely finish it!!! I hope they exist in California cuz I'm going back to my area... LA :)"}
{"text":"I'm done with firehouse subs.  The same thing no matter what location I visit.  I always leave hungry.  I have been to this location twice in the past two weeks and both times I my sandwich was embarrassing short of meat.  If I'm paying over $10 for a sandwich I would expect that when I look down to see something besides just bread.  My coworkers were laughing at it saying check and see if there is anyone inside the bread.  I'll pay half as much and go to subway and get twice as much meat in my sandwich."}
{"text":"I went to eat at this location after driving by once to try it out. It wasn't bad, I had the 8\" steak & cheese sandwich combo with sauteed mushrooms and sauteed onions. Next time I will get something with some spice, since they had a cabinet full of different hot sauces."}
{"text":"The staff is so accommodating and friendly! Excellent, fast service and one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Will definitely be coming back often."}
{"text":"I typically LOOOOOOVE firehouse subs! But yesterday I had the experience of my life. Sadly my husband and kids had already finished their food and I was half way through my sandwich and pickle when I noticed something in my pickle. Tucked in like a little seed! I looked closer and noticed it had legs!!! EEEEK. I was mortified. It was the most disgusting looking bug out there imbedded in my pickle. God knows if there were more since I ate practically the whole thing! My husband was so disgusted! He kept saying we should have just went to Chik fil A. Anyways the manager came and the way he acted only made it worse. He refunded my sandwich but he was smiling the whole time and slightly giggling. AND to top it off he was showing people in the restaurant the bug in the pickle! How humiliating is that!!!! What he should have done is refund my whole dinner and and try and make it right. Instead he laughed and paraded around the bug I almost ate! Anyways I don't think we will return to a firehouse sub again! ** Litchfield and Bell Rd location**"}
{"text":"They make the best sandwiches. Except when they're handing them to other guests in the restaurant that I paid for. This is the second time they've done that to me at this location. I walked out because I didn't want to wait long and asked the manager to donate my refund to the charity they ask you to give to when you're paying. Thank goodness Subway makes sandwiches for me when I pay for them."}
{"text":"First of all, our order took about 25 minutes to come out which was very frustrating. Conveniently, the gentlemen behind us who seemed like they worked there got their much larger subs about 10 minutes before the two of us. Then as our food comes up, a frustrated young blonde (no color in hair) talks very loudly about how none of her coworkers are \"doing their f#&@ing jobs\". First time here and I will never come back to this location. Good food."}
{"text":"If their sandwiches are pretty good, their service is hit and miss. Sometimes ready within minutes and like today when I'm writing this 10 minutes went by before I had to get up and ask if they forgot to make it. Worth going to but worth driving too."}
{"text":"The absolute worst, the girl at the counter was unbelievably rude and snotty and quite frankly dumb as a stump... as I'm trying to order a sandwich she's talking over me and rushing me along, I'm trying to ask what veggies and she's telling me the cheeses and the condiments, for god sakes shut up and listen .... I'm only asking about the veggies and she just kept spouting out the entire sandwich. I then told her to just listen to what I wanted and after that she was still asking me if I wanted the other stuff such as  peppers and mayo and cheese. She was the dumbest millennial yet. She is what gives this generation a bad name."}
{"text":"Tried one sandwich. Large = Ginormous. Ordered the meatball sub. Sauce was a little bland, but the bread was fresh and the meatballs were good. I will try something different next time. They have 5 star potential, I just haev ti give it another try."}
{"text":"Great sub shop.  Yes, you have to wait a bit for your sub but that's because of the way is made. The subs taste amazing.  Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, and the owner is usually on-site. Nice to know he really cares and wants to be known for great customer service and yummy subs."}
{"text":"Very slow service.  Took forever to take order then long wait for sandwich.  Sub is good but service needs help."}
{"text":"This was the friendliest Firehouse I've ever been to. I ordered a very large to go order that was ready in ten minutes and completely correct. They even offered to take it out to my car. Friendly staff and very clean."}
{"text":"Went last night and everyone was friendly and helpful. I had the hook and ladder and it was tasty and filling. My husband had the meatball and he liked it. So much better than Subway!!!!"}
{"text":"Love their Philly Cheesesteak or Hook & Ladder!! YUM!! The mobile App makes ordering super convenient too!"}
{"text":"If u are in the mood for a good hot sub with all the cool hot sauces, this is the place. the fountain drinks section is awesome.Lots of variety of soda too.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is great, mostly writing a review because I'm impressed by the people working here. Friendly, great customer service. I had a big order and Dan (I think his name) helped me out to my car! I would occasionally like the option to order some of the same sandwiches cold vs hot, but not a big deal."}
{"text":"I was given a free sub because I got a burnt meatball in my sub. I just wanted to let them know about the burnt meatball and a minute later the manager presented me a free sub. I didn't ask for it but the jesture was very appreciated."}
{"text":"Fresh, Friendly, and Fast, I ordered a Firehouse meatball sub which  was spectacular .Fresh Ingredients, melted provolone cheese, nicely toasted bun, delicious sauce(not too sweet nor tangy), friendly faces and considering the amount of people in line ,they were super fast. This is my new \"on the go\", sub place for sure. Delish!!AW:)"}
{"text":"Make sure you get what you order before you leave!  When I got home 5 of the 6 sandwich's ordered were wrong!  Bread was soggy threw them in the trash! Italian subs were given to me not what was ordered Called they said I can come back and get the correct subs I ordered make sure you keep the receipt because they will ask for identification the employee who took the order was there Ridiculous I was there the night before and wouldn't have to return to get my correct order if I would have gotten the right order in the first place! Bread soggy the 2nd  time will not go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite sub shop!  The taste cannot be beat, nor the friendly staff.  I didn't give them a 5 because it takes awhile for them to make these tasty subs AND I find it difficult to know where to stand in line.  When I stand straight in front of the counter (with my back to the soda machine) people coming in from along the counter cut in front of me.  When I stand along the counter, invariably people walk around by the soda machine to stand directly in front of the register and cut in front of me.  I realize these people are probably just as confused as me but seriously - every time??  I suggest arrows on the floor or something."}
{"text":"Let me start off with the positive things about this place. The place is clean, it's close to home and staff is decent. The sandwich I had was very flavorful.   Now the not so great things about this place. Holy crap the price for a tiny ass sandwich is outrageous! Then they have the nerve to ask if you want to round up to the nearest dollar for a donation. I'm all for supporting the cause but dang how about taking it out of that huge chunk of change you are charging me for JUST a sandwich. For the same price as I'd pay here for a combo I could go eat at Olive Garden or even make a meal at home. Seriously this place is highway robbery. Like I said the sandwiches are good but not at that price. I'm so sad I probably won't be eating here very often due to price."}
{"text":"My family and i ordered 5 subs and chips and spent over $50.00  and these were the worst sub sanwiches we have ever  teasted my family even aggreed  I would rather have a Blimpies,Jersey Mike's or  even  Jimmy Johns  Thoes snawhiches are so much better than Fire House  They look like nothing on the commercial very disappointed:("}
{"text":"Super good sub. The ice tea was excellent!   Workers were very friendly. Easy to earn rewards with the app.  Will defiantly be back in again soon!!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly. Environment was nice, clean and offered outdoor dining which I enjoy. Huge drink selection included various water options and tea- very appreciated since I don't drink soda or coffee. Sandwiches and salads are available, thumbs up for that. Smokehouse sandwich was good but I personally would either make it a salad or add lots of veggies to it. The turkey said \"smoked\" which isn't my preference so I didn't try it. I would need to experiment to find what fits my eating preference, which would pop the stars higher."}
{"text":"Disappointing  Same experience as other customers. I asked for extra lettuce and a few other toppings and I got 3 small, wilted shredded pieces of lettuce and maybe 5 chopped pieces of green pepper, one onion slice and they didn't add the rest of toppings. My husband said there was no manager and just a couple teenagers working. Ridiculous. Even more sad considering how good the meat is here."}
{"text":"I'm going to go right in the middle on this one because I love their subs. A couple things about this place are frustrating, though.   First off...customer service is not their forte. They almost make me want to apologize for inconveniencing them by wanting a sub.   Second...do NOT go here if you are in a hurry. Don't attempt it. I work in the area and decided to grab a sub on my lunch. I called the order in because I was on a time constraint. I arrived ten minutes later and still waitied approximately 20 minutes. Thirty minutes total for a sub?? Okay, so they were busy, but 30 minutes? I gave them the benefit of the doubt and avoided the review because I knew I was heated. I went in again tonight. There was one couple waiting for their sandwiches. I ordered four for my family. It took 25 minutes.  A couple other comments, one girl was standing around talking the entire duration of my visit. I had 25 minutes to observe this. She talked to the gentleman making all the sandwiches. This made me upset because the time could've been cut in half if she helped him. Further, the dining room was really messy. She could've been cleaning. Instead, the order taker cleaned the dining room when she finished taking orders. Firehouse could either cut labor cost or improve customer experiences by focusing on training their associates."}
{"text":"New location, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to speed.  SO SLOW!!  The sandwiches taste great and really fresh, but be prepared to wait quite awhile during peak times.  Pricing is fair, and I LOVE the Coca Cola Freestyle pop machine they have there, which dispenses around 21 different brands of pop, each with 2-7 different flavors per brand.  7 flavors of Fanta and 4 flavors of Mello Yello?  Who knew!  Plenty of indoor seating, with some outdoor seating as well.  Parking kind of sucks because there's only about 7 spots directly outside the restaurant...so get used to parking by McDonalds and walking over.  Ok, back to the wait times.  I have been there twice.  The first time was only a couple days after they first opened their doors for business, and I waited in line about 5 minutes and it took 10-15 minutes to get my sandwich after paying for it.  At that time(roughly 3pm on a weekday), there wasn't many people there, so I was a little concerned about how long my sandwich took.  Today was my second time there, and this time I was there at the peak of lunch hour(12:15 on a weekday).  The place was packed with people and the line was long enough to span the entire front counter area.  The line seemed to be moving along ok, and within about 5-7 minutes I was placing my order.  This is where you thank me for telling you to bring your smartphone with you.  I waited a solid 20 minutes to get my sandwich today, and that's after I the initial wait to place the order.  I'm not sure if there is any prioritization on \"to go\" orders, or if they just made first in first out, but there was a pretty big group of us waiting in the corner for our to-go orders.  Now I understand why they have a sign in there that says, \"Save time, order online ahead of time!\".  I will test that out on my next visit.  Overall, good place to get a fresh sandwich.  The Steak & Cheese and Meatball sandwiches are pretty good, and the New York Steamer is a good choice if you like beef brisket with with pastrami.  I'll be back, but next time I will try to avoid the busy times of the work day."}
{"text":"I like Firehouse Subs for their premium tasty sandwiches, they're absolutely outstanding!    Recently I've found it somewhat harder to swallow their premium prices.  Years ago, the late Clara Peller became famous for her TV commercial \"Where's the Beef?\", while complaining at a burger place called, \"Home of the Big Bun\".  While Firehouse isn't that bad, they are close and Which Wich isn't too far behind either for the same reason.  I'm tired of trying to figure out who is giving out 3oz, or 4oz of deli meat on their subs.    What I truly enjoy is a creative, well made sandwich, that has er, some beef on it, or in Firehouse's case, some meat.    Quiznos went though bankruptcy, I believe because they forgot that consumers could see them weighing the meat on a scale, and then removing a slice or two when it was too much.  Okay, here's my beef (pun intended).  A group of us came here for lunch and universally found our checks in the $11.00 range.  So that's a sandwich 12\" long, meat, chips and a drink.  How much does a 1/4 lb of the most expensive deli meat cost at Fry's or AJ's?  Sadly, we've found it easier just going to Jimmy Johns down on Chandler Boulevard, asking for double meat and paying $9.50 for the same setup.  I give the manager of this location high marks for draining the liquid from the heated pastrami/corn beef NY Steamer after it came out of the oven.  I was in a Firehouse in Florida recently where they forgot to do this and the sandwich just a mushy mess.  In summary, \"Yes, I am a Fan\" of Firehouse Subs, particularly for all the local Outreach they do for our Bravest. But I only hope they consider taking their thumb off the scale and put some real meat on those sandwiches.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love these sandwiches.  More meat and toppings that other sub places and is close to home.   Always greeted upon entry and pleasant folks behind the counter.  Always amusing to see the variety of hot sauces.  Even my kid has his favorite sandwich.  Plus. You can buy a 5 gallon bucket for 2 bucks and it goes to help out families in need and to support firemen and women.  Great sandwich and Great cause!!"}
{"text":"This place was soooo good! We wanted to eat here again the next day on our soccer tournament to Las Vegas but it was so busy we passed. A good sign that they're good though. I had the beef brisket my son had the meatball and my husband the chicken club we all loved them. Also great friendly service."}
{"text":"Tons of options, customizations, incredible employees, and amazing food. They know us by now. Their subs might take a little longer than Subway but they're made better and once you stop and think about it there are other customers in the world so who cares. Plus, you get what you wait for. 10 minutes making a hot meat sandwich in the manner that they do is not a lot to ask for. Also I'm not sure I have ever heard of damning a place with one star for too many options. #bye"}
{"text":"We have now visited Firehouse Subs Surprise at least twice a week since they opened and we couldn't be happier with the food, service, and atmosphere. My oldest son loves the cheesesteak sandwich and my hubby loves the brisket. I am a huge fan of the salsa verde turkey sandwich and the littlest loves the kids' ham and cheese (mostly because he has quite a collection of FREE fireman hats with every kids' meal) I have also enjoyed the Firehouse salad which is always crisp, fresh, and delicious.   We love using their free online app to order when we need sandwiches to go and love the friendly atmosphere when we dine in. If there is a mistake, they fix it, no questions asked. And I love being greeted by Welcome to Firehouse every time I walk in. Makes me feel like Norm from Cheers. :)   With the loss of my other most favorite restaurant in Surprise a few months ago due to all that construction, I'm so glad to have a new favorite place to visit and be treated like family.   In fact...I might head there now...all this talk about salsa verde turkey.....mouth.watering.must.run"}
{"text":"Love me some Hook & Ladder! An addicting sandwich. I love it fresh and with Gator Sauce."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, 1 pm over 12 people simply sitting around waiting for food and the staff walking back and forth yelling knife, knife walking. 20 minutes later and I asked for a refund, it's a sub for gosh sakes. Never coming back to this one thats for sure. One star because there is nothing lower."}
{"text":"Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow and not worth the money. 3 other sub places within walking distance and I know 2 are faster and the food is just as good."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because we don't have them back home. And didn't just come here because I wanted to support the firemen who founded it, even though their compensated extremely well for their service and for the rest of their lives. But knew they would build a good sandwich and it was. I got the Engineer's sandwich that had mushrooms but had them hold back on the mustard. The bread was toasted perfect, very happy. Would of gave them 5 stars if they would of had a tuna sandwich, that was my originally what I was craving."}
{"text":"The Italian sub is amazing. My mind is blown that a sandwich from a chain sandwich shop could be so delicious. Definitely coming back. The place was also clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Just an average sub, un- fortunately for 32.00 dollars for three subs was hoping to be wow'ed a little"}
{"text":"Tasty and filling delicious subs both of my girls ate every bit of their kid meal sub :)"}
{"text":"Out of all the franchised sub sandwich shops, FireHouse Subs is definitely the best. And their house sauce, Capt Sorensen's Datil Pepper Hot Sauce is the perfect blend of flavor and spice that goes with everyone one of their subs.  Prices are reasonable, they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle drink machine, Kids eat for 99 cents after 4pm (at least at this location), and they have Miss Vickie's Jalapeño chips. These franchises have it all (except for a drive-thru)."}
{"text":"Holy smokes. Don't go here at lunch if you don't have more than 30 minutes for your break. The line was to the door. Luckily, we ordered online for pick up and were able to bypass the long line (only after consulting with the nice young man who was at the door welcoming guests who then had to ask another employee what proper protocol is). This was my first time to a Firehouse Subs and I chose the Philly steak. It was large and filling, the pickle was perfectly sour.  The steak was tender and the sauteed onions were perfect."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly staff at this fire station-themed sub shop. I had a business lunch there at the suggestion of a colleague and it fit the bill good enough.   Big selection of subs on the menu, both hot and cold. There should be something  to suit  everyone. I only wish that they would have the traditional oil and vinegar dressing, and I don't like mayo and mustard. I didn't see anything like it on the menu, so I had a dry sub.   I'm not much into hot sauces, but the place as a huge selection of different bottles. Everybody in the place with sprinkling up their subs.   My only complaints about the place are the location of the soda machine, which is too close to the counter where you pay and blocks access to the restrooms when too many people are gathered in that area and the lack of a simple dressing choice."}
{"text":"Freakishly slow,  but pretty good food, clean and friendly service. The prices are a little  high for what you get, but this is one place everyone in our family can agree on when  we have a lot of time to spare, because we always wait a long long time for our food."}
{"text":"An ok sub. I would visit again if I was in the mood for a sub and was in the vicinity, but would not seek the place on my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is a relatively new place here in the Valley and they offer up a tasty, toasted version of a tired old lunch staple.    I was driving aimlessly south into Phoenix with a vague recollection that there was a Firehouse Subs nearby. I almost gave up when I saw the Chicago Hamburger sign, but it was only a little further along Indian School. I actually nearly drove past it, before turning into the strip mall at the last second.  I found a parking space in front, and the place wasn't too crowded for one o'clock.   As I said in my Tip, these folks are over the top friendly, but in good way. They greeted me warmly as I came in, asked if I had ever been here before and offered up that their #1, #4 and #5 Subs were their most popular sandwiches.  Nice!  I took a few moments to study the board before ordering the New York Steamer. It's a nice combination of Corned Beef, Pastrami and melted Provolone. They then asked if I wanted the usual of mustard, mayo and Italian Dressing on it? Say what?   Mayo I thought?  I haven't heard of mayo on a pastrami & corned beef sandwich since Woody Allen accused Diane Keaton of doing that in \"Annie Hall\" LOL  You should know, that almost all of Firehouse's medium subs are $5.89. They advertise that for $2.00 more, you can get the large. So, a large it was and I asked them to hold the mayo & dressing.   I've taken a few pictures of the inside of the restaurant and of my sandwich. It was very large, probably a foot or so long. It was also very good, but too much to finish. I wrapped the other half for home and was told later by one of my homebodies, that it was really very good. LOL. Clearly, I'll need to start marking my food in the frig.   Besides what I ordered, Firehouse also has something called the \"Hook & Ladder\" it's a sub of Smoked Turkey & Virginia Ham with Provolone; a Firehouse Meatball; an Italian with salami, pepperoni, ham with melted provolone; a Club; a Turkey Bacon Ranch; and a Firehouse Steak & Cheese. They also have two Premium Subs on the menu: the Firehouse \"Hero\", with roast beef, smoked turkey breast Virginia ham and provolone; or, the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket for $6.19 each.   My large #3 NY Steamer, with mustard only, came to $7.89, plus $0.66 in taxes for Gov Brewer. BTW, I cannot wait for the State to rollback those temporary sales tax increases can you?  LOL  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here it takes 10-15 to make my sub and the place doesn't even be busy...smh"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Firehouse Subs for the past 2- 1/2 years.  I usually order the New York Steamer which was excellent.   Not in my last visit.  It seems that Firehouse Subs has changed its' meat vendor.  The corned beef in the sandwich looked more like ham than corned beef and it was tasteless.  My wife also commented that the ham in her sandwich was sweeter than it used to be.  It looks like we will not be patronizing Firehouse Subs any longer."}
{"text":"Updated to 3 Stars.  My review might have been a little on the harsh side.  While I won't return to this location anytime soon, 3 Stars was more appropriate."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sandwich person and my favorite is a basic homemade ham (no turkey) and mustard (no mayo) on wheat bread LOL, so it's definitely not hard to impress me when it comes to sandwiches. I love Firehouse Sub, always have. My only complaints about this particular location is the woman at the register was very unfriendly. I'm stupidly blind when I don't have contacts/glasses on and since I didn't see anything spicy on the menu that's provided to you while you're ordering, I asked her if there were spicy items and she looked at me and rolled her eyes LOL. I'm sorry that you have to explain, I know I could easily LOOK but unfortunately I can't easily SEE. Also, the place was a mess. There was ice all over the floor near the soda machine - pretty sure that was an accident waiting to happen. So, three stars to this location, not the food chain in general.  If you receive coupons in the mail, make sure to check for ones for this place. My GF and I got two meals (small sandwich, drink, chips) for $4.58 LOL. You can use multiple coupons on one order, which is very rare."}
{"text":"If you like bread then these sandwiches are for you.  If you prefer to get what you pay for then go to Capriottis.  This place skimps on the fillings and thinks you won't notice because of a big soft piece of bread."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I always get the brisket and the large size. It's more than enough for 2 meals so it cuts the cost down considerably. The bread and the fillings are always fresh and the restaurant is spotless. I have been to other Firehouse locations and the service has always been great but not so much here. I deducted one star because I had to actually walk around the counter into the back of the restaurant to find someone to give me a bag to take my leftovers home in. The guy and the girl were just sitting around talking and laughing and looked really annoyed that I showed up to break up their little party. They gave me the bag politely and even apologized for the wait but I saw the look on their faces and I should not have had to wait at the counter by myself for 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Yum! I ordered online. Great customer service. Awesome subs. This is a great sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Excellent subs, friendly staff, good prices.  Only knocked a star because it took a little longer than expected and the kid making my sub looked like he would rather be anywhere else but at work.  Loved the games on the TV."}
{"text":"First time and we liked it. Way better than Subway. More expensive too. Also,the small sandwich is probably meant for kids."}
{"text":"Love the subs. Hate the service. Took 25 minutes to get our food. I've gotten faster service at a sit down restaurant. Don't come here if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"i had my first order with firehouse & every thing was great -- i will know use them all the time since they are just the best-- i am 86 years old & used bite for delivery & they were also great. richard drapo"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, usually to pick up sandwiches on the weekends and I've always had a good experience. I appreciate that the combo price includes any size drink and they are easy and accommodating if you substitute anything on the sandwiches. Good food and a good place all around."}
{"text":"Firstly, customer service was most definitely a 5-star rating!  WHERE: Tenaya & Lake Mead, right next to Rubio's!  WHY: To get your sandwich fix on =D  WHAT: As you park and walk to the entrance, it really looks like a firehouse!! (Or, I actually didn't know if half of the building was actually under construction, HAHA).   There were also about 10 or more specialty sandwiches, with a million different types of hot sauces! I really thought that was creative!! You are allowed to get up and choose one, either out of curiosity or to ADD A LITTLE FLARE to your sandwich!  I had the Firehouse meatball sub because I absolutely love different meats and meatballs in my subs!! I also asked to add lettuce and tomato on top, which made it a little more sub-like! I was surely pleased with my sandwich and ate it all there! =D  They also had a signature fountain drink!! It was the firehouse cherry limeade, and of course I had to try it out!! It was a little on the sweet side, but it was okay.  SERVICE:  There was one worker named Melanie, who gave absolutely great service!! If you're ever there, give her a shout out for me! She was really helpful with helping me pick out the right sandwich for me, and brought our sandwiches over to our table. She also said, \"when you come back and eat inside, they should always bring the sandwiches over to you, otherwise don't be scared to let them know!\" YOU GO GIRL! Haha, so kudos x10 to her!!  *NOTE: The combo, which included a large drink, sub, and chips of your choice was just under 10 bucks!!"}
{"text":"It is nothing special, I'm sad to say. I think they the two times I've had Firehouse Subs, both times I was left wanting more flavor and less greasy/oily after taste."}
{"text":"I come here often because its great for lunch and they're usually quick. The workers are always nice and happy to greet you. There's a lot to choose from so everyone can have something they like. My favorite location hands down"}
{"text":"Fuckin good sub Subway can suck it Jersey Mikes, we still cool But this place is top fuckin tier."}
{"text":"Cute inside. Had the italian...it was good...but not the bestest ever. I would eat it again."}
{"text":"Had a 3 sandwich order. They got 2/3 right. They accidently gave me pastrami instead of roast beef"}
{"text":"Amazing service Everytime we come here, I never have a problem . I got a brisket sub omg amazing!"}
{"text":"Kinda bummed. I'm pretty sure my brisket is not brisket. I had a brisket sandwich last night that was amazing drove to three locations to get one today and is its not even close to the other Firehouse subs. How does that happen? Bummed.    I am not thrilled with the response. From my post either"}
{"text":"I ordered one of their \"Hot Specialty Subs\", the \"Turkey Bacon Ranch\" for $11 with tax (no drinks or chips included at that price).  I did ask for oil, but it had so much oil that the bread was as soggy as under-cooked french toast and the oil had soaked through the carry out bag.  The meat in the sandwich had no texture at all ... the two small slices of bacon were nearly paper thin and where not cooked enough to have any color or crispness.  The cheese was melted, but the bread had not been toasted or was never fully cooked to begin with.  Even swimming in oil, fully cooked bread should not become liquefied.  My wife did like her cheese steak sub, but I would never risk going back."}
{"text":"Over priced, low quality food. I will not be visiting a Firehouse Subs location again as long as there is a Subway or Quizno's close by. Frankly, I'd rather get something from the grocery store deli counter."}
{"text":"Amazing job you guys you have great customer service by greeting and  assuring  everyone knows how y'all roll  thank you for your donations to the firehouses  I'm happy to see the community restaurants helping and donating to our services keep up the hard work"}
{"text":"Visited Firehouse Subs on a recent trip to Cleveland. I hadn't been to a Firehouse in years -- they are scarce in my neck of the woods -- and I was craving on of their Italian subs. As soon as I entered the door, I was taken aback at the size of the dining room. IT WAS HUGE. Every Firehouse i've been to is usually a skinny little joint, with a few chairs lining the walls.  The woman who took my order was so pleasant and nice. It was very refreshing. They even offered my little one a plastic firehat to take home.  The food: solid. The price: affordable. The size of a medium soda is like a watering hole trough. And they have one of those fancy mix-as-you-wish Coke machines, boasting 120 flavor combinations. oh boy.  I recommend for a quick lunch break. Oh ya - I can't forget to mention their array of hot sauces and BBQ sauces. Nice touch. This place beats the pants of Subway. Sorry, subway."}
{"text":"Heard about this place in the States always wanted to try it, but didn't want to go out of my way to do so. So after finishing shopping at Vaughan mills, fellow yelpers rated this place pretty high so we gave it a shot. Price wise they're a notch higher than subway but no comparison in quality. The subs are melt in your mouth and delicious.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The staff here is very attentive! The place is clean, not rowdy, always busy, and quick with their service."}
{"text":"Takes forever. Saw them mess up a couple peoples orders before mine came out. Staff is friendly enough but tables and floor are sticky. The sandwiches are good though, whenever I order here it's always the same good quality."}
{"text":"Food cold Shortstaffed lots of people standing around not happy with the employees not to nice been to a lot of fire house subs an they have been good an the customer service was great not at this one will not be back port of subs here we come sorry firehouse sub Joseph the employee making the sandwiches was not too friendly"}
{"text":"First time at Firehouse. Great and friendly service. Got the Turkey Cranberry, was a very good sandwich. Service was very friendly and quick. Would definitely go back for a quick and cheap lunch."}
{"text":"I saw this pop up down the street, read the reviews, and headed there today. This is my new \"go-to\" spot for subs. Atmosphere  feels so upbeat and there were friendly sandwich makers eager to explain the options.  Lots of firehouse references and decor. The sandwich I had was \"the Italian but I will try others. I mentioned I had been there to several friends today and they all have it a big thumbs up as well. So happy to have this shop in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I love this place. One of the best sandwich shops that I have ever been too... Yummy"}
{"text":"Subs are good.  Reason I gave a 3 star is because I feel the customer service and time can step it up.  Second time I have been here and both times they are very slow at making the subs.    Tonight I walked in and order 3 subs.  I am the only customer in the joint.  4 employees working.  I place my order.  After I place my order, the cashier goes and sweeps,one gal starts to make the subs, another employee is cleaning the counter along the back wall and another is doing something else.  One would think that maybe another employee would stop what they were doing to help make 3 subs.  Nope, left it up to the girl and she was very slow.  A few other people walk in and order and then another employee starts on their subs.  Mind you, my order is still not complete.  I think I will stick with Subway next time.  More options, less expensive. Faster service and it still fills me up."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite now out of any sandwich store I have ever been. You can select size of small, medium and large. Small is good size for kids, medium is just a bit bigger than subway's 6 inch sub. Staffs are friendly and nice which is great!"}
{"text":"Always super service, friendly greeting when you arrive and now they have added cherry lime to their drink line up with actual fresh limes to squeeze in!"}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit and I don't think I've ever been disappointed. Good Service, not perfect but they will try and make up for it if they screw up. I love the subs. I take the kids there every now and again and have them split a sub since they don't eat that much so I get a real good value and a great meal.  I love their theme and what they stand for.  I also like it when you walk in and they yell WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Waited 30 minutes for a sandwich and salad. Salad came first and the chicken was FROZEN!!! There was another couple before us and the restaurant was pretty dead when we showed up. Kids making sandwiches didn't care. Restaurant was FILTHY. A 3rd kid eventually showed up and put on gloves only to touch doors, walk in the back and walked up front to make a sandwich using the same gloves. TRYING TO GET PEOPLE SICK? Way to go Max, at least try. I asked why the restaurant was so filthy and he said they were busy. There wasn't anyone there and All Max did was walk into the back. No one came to clean the food on the tables and the food on the floors. Called corporate to let them know...this restaurant is privately owned. Left my number for the owner to call me, no follow through. Great way to support our firefighters!"}
{"text":"Best meatball sandwich I have ever had.  Not too spicy and great flavor, fresh bread.  Looking forward to having another one.  YUM"}
{"text":"This place is for you if you want to spend alot. And like people to yell at you when you walk in and yelling out in the middle of your order and oh and more yelling while you eat at ALL the new people coming in. Also you must eat Immediately!!   I can't stress this enough, if you can eat it before you get it... or it will be soggy...lol.  I REALLY wanted to like it but i just can't. In their defense this was only 2 days after opening...soooo I hope this helps."}
{"text":"Walked into an empty store with a two sandwich order to go and waited 20 minutes. 4 workers and only 1 making sandwiches, slowly. Asked for no mayo and when I got home the sandwich was full of mayo."}
{"text":"Had my first visit to a Firehouse Sub today. They mailed me a coupon for a free sub when they opened this location. I had the prime rib sub on wheat. While the place might be a little pricey for a daily lunch (combos average just under $10) the food is excellent and the staff was great. Will be coming in the near future!"}
{"text":"Great subs! The large ones are VERY filling and the meat is noticeably better than those at other sub joints.  The decor/style is top-notch. The place was clean, very modern and new 'Freestyle' Coke soda machine was fun to play with.  I grabbed The 'Engineer' sub and my friend chose the 'Club on a Sub.' We both enjoyed our meal and left full. Neither of us tried their range of hot sauces, something we'll have to do next time.  On a final note, the staff and management were very friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"My first and last time eating at Firehouse Subs. They left the stems on the cherry peppers and the pickles!  Yuck! I was chewing on hard fibers!  I had to spit it out. Who wants to finish eating a sandwich once they start finding that? One cannot enjoy the rest of a meal. Firehouse Subs has lost a customer!"}
{"text":"Hard to beat a pretty decent meal for 2 adults and 2 kids for under $20 Good subs, kids friendly and good location. Good option for sunday's lunch!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a delicious meatball sub.  The person working was friendly and helpful and I was extremely appreciative since it was my first time there. =)"}
{"text":"We love Firehouse but our experience was less then last night. I waited a long time long time for my food and it was wrong. Kinda upsetting. I asked for mayo not to be put on there was. And they took off stuff that is usually on. They two guys were a little confused about orders speaking among there selves about it . 1 person was out there most of the time I was there and he had alot to do to much! Horrible food tonight . Won't be back to our favorite sandwich place!"}
{"text":"Have ordered online here for pick up numerous times and it is never ready (not once) at the time promised. I think they ignore online orders because they never have ours ready (2 items) and don't begin to make them until we have arrived. Also, they do not prioritize our order although it's already technically late. Kind of defeats the purpose of the online order..."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Get the Italian sub, OMG, it's delicious. Make sure to join their rewards program. They will ask you to round up to the next dollar for our firemen, do it!"}
{"text":"A fan of Firehouse Subs, and I usually go to the one in Arcadia, so it was disappointing the one in Tempe was soooooo slow considering I was one of 4 people who has ordered. Fast-casual, not fast, but still good subs."}
{"text":"Went here when my dad was visiting from Nebraska on a recommendation and wow, we were both amazed at how good the subs are. They are so much tastier than most other subs we have had and the soda machine was awesome..will be back"}
{"text":"I ate firehouse last week for first time and got a new York steamer sub and it was absolutely amazing.  Best sub I've ever had and highly recommend this sub place to anyone"}
{"text":"I tried this place out on the recommendations of the Chandler Fire people I work with, since they offered a free sub on your birthday, and yesterday was my birthday. I tried the Engineer, which is smoked turkey with grilled mushrooms. It was good, but a little small for an almost $7 sandwich. I had the medium and it was only slightly larger than a hot dog bun, but the ingredients were fresh and good. The service was a little slow considering they had 7 people behind the counter, and a manger greeting people. I took more than10 minutes to get my sandwich, and since I was in line for 5 minutes that doesn't leave much time to eat if you're on a half hour lunch break."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have been to Firehouse Subs. These subs are so good. I figured it would be just like Subway. Boy was I wrong!  I'm sorry I hadn't tried them sooner. This particular location is clean and the staff is so friendly, consistently."}
{"text":"Great sub choices, the bread had a flavor like my grandma's , I chose the Italian and the meat was moist and delicious. Chicken noodle soup was flavorful and in all, we will come back. Plenty of meat , cheeses, etc not sparse like other sub companies.  Service was great, friendly, welcoming."}
{"text":"This is NOT your typical fast food sub shop! I stopped in during a busy lunch hour and still had a great experience and got a great hot sub. Every time someone walked inn he door, all the employees behind the counter called out \"Welcome to Firehouse!\"  And before I left with. My takeout order a few of them called out telling me to have a great day. I love this place. I'll remember the experience, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE! We ordered 2 subs @ 4:31. The joint WAS NOT BUSY at all. After 25 min of waiting my husband went to the counter to ask about our food (he went because he knew I would chew them out!) 30 min later we got our sandwiches:("}
{"text":"Top service! Everyone was friendly and patient with us. Had never been to a firehouse subs before, would recommend to everyone. Great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"My very first time to eat subs besides subway. This sub was way to yummy than other subs. I'm pretty sure I'll go back to this subs resto again love their subs...Place is nice and clean with nice staff..."}
{"text":"Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket is amazing. The service was excellent. Only issue was no Military discount. We got Medical Monday free Combos so that helped get me off the edge. Great meal, food value and you have to play with the Coke machine"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Firehouse chain.  I am a whore for corned beef, and most that I have had from the various locations is tender and not stringy.  Located at the corner of South Blvd and Woodlawn, in the same shopping center as Home Depot, be on the lookout for this small shop or you may pass it.   My NY Steamer (corned beef and pastrami with cheese, mayo, mustard and italian dressing) hit the spot.  Eaten with their Cherry Limeade and a bag of the new Ruffles Ultimate Sweet & Smoky chips, I enjoyed my meal.  I also purchased a limited run S'mores brownie.  It was okay, though dense and a little dry.   Firehouse costs a bit more than their sub competitors, and take a bit longer to receive, but it is a delicious change from boring.  Their hot subs are tender and juicy, served hot and delicious.  Firehouse also has online ordering now for various locations, including this one - so if you are in a rush, or need a big order, utilize the Online Ordering via their website.   Good stuff, I have been coming here for years and will definitely return."}
{"text":"LOVE the hot, steaming subs from Firehouse.  My favorite is the New York Steamer (I hang out with degenerates, so that sounds like it belongs on Urban Dictionary for some reason), which is corned beef brisket, pastrami, melted provolone, mustard, mayo, and Italian dressing (hold the mustard).  Delicious!  The bread is warm and soft and the meat is always very good - not stringy or dry like some places.    Served with a pickle,there is also a good selection of chips to go along with your sub and a few choices of cookies and brownies for sweets.  A good amount of seating inside and there are some tables outside as well to enjoy the warmer weather.    They have added the new touch-screen fountain drink machine where you can custom design your beverage of choice.  Being over 16 and not good with the technology, it was a bit overwhelming to me, but the Cherry Coke that I was able to order was quite good.    Every time I have visited, the food has been consistently good.  Sometimes the wait seems inordinately long for just assembling a sub, but you can't argue with the end result."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent Firehouse Subs whenever we see them. The sandwiches are made to order, heated and brought to your table. We love the concept and the always friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best subs in Durham Region! Walked into a very friendly atmosphere and warm welcome from the staff. Cashier taking my order was very helpful and knowledgeable and walked us thru the menu and her favourites!  Ordered the beef & cheddar brisket and it was to die for! So fresh and delicious!  Also learned about their \"round-up\" concept which is totally amazing.....they ask customers to round up their order to the next dollar and they donate this money to support first responders in the local area! Love that this business is so dedicated to giving back to the local community!  If you live in the Whitby area or are visiting this place is a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sub stop in town!!! Every team member from the moment you walk in the door, treats you with kindness and a smile. I'm truly impressed with the customer service here! Shannon the GM is more than amazing! She goes above and beyond to make you feel extra special! You can definitely see how passionate she is about her store and that reflects on her team as well! I wished there were more people like her in this line of business!"}
{"text":"Love love love this location and firehouse in general! I usually end up getting the Italian on wheat, I've had many Italians in the past but this by far is the best! The meat is cooked perfectly, sliced thin and with the best dressings included! Price wise this is fairly affordable for a lot of food it can be pricey for some people, but you really are getting some good quality ingredients, I usually round up to donate to the firefighters anyways! The location is quite clean and organized, the employees are always excellent as they greet you and make sure they get your orders correct. I've never had any issues with my sandwich coming out slow or soggy, they've always brought it out in q quick timely manner. If you haven't gone here go ahead and try it there's bound to be something you like!"}
{"text":"Friendly service (they greet you as soon as you walk in) and the bread the subs come on are delicious and even more delicious toasted! I would recommend the grilled chicken or the philly cheese steak sub. :)"}
{"text":"We loved it here! They're super friendly. While we were eating the girls came up to our table like 3 times to see how we were doing and if we needed anything.. I did think  their sandwiches looked a little smaller than the location we used to go to before... But it was still a nice little quick dinner stop experience :)"}
{"text":"Firehouse subs are by far my most favorite subs! When I walked in to this firehouse sub today I completely lost my appetite! This place was so filthy as if nobody cleaned in a whole week and I was shocked because there were around seven women that were working there and it was that dirty? I don't think I will be coming back to this place because of its uncleanness and on top of that they messed up my order."}
{"text":"Maybe I went on an off day but I was not happy with my sub. I think I ordered an Italian Sub. What I got was a soggy sub which I didn't even finish half of it. I have heard people rave about this place but I don't see it.  If you are in Chandler and you are craving a deli sandwich just go to Jason's Deli. I'm not saying they are great (almost no sandwich shops are) but that's your best bet unless you really want to feel like you could have made your meal at home, which happens at Jason's Deli too..."}
{"text":"Getting my firehouse Hero fix ... With special sauce ... And you can buy sauce to take home I am a fan and the staff is efficient !!! i'm for sure a regular here ... Dukedom here I come :)"}
{"text":"I really loved the theme of this restaurant!  The floor plan is good, its very clean and the staff was great!  However, the subs were just ok and on the small side.  I could only order a salad because Im gluten intolerant. They should offer gf bread for an up charge..pretty simple solution.  Anyways, my salad was small too.  It would not cost that much to put more lettuce in there!  I probably wont go back unless they literally beef up th samwiches!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I walked in and the place was totally empty, which is not -usually- a good sign. I ordered a turkey sub with veggies, no onion, no mayo, cherry peppers and mustard.  Turkey slices= maybeeeee 1. Lettuce?non existent. Oozing mayo, no cherry peppers, no mustard.And it was given to me -toasted-[mmmmm toasty warm oozing mayo, yum yum not]. the whole thing was just awful."}
{"text":"Finally a hot Sandwhich place that doesn't suck.  All my favorite hot Sandwhich places are gone now or have lost their shine. I love firehouse so glad we finally got one here! The kids who work there are all very nice and it is always clean."}
{"text":"I would give a lower review if it wasn't for the amazing food. When I walked in, there were no customers inside, just employees. Three of them were behind the counter and not one of them greeted me. When I walked to the counter I thought I'd start my timer and see how long it would take for someone to say something to me. A girl named Erica stood behind the register starring off into space and was doodling on a post-it note for a solid 6 min and 24 seconds. The silence was broken by a man that came in and jumped ahead of me to order. She abruptly looked at me and said \"are you ready?\" I kind of chuckled as I said \"hmm, was wondering when someone would say something to me..\" Not only that but I asked for the number 5 and she proceeded to ask me 3 times if I wanted the combo...? I'll probably try another location next time due to the lack of customer service and hospitality of the employees."}
{"text":"Dear Engineer sub,  How and why are you so delicious? With your freshly steamed bun, gooey cheese, crisp veggies, tender turkey meat, all topped with perfectly sautéed mushrooms... It's not even fair for the competition.   Subway, port of subs, Quiznos and earl of sandwiches, you are all in trouble."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was really excited when he saw Firehouse Subs so of course we went in for lunch one day. It was a firefighter theme because duh, it was founded by firemen.   Their sandwiches are delicious and flavorful however it was a little on the expensive side. Two combos (chips and a pretty big sized drink included) can run you up to $20. So about $8 a combo plus tax!?! Yeah.....=/ in this economy...hmm. Speaking of drinks, we LOVED the soda machine where you can mix and match your favorite soda to your favorite syrup. This is probably one of the few places I can get my Vanilla Coke. =) Mmmm yumm!!!!!  But I do believe the saying, \"you get what you paid for.\" $$=good sandwiches. It definitely beats Subway on the tastebud side but Firehouse Subs is not for heath-conscious folks. After you eat your sandwich, make sure you keep active the rest of your day. Cuz these sandwiches rank up some pretty big numbers in calories I'm sure."}
{"text":"I've gone,to 2 Firehouse Subs awesome I tried this one here 3 times  on Lake Mead it's the worst no matter how simple the order they screw it up  either they have no clue  here ! Firehouse Subs .     NOT on Lake Mead..... they could screw up a,2 car parade on any given Sunday."}
{"text":"I don't understand why it's so difficult for the staff here to comprehend a cold, no sautés, veggie sandwich. If they would just listen they'd realize what I'm asking is so simple and takes less steps to make. The cashier and young girl making the sandwiches both gave me major attitude. The staff is young here, like a previous review stated, but that's no excuse for being rude to customers. Our sandwiches were good (first time they made them wrong) but ordering is such a hassle that I only come here when I've got the time and now I'm considering not even coming back at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here weekly, from across town, for over a year. We obviously really love the sandwiches but......the service is terrible! We are both vegetarians and ordering is a huge deal each and every time. We constantly have to repeat ourselves over and over to the unfriendly staff regarding our order. We order the same thing every time we go there and all that is different is cold, no meat and more veggies. Apparently, if your ordering from right off the menu everything is cool, but if you want substitutions or extras, it's a HUGE fiasco (which they aren't shy about showing, especially the female owner).  We aren't expecting perfection or a parade every time we walk in, but a little patience and recognition would be nice. Their sandwiches are fantastic but with all the choices available in Las Vegas and the poor economy, good customer service is a must. Remembering your loyal repeat customers and making what they want, how they want it, should be a priority."}
{"text":"I had several people tell me they really love Firehouse subs so I went to check it  out. The sandwiches my son and I got were decent. Nothing special, nothing really flavorful, Just OK. As mentioned in other reviews, the moral and employees are just there. They have zero personality. I don't care to have any real conversation with the person ringing me up or making my sandwich but when you are trying to be a better alternative than Subway, Port of Subs, Quiznos, try to at least fake that you want to be there.   I liked that they have a big selection of different hot sauces. That was a plus, too bad I had to add plenty to make my sandwich have more flavor. I don't drink soda all that often but they have one of those build your own coke machines and that is also a nice addition to Firehouse Subs.   If the sandwiches had better and or more flavor it would help this place stand out more. With no personality service and just Decent sandwiches, I found it very forgettable and have no desire to try it again."}
{"text":"Have been to this Firehouse in Surprise for lunch and dinner several times since they've open. The subs are very delicious but I love the fresh salads even more. I never leave without a brownie for dessert.  Great experience overall on all my visits."}
{"text":"It has to be this area.  I can only hope that is the reason why businesses here are always underperforming.  This has happened so many times with this particular location that I have to believe it's the area.  I placed my order online.  3 sandwiches: some with additional ingredients; some with removal of ingredients; none of them correct, although the receipt was correct and a review of the online order showed it correctly too.  Thankfully, at least, the one item that absolutely couldn't be on one of the sandwiches because of a severe allergy (that could be deadly) was actually omitted as requested.  There is a Subway nearby that messes up much less than this...  It has to be this area.  The young men behind the counter making the sandwiches were more interested in the really loud television and chatting with one another.  They were obviously distracted and disinterested in doing their jon to the best of their abilities.  The last time this happened, I didn't call and complain or anything.  But having something wrong the last 4 times you buy, the 5th time is too much.  I'm not sure why it's proven so difficult for them to figure out online orders, but even orders taken in person have been botched.  We like the food when it's what we asked for, but don't waste your time with this location.  We won't anymore."}
{"text":"Very clean when entering the store, welcoming atmosphere.  Staff welcomed us as we entered the store and was very knowledgeable and helpful in making decisions.  Food was very fresh, was visually appealing and tasted fantastic!"}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed and saw it after going to the drivers license center so I'd figure i give it a try. I had the sriracha roast beef sub and it was a 10/10. Best sandwich I ever had. It crushes wAwa and sheetz combined."}
{"text":"Every sandwich I have had here is fantastic ! Really good food . I took a star because it is very pricey for a sub place"}
{"text":"Ordered pickup, two subs. Both were wrong. I called once home and was advised by the shift manager the online order was \"confusing\" and nothing would be done to make the situation right due to \"online ordering.\"  The online ordering system is quite clear. Specifying to omit one ingredient on one sub and specifying to replace an ingredient with another hardly seems \"confusing\", but if there's any confusion, I suppose that's why a phone number is provided to reach me, or perhaps they could have cleared the confusion in person when the subs were picked up.  Will never order/visit again."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse sandwiches! They are steamed so the bread isn't hard and crunchy cutting the inside of your mouth but they are hot and yummy. My favorite is the engineer. I like that they have a wide variety of hot sauces to put on your sandwich too."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty sandwiches and much better then Subway. Great service, super polite employees. I knocked off a star because I thought it was a tad pricey"}
{"text":"Well, I would definitely have to agree with the 2.5 star rating for Firehouse. Not only is it pricey, but it's just bland. I had a tuna salad which was nothing to write home about, and my family was left unimpressed with their subs. On the plus side, the restaurant is clean and the theme of the decor is neat."}
{"text":"I've been told that Firehouse subs are delicious.  Finally got around to trying out their meatball sub, a sub they are supposed to be known for. I'd have to say it was one of the best I've ever had. It was loaded and even looked delicious."}
{"text":"Firehouse is a great lunch spot. The staff are very friendly and attentive. They are super kid friendly. This is our favorite lunch place."}
{"text":"Sad to say, but among the many sandwich shops around, Firehouse is mediocre for a number of reasons.  Their meats, smoked as they are, just do not stand out.  The degree of smokiness is not even that noticeable.  Going to a BBQ place as Modern Smoke or 521 BBQ will give you smokey brisket.  And overall the sandwiches are nothing that special.  The staff preparing the sandwiches is really disorganized and slow.  Even at off-peak times you have to wait quite awhile and at peak times you might not have the time, with a short lunch break to get your order quickly.  Cute theme, but falls down on service and so-so offerings."}
{"text":"Clean, great staff good subs, even better that it right beside Starbucks. They also now take Apple Pay."}
{"text":"My friends recently had Firehouse subs cater a get together for them.  It had been years since I had their sandwiches and they were good.  It was nice to see that almost all of their subs are soy allergen friendly.  The sandwiches are very fresh and I like the steamed buns.  Most full size subs are about $8 and much larger than Jersey Mike's comparably priced subs.  I also like the spicy mustard on the sandwich and the dill pickled on the side."}
{"text":"The crew needs to get some tip jars cuz they go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. Thanks guys oh and gals , well mostly gals lol"}
{"text":"Call me crazy , but best fresh late night sandwich . Bread down to the onions just as fresh as 12 noon . 8:49pm"}
{"text":"Surprise, surprise there is a Firehouse sub shop in Las Vegas! This is my first time coming here, but word on an eastcoaster's street is that it is a legit sub, so why not?  I shared a large \"Engineer\" with smoked turkey breast, melted swiss, sautéed mushrooms, and the regular stuff. Good, sure, but didn't fufill all it's reputation-glory. The soda fountain was cool. You choose your brand, then you choose your flavor.   What I liked was that I shared a large sandwich, but there were slight differences. I like onions and mustard, he does not. They easily accommodated so that both of our side of the wich was to our liking and choosing."}
{"text":"Love firehouse Subs! Been going there since there grand opening! Went yesterday to get my Free Birthday sub! Had the new Sweet Thai chili pork Sub, a new favorite of mine. Jenifer made my sub with sauce on the side, for the reason in the past when I had it to go and got home the sauce was all on the outside and made bread soggy. Thanks Jenifer for a perfect meal on the go! And your sweet smile and great attitude while working!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Hey, did you know this place was started by firemen? Well, if you didn't, you're an idiot, because it's plastered all over nearly everything.  My sandwich was decent. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good. Before I went, I wondered what their gimmick would be. Besides the firefighter thing, I mean. It turns out their gimmick is steaming their sandwich meat.  Now, I'm no expert, but in my experience with culinary parlance, \"steaming\" ranks somewhere below \"slow-roasted\", \"braised\", or \"thinly-sliced\" and somewhere slightly above \"microwaved\". I'm open-minded, though. I'd try this uniquely steamed meat. It turns out, I COULD tell the difference. The difference was the meat was warm and wet, almost like it had absorbed a bunch of vaporized air.  What makes Firehouse Subs stand out is their bread, which was really, really good. It was better than Jimmy John's bread, in fact. But between the steaming, the onslaught of fire-fighting paraphernalia, the longer wait, and the higher cost at Firehouse Subs, I'll take Jimmy John's every time. And it's only slightly farther away. I'm down with supporting heroes, but I'd also like to eat reasonably-priced, un-steamed sandwiches on occasion."}
{"text":"I'll go here occasionally for lunch and really like the beef and brisket sandwich.    Service tends to take just a tad on the long side for a sandwich, which is surprising since the place tends to be pretty low key."}
{"text":"Much better then Subway , IMO. The few times I have been here it hasn't been busy so hopefully they will stay in business. They seem to take longer then usual to make sandwiches but not too bad. This place is always clean and I am always greeted by all of the employees when I walk in. They have the high tech soda machines where you can add flavoring which is awesome. Two thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"6 pm on a Friday in Vegas. 108 outside. The air must have been set at 90. No blinds on the windows, no shade to sit in. Seriously?!?! Workers were awesome. Too bad the temperature made the whole place rank and uncomfortable. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Welcome to Firehouse!!  I hate to admit it but I like Subway, I go there often during lunch but when the boss is paying, you go where he wants. So a couple months ago he suggested we stop here for lunch. Ehhhh, I don't really like trying new foods. Besides hiring me, this was the best decision he has ever had!  I ordered the Capt. Sorensen's Datil Pepper Grilled Chicken and fell instantly in love. They claim it's under 500 calories but I think that's a lie, it takes way tooooo good.   I've been here more than subway in the past few months and I'm happy to say, I love this place. I also love that you have Mellow Yellow, no one ever has that anymore.   I can't comment on any other sandwich since I refuse to try anything different. I crave this sandwich."}
{"text":"First time to Firehouse subs of any kind. Was met by the owner Avril Tatum. She personally walked me through the whole process and explained all the sandwiches i asked about. The subs were very good and all the staff friendly. I will be coming back. PS They have an amazing hot sauce collection. Something for everyone. Even Dave's Insanity. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Great subs and friendly service . Lots of hot and spice sauces to add as well. Go for the \"real\" subs , not the low calorie ones, the difference is big in flavor and taste !"}
{"text":"No star review terrible customer service ever!!! Worst experience ever. I ate there like 4 days in a row and every time the serive was worst than the last. Rude, unprofessional, and disrespectful employees. Owners must not care at all."}
{"text":"Very good subs! Been here twice and so far it has been great! Staff were very friendly.  items ordered- meatballs sub hero subway  Both very tasty. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches.  We have been looking for an old fashioned sub. We found one.  We ate in and had fast and friendly service.  We will go back."}
{"text":"I really like the food at Firehouse but the last 3 times at this location the service has been horrible Isreal took my order but when he cam to the registered was frowning and acted like he was mad I came in. I had to wait so long you would think they had to make the meatballs from scratch this location had an incredible number of flys  I don't think I will go to this location anymore which is unfortunate as it is the only location close to me."}
{"text":"this place was horrible, way over priced , small portions,  they are stingey on the meat. im from the east coast and ive only found one good sandwich place so far in az but its in scottsdale.. so i keep trying places closer to where i live only to be horribly disappointed each time.. also the other bizarre thing ive never seen anywhere elseexcept at firehouse subs was the rolls for the hoagies come in 6 or 8 inches or 8 or 10 inches depending on which sandwich you get.. mine was 6 inches and the bread was as thin as a baguette, my husband got 8 inches and it was bigger like a hoagie roll. mine sandwich cost more than his though?? my kids got a kids meal there sandwich was 2 inches smaller than mine.. wth??? also the counters were so tall i couldn't read the bottom of the menu on the wall and im 5'7\".."}
{"text":"I don't have to have it again. The sandwiches are JUST OK. I like the way we're greeted when we came in and I love the fountain drink machine but that's about it. The meat taste as if it came from Frys grocery. The bread was OK. Definitely get condiments. You'll need it."}
{"text":"Delicious subs! Good portions and fresh. The employees are really what makes this a five star place. Always friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Firehouse just didn't do it for me... Stopped in for lunch at this Firehouse Subs after spending the morning getting to know Charlotte. The place was pretty busy, as it was during the peak lunch hour. I was in the mood for a salad, and since there was only one on the menu, my choice was made for me. I got to pick the protein though. I chose the tuna salad. The boyfriend got the hook & ladder combo (cute). We were both amused by the large selection of hot sauces that were available (we both LOVE spicy food & hot sauce). I was largely underwhelmed with the salad, which consisted of large leafs of lettuce, a few thick bell pepper slices and a large wedges of tomato. It was topped with three sizable scoops of tuna salad and provolone cheese slices. I just wasn't psyched on the salad at all. Yes, I know I'm at a sub shop ordering a salad, but it really isn't that hard to throw a decent salad together. The boyfriend said his sub was meh. I personally prefer Which Wich."}
{"text":"I would normally give this 5 stars but today I stood in line for 10 mins while the cashier took a telephone order. At least offer something for free... Dang."}
{"text":"Great service amazing employees doing an excellent job the management is superbly professional and I will most indubitably eat here again"}
{"text":"Since this shop as been open, I don't need to repeat my order compare to the other stores I visit. It's a small space so the tables are close but hey it's kewl"}
{"text":"Always on the target! Very friendly people and the quality is spot on. Only thing I dislike is that the cashier can't listen, I always speak clear and nice pace my order; ie: small wheat meatball, no combo but a small drink for here\" - here is where I dislike people that can't listen -- \"what type of bread? You want a combo and you dining in?\" REALLY!?!?! Otherwise, I love your food!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!!!  My favorite is the Engineer.  Who doesn't like hot turkey and roast beef.............................. WOW"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I am so glad we have a Firehouse Subs in the San Tan Village area.  The staff here treats me like family, as they know my name when I walk in!  I have tried nearly all the subs on the menu and by far my favorite is the New York Steamer.  Fresh meats, soft bread, served hot.  I've tried the salad and it was very good as well."}
{"text":"I order the Engineer sub every single time and it never fails me. Definitely the best turkey sub in Vegas (A must try for anyone who likes turkey) As soon as you walk in, the employees welcome you and they are as nice as can be. The environment is clean and friendly. It was definitely worth the half hour run here."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. The subs are pretty good, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The staff here is so friendly! Made our experience even better. Our sandwiches looked picture perfect. Will definitely come here more often for lunch!"}
{"text":"Went here for my first time last week, and it's definitely the best place for subs!  I've been hearing about it for weeks; friends and family simply rave non-stop about it.  I figured it must be good, and I was sick of people begging me to go.  It's not much more than Subway, but it tastes sooo much better, and you get a lot more for your money.  I can't wait to take my husband here."}
{"text":"Took my daughter there today as it was my birthday and you get a free medium sub. One word. WOW. That was probable one of the best meals I have had in a while, and the best sub I've had since we moved here 10 years ago.    Also met the owner who was very pleasant and the entire place was VERY clean, a nice change from some other establishments who don't seem to care.   I will definetly come again and recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful and the food was great ! Awesome place to bring the family for a meal."}
{"text":"Tasty hot sandwiches here and friendly staff. I feel the quality has gone down the last couple times I visited, but still satisfied."}
{"text":"9/19/16 First time in life trying Firehouse subs. I do like that they offer a smaller menu for those of us who don't want to wolf down an entire sub.   I ordered the Cranberry and Turkey, hold the mayo, it was way too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll tell them to only do a small amount of cranberry because it was too intense for my taste."}
{"text":"Started eating at this chain the past few weeks, and I am very impressed with the quality of the food.  The Turkey Bacon Ranch sandwich and the BBQ Cheddar Brisket Sandwich are delicious!!!!!  They apparently just raised their pricing, but for still about $10 you can get a regular size sandwich, a medium fountain drink, and a bag of chips.  I have been to a few other locations, but I am ranking this one because I was impressed that when I went here, 2 days in a row, the young lady, Audra, working the register remembered me and my name from the day before.  She also offered me a punch card so I can get a free meal after I get 10 punches.  The other staff in the dining room are friendly when they deliver my order and I like the Coca Cola machine that has all the different sodas...I am a big Dr. Pepper fan so I am glad they offer that.  There is also a TV in the dining room so you can watch that while you dine and enjoy your meal.  Great job Firehouse Subs!  I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"friendly staff. The place is clean and there are tons of hot sauce if you're a fan of spicy. I'm giving it 3 stars though because it is a little pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is great if you have an hour lunch break and you want to sit down and have a nice hot sub for lunch. Around lunch time, this place can get kinda packed so I wouldn't necessary call it a quick-grab-and-go kinda place.   My favorite sandwich  is the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket with BBQ sauce. It's so good, it almost taste like real southern BBQ. With all the sandwiches you can get a combo with a drink and a bag of chips. The subs come in two sizes, the medium and the large. Almost equivalent to a 6inch and a foot long. You won't be able to get enough!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing subs. The bread has a crunchy crust but a soft and moist inside. They have a wide variety of drinks since they have that coca cola machine that holds different kinds of drinks. Their best drink is their cherry limeade hands down. Workers are friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"I have liked every sub I've had there with the exception of one. Pretty good odds!"}
{"text":"GROSS HAIR FOUND IN SUB! We eat at firehouse subs several times a year and think it's good but this ruined it for my wife.  She took a bite and pulled out a nasty long hair that was entangled in her sub.  GROSS!  When I picked up the subs tonight there were several girls making the sandwiches...you would think firehouse has rules in place to make sure their hair doesn't end up in your food.  It ruined her dinner and  wasted our money.  Thanks firehouse subs."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would!!! So bad, from the time we walked in we were told that they were closing in a few minutes instead of greeting us like they should have. I hope that the money I payed for this garbage went to help some fire station, it was certainly not worth the money I spent in there!!! Awful!!!! Not ever again!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this sub shop.  Right when you walk in, the staff is super friendly.  While I am not a fan of hot subs, they accommodated making my sub cold.  The bread and meat were both fresh.  The kid's meals are a good value.  We will definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"Gosh the selection of hot sauces here makes this my favorite sub shop. I love the Poison sauce. Good prices, delicious food. Try it if you haven't already!!"}
{"text":"It's a good sandwich which are typically surged warm.  I think they quickly steam the meat and cheese and then assemble the sandwich.  Not the best but good."}
{"text":"Ok so I finally decided to do this review after going here for the second time. Based on the 4 and 5 star reviews, I was thinking it should be good. NOT! I was thinking since it had some good reviews, my first experience must of been a fluke. After verifying it wasnt, im sorry to report that I am not impressed.  My first visit I ordered the philly cheesesteak. Should be good right? They didnt mess up. Its just the taste. The meat was dry. The peppers and onions were scarce. If it was not for the spicy barbeque sauce I drenched it with, I would have seriously asked for my money back. I thought maybe I was just having a bad day and that my taste buds were not working properly.   So comes my second visit. It was dinner time about 7 pm. I tried the smokehouse cheddar beef brisket. I had high hopes until I took my first bite. Again the meat was bland and I had to wash it down with their spicy barbeque sauce. I was beginning to wonder why their meat was so dry. When I went up to the counter for more spicy barbeque sauce, I think I found out why their meat was so moistureless. I noticed they store their cooked meat in warmers. Ok now that explains a lot. I figure first thing in the morning the meat should be fresh and flavorful. Thats when I realized my first visit was at lunch time around 11:30.   Service is good. I love their newer style soda machine. Its just the main product does not tickle my fancy even after giving them another chance. Maybe its just this location. Now if I just happen to try another location and its better, then I will definitely do an update. For now I will look into stocking up on their spicy barbeque sauce."}
{"text":"We left here saying we got better service than a 5 star restaurant. I love firehouse sub sandwiches and have been to many locations in Nevada and Arizona. But this location is the best! The staff are extra friendly; delivering food to your table, asking if you need anything while eating, and even coming to clear our baskets. Even had the door held for us by an employee on the way out. Impeccable service. While we were eating, employees were cleaning tables and countertops the whole time. Clean place, great service. This is why we'll go out of our way to eat at this location."}
{"text":"I love the firehouse theme, and like how the restaurant pays tribute to firefighters. The food was just okay to me though. It tasted just a tad bit better than Subway, and it was more expensive than $5 footlongs - so I'd doubt I'll return to Firehouse Subs.  I ordered The Engineer sandwich - packed with turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms. There wasn't many mushrooms in my sandwich :( I really do like the original hot sauce. Definitely add that to any sandwich you try there. Maybe if I had kids I would bring them to this place, the kids meal comes with a complimentary firefighter hat."}
{"text":"Great subs as always! I used to go to another location and was always impressed by the food and service. The servers always greeted you and were kind, however my experience at this location was totally different. No greeting when you came in and all the employees seemed to avoid eye contact with me...weird. But I moved on and proceeded to tell my order to the less than enthusiastic cashier (who also appeared to be the manager). Then when the server brought our food she just left the sandwiches in front of us without a single word...oooookay? However I noticed that when some of the previous guests left, they were accompanied with a \"goodbye! And thank you!\" from the employees, but when my mom and I were leaving, they all pretended not to see us leaving as I said \"thank you!\" aloud. Hmmm. Maybe they didn't hear me, so I said it again and still nothing. Honestly I don't understand why the different treatment, I'm always nice and courteous. And because of this uncomfortable feeling my mom and I had the ENTIRE time I will only give it 2 stars. Really disappointing guys, your subs are amazing but your service SUCKS."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I can't wait to try it. It's my first time, the employees were very helpful and courteous. The place is clean.... I'm very impressed with the Steak & Cheese and will definitely et it again. My husband had the Thai Chili Pork, he said it was satisfactory"}
{"text":"I used to order from here more often but started to resent the high price of sandwiches vs the low level of service. I typically call in on my way home but one thing that bugs me is that although I stand in the \"Online/Pick up Orders Here\" line, I am always treated like I cut in ahead of those trying to decide what they want while I can see my sandwiches sitting waiting. Not very efficient.   They need someone to manage online and phone orders from beginning to end and not expect the one poor girl to manage it all. I called in tonight and put on hold for over 7 minutes -  she told me 'sorry our store is really busy and there's a lot of people ahead of you' -  well then it's 15-20 mins for a SANDWICH really? So I just lost a half hour of my life... and lose the new hefty packaging, and go back to the wrap and roll like JJ."}
{"text":"Pretty simple- guys who made my sandwich tonight didn't give two fucks about my sandwich. I had a long 13 hour day on my feet at the convention. I was way too tired to cook. I had meat and cheese on the outside bottom of my sandwich and the sandwich was so sloppy and soggy that it was impossible and straight up disgusting to eat. I am so fucking hangry right now. These guys spent more time socializing than they did doing their jobs. I'm too tired to go back. Looks like I'll be having cereal for dinner. And whichever guys were working tonight at 9 pm.... fuck you."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at Firehouse Subs in several years but remembered that I really enjoyed their Hook & Ladder so I ordered one up at this location. It was decent but not as good as what I used to get at their Pineville Park Rd location. One obvious difference was that the bread was not as fresh. Service was okay.  Cleanliness was average, as was my overall experience. Just too many better options around to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, quick service! Love the pickle with your sub!"}
{"text":"Great place decent food overall very pleasant experience it's definitely a step up from subway but I highly recommend"}
{"text":"My boys and I stopped here on our way out-of-town (to head back to Vegas).    The staff greeted us as we walked in - I know it sounds like a silly little thing, but it's a VERY nice touch.  They didn't rush us with our orders, but were right there when we were ready.  The food was outstanding! It's everything that one expects from Firehouse Subs. And the restaurant was spotlessly clean.  As we left, the staff said goodbye and wished us a safe trip.  Again, a silly little thing that means a lot."}
{"text":"If your a man, this is your sammich shop!!! Its a bit pricey but it seems like most of the sammich places now a days are. The hubby loves this place. He always get \"The Hero\" which he claims is named after him. I tend to get the same thing at most sammich shops which is a turkey sammich, smoked turkey breast in Firehouses case. I will say that this is a decent sammich. The bread and other ingredients always seem to be fresh. However, its not one of those places that I crave for some reason. Honestly, I think I prefer Jimmy Johns.  Firehouse is not bad though and the atmosphere is cute, kinda like an old firehouse (imagine that!). They also have some good chocolate chip cookies    :)"}
{"text":"There's something wrong at this location. Just one guy working, he did a really good job being on his own and was very friendly as well. People were waiting a really long time and the phones were ringing nonstop. I felt bad for the guy working there. Not going back. $12.00 for a sandwich, out of pastrami and a 20-30 minute wait."}
{"text":"First time here, the bread they use on the sandwiches is amazing. Ordered the veggie, not the best tasting but could tell the ingredients were good quality"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST sandwiches! Our favorites are the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket and the turkey bacon ranch sub. Definitely recommend these two subs! Great service and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Incompetence! That describes my experience here. Placed order via internet. \" Lost my $40 order!\" This is definitely a chain that has gotten to big to remain competent."}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing! I called on a Saturday with an impromptu lunch order for 18 box lunches. Lakeisha, the awesome employee that answered the phone didn't flinch when I said I needed the lunches in an hour.   I arrived an hour later and everything was ready and organized. My HOA volunteers thank you and we'll be back...with more notice next time"}
{"text":"I really like firehouse subs. From the second you walk in and they yell \" WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE!\" You feel like this is the place to eat! My favorite part is the 50 different hot sauces they have to compliment to subs. Choose your hot sauce wisely cause some are HOT!!"}
{"text":"Maybe just rookie errors, but the order was all wrong and the sandwich was mediocre. My turkey club was good but not good enough to justify the premium over a comparable subway. My wife will not come back; had four strikes on her order. For here was delivered as to go. White bread was delivered as wheat. Veggie had scant veggies, cost as much as a meat sandwich, and had unimpressive taste. Otherwise, the servers were nice, but I think the place needs a bit more practice."}
{"text":"First and last time at Firehouse Subs. I had a steak and cheese while my friend had Italian.  We both agreed it was the worst sub we'd ever had.  I know advertising pictures of sandwiches are exaggerated but my pathetic looking sub was ridiculous looking.  In addition, it had no sautéed onions or bell peppers.  My friend went back to buy a tiny bag of potato chips. $1.40!!  We couldn't believe that one.  Overall a very disappointing experience. I guess being the only ones in the place at 5pm should have been a clue."}
{"text":"These subs are incredible. They make their cold cuts fresh everyday and the bread is delicious. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I am a sandwich person ;) I love a good sandwich and I am always up to try a new one. But come on, where have I been? Entering this place, they welcome you \"Welcome to the Firehouse!\" lol I was the only person to order so I approached the cashier, Thiago, and he asked me if I had been there before, which I had not. He went over their store, how they got their start, how each store is unique and how their menu is and works. As I starred at it, I scooted to the side and said the woman behind me could order while I read the board. Then Joshua one of the sandwich makers said, \"Would you like a recommendation?\" So, I said sure and he recommended The New York Steamer and it was delicious! It had corned beef brisket, pastrami, melted provolone, deli mustard, mayo, and Italian dressing. I made it a combo and got a big drink and a bag of chips to go with it. I am a big fan of this place and look forward to visiting their other locations and trying more of their food. Also, when my combo came to 10.22 they asked me if I wanted to make it an even $11 so they could donate that change to first responders so I said okay. I noticed a big check on the wall later for a couple hundred thousand dollars that was donated to a local charity on behalf of this place. I really like this place and I will be back. Also, with precision timing I might add (I am a trained 5-star food server) Gabe came over and checked on me to make sure the sandwich was good and asked me if I needed anything. What a nice crew, lucky ownership of this establishment I'll tell ya! Gabe, Josh and Thiago deserve bonuses! Also, there's a cool painting on the wall so I asked the guys about it and they told me that each location has an original painting, painted onto the wall -- so I look forward to seeing the other ones here in town. This one featured the Rat Pack and had an old-school Vegas theme. Great food, nice workers, and doing good for the community - I am a fan! Lastly, I want to emphasize how much I appreciated Joshua making a sandwich recommendation. I wasn't familiar with the menu, I never seen it before, I wasn't sure what to pick - he picked the perfect sandwich for a new comer, and truly made my visit an easy win. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Wow great customer service! Moneca J. was very welcoming and explained everything with such patience ! The # 6  sandwich I had was great as well."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed two outta the three sandwiches I've tried here.  Club - Good. Beef & Cheddar - Very Good Corn Beef & Pastrami - Nope  I will be back for the Beef & Cheddar. It's insanely good. The chili here is also tasty. It's meaty with no beans, just the way I like it. (kind of reminds me of the one at Jason's Deli) And I especially love the Cherry Limeaid. Yeeeee! No need to go to Sonics!  Service is whatevers. Some of the staff are friendlier than others but nobody I've encountered was rude... so it's all good."}
{"text":"I had no idea Yelp was full of such Sub Aficionados but I was not disappointed with Firehouse. I didn't even know about the steaming versus whatever debate but my sandwich (The Engineer) came with piping hot meat, gooey cheese, crunchy, delightful toppings, all on a delicious toasty roll. It was glorious.  The sandwich actually reminded me of  the Chicken Cordon Blue I used to get at a sub place called Penn Station in Ohio. Man, I loved that sandwich, but Firehouse is a good substitute. Now all I need is Skyline and White Castle and I won't even need to go home anymore!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a sandwich. Food quality is high, much higher than the Yellow and Green chain!  Staff are friendly and really do take to their ambiance.  The hotsauce station is awesome! Food packaging for take out is brilliant, premium and environmentally friendly!  Absolutely recommend to try this joint!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going here and it has ruined all other sub places for me! The Cheddar brisket is so tender and delicious it melts in your mouth. The cashier was very friendly and the rest of the staff were very efficient. I will definitely go back often."}
{"text":"I'm a junk food, fast food junkie.  I admit that.  I was a subway whore for many years.  I don't like my sub toasted, fried or whatever.  Just good bread, good fixings and fast service...  Than a friend took me to a  FireHouse and its been love ever since.  I will drive past the other place, if there is a FH close by...   First -  its not some tiny little storefront with some snot nosed kid behind the counter, waiting to make some sandwich than ring you up...  Nooo..  There is a line of people waiting to get working on making what you ordered.  friendly, smiling and knowledgeable people...   yes, I said smiling people who know what they are doing... Amazing, but true...   I usually go for the Italian, but will settle for an engineer if pressed.  Haven't had a bad sandwich no matter what I have ordered...    All the meat is fresh and steamed.  I didn't know steamed was this tasty!  The soda machine is soo cool, but they need two in each store because people get overwhelmed at the selections that they see to freeze in front of it and takes awhile to select.  Especially if they never encountered the new mix your own drink machine..."}
{"text":"Firehouse is comfort food in that you know what to expect going in.  Its the same, yet different.  They are all nice, clean decor, friendly staff and fast service.    I like its not like the others where you walk a line and have to deal with the \"I don't know what I want\" person in front of you.  Once ordered, it's made and delivered to your table.  I like the wall painting in each one depicts the local neighborhood and the fire house that serves that location.    Each sandwich is fresh, hot and filled with the meats and condiments.  Not too much, not too little...  Great variety..  Being a fast food junkie, this is a nice diversion and I never had a bad experience.  Everyone is friendly and helpful and they are big on being clean!  .."}
{"text":"Went here today to pick up a sandwich for someone, was my first time. I honestly had a great experience everyone was kind and displayed amazing customer service from the cashier who explained the firehouse sub options to the lady who called my name for my sandwich!"}
{"text":"Worst Firehouse subs I've ever eaten at and I have eaten at quite a bit, since I usually enjoy their subs at least twice a week. I've had 2 subs there in the past week, both of which have made me extremely sick to my stomach. Their tomatoes were old but I'm not 100% sure that was it.  To top it off their team members are completely incompetent and do not even know how their own reward system works. The only reason I gave this one star is because they carry funyons and that isn't a thing where I live in ENC."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for 2 salads.  They didn't even warn us when we ordered that it will take a while.  After we ordered I noticed everyone in there was sitting with a drink and bag of chips,  waiting on their sandwich. I knew we were in for a wait.   We did order a small ham and cheese for my son which came out 10 minutes before ours. Not sure how our order got separated but it did.  The sandwich was ok for a child, I would have been mad with the small amount on meat and cheese, but it was a kid.  Our salads weren't the best for the amount of time we waited.  In both salads there was brown lettuce, not just a small piece that got by but enough that makes you think they didn't have any quality control going on.   I went with 2 stars because most of the salad was good. The wait time is horrible for a fast food joint. I think it could have used another person working there to speed things up.  Will I go back, probably but not soon and only out of convenience."}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight. The food was awesome and the service was quick. The staff was friendly. I had not been to Firehouse Subs for n a while but I really enjoyed it. I normally don't eat a lot of beef but the beef brisket sandwich I had was very filling."}
{"text":"The level of service has always been excellent in this establishment until today. A new owner has come in and is attempting to squeeze every dollar from the customer. I have been a long term customer and was given a $2 off coupon some time back for their appreciation and my loyalty. Upon my visit today I presented my coupon and was informed I would not be able too retain the coupon for a future visit. The explanation I was given was customers were abusing the coupons by using them to often. What the? Isn't that the point, create loyal and repeat customers? $2 isn't going to put me in the poor house, it was just a nice gesture for my loyalty. Today was the last time I will visit this sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Love firehouse subs!!!! Got the hook and ladder sandwhich tonight! It was perfect! Hit the spot! Their virginia ham is delicious! Has a great sweetness to it!"}
{"text":"Their subs were super tasty! I loved all the different choices and the atmosphere was nice and calm. I need to come back!"}
{"text":"The Firemen need to put out a few fires of their own!   Today everything was very disappointing. I ordered the Firehouse Steak & Cheese...with mayo and mustard on the side, not a hot mayo fan and I like dipping my mustard.   The sandwich - meat, cheese, and veggies were completely tasteless. No unique flavor at all. The meat was full of grisle and nodules, very low quality meat you can tell. And honestly the photo on the wall showed a sandwich loaded with meat and cheese...not the case.  After a couple of bites, I went up to get some type of sauces to give the sandwich flavor. Decided against it...as the sauce bottles were all horribly dirty...crusted gummy old sauce stuck on the outside, inside and lid/knecks of more than 75% of the bottles. That's just really lazy standards as far as I'm concerned.   Good luck Firehouse, probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"I made a call was placed on hold. I have asked if I could pay over the phone with my card since my hubby left his wallet at home and was hungry, so he could have some launch since he has to work a long day they said they don't take a card over the phone. I worked in retail over 10 years and yes if it a big amount of money I agree but $7 dollars really??? That is a big joke! Definitely will give my business and money to else were."}
{"text":"Service was great. Employees were friendly. Location was clean. I did not have a sub. I had a salad, so this review is only based on their salad. Grilled chicken salad. Chicken is not fresh. It's that processed chicken, with strange consistency. Salad was wilted, some rotted. Tomatoes were old and soft. The entire salad had a wet consistency. This is with the dressing on the side. I didn't eat much of it. I guess a sub was the way to go but I was looking for something light and fresh. Never again."}
{"text":"I had been to a firehouse before in Oregon but not in Arizona. I stopped by today and I was so impressed with their level of service. They were so welcoming and accommodating! Like always, great food! And very clean! I want to go back just to feel the positive energy the employees give off!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try out for the first time firehouse subs! Never been there before we have always gone to subway...UNTIL NOW!!! Firehouse subs is AMAZING!! Fantastic service, explains what's on there menu and lets u know what additional items u can put on for a lil extra charge.  Shannon (the Gm) at this location welcomed my husband and I as we walked into the doors very energetic, filled with smiles and most of all a great personality and the young lady (Erika S.) who had rung us up on the register was very helpful and explained and answer any questions we had!! We were in Awww's while enjoying our lunch and admiring the pictures, and the building and most definitely the food, I unfortunately did get the gentlemen's name who made the sandwiches but THANK U  he did a great job!!! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND  this place to anyone and everyone. The staff will turn your bad day into a wonderful day just with there great vibes!! Thank u to the staff at firehouse subs on lake Meade and tanaya it was a pleasure being there today"}
{"text":"It was a big sub with lots of meat and veggies, but I was super disappointment in the stale bread. Very very dry"}
{"text":"When I pay someone else to make food for me - it better be good.  Fresh.  Flavorful.  Fast when appropriate.  Appetizing.  Filling.  Score!  I used to go to that place that that guy Jared plugged.  After having a Firehouse Sub - I realize how sad both the Subway sandwich and Jared are.  Since my first Firehouse Sub (I love the Italian - and I have them make it the \"Fit and Light\" way... as well as the Turkey Cranberry and the... Oh wait - everything I've had here I've loved!  Clean, prompt, courteous, and fantastic flavors and textures.  I love to add a little bit of the captain's sauce then have on the counter.  Every time I go at lunch the place is crazy busy.  We will call ahead/order online at times knowing this.  We've even gone to lunch early to miss the crowds.  I bet they wish they could double the dining area at lunch time!  There's a reason for the foot traffic.  You have to go out of your way a bit to go here.  Try it.  You'll like it.  I dislike chains ... but this one is a keeper."}
{"text":"Wow. So what happened to the people who work at Firehouse Subs saying hello to people as they walk in.... I barely was even greeted! then got home with my sub and it has ZERO TOPPINGS.... are you f'n kidding me???? Isn't there a standard of what goes on a sub at this place. I have no idea how this location is making it. I will NEVER return. I'd rather drive 20minutes to a location that has customer service. Terrible if I could give less than one star I would. I just wasted $10 and time."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to try the sandwiches, thinking it would be a pretty average sandwich shop.  Ordered a turkey sub, and a BBQ sub.  Sandwiches were pretty good, particularly BBQ sub, which had tender meat and a good sauce.  Good serviceable option, and superior to the standard sandwich shops which I do not patronize (i.e. subway, port o' subs, etc...)  Price was a little higher, but quality was a little better as well."}
{"text":"So thankful that this location opened, as it's on my way home!! Awesome service and great food, like all Firehouse Subs!"}
{"text":"Best place for a quick sandwich lunch without sacrificing the flavor! My favorite is the engineer with added hot sauce from the 30 bottle display. I do wish they wouldn't hound for donations so much though when you're at the register. I mean rounding up is enough to donate each time- do I really need to donate more for a sticker on the wall or a used pickle bucket? STOP ASKING in THREE different ways, it just makes me feel bad or look bad when I say no."}
{"text":"I had firehouse subs today at work for a luncheon. The subs were amazing and fresh. The rolls were excellent!!! They have an awesome sweet tea to drink. I want to go and check this place out."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Never had less than an excellent experience here Convenient option for calling in and taking out Recommend highly"}
{"text":"First visit to Firehouse Subs the other day, prompted by some really good coupons I got in the mail. This location is closest to my house. It will not be my last visit. Very friendly, knowledgeable, helpful & efficient staff, and an absolutely delicious sandwich. Happy, happy!"}
{"text":"Our sub was good. Arrived quickly, staff was friendly. The owner was mopping, chatting with customers, very friendly. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The NY Steamer which is their beef brisket sub w/ provolone was delicious, however, a major drawback of the place is the price and a lack of selection to accompany their subs. $16 for two small subs with chips and drink is a little on the high side."}
{"text":"This firehouse is the best! I teach kindergarten at monte vista down the street, and Tyler so generously donated several hats to the whole kinder cluster. This will make learning about fire safety that much more memorable.   Thanks again!"}
{"text":"This is one of those sandwich shops that is fairly new to Las Vegas and tucked into strip malls.  With that said; honestly you forget it's there.  I have eaten here a few times just out of curiosity.  It was pretty good.  They have the fireman theme.  Their flagship sandwich is called the \"Hook & Ladder,\"  which you guessed it is a fireman reference.    The reason I went here two time in a seven day period is because of a radio commercial.  Yes, a radio ad!  They have blitzed the radio stations promoting their new Pork and Slaw sandwich.  The first 50 times I heard this my brain started to give in.  It was almost like a jedi mind trick via the radio.  After about the 75th time I heard the ad, I said to myself: \"I must try this pit smoked pecan pulled pork sandwich topped with Hawaiian cole slaw and pepper jack cheese nestled into a sweet roll!\"  Yeah I know your mouth is watering right now.  I finally made it to the restaurant super stoked and somewhat brainwashed.  When I bit into this sandwich I my taste buds when into shock.  I couldn't believe a pulled pork sandwich could be so tasty!    Stop by and get this wonderful sandwich before it's gone!  The other sandwiches are great too.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this location. It's always clean and the staff there are super friendly. My favorite thing to order here is the \"hook & ladder\". I'm not to fond of subway sandwiches so this is a great alternative as far a sub shops go. They have a pretty sweet sauce bar as well."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs was rated by \"Consumer Reports\" as being one of the top three Sub Shops nationally so I thought I would give their new South Chandler location a try.  It is new so it is very clean and the service was very good.  I ordered their signature \"Hook & Ladder\" sub on a hoagie roll done \"fully involved\" with all the fixings.  All of the subs are heated so lots of melted cheese and crispy roll.  I really liked the unique flavor of their \"secret sauce\" or maybe it was just the combination of mayo, mustard and oil/vinegar.  Pretty impressed and I will be back.  Easy to see why Firehouse was rated highly."}
{"text":"Tried to order pickup online. Let's me get up to the very end and doesn't go through. So much for technology and skipping the line. I decided I'd rather go somewhere else. I think I'd rather go somewhere else from now on in general. Do offer a service if it's not fully functional."}
{"text":"New to Vegas, was craving Subway but wanted to try something new. Went here with a friend who had also never been and we both had the meatball sandwich. It was actually really good! Also a good footling size, with meatballs stacked from edge to edge. However, my sandwich was slightly burned on one half of the bread. I don't think this is a normal trend, as my friend's was golden brown all around.  The service was nice and even assisted in picking a size of order for the artichoke hearts that we had. I'm not quite sure what it was, but that wasn't a side I was too crazy about after trying a couple. Something I'll avoid next time. However, I do see myself coming back to try more and a different sandwich next time. Not sure it's in my top five, but definitely worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I regularly eat at Firehouse by my office for lunch, so was excited to have one open by home. Unfortunately it seems they might be going through some growing pains.   Minus one star for putting tomatoes on a sandwich clearly ordered without tomatoes (I checked the receipt & it was noted properly) and minus another for an EXTRAORDINARILY long wait time even though it appeared to be a slow night. I've never had to wait that long at any Firehouse even during a busy peak lunch period. It made no sense to me at all. Lots of chatter behind the counter though - at least the staff seemed to be enjoying themselves at the expense of my time.   They also had a comparatively scant hot sauce offering, and what they did have had LOTS of empty bottles. It's all the little things Firehouse does that make it so good, and this location is doing none of them yet. Maybe once they learn how to pay attention to detail and start caring about empty condiment bottles and special orders it will be a real Firehouse subs, but for now it's just another hit & miss sub shop with lackluster service and employees who care more about socializing with one another than doing their jobs. Too bad - I had such high hopes because other Firehouse locations are just superb, but I guess they've had more time to work out their problems. I'll give this location another try in a month or so & see if they get it right then, but they sure aren't now.   Oh - and Yelp is wrong on the times they're open too. I know they're open until 10 at least on Saturday, probably Friday and other days too. Yelp lists closing time as 9 across the board."}
{"text":"Located on the northeast corner of Rainbow Blvd and Patrick Lane, Firehouse Subs is pretty easy to find.  I do enjoy Firehouse Subs and their product. The only reason I don't enjoy it more is because I have to pass Subway (that part is actually pretty easy :P), Port of Subs, Capriotti's, and Jimmy John's to get there!  (+) They have those awesome Coke machines where you can mix sodas and flavors! That is always a big plus for me! Cherry Coke Zero!! (+) Subs are always tasty! I keep trying new menu items and, while I prefer some over others, I have yet to get a total stinker.   (-)  little bit on the pricey side. my last footlong was $13. Footlong sub at Port of Subs is $8.50 (-) the few times I have been here it has been busy and the place has been pretty trashed. Maybe I can update it next time I go during a slower time.  Service seems to be hit or miss. I have gotten great service at times and meh service at other times. Feels like a crapshoot in that regard.  Overall, this place is a-ok. I will eventually be back and try something else...if I can make it past those 4 other sub places between my house and Firehouse!  3 stars.  A-Ok."}
{"text":"I thought it would be unfair to leave this at 3 stars. I have been back several times and I have found what works best for me is to just order the subs and take them to go. They are some DAMN tasty sandwhiches, the best I've had in the city so far. The \"value\" meals just aren't worth it and even though the employees are pretty nice, the dining experience there leaves much to be desired.   But the sandwhiches are great! The engineer seems to be my fave at the moment, but I've tried several options on the menu and have yet to be let down.   So thats my two cents worth. Just grab the sub and take it to go!  4 stars."}
{"text":"One of the best sub shops hands down. Love the way they steam the subs, make them taste freaking delicious.  Really there isn't any sub on the menu you can't go wrong with. Average prices and the \"Welcome to Firehouse\" never gets old.  Give it a go and head to Firehouse!"}
{"text":"Firehouse subs always delivers on excellent sub sandwiches, but that's not why I'm writing this now. Jacob, who took my order, is the type of person that makes the experience. He is the reason I'll keep going to Firehouse Subs. We interacted for maybe 30 seconds, and in 30 seconds I was compelled to come write this. From his eye contact, to his genuine demeanor, this guy personifies incredible guest service. I hope Firehouse helps him climb the corporate ladder before they lose him to another company who realises he's special. Keep being great and thanks again Jacob!"}
{"text":"Had a good friend (thanks Ben!) tell me how great Firehouse Subs sandwhiches taste. As I'm a lover of good sub sandwiches, I had to give them a try.   Today, I tried the sampler route and bought two small sandwiches.  The first was the Italian- Genoa Salami, pepperoni, Virginia Honey Ham, provolone, Italian dressing & seasonings. It also came with a dill pickle spear on the side. Whoa, this sandwich  kicked tail, one of the best I've tasted!  The second sandwich was The New York Steamer-corned beef, pastrami, provolone, deli mustard, mayo & Italian dressing. It too, came with a dill pickle spear on the side. Verrry good!  I found out that both my sandwhiches came \"Fully Involved \" ie.,mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato,onion & a kosher dill spear on the side. Aha!   The staff was very welcoming and one in particular,  Matthew checked on me several times to see how I was enjoying my meal. Thanks Matthew!  Yup, I now count myself a fan of Firehouse Subs and I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is in love with Firehouse so I eat there quite a bit. In terms of quality they blow away Subway, Quiznos, etc. Their subs are also quite large, and the hot sauce collection is amusing. I tried the DBacks hot sauce as a joke, and actually found it to be quite tasty. At the same time, I realized I do like hot sauce on my sandwiches. Who knew? Thanks, Firehouse!  I give them four out of five stars for two reasons: 1. One night they gave me the hard sell on the brownies and I caved. They were not anything special. Don't bother. 2. The last time I was there they took way too long to make one sub and there were six people working behind the counter. In addition, two people that ordered after me got their food first. That is seriously irritating.   Definitely a nice alternative to other sandwich chains."}
{"text":"I'm falling asleep here waiting.  Slow, very slow.  with 5 people behind the counter can't think of a reason why. I'll stay with jersey mikes  Tried it again and this time is was great Sam the cashier was great .  Got our food in four min great recovery guys"}
{"text":"No doudt about this location best i have ever gone too. Sandwiches are always well put together and taste incredible. They also have a great selection of hot sauces."}
{"text":"There's  an aspect  to Firehouse  that very few people are aware of, I've  found that they consistently  have better brisket in their  subs than a good many of the BBQ restaurants  in the area. And more  importantly  it's consistently  good. You really never know  if you're  going  to  wind  up  with  a  mouth  full of fat, meat or a combination  at most places. Firehouse  gives you tender delicious  brisket  all the time. The rewards  program  also makes it very easy to get free food in very little  time. The Northlake  employees  are very hard working, friendly and polite."}
{"text":"(3/12/14) I had a great Italian sub today. It was superbly crafted by Mandy. It was delicious hot but I could only eat half of it. So I took the other half home in a container. I ate it for lunch the next day and surprisingly it tasted even better cold.  (3/14/14)Fast forward to today. I'm having another Italian sub jointly crafted by Mike Shingle & Greg Gimon. As usual it was very well made and delicious.    (03/15/14) Mike and Greg are working second shift again today. What to have what to have... I again decided on an Italian sub. It was good to see Matt back behind the counter. He really makes customers feel welcome. The sub as usual was very tasty and prepared just right. Nice work guys!"}
{"text":"Yes, I likey.   If you go on your birthday you get a free sub.  Thats worth another visit as I see it.  Great local grindage."}
{"text":"Great change of pace. This sub place is decent. Clean and new. Servers are energetic. Sub combinations are many. You are certain to find your own combination."}
{"text":"We love Firehouse! But this particular branch seriously needs a lesson in customer service. We ordered our subs and they were completely cold. I went to tell them and asked if there was anyway possible they could just warm them up. The cashier told me no, and that they would just remake them. The whole rest of the time we were there, the staff openly was talking bad about us, and giving us dirty looks. As a manager at a restaurant I know how frustrating it can be to deal with costumers, but i would never tolerate my staff acting like that. We will never go to this Firehouse ever again."}
{"text":"A three star rating per Yelp means A-OK. I think that fits for this restaurant. I think all of the employees are polite AND helpful. They are always willing to help out the newbies coming into the shop. The sandwiches are okay, but nothing which will blow you away. The only exception would be the Beef and Cheddar, which is really good. I dig the two soda machines that they have so you're never waiting to fill up. They have those new machines where you use the touchscreens to pick your drink.  One source of aggravation for me as a customer is that businesses are always asking the customer to donate something. In this case, they ask the customer if they want to round up their purchases. I really just want to buy lunch and move on. Let me decide how I want to spend my Charity budget on my own terms."}
{"text":"hook & ladder sub was  good, but little bag of chips? if it had a heaping pile of frys with it ,would be as good as uncle sams."}
{"text":"I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o  The Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs."}
{"text":"Good crew, always courteous and attentive upon arrival.  Sandwiches taste great, are well put together and the dining area is always clean.  I've never been disappointed! The wait for your food lags sometimes, but this isn't Subway, which is why I come here in the first place."}
{"text":"It was my second time here and even thou first I got the wrong item they exchanged it in a timely manner. Everything tasted fresh and yummie. I honestly dont care for subs but the combos they have are awesome."}
{"text":"Today was my first day at Firehouse and it was AMAZING!!!! Everything from the friendly staff to the absolutely delicious Italian sub and sweet and spicy meatball sub. My husband and I will be back. Also my little sister said she'd be back too!!!"}
{"text":"Firehouse is  #1 of the sub shops in our area. Not the cheapest and not the most expensive but better quality than the cheapest and a better menu selection than all of them!   They will even accommodate a custom sandwich, in case, like me you still want something other than a menu item.   They have salads, a low calorie menu and  many hot & cold subs.   In addition the fresh bread, service and fancy Coke machine are top notch!  Check 'em out."}
{"text":"This Firehouse Subs opened up in an old Zoup location. First thing you notice when you walk in there as they went to the effort to get old turnout gear hoses pictures helmets Etc from the local Willoughby fire station which I thought was pretty cool and a good omage to the neighborhood.  In addition to the interactive Coke machine which is pretty much standard in most places now they do have your standard selection of chips the subs are all named after something that has to do with firefighting which is kind of cheesy LOL but still you can custom make your own sub as well. And as with most sub shops you can also make any sub into a salad. One of my friends got a salad and look to be a pretty hearty serving of salad and you can also dump pretty much any of the toppings that they offer on to the salad and no extra cost.  My only real gripe is since they were new I don't think they have their sub assembly process down to the speed of probably it should be because it does take quite a while sometimes upper to 10 minutes to get a sub made which is not really a big deal if you're not in a hurry however being a lunch crowd you do have to expedite in some cases. The sub also comes served in a box of some sort and it served horizontally so it's not a good idea to take your sub and hold it vertically. Well it may be an oh okay idea but I didn't try it but the Box seem to hold the sub.  Overall the bread was fresh the toppings were fresh I scanned the makeline that did not seem like they had any wilted lettuce or off-color tomatoes like subway does. Due to these reasons we've been back there four times already in the two weeks they have been opened and my big fat belly shows exactly how delicious it is. I have to lay off LOL"}
{"text":"I gave Capriotti's a 4 so I gotta give Firehouse a Five!  I had a big 12 inch Italian sub and what can I say but how you can taste the freshness!  Getting the 12\" for the extra $2 also gives you much more meat and leftovers!  The staff here was super friendly asking if it was my first time and explaining the menu, bringing the food to my table and picking up when I was done.  Another bonus is the Coca Cola Freestyle machine which has over 100 varieties of soft drink.  I'll be back to try something different, I've heard the meatball sub makes Subway taste like fast food!"}
{"text":"Great staff, quick service and a clean facility. Finally a place worth while near buckeye! My best friend and I are so impressed with this firehouse sub location we have become regulars. They care about their food, and their customers! Its also nice to be greeted as soon as you open the door, and it reminds me of the friendly local dinner atmosphere I used to get back on the east coast in small country towns. ( only cleaner ). I look forward to patronizing this establishment hopefully for years to come!"}
{"text":"The Turkey bacon ranch is heavenly! This is my first tube here, and I love it! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My only complaint about this location is the manager said she would put margaritas in the freestyle coke machine. She has yet to do so. LOL great subs and great people."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a sandwich! The staff is very friendly and helpful. They always bring your order straight to your table. The cashier was knowledgable and explained the menu to me, and also the soda machine. It has 120 different combinations. The food was delicious. I ordered the beef brisket and cheddar, and it was the best sub sandwich I've had in a long time. Juicy, tender, the perfect amount of meat and cheese. Yummy!  The shop has on the counter an entire array of hot sauces, rated on a scale of 1 - 10. I think that's neat. The restaurant was clean, bright and very open. All in all, a great lunch experience, and I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love sandwiches and this is the place to stop. You need a little extra kick to your sandwich? Add some hot sauce and spice it up.  Never ever been disappointed when I have been here."}
{"text":"Omg the best sandwiches ever !!! Night crew is the bomb love Shannon Chad Liz and the newest member Brahms great customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing wonderful things about this chain, I was excited to see one opening so close.  Finally got a chance to eat there.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  Ordered a cold hook and ladder.  Everything was bland. No taste to the bread or the italian dressing.  Even the onion was bland.  The pickle was good though.  Guess I'll talk to my friends And see what they order that's so delicious."}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich is mouth-wateringly delicious and I love their hot sauce selection!"}
{"text":"Way better than subway or port of subs in my opinion but that's probably because I hate ordering cold sandwiches since I could easily make it at home. Having a hot sandwich makes me feel a little better/less lazy lol. The ingredients taste fresher and I like that they now offer salads and smaller subs for under 500 calories. This location is really clean and it's nice of the workers to offer to take your basket when you're done. I also like their soda machine because it has soo many options and I also like that they offer a large range of hot sauces! My favorites are their smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket and their club on a sub. They offer catering and you can also order online :)"}
{"text":"Not so good experience. First it took forever to make a bacon turkey ranch sub that he mistakenly already messed  up on. Then when I get it he leaves basically everything off the sub so it's dry!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Firehouse subs,  I'm very impressed.. With the amount of meat on the sandwich.  I had the Italian sandwich,  I enjoyed it so much.   The staff was great,  the service was fast and friendly.  I hope to see more Firehouse restaurants"}
{"text":"I came in to have lunch. As soon as i got ready to sit at a table i placed my soda on the table and as i was sitting down the table base was broken and the soda spilled all over me. NOBODY APPOLOGIZED. they looked at me like im wierd.  When they came to clean the mess i told them to talk to the owner because last time i had a similar issue with another table STILL NO APPOLOGY. SERVICE SUCKS AT THIS LOCATION I DONT KNOW HIRED THEM. THERE WAS APPROX. 5 ENPLOYEES BEHIND THE COUNTER NO SERVICE WHAT SO EVER. I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. Just an FYI to the owner that your employees are not doing their job im very disappointed after spending so much money here!!!"}
{"text":"My 1st time there it's got great sandwiches my favorite is the roast beef and cheddar it's addictive.  The sweet and spicy meatball sub is also wonderful.  Bread is very fresh . Staff was very friendly cute and clean love this place ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Tried the kings Hawaiian and it was delicious! Everything here is great but the best part is the service and quality that you get. The guys at this location always greet you with a smile and have excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I love this location, everyone is so friendly! Food is delicious and they have a patio so I usually take my dog with me. Favorites are the Italian, the engineer, and the beef and cheddar brisket."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches for reasonable prices. They get your food to you in a timely manner. The location is small and very warm. I would recommend you get your food to go."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite sub places! Good service and quality sandwich ingredients.  Hook and Ladder is my favorite.  They also have a Fuel Under 500 lighter fare menu.  Turkey and Cranberry is very good!  Great place for subs!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Firehouse Subs. Very clean restaurant and nice employees. The pop machine with the 120 different combinations is a nice touch too. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've only had the meatball sub and the italian sub, but both of them knock the socks off the competition.  If you've never been here, you should just go and experience it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Traveling through and wanted a good easy sandwich.  Enjoyed the Italian firehouse.  Service was just average. They were not the best but the food was awesome."}
{"text":"We LOVE Firehouse Subs! A great restaurant with a great cause, and some of the best food you'll ever eat! Of course, with better quality ingredients comes slightly higher prices, but every single one of the restaurants are clean, fast, always have what you want, and all the hot sauces you could ever need. Sometimes I have dreams about the food, tbh"}
{"text":"Cool location, takes a while to get your order but they're always really busy.  It's a great place to have lunch with some friends and hang out. Food quality is superb, they've never once been out of any ingredients, the staff are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday, felt like a good sub sandwich and wasn't in the mood for Subway.  Choose Firehouse instead. I was happy that I did. Decided on the Italian, genoa salami, pepperoni, ham and topped with provolone  melted on top, plus all the other stuff, tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, olives, bit of deli mustard, salt and pepper, no mayo thank you.  Bread was nice, a bit chewy, which it the way it should be, a bit of bite added by the pepperoni . Nice sandwich and it hit the spot. Reasonably priced and prepared quickly. On my list of places to go again."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place out. First time at a Firehouse Sub period. They welcome you in just like subway does. Great idea, customer always wants to be acknowledged.  Great deco, of course it's a fireman theme.  I had the beef and cheddar sandwich. Really enjoyed it, great portions of meat, plenty of cheese. You can purchase your sandwich in three sizes, and in a combo if wanted.  Plenty of room inside and outside to sit, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We went in and ordered two meatball subs to go. After waiting about ten minutes someone comes out and tells us that they only had enough meatballs ready for my girlfriends small sub. I would have to wait while they cooked more meatballs for my large sub. We said OK. About ten minutes passed and they brought out my sub. It seemed fast for meatballs to cook but I didn't think anything of it, YET! I ate my sub at home and woke about 3:00 am sick as a dog. I'm not going to go into the gross details but suffice it to say that the only reason they got one star from me is because there is no lower rating. I will NEVER go back to this place. It's nothing but a bunch of kids working there and I don't think they know the first thing about food safety."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a number of times now and they never disappoint.  The cashier is always friendly,  place is always clean and food is always delicious.        I decided to write a review today because a soccer tournament had just let out and the place is beyond packed with a line out the door....it didn't seem to faze them at all.  Line when very quick and food came faster than expected.       Fyi...I recommend the beef brisket,  it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I moved from Vegas to LA 3 years ago. When i go back to visit I make it a must to stop by here for a sub. They steam them so the meat is extremely juicy and flavorful. I ate here once a week when I lived here. The club sandwich is the best club I have ever had. Plus they have a million different hot sauces to sample. You can have a different  sauce on every bite if you wanted. Try the peach habanero hot sauce......Um now I want to go back."}
{"text":"This is relatively new store. Have been to several other Firehouse Subs so we knew what to expect. My wife had the hook and ladder lite and I had the steak and cheese. They were both very good. It was kind of funny that we knew the menu and how to order better than the clerk did. It was busy but they were pretty quick on getting our food.  We will be back as this is closer than the other one near us."}
{"text":"Love this place, there should be one on every block instead of crappy subways. The subs are great, service is great. I love the whole firehouse theme."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times in the past and it was always pretty good until today.  They did not make the sub the way I asked (there were no added olives) and I am really not a fan of the new way they package the subs.  Instead of wrapping it in wax paper as it always had been, they put it in a paper box which spilled ingredients all through the bag and the sandwich just really fell apart.  Will not be back"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Friendly and prompt service. Delicious subs, the hook and ladder is my favorite. Gotta love that the subs come with a pickle!!! First time at this location and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I Like the concept and how a portion of there processes go to help safety,but will say I like subway better for instance at subway my spicy Italian has twice the meat on it and twice as big and cheaper and more condiments. As for cleanliness I thought my table was clean before I sat down hard to tell because they are very busy with spots in them well it was not so got up and went to sit it a another  table same thing looked around and yeah none are whipped down and I was there at 10:30 am so the mustard and what not have probably been there  from previous day  two people working I am the only customer in the place there are standing around talking"}
{"text":"Great place for a sub. Always greeted with a friendly welcome. Caitlin is especially friendly and always asks how I am doing while I am eating my sandwich.  The sub I get is always fresh made. I especially enjoy their Italian, also their club on a sub. Give this place a try. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I really like the food here, sandwiches are made fresh and their specialty is serving them warm (you can ask them to make yours cold).    $10 for a sandwich, chips & a drink is the average here."}
{"text":"Open 10am to 10pm. I had the smokehouse brisket ($10.29) on  whole wheat roll with cheddar cheese and some Doritos ($1.19). Later I found out that just the sandwich was 1500 calories. It was tasty going down, but I had terrible heartburn later which tasted like the artificial smoke that goes into cheap lunch meats. The roll was fresh and toasted.  This sandwich shop is located in a former Arbys across from Banner Desert Hospital. The roadwork going on on Southern Ave in front of the business makes access very difficult. Parking is very tight and is shared with the Little Caesars pizza place next door. The limited indoor seating is very cramped. The staff is OK.  If I want a brisket sandwich in the future, I would probably head over to Chompies or Dave's BBQ."}
{"text":"I love the variety here. I was familiar with the brand having eaten at locations in the \"south\" many times. I have been to this location. Very clean. Subs are good. I recommend the smokehouse beef and brisket."}
{"text":"Just overall great. Service was amazing 20 minutes in we were checked on, asked how the food was.   First here and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was less than mediocre and way overpriced for what you get. I'm a small/average woman and I left still hungry. My daughter got the grilled cheese and the cheese wasn't even melted.  The service was awful. Their were 5 young men working behind the counter and every one of them seemed incompetent and lacked any confidence. We were given a crappy unenthusiastic forced greeting when we entered this place. The cashier Braedon was rude. Making a comment to one of his coworkers in an annoyed tone that he was the only one who knew how to work the register before asking us what we wanted to order and talking to coworkers while we were trying to order.  We waited almost 20 minutes for our sandwiches to get to the table, there were only 4 other tables seated when we got there and one already had their food. While we were eating there was another complaint from a customer sitting across the way that their order wasn't correct and they also had been waiting 20 minutes. They were offered a free brownie which I found laughable. The lady had ordered a sandwich with meat and cheese only and waited 20 minutes for it. Absolutely ridiculous.  Don't waste your time, go next door to Some burros."}
{"text":"I always get the best customer service here. They are always very sweet and prompt with my order. The management is very sweet as well. There are always workers cleaning the restaurant and making sure guests are taken care of. I would definitely recommend this location if you're craving a delicious sub. Thanks guys :)"}
{"text":"Asked if they could condo,something about the temperature inside. It was very cold. They said They couldn't do anything because the thermostat was locked but I could go outside and eat in the brain because It was warmer. This place is just becoming a dump. Sandwich was burnt on the end and soda area was pretty nasty."}
{"text":"All time favorite! They have the best subs hands down! Service is great and people are nice"}
{"text":"I'd never heard of this place until I stumbled upon it today. The \"established by firefighters\" sign tug at my heartstrings, so I had to stop in. It's a few days post the 10th Anniversary of 9/11, after all.   Everyone who walks through the door is greated by every available employee shouting \"Welcome to Firehouse!\" And they did a fair job of making it look a bit like a firehouse. There was some (artificial) exposed red brick, a large rescue scene mural, numerous firefighter photos, jackets and pants, etc. It's a brightly decorated in red, white and black and even has dalmation-motif tabletops. (There's also a lone TV for those who care, but the volume was down to nothing.) Outdoor seating with umbrellas and misters is available if you're up for watching Indian School traffic drive by.   The cashier was quick to educate me they toast only the buns. The meats and cheeses are steamed to 140 degrees to retain the flavor, and I'd have to agree that it did. I had the Italian (Genoa, pepperoni, salami, provolone and Italian dressing. It's served \"fully involved\" meaning with lettuce and tomato. It was good with the dressing a bit on the sweet side. There are numerous hot and cold subs from which to choose, as well salads, cookies and brownies. Of course the menu wouldn't be complete without their \"Firehouse Chili\". Be sure to check out their abundant supply of hot sauces, if you can take the heat!   The place was clean and the staff friendly. While I understand they've been open just four days, the service was a little slow. There was just one customer ahead of me, yet I still had to wait several minutes. I hope once they work some minor kinks out that the speed of service increases and it'll be a nice place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Sorry to say but the sand which I just attempted to eat was disgusting.  I drive less than 5 minutes home with it and the whole bottom part of the sandwich was soggy.  I pulled the bottom part of the bread off and just ate the tops.  Zero flavor and I actually had to spit it out of my mouth.    Aside from the gross sandwich, when I arrived it was not busy, but it took way too long to get such a low quality sandwich made.  Maybe soaking the bread in water is what took so long.  The girl at the register had her hair in her face and was scratching her head.  Then went on to make sandwiches.  I am hoping she washed her hands.    Super disappointing because I've had other good Firehouse experiences but I'll never go back to this location.  Vile."}
{"text":"I was in a hurry and very hungry after shopping , other nearby places were very busy so I gave Firehouse a try and will say it was worth the money. I had a bbq beef sandwich and it tasted sweet and smokey. Service was quick and friendl at about 7 minutes and I appreciated complimdntary veteran drink. I recmmend this spot!"}
{"text":"The Firehouse Smoke and Cheddar Beef Brisket (#10) is pretty awesome. The sub is smothered in delicious barbecue sauce (the way I like it) but the meat is more on the deli style, not the thick cut smoked meat you get at the smoked meat place in Vaughan. But for what it is, it's pretty good. Topping are extra but you definitely don't need them."}
{"text":"I tried this new sub sandwich chain today and was not disappointed! I ordered the Engineer sub which was sliced turkey, sauteed mushrooms and provolone cheese and served \"fully involved\", topped with lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard and onion. It was their opening weekend so the owner was present and talking to customers. He suggested that I try their Datil Pepper hot sauce, which was a slightly sweet, slightly spicy hot sauce and said it would go well with my sandwich. He was absolutely right!  I usually like my sandwich a little more well-toasted but it was very tasty and very filling. The cost for a medium size sub with a combo was $14, a little more than I'm used to paying, but it was good. They have a wide variety of pre-configured subs but you can also make your own (I may try this next time just for fun). Service was fast and friendly and it was a nice touch to meet the owner)."}
{"text":"After I made this comment the manager respectfully contacted me and dealt with the situation in a polite manner. And for that I change my review."}
{"text":"We came with a large group (20) and the manager and staff busted the orders right out, all with a smile.  Great place."}
{"text":"Had 18 people in the store and I still received my sandwich in about 5-6 minutes with only three staff members working. Wayyyyyy better than jimmy johns"}
{"text":"Such nice employees at this place! Patient and helpful. I needed just a side of chicken breast to feed my dogs and they were happy to accommodate. The subs are so yummy and we love the Under 500 Calorie choices! Great place ;-)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always a friendly employee there to take my order. They're kindness and   quality are hard to find these days. Kudos to this team for being awesome!"}
{"text":"I judge my lunch and dinner places to a different set of criteria.  For lunch it's about convenience, cost, and taste.  A distant fourth criterion might be the relative nutritional value of the meal.  Firehouse, wins on the first three and is worthy of inclusion into the lunch time rotation.  The sandwiches are hearty, heavy, and tasty.  Denser and more robust flavors then you'd get at the chain sub spots.  I doubt that this place will win any accolades from the American Heart Association but I also doubt that 85% percent of its patrons even consider calorie counts when they order one of these sandwiches.    A great sub.  Just make sure you eat fruits, vegetables, and other healthy options when you're not here."}
{"text":"Always a good experience friendly stuff a good place to relax and eat food are great never disappointed me"}
{"text":"Avoid this company! They had my review removed, I will never trust yelp again. Since I can't specifically explain I'll just say the management is very bad, employees all great but owners are bad. Food is bland and skimpy on portions. Instead of trying to respond and help an upset customers they  look for excuses to have reviews removed. Lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"Forget all the other places because Firehouse has the best sandwiches IMO.  Most similar to Jersey Mikes, but even better."}
{"text":"Always an awesome go to for a quality meal when you're in a relative hurry. My staple is the Italian, but I used to work at a Firehouse when I was in college and can vouch that everything on the menu is great. Meats are fresh sliced every day and made to order while you wait.  This location is right around the corner from my new office, which will be dangerous for my wallet, but I had a great experience. Multiple employees came and asked how everything was, if I needed anything, and also offered to fill up my drink during my short visit.   Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Support a great cause, eat a great sub. Done deal in my book  I love the cause and the whole decor of the shop. It is really neat to just look around the place. So anyway, I ordered the signature slow cooked beef  brisket. Do yourself a favor and order a large. The subs are decent sized but I was still a little hungry. Maye make it a combo?!   It was super tender and the bread was great. Perfect sandwich for the price. The sauce selection at the end of the counter is quite impressive too. Try the hot ones, the 10+ on their heat scale. wow!   The Coke machine is one of the huge mix and match create your own drink things. It was so much fun. Blackberry vanilla Coke Zero. It was as good as it sounds.  I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great staff and management. They delayed our order. Even though we waited patiently, the manager gave us two free sub coupons for next time. Great service!"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat sub sandwiches, but this is definitely a great place to have them!  The sandwiches come out nice and hot and food comes out pretty quickly. The soda machine has a bunch of different drinks, so there's no problem choosing what to drink. The staff is nice overall and the place is pretty clean. Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a sub to eat!"}
{"text":"Placed a catering order for a business meeting and was very pleased how friendly the whole team was when I arrived to pick it up. Two members even walked my order out to my car.  Had to remind them of a few things missing before leaving.  Returned back to work and learned that I was given the wrong gallon drink.  I returned to exchange it and as a result had to delay the start of my meeting.  Very disappointed that I wasn't offered even a free cookie for my inconvenience."}
{"text":"I am a picky picky eater. Firehouse subs made me a wonderful sandwich with exactly what I wanted, full of flavor, quite delicious."}
{"text":"Good Evening, The other day my daughter ordered a Turkey Bacon sub for herself and a Hook and Ladder Salad for myself on the App and had it delivered. It was delicious.  Two day later, today June, 29th, 2018 I was driving by Firehouse and decided to stop in and get the same but my daughter wanted a half sub instead.  I took nearly 10 minutes just to place the order and was told they don't do half subs but they have a half and half which is half a sub and either a salad or a soup, so I ordered the sub with the soup, and I got the H & L Salad for myself with the Balsamic dressing.  When I got it home, we sat down to eat and was soooo disappointed.  The sub was so small that my 2 yr old granddaughter could of eaten it.  I ordered it with no mayo, no cheese and it came with mayo on it. The Butternut Squash soup was very good.  My Salad was nothing like the salad I got the other day, it was made with shaved lettuce not the mixed leafy lettuce I received the other day. It also came with the wrong salad dressing.   I don't mind spending $25.00 on lunch but I do expect it to be what I ordered.  Going forward I don't think I will be making another visit to Firehouse Subs. Thank you Lynne Eibich"}
{"text":"First time I stopped in to this new location.  Wait was entirely too long and not that busy.  I will think twice about coming here again."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this chain so when they came to Maple it was the perfect opportunity to try it out. I was greeted by a moderately enthusiastic 10-12 followed by Welcome to Firehouse which was fine and I certainly get the fact that some chains like to make a little show out of it. That's cool.   I ordered a medium NY Steamer which came with pastrami, brisket provolone and deli mustard. The standard also comes with mayo but I have never understood why anyone would want mayo on a pastrami sandwich but hey that's me. A medium is 8\" and includes 4oz of meat which filled me up but didn't leave me feeling like I had eaten like a pig. Could I have done with a few extra ounces?  Sure but at the same time I probably don't need it.   Price was $8.49 plus tax which brought it to $9.60 which given the quality of the meat was fair. I'm not sure if moving to a large which gives you twice the meat for an additional $3.50 would be worth it though.  I mean it is a better value but the cost/benefit ratio just isn't working for me on that. I would add that the inclusion of a quarter fill was a nice touch.   Overall I would say a nice quality sandwich which offered decent value for my money.  I didn't do a combo so I can't speak to the cost there."}
{"text":"I like that they always welcome you when you walk in! The cookies are always soft, the best soda machine with over 300 combinations to choose from and the best sandwiches. Always clean and staff is friendly. If you like hot sauce there's a great selection."}
{"text":"Firehouse Serves up good subs and salads.   First, I have to say the service at Firehouse Subs is great!  The staff welcomes you when you walk through the door.  On my first visit to Firehouse Subs (some time ago).  Upon arriving we were met by an employee handing out menus.  My co-worker and I were asked if it  was our first visit to Firehouse Subs and we said yes. The emoloyee went over the menu and recommended we try the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  The sub was delicious.  After leaving we couldn't stop talking about how good the sub was. In fact we went right back to firehouse subs a few days later.   So if your hungry for a good sub at a great price, head over to firehouse."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time having Firehouse Subs and I really liked it, just as I did the first time I tried it. I love everything, from the friendly chant of \"Welcome to Firehouse!\" from the employees when you walk through the door, to the atmosphere, the food, and of course, the Coke Freestyle on their soda machine. I enjoy creating my own drink concoctions.   I had the Sliced Chicken Breast sandwich on wheat and it was delicious. Also got the large drink, a bag of chips, and a brownie for dessert. For the money, I found it to be a great deal and I would definitely recommend Firehouse Subs to anyone looking for a new place to try."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a coworker at this location today. We both got the Turkey Bacon Ranch sub & it was very good!   The only drawback was having to wait for our food but being it was prepared fresh and with proper care, we girls didn't mind.   It's a nice restaurant in a decent location. Easy to get to.   I know we'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I really like Firehouse subs, but this location leaves a lot to be desired. They are slow, your order is more likely than not to be wrong, and is is very obvious nobody working there gives a crap. I think they must be spending all of their energy thinking of excuses to take the trash out so they can have a smoke break."}
{"text":"Firehouse Serves up good subs and salads.   First, I have to say the service at Firehouse Subs is great!  The staff welcomes you when you walk through the door.    On this visit to Firehouse Subs.  Upon arriving we were met by an employee handing out menus.  My sister and I were asked if it  was our first visit to Firehouse Subs.  I said \"no\" however, my sister said \"yes\". The emoloyee went over the menu and recommended my sister try the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  My sister said the sub was delicious.  I had the meatball sub and the meatballs were very tasty.  I wish there wasn't so much sauce because the bread was very soggy.  After leaving we couldn't stop talking about how good the sub was. So if your hungry for a good sub at a great price, head over to firehouse"}
{"text":"We eat at Firehouse every week. We enjoy the consistent service and yummy food.  They also have a loyalty program that keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Mehh.  I don't know... it's not somewhere I would go out of my way to visit.  But it's ok!  The pickles are really great.  Everybody is really nice in there... I just think their subs are mediocre & that makes me sad.  I was expecting greatness.  I'd rather go to Jimmy John's.  Don't hate!"}
{"text":"The food was great but over priced. The placed was packed yet the service was exceptional which is a rare combination. I would definitely recommend this place place to my friends just remember to save up before you stop in."}
{"text":"So as an Employee if Port of Subs, I Must say this place ROCKS!!  1)Customer Service- This place has it. which is HUGE in my book. Personality, Greeting the Customers and making them feel Welcome. The Enviorment was great, very upbeat place, there were several Customers both visits to this Location. you had to wait a minute for your food as they made it for you. you are able to customize what you get on it, which is a plus. if you don't want mustard, your welcome to let them know. I have had the Chicken Salad Sandwhich both Visits with my sister, as she works across the Street at Republic. my son and I shared the Medium Sandwhich with the meal. the first time we Split it, I didn't ask to see if we could get it in seperate baskets, but the second Visit they surprised us and as I said I was splitting it with my son they put each half of the Sandwhich in 2 seperate baskets. it was very kind of them. I would Recommend this place if you would like a Change up. I wish they had more Firehouse Subs threw out Southern California AND more Port of Subs, Also instead of Subway (not a fan- only if people REALLy knew about subway). I will continue to ear here, anytime I'm in the Neighborhood."}
{"text":"My first time ever at any Firehouse Subs was on Thursday, September 25, 2014.  I had the Turkey w/Bacon on Wheat bread, large size, and it was TERRIFIC!  Much better than their competitors, definitely, but that's to be expected, as Firefighters are known for their hearty appetites and their love of cooking.  Yes, I'll definitely be going back, and I'll pray that they one day have a location that isn't 10+ miles away from where I live."}
{"text":"Got a coupon and thought I'd try it. Called in the order. When I arrived 10 minutes laterI was surprised it was ready. The staff was friendly and helpful. I got the large steak & cheese sandwich and a small one for my daughter. Surprised it was really good except when we got home and opened it the bottom bread was soggy. Didn't stop us from eating it but would have been better if the bread wasn't soggy. My wife had the pastrami sandwich. It need some work. Not the best. I'd stick with the steak and cheese. Liked it that they had all these different bbq & hot sauces you can try. Will be back to try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Embarrassing.  We go to Firehouse Subs every Sunday because it is on the way home from church, it is quick and easy and they have a great Sunday deal for families, for every adult combo meal (mine) I can buy up to two $1 kids meal which works out great for me and my two kids.  We eat a good meal for less than $15 bucks, awesome for the budget.  Anyway, they hired a new lady a couple months ago and she doesn't get it, it is like a fight every time and the manager or another co-worker has to tell her to honor the special, every Sunday.  When she finally does enter in the deal she always looks at me in disgust, kind of a \"really, you can't buy your kids a normal priced meal\".  It has been bad enough that my five year old has picked up on it and asked me if we have done something wrong.  #1, no 18 year old kid has earned the right to belittle me, a customer, especially in front of my kids.  #2, if you don't know how to run a cash register or know your company's deals then you probably should not be the face that the customers deal with, believe it or not... I used to be one of those customers that paid your paycheck, now we drive over 4 miles out of our way to eat at the one on Eastern. The embarrassing part, I am only one customer that's has spoken up, how many more just write the place off and never come back that don't say something?"}
{"text":"Simply the best sub chain there is- no exaggeration.   As in all their locations you will find a clean, bright store with very friendly staff.   I usually order the Hook & Ladder, their signature sub. But all of the subs I've had are excellent. Pickle always served on the side!  All their meats are steamed which makes them very tasty.  Buns are fresh & soft- wonderful.  I am very happy Firehouse has expanded up to Canada & look-forward to even more locations opening soon."}
{"text":"First visit.  We ordered a medium and split it.  Good sized sandwich.  It was a \"hero\".  Pretty standard fare.  It was fine.  Nothing special, but fine.  Service was slow.  We stood there, they saw us, but it took a while before anyone asked if we had been helped.  Weird.  There was no line.  I may try this place again.  I'll order meatballs next time.  If that is \"fine\" then I'll just have to conclude they are \"average\".  Not great, not bad.  \"OK\".  One interesting thing is that they have a sauce bar with at least a dozen different sauces with various \"hot\" ratings.  Kinda a neat feature I haven't seen before."}
{"text":"They have the best sandwiches! The staff is always friendly and greet you as soon as you walk in. Love the soda machine with all the choices. Very cool feature. Now they have the lower calorie menu which I appreciate especially since now they list the calories on all of their sandwiches. This is our go to place for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a quick bite. Got 2 sandwiches. Didn't need a drink because our real reason for being in this shopping center was to get a coffee at the amazing shop next door, after we'd eaten. Husband asked for a water cup (just to wash down the sandwich). Firehouse wanted to charge for a water cup. We'd purchased 2 sandwiches. And, last time I checked, this is Arizona in the summer. There used to be a law in place - you must give water for free here. So, Firehouse.... why are you charging for a water cup? We purchased food. We didn't just come in off the street and demand water. Please, help me understand."}
{"text":"Get more help. I have never waited this long for a sub, almost 30 minutes. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Every time we order food from this establishment it is always amazing. I have never been inside this food eatery. Our food has always been delivered: super fast, exactly the way we ordered, super friendly delivery people and the food is outstanding. Thank you for continued great service!"}
{"text":"Went to this location again tonight and it was even worse then the first time. I didn't catch her name but the tall blonde who seemed to be the manager at the time was being ridiculously mean to the other workers. She was arguing with them in front of me and from her tone and attitude it seemed as if she was talking down to them also. All other staff members were very friendly to me even after being yelled at by her. I felt bad for the workers"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place. We walked in, it was very clean, and quiet. It was 5:51PM when we ordered. Candace took our order, whom was very nice and attentive to our needs. She was so nice, it caught me off guard because I'm used to crappy service everywhere we go.   We're from New England originally, I'd been CRAVING a \"hot oven grinder\" for 2 years. I got an Italian sandwich it comes with Genoa salami, pepperoni, ham, melted provolone, Italian dressing & seasoning, onions, tomato lettuce, and mustard.  Back east it's pretty much the same way but WITHOUT mustard & they usually throw hot peppers on it. I wasn't heart broken I never liked hot peppers on my sandwich.   I got an 8\" italian sub without mustard or onions on it. It bought me back home for brief moment. For $5.79 I couldn't be happier, I was shocked the prices were REASONABLE.  I HATE subway with a passion now that I've come here. It was just THAT much better. The combo is 2.29 more with a medium drink & chips.   Now for desert they had COOKIES. =) Oh yeah, I'm going there. I had a Chocolate chip cookie, my boyfriend had Oatmeal Raisin. Both of them were soft,  chewable and delicious. They're $0.85 for cookies & and they had brownies are $1.29.  The place steams the meats and I gotta say I never thought it'd be so freakin' delicious. I'm in love with this place. We'll be back.  I forgot to mention the whole reason we came I saw a picture of the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine that my boyfriend is thoroughly in love with. I told him they had it, he didn't even give me a chance to look at the menu, he said \"LET'S GO!\". Every time we get drinks from a free style machine we do half SPRITE vanilla & half Sprite Strawberry. Tastes like a strawberry jolly rancher.  =) lol try it."}
{"text":"My mom and I wanted to get a To-Go order from Firehouse Subs to take home. I've eaten at many Firehouse Subs and it's been fantastic. No mistakes, food is great, no issues or complaints. This location however made it seem very complicated than it needed to be. First of all, i'm vegetarian, so i need to custom pick my whole sandwich, which i have no issue with at all! I'm used to it. It's a basic sandwich - onions, lettuce, pickles, cheese. Nothing too complicated. When we were ordering i said no meat at least 3 times, she told me they wouldn't put meat on it and i saw it on the screen that it said \"no meat\". As we were waiting for at least 10-15 minutes for our 2 salad and sandwich order, the manager came over and asked if i wanted my cheese melted or sandwich toasted (don't know why they didn't ask me that at the counter but it's fine) He also double checked that i didn't want meat on it once again. I gave him my answers. Finally we got our bag, after 20 minutes, and I wanted to check our order to make sure there were no mistakes. The salad was correct, one of the sandwiches were correct, and then my sandwich, the one that was double checked at least 4 times, had meat on it. We went back in and they were kind enough to change it for free but the fact that we waited so long, and the manager even asked me if i didn't want meat on my sandwich, and it STILL had meat on it was very frustrating. I still had eaten my correct sandwich after it was re-made. No harm to the employees or people training. I just won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Employees here are the biggest morons I've ever seen. As I was standing by the register a very large phone order came in. All I ordered was one sub, instead of making that one sub and letting me go these guys made me wait until they have completed the ENTIRE phone order first, which took them about 20 mins, and only then did they proceed to make my one sandwich that didn't even take 5 mins. These guys lack basic common sense, but what can I expect, after all there is a reason why they are working earning minimum wage lol"}
{"text":"The subs are very good. The staff is friendly. The subs are a little slow to the table considering how much staff they have. I will be back."}
{"text":"No issues a great sub! Great fresh ingredients and service is great. Like the idea of a selection of hot sauces rated 1-10."}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I say I didnt like this place. Food was great the soda machine was even better"}
{"text":"We ordered a Hook and Ladder and Turkey Cranberry Lite and the gal who took our order was nice. Took almost 20 minutes for them to make our sandwiches and we could hear them talking and could physically see them standing behind the counter talk and laughing obnoxiously loud. One girl complained very loud about some folks sitting outside and like it was such an inconvenience for her to walk 10 feet outside.  Food was delicious but I wish the young gals working would keep their conversations more private!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches if you're sick of the typical Subway sandwich. Yes, it is more expensive than Subway, but the quality is much better. Friendly staff; a \"Hello\" when you enter. I will be using them to cater future meetings! Great job Huntersville Firehouse!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best sub place I know of.  Unfortunately, they are not nation-wide.  Meatball is my favorite.  Always worth the wait for them to freshly prepare it."}
{"text":"I've never had Firehouse Subs before but it has always sounded good to me.  I finally decided to stop in at this location on a whim.    I told the lady who was cashiering that it was my first time here and she was kind and told me how it works there (all sandwiches are served hot, etc).  Another detail I would like to point out is that it was a little chilly inside the shop and the cashier noticed me shivering and she promptly turned the air up to make me feel more comfortable.  That was incredibly nice of her.  I was impressed.    I ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch 8 inch sub with a bag of chips and a soda on the side.  I love the soda machine.  Wingstop has it too and some 7/11 locations and it's amazing.  \"120+ drink choices\" as advertised on their cups.  I got cherry limeade and mm mm good.    Now to the sub.  It was smaller than I was expecting.  But that does make it any less delicious.  Because it was just that, delicious.  The quality of this sandwich surpasses anything that comes out of Subway.  Subway is good in its own way but this sandwich from firehouse subs is gourmet level.  I just finished eating and I already want more, lol.    Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a gracious review. I was hesitant in trying this place out since I am not fan of places like SW. However, I am so pleased I did try Firehouse! I had the smoked turkey on their honey wheat bread with jalapenos! It was delicious, warm and fresh. I will definitely be back!! Super close to my home and say NO to SW with the quality of Firehouse deli meats and bread it's a MUST try! I will have to try their other specialty subs.   Customer service was very nice and appreciated! : )"}
{"text":"COOL firehouse theme, great food, good service.  Like subway - only way better (and probably more fattening).  That's really all you need to know.  TRY It.."}
{"text":"Great service. Tasty as always. The delivery is always on time whenever an order is placed."}
{"text":"Hook and ladder hot sandwich was to die for. Love this place. Also the hot Italian was deelicious. Will eat here again. Very reasonable prices and great tasting sandwiches."}
{"text":"Friendly environment and good customer service.  I have one near where I live in So. Cal. and this sub shop never disappoints!"}
{"text":"We love firehouse sub's, way better than subway sandwiches. They're fairly priced and always friendly. This location is really clean and the staff is super friendly. Location is very convenient for students on break. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My kids love going to firehouse subs and we always get great service when we are in there!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Firehouse Subs and I must say I was told very little about it and knew very little walking in. My best description would be a Quiznos Sub place on steroids. The reason I use this analogy is because the size of the subs are huge, the quality of the meats and the bread they use are exceptional. I was told to order a regular sub, I saw the large and thought I could eat this no problem. As I was devouring my lunch I quickly noticed how fast the large sub added up in my stomach and I was completely full when finished. The first sub I tried here was the cheese steak sub which is just incredible and I don't suggest adding anything because it's perfect. My friend who I went with got the Italian and she could barely finish her meal because she only got a regular. I wish I could add more pictures but I only realized as I was finishing up that I didn't take any pictures of the sub."}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com . Never a bad experience at firehouse subs. The subs are amazing. My personal favorites are the Philly, beef and cheddar brisket, and the turkey bacon cheddar ranch; to name a few. Price is reasonable, and the soda machine is pretty cool. All in all, firehouse subs is a great family establishment."}
{"text":"There is something awesome about their smoked brisket sandwich. You can't take a bite without the reminder of the smokey flavor of the awesome brisket they serve.   My favorites are the Italian, the Hook & Ladder, and (of course) the smoked cheddar brisket sandwich"}
{"text":"Firehouse is a solid sub shop and really isn't much more expensive than Subway.  They don't have a five dollar foot long, just better subs and a really cool soda machine.  The hot specialty subs are my favorite.  If I had to pick my favorite I would say its the \"Engineer\" but every sub I have ever ordered, at any location, has been good.  They are consistent, friendly and the subs are huge.  Get your sub \"fully involved\" and there's no way you're leaving this establishment hungry.  If I want a sub sandwich and there is a Subway and Firehouse sitting across the road from each other, I'm going to Firehouse because the food is better and lets face it, firefighters are a lot cooler than Jared."}
{"text":"Yay!! The northwest got a Firehouse subs!! This location is obviously very clean since it's new! The employees were very nice. We went later in the afternoon and it was pretty busy, which would normally be weird but since it's new, it'll probably be that way for a while. Btw: I HIGHLY recommend the bbq cheddar brisket sandwich!! A small is only 4\" so I get the medium, you're welcome!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Very disappointed both times. Ordered 2 sandwiches today and they didn't toast them, they were both the wrong bread, they didn't put any of the things we asked and there was one tiny bit of meat. It was pretty much all bun. Unbelievable. I'll try another location but this one is very poorly run."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Firehouse Subs, now I regret waiting so long.  Wow, probably the best sub I ever had.  I had the italian sub and the bread is toasted just perfect and the sandwich is so flavorful.  These guys make a good sub.  My son is really particular about what he eats and he got just a ham and mayo but he tried a bite of mine and next thing I know, he ate half of it.  Staff were friendly, overall thumbs up for me and my son.  We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, I had heard great things so I decided to check it out. I got the large Italian as it's what I get at most sub shops. As for meats the sub has pepperoni, salami, and  Virginia honey ham.  I thought the addition of honey ham was a little strange but whatever. The guy taking my order was quick and precise and my huge sandwich was ready in a few minutes. When I got home and started eating the sandwich I found out there was a massive amount of ham, like 75%. There was just a thin layer of pepperoni and salami. I'm not a huge fan of ham, I'll tolerate it, but it was the only meat I tasted with its sweetness.   Overall service was great, sandwich looked great but wasn't a fan of it in the end. I'll have to try another sandwich, that's why I'm leaving it a 4."}
{"text":"Forget about \"Subway Subs\" and the pictures you see on TV. Even \"Jersey Mikes\" subs all SKIMP ON THE MEAT.. Firehouse Subs are the best. A lot of meat and very tasty."}
{"text":"The guys and gals that greet and serve you are amazing!  Love the subs too! Always fresh and superior service!"}
{"text":"Loved the subs. Hated the soda machine. 100+ choices, that I can live with. On person using it at a time with a big line while everyone is trying to decide? no, thank you. I just wanted ice for iced tea and still I had to stay in line. I didn't see any other ice machine, so an additional one would be a good idea if they don't have it.  I had the New York sub, on wheat, added mushrooms... delicious. I am not a big fan of subs but I guess I will be back : )  We ordered online so it was ready when we got there.  I didn't know of this place until today, turns out there are a few in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Great subs, usually fast service.  The hot sauce selection is the best part though.  They will even sell full bottles which is good as the grocery stores around here have very limited selections."}
{"text":"Great new concept to the valley. It reminds me of some other sandwich shops, but its convient, affordable and tasty. I like that the concept helps local fire fighters and the surrounding community and the staff is always super attentive."}
{"text":"What a joke. I ordered three 8 inch meatball subs but when we got home they were all 6 inches.  Rip off.... too much money for a crappie deal."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service here sucks. Had to wait over 15 minutes just for a simple sub."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were OK. The hot ones were cold and the cold ones were warm. Forgot half of my food (I used Uber Eats). When I called back, they left me on hold continued to take new orders. I was listening to them for ten minutes"}
{"text":"I wish I could do 'No Stars'.  I tried 2 sandwiches at different times to see if the problems were one time or systemic.  Unfortunately, it's the latter.   1.  Bread has 'hotdog roll' consistency, OK for kids, or a nice Chicago dog. 2.  Let the customer pick the condiments, the default in most cases is mayo, mustard and dressing?  Give us PC's pacs. 3.  Steaming the sandwich, who was the bozo that came up with this?  You must eat the thing in the shop or while it's still hot.  Otherwise it turns into a soggy mess in a roll. 4.  Honey Ham?  Sweet ham taste like **** on an Italian Sandwich. 5.  what do all these people do?  The shop had about ten people wandering around and the order still took 20 minutes!!!  Goofy layout too, while you're standing in line, you are in everyone way. 6.  I actually would rate Subway higher, and they also get 1 star.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  Please close and open up this location for something worth eating.  Don't waste your time, Don't waste your money, go West, there is a Wendy's about a mile in that direction.  Or east to DQ."}
{"text":"Don't go, awful place.   1.   Slow 2.   Too much staff and crowded eating area 3.   Tasteless deli meats and cheese that are poorly matched 4.   Hotdog Roll quality bread, no tooth 5.   Expensive for what you get  Subway is better and I NEVER eat at Subway."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this Firehouse Sub shop! Our subs are always perfect and tasty...but it's the EMPLOYEES that stand out. Maybe it's because it's new, but it genuinely appears these people are happy to be there and are one big giant bonded family.  We are a family of 7, so when we decide to eat out we carefully weigh our choices. Based On price...selection..and does it offer something we each would enjoy? Firehouse subs meets our dinner out qualifications LoL. We love you Firehouse! Thank you for serving us and those who serve. ....and busting butt to raise $$$ for First Responders. So many good reasons to chose this place and.... Y U M"}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  First time I ordered a hot pastrami sandwich and I wasn't very impressed, based on the price-sandwich ratio.  I tried it again tonight and ordered the NY Steamer.  Corn beef, pastrami, provolone, Italian dressing, mayo on white.  Wow.  Now I am a impressed repeat customer."}
{"text":"This was quite possibly one of the worst customer service experiences I have seen in a very long time.   It was so bad that it was funny. My husband and I were laughing pretty much the whole time we were there. When we got home we read the other reviews for this place and just couldn't stop laughing! Hilarious!  I have never written a yelp review before but I figured this would be a great place to start.  When walking in, we weren't greeted( really not a big deal in a place like this) and we got in line to order. Looking around there were at least 7 people wearing the red employee shirts but I don't know how many were actually on a shift. Some were sitting around texting/talking. The 2 guys behind the counter were laughing about something.  One employee was even in line in front of us! When it was her turn to order she rolled off the most ridiculous order I have ever heard! \"I want the turkey sandwich, no turkey, add mustard, no cheese, sub avocado, no bread, bacon on the side, sauce on the side, half to go, half for here, add onion- just a little onion! Bla bla bla\" her order seriously took 5 minutes. In customer time, that feels like 10 minutes! During this time we just stood in line quietly waiting our turn and giving each other \"the look\" every once in a while!  Finally we ordered. The kid didn't say hi, or apologize for the wait, or ask us what we wanted. Just stared at us until we started talking. Haha!!! He didn't give us a cup for soda or any instructions on what to do next. Do we sit down and they bring it out? Do we wait for our name to be called? No idea  Our order came out wrong. They forgot to make one of the sandwiches. I heard them say they lost the ticket. They had to ask us again what we ordered.   We ordered our food to-go. By the time we got it home both sandwiches were a sloppy wet mess.  Every new restaurant needs time to work out kinks and work on getting a great crew. We will try again."}
{"text":"The food is good, as usual, but this is a new location and the crew is lacking in speed and efficiency. Today was my third, and probably final, visit to this store. While there was no appreciable line of people waiting to order, there were many waiting for their orders. My friend and I noted that there were more people waiting than there were eating.   We have a 30 minute lunch break. We did not make it back before it was over. Hopefully these guys find their flow and move with the hustle I've come to expect from other locations."}
{"text":"I am at a mixed martial arts training today and found the FireHouse subs close by so the group of us came by for lunch.  I've been meaning to try FireHouse out since I came to the Valley 6 years ago but just never had the chance until today. :)  Well I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Smoke House Beef & Cheddar sub and it was very good.  The smoked brisket was very fresh and the BBQ sauce and cheddar was pretty good too.  Also the sandwich was brought out to us as we were chatting at the tables.  Nice touch instead of having to wait for your name or your order.  I'm glad I came by.  FireHouse is on my good list of eats.  Beats Subway, which I would rate a 1.5 on quality of sandwiches.  lol"}
{"text":"Smokehouse beef brisket and cheddar is the absolute best sub ever!!!! This may be blasphemy, but the brisket n BBQ sauce in this sandwich rivals that of any BBQ joint I've ever been to. Yes, it's that damn good!! Go and get one... NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Just like all the other Firehouse subs that I've been to.  They make great subs, much better than Subway.  Service was fast here, even with a group of 15."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place to eat. The Beef and Cheddar brisket sub is fantastic but it's really hard to go wrong on the menu. I wish there were more of these places."}
{"text":"terrible service.  not a single person in the place, 4 employees and no one helped us, we got a dirty look from one of the girls so we left, we will not patronize a place with such poor customer service.  its a shame that people have no work ethic."}
{"text":"best service ever!!!...  my favorite sub is the pastrami sub ... always on point.. staff is so friendly and attentive  and the place alway so clean.. (a+)......"}
{"text":"My new sub place. It just opened.  I wish they delivered. The bread is insanely good. The #3 Corned Beef and Pastrami with Provolone -New York Steamer is nuts good. Even the Italian, which is not usually my first choice is texturally perfect and full of complimentary flavors that hit you in succession. So good. And they have a Pininfarina designed Coca Cola machine. Quite literally, the Ferrari of Soda machines. Also got a meatball sub out of sheer curiosity. The BEST Meatball sub Ive had in my life."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and great service, ordered multiple times never a problem always great sandwich"}
{"text":"Great place to get a sandwich and soda.  The firehouse service was friendly and the place was clean.   Food was good.  I really like adding the firehouse brand sauce on my sandwiches.   I also love the drink sections.    If you are on fire looking for food, come here to get hosed off and fed."}
{"text":"Amazing subs- so glad they opened this location. The service is great, the food is awesome, the hot sauces are delicious, the coke machine is fun- I really enjoy eating here and I look forward to repeat visits. Every other sub place pales in comparison, except Capriotti's, but they have their own special thing going on, so I don't really compare the two.  By the way, the #10 with the Datil sauce is fantastic!! My other favorite is the #5, just as it is. YUM!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars Excellent service + Tasty, Quality meats + Fun Ambience.  Top notch service from cashier to manager, makes Subway feel like an ex whom I'm so over with. Friendly manager (maybe he's the owner?) came by twice during the 2 hours we were there, even remembered what he said to us first time around.   I ordered #1 Hook and Ladder Sub and my friend ordered #10, the most popular Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket Sub. I enjoyed mine fully loaded (except for the onions) and was so impressed I ordered #10 to go, and it didn't disappoint! Both subs packed with lots of meat and robust flavours. Prices are higher than Subway's but hey:  you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.   Deducting half a star becoz they don't offer Multigrain bread nor WiFi. Regardless, I will try to stop by again (and again)."}
{"text":"(3.5) ~ good overall food & service.  NOTES: You can choose between an 8-or-12 inch roll & White -or- Whole Wheat.  Their Beverage Cup is one size & it's EXTRA LARGE!;-)  OUR MENU: ** Engineer Sub (8\" whole wheat) = (4) very good, especially when you add their Capt. Sorensen Hot Sauce:-) * Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket (8\" White) = (3.5) good * Chile = (2)...I've had better:-( * Chocolate Chip Cookie = (3.5) good * Brownie = (3.5) good * Cherry Limeade = (3) ok...but too sweet"}
{"text":"Sad to say great sandwiches, high prices but great sandwiches. So why one star? Customer service, slow lacking enthusiasm and closes early when customers are at the door 15 minutes early.  See my Google review."}
{"text":"Good subs, quiet and very clean, service was fast and all the employees seem nice and courteous"}
{"text":"I gt there steak cheese sub and I added mushrooms, this sammy was delicious except i think they were canned mushrooms not fresh, they tasted very rubbery... everything else was excellent, service was kinda slow but they were very busy. I love all the hott sauces they had, I wanted to tey them all but didnt have enough time or sandwhich. Id def. go back here again"}
{"text":"I've only been here the one time to pick up a sandwich on my way somewhere.  The restaurant seemed clean featuring all the firefighter themed decorations that all the Firehouse locations have.  It wasn't super busy when I was here but did end up waiting a bit longer than expected due to some orders coming out incorrect. Mine however, was exactly as ordered. The sandwich was really good and substantial. I left feeling like I had a quality sub and was full. I didn't notice anything that would prevent me from coming back. Overall it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"I don't work much in the office these days, but try to eat here when I do. I love this place. Took my cousin here for his first time and he liked it as well. The place is clean, the food is good, staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. Try the chicken bacon ranch.  We need one of these is Madison."}
{"text":"My husband and I had this for a late lunch this past Saturday and had the steak and cheese sandwiches.   I loved their soda machine, but my meat was not completely cold, but definitely less than warm and for a hot sandwich, I would expect the steak to be hot.   Other than that, the staff was friendly, but I would probably try out a different firehouse subs shop."}
{"text":"I decided to order online because I wanted to avoid the wait that is inevitable at Firehouse subs. Once I ordered online, my sandwiches would be ready for pickup at 5:35pm. I got to the store a little late at 5:40pm. I was greeted by a zombie-like \"welcome to Firehouse uhhhhhh...\" I let the cashier know that I had an online order and was told it would be ready soon. I waited about 5 minutes for it to be ready. There was one other person there before me. So it took the same amount of time as if I had ordered there in the store. Not sure what the point of ordering online is if you don't get the food when it says it will be ready. I understand if the store was poppin' and they were working like crazy but it was empty and four employees were there. I guess you shouldn't try to upset the long waits at Firehouse and just suck it up and wait for your food. The sandwiches were very good."}
{"text":"i love firehouse! except this is my first time at this location and it was subpar. took 30 minutes no joke to get 1 sandwich!!! no apologies no nothing. 4 people working and takes that long to make one sandwich?? Ill stick to the Goodyear location. hook n ladder was delicious but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food!  Excellent for a quick lunch. I always get the hook and ladder light. Just the right amount of food."}
{"text":"So many choices for subs around these days but Firehouse Subs makes a good sandwich. I used to love their salads; chef salad and chicken salad but they changed them and they are so much skimpy now."}
{"text":"Goodbye subway...hello firehouse! I had the New York Steamer and it was the best sandwich ive ever had at a chain sandwich shop! And don't forget to try their bbq sauce, it's the bomb!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for awhile and keep giving chances but after tonight I don't think I will be back. I always order extra cheese and never get it and to top it off I am charged an extra .75 cents. I put in the special instructions please make sure I get extra cheese and guess what I didn't get extra cheese at all!!! Very disappointing!!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't get the excitement over this place. The subs are sub-par and really lack any creativity from the next sub place. I have given it a few shots and each time I leave wanting more and not hunger wise but flavor wise."}
{"text":"Five people working the line and only 10 people in the seating area. I've been waiting 20 minutes for a sandwich. Watched a guy handle the register then go back to making sandwiches without washing his hands and putting on new gloves. Informed a co-worker and she made him correct the issue."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here since it opened. We were happy because we found firehouse subs in Austin and now we had one here. So we are very pleased when we go in but 4/7/16 we went in at 7:30 there were about four couples in line and two people waiting on take out. After placing our order with the cashier who was friendly we went to sit and found food on the floor under several chairs. Tables dirty, we picked the least dirtiest and just swept the table with napkins. Then realized our napkin disperser only had 2 more napkins! Looking around us the other containers were the same. When we got our order I asked for more BBQ sauce which usually not ever a problem but the guy kinda rolled his head in dissatisfaction! Then I asked my husband to get them because he was upset. I hope this is not the new trend for this location! So sad to see it this way!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and picked up a couple of sandwiches at this Firehouse Subs location. Overall, I had a great experience!  It was super easy to put in an order online and I just scheduled it so I could pick it up just before dinner. My order was ready at my preferred time and the employees were super nice about grabbing it and making sure everything was in order.   The sandwiches themselves were filling and tasty! Exactly what we were hoping for for dinner. Highly recommend this location for efficiency and friendliness!"}
{"text":"Ok so I waited 1 day before writing the review because I wanted to be fair and not be in a grumpy mood from the terrible service I received.    My first time trying Firehouse subs   The service my little son and I received was very unwelcoming and unpleasant, the only reason I stayed was because my son was hungry for a yummy sandwich and was excited to see the firehouse theme, Otherwise I would have left and went elsewhere.    I walk in and at least 4 staff are behind the counter, not one single person greeted us you would think they'd be a bit more enthusiastic being its was grand opening, no one explained the menu options and when I asked about which hot sauce the recommended they said they didn't know because they don't eat that. So I tried 3 different ones the Iguana Gold was delicious but pretty spicy so have a drink handy.     The cashier was the only one with a smile on her face, she was new so wasn't familiar with the menu yet, I had a few questions about the dressing and items on the salad   I picked the Italian grilled chicken with peppercorn Ranch I'll rate it a good 4 since the lettuce had brown pieces and the chicken was so tiny and didn't taste fresh. I'm not a super picky person and know a fresh salad when I see and taste one.  It was a decent size for the price though.  My son had the kids turkey with provolone & added bacon, he rated it a 7-8 and I'll give it the same.  The turkey was very good ! Fresh slices just right, nice portion size, the bacon was nice and crispy a little thin but that's ok  The bread seemed fresh, he ate the whole thing.  He was real happy that they gave him a plastic fireman's hat and a rice Krispy treat  The soda machine is awesome ! It's one of those electronic pick your own mix kind   The plastic ware was a nice touch it looked like real silverware, tons of hot sauce bottles, looked like there were over 10 kinds.  Salt and pepper packets no shakers.    They locked us in & we couldn't get out ugh as if the visit wasn't already upsetting now my kid was scared and they didn't even say sorry  I'm just disappointed in the poor service and unfriendly staff, treat people as you would want your grandparents  to be treated.  Even my son commented that no one smiled   I'll don't think they wanted my business so why should I go back, it's a shame because I was so excited to try it   There are plenty of good food places in the area like modern margarita, yard house, mellow mushroom, heck even sprouts has ffriendlier staff working for them."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner before a movie as we had recently seen a review from a different location on YouTube and they were really impressed. The staff was super friendly as soon as we walked in, the decor is adorable, and they give kids fireman helmets. I got the veggie sub minus tomato and mayo and my boyfriend got the meatball sub - sweet and spicy. You order at the counter, take your number and they come serve you at your table. My sub was good, the bread was great, crunchy on the outside, soft inside, super fresh. The cheese was what also made it because it was kind of boring, and that is why I am deducting a star. If I were a meat eater this review would be 5 stars all day!!! Look at the picture of my boyfriends sub and you'll see why. But look at mine, kinda sad looking huh? I am telling you that yes they are way WAY better than any other sub place around without a doubt. However with so many vegetarians and vegans they need to step up their non-meat game, get creative! Have more than one set vegetarian option on the menu, so many other places have awesome veggie options now so I have faith these guys can do it."}
{"text":"I love this location.  I have had many issues with Firehouse locations (the one on S. Rainbow comes to mind, here in Vegas) getting my order wrong, but this one has gotten it right every time.  I love the steaming process.  The ingredients always seem fresh.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  And it is always clean in here.  The one downside is I wish they were Open 24 Hours like Subway is.  I work overnights and would love to eat there more often either before work or after work."}
{"text":"I've been literally ordered by many people to try this place for lunch, so I finally did. Short and sweet, I've made up a new word to describe Firehouse Subs, phenomenaltastic. Best sub I've had in.. well, ever."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check this place out but couldn't get myself in the door even though I live around the corner. Then I found out they have the best birthday deal in town and picked up a free birthday sub. It was full sized, didn't require an additional order, and didn't demand my signature promising my first born to be greeted into the world with a sub and fire hat so I was both shocked and pleasantly surprised. I ordered the hook and ladder because it appeared the one most advertised. It has turkey, ham, and montery jack cheese. The boyfriend stole a bite and liked it as did I. I am personally partial to feeling healthy with a vegged out raw food \"healthy tasting\" fare but for a birthday caloric splurge after a nice run, I am a fan.   Tip: I would order ahead online during rush times, I felt like I waited about 15 minutes for my sub and eyed the people that ordered ahead enviously. I practically pounced on the sandwich when I saw the reciept before the lady even called for it which is why I should be (but sadly am not) too embarrassed to come back.  I should also warn that I raised my star rating to a 4 because it was an awesome birthday deal, I liked the fireman ambience, and I like the cool soda/hotsauce trend. The sandwich itselt was just a little average."}
{"text":"Heard Good things so being a sub lover I went out of my way to try it. The good was meat quality, lettuce tomato and pickles. Not so good was the bread is doughy, seemed to skimp on the ham and the Italian dressing not so great. Workers were all pretty grumpy. Not likely to be back."}
{"text":"Yum! Firehouse subs are worth the calories!! They are yummy and the staff is very friendly too!"}
{"text":"The employees like to have conversations with each other and the customers rather than make sandwiches. It took 20 minutes to get a medium steak and cheese sandwich. This is not the first time that this has happened at this place."}
{"text":"This location has friendly staff.  Firehouse subs also contribute to first responders.  A worthy cause.  However...  Try as I might , the food quantity and quality falls significantly short of competing sub shops like Jersey Mike's and Lenny's.  The sandwiches fall short of meat and toppings reflective of photos around the dining room.  Disappointing and unfulfilling unless you get a large, and then you are likely filled by bread and chips.   One saving grace is that the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Had to stop in and grab the Monday Meatball Sub special for $5.55....yummy. So glad I stopped at this location. Very good. Very quick. The staff here are great!! Very clean store. Very nice staff. Would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is like a better cleaner and higher-quality Quiznos. I ordered a steak and cheese sub and it was delicious. The friendly staff made my order quick and well.  With Subway taking over the the sandwich market altogether, I was happy to see Firehouse Subs open near me. More competition is always better. I hope this place does well."}
{"text":"FREE sandwich on your birthday. Just show your ID. That's how I got hooked. I was on a mission back in December to get as much free stuff for my birthday. Since then I've been back many times since. Their subs are delicious and staff is friendly.  I've tried a couple different subs but my personal favorite is the Hook and Ladder. Sweet honey ham and turkey. They have a wheat bread option and I like it 'fully involved.' If you don't like the regular chips they also have brownies and cookies with no up charge.   As part of their charity they sell pickle buckets for $2. Just a side note that's cheaper than a Home Depot bucket.   The best part Firehouse subs soda fountain. 120 drink options. which includes diet vanilla coke. I don't know of any other place that offers this. Even though there are closer sub and sandwich shops where I live, Firehouse subs is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Was in the area and had heard only great things.  The cheddar brisket sub on white bread was amazing.  Modern cola machine to customize beverages.  The restaurant staff were super friendly and inviting.  Plenty of parking and the restaurant was very clean.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"It's been far too long since I've had firehouse subs. I went with my original the NY steamer. And of course it was great. Friendly staff at this location."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is very good and the atmosphere is cool! Staff seem very friendly and knows their product!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a sub joint where the sub they make for you looks just as good or even better than the photo on the menu!? Well this place is it! The subs are jam packed with tender meat, fresh veggies and spices. Subway can't compete!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Somehow the Firehouse brainiacs have reinvented the sandwich! My favorite the beef and cheddar brisket (large of course) is a sweet symphony of flavor with a hint of spice at the end. Bottom line is that you can't go wrong with Firehouse because what they have done better than their competitors is the use of quality meats and customer service. I'm not gonna lie I eat at Subway but only because Firehouse doesn't have the same number of locations and at one time I was a faithful customer at Quiznos until the switched their meat supplier (ruined my fav sandwich). All in all the food is great and so is the customer service which makes it easier to lay down my hard earned cash for a great lunch experience. One more thing, always go large! You'll be angry at yourself if you settle for a smaller sandwich."}
{"text":"Firehouse is always great but the staff needs to work on the consistency of ingredients (too much or to little) I've found this to be true at other locations as well, especially in Maricopa."}
{"text":"You ever burn the roof of your mouth because you're too impatient to let your food cool?  Ouch !   The sub sandwiches are excellent but as a bonus, a portion of your purchase goes to the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation, to be used to provide lifesaving equipment to first responders.  Makes that sandwich just a little more tasty to me.   This is a fine location in a fairly newly developed area of town.  The building is nice and the interior is spotless. I've only been here during non-peak hours so the parking has been easy.  You're greeted every time you walk in the door and the service is friendly and helpful.    Have a question about the menu? Ask and get your sandwich ordered the way you want.  The hot subs are what set them above the other sandwich shops out there.  The meatball sub is especially  noteworthy.    There's plenty of seating and a TV to watch as you wolf down your meal or order to go."}
{"text":"The food is good, that's consistent at all Firehouses. The problem with this location are the employees...we come here once every couple of weeks because we like the food more than any other fast sub sandwich place. The employees couldn't care less about their customers, it's obvious that they aren't aware their clientele is listening to their every word. I've always thought the service here was horrible, but today inspired me to finally write a review. A family was eating, and a child of no more than 2 spilled a drink as I was ordering. The person ringing me up was about to get off, and complained that she had to clean up the floor within my earshot. I thought this very unprofessional. Unfortunately, they won't lose my business over their attitude. I just want it to be known: this firehouse subs is sadly not a customer driven environment."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for a quick bite! I was greeted from everyone behind the counter. My order was takin right away. They were quick with the order. The mood was just right for a Saturday afternoon. Music not too loud,very cleanly."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to your \"regular\" sub sandwiches if you're in the mood for something else. My favorite is the roast beef. It can get a little busy in here around lunch time so I always get mine to go in case there isn't available seating. I'd recommend any to try it at least once, though I've been back here a few times!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, 20 minutes waiting for a tuna sandwich, ridiculous, there was 5 people in the restaurant. Not a good 1st time impression. I most likely will NOT come back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the quality of sandwich! Nothing beats the personality of their staff!love Heather!she is the best!!!Kat will forever come to your store!!"}
{"text":"Of all the sub shops in Mayfield (and there are quite a few!) this one is probably my favorite. The food is consistently fast and fresh. Portions are quite large, I don't think I could finish a large sub by myself but it would be perfect for sharing.  I usually get a brisket and cheddar sandwich which comes out hot and delicious, with nice BBQ sauce and cheese. I've tried a few of their other hot subs and they are all pretty good.  Service is fast and friendly and they have a coke freestyle machine. Fun!"}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would! Long story short, I have stage 4 cancer, haven't wanted food since October, ordered, told them that. I am allergic to tomatoes so I nixed that. Flash to home 20 minutes away, open all of my order to see everything BUT my sub. All of my family has tomato so I can't share. Thank you Firehouse for completely letting me down!"}
{"text":"Subs here good!  But if you're on a time crunch or don't feel like waiting the 20 plus mins after ordering and don't like to be greeted when you walk in....  DO NOT GO HERE.  Customer service here needs some serious re-training."}
{"text":"Do not get it to go!! They have a tendency to wrap the pickles with the sandwich. In the 5 minutes it took to get home, our sandwiches were a soggy mess. We couldn't even eat it was so disgusting."}
{"text":"Awesome new discovery for us, visited this franchise in the states. Very glad they opened a location here!  Delicious bread, amazing meats and the toppings combine together for a mouthwatering experience.  Excellent customer service, we will certainly be back and bring friends next time.  Add: the pickle is like a cherry on top of a delish meal, it's perfectly crunchy   Steak and cheese sub on the picture"}
{"text":"The bread is yummy , however I can't say there was anything different from any other sub shop. Your basics with usual toppings. I can't say it was memorable but it was convenient for lunch after going to Payless. Ill probably go again. They do have smaller sandwiches so if you are watching calories that does help."}
{"text":"Heaven!!!!!! Earlier I went to the firehouse subs on Maryland Parkway \"the owner\" was so rude had an issue with how I wanted my sandwich that I ended up not even getting my sandwich so all day I went with out eating till I got of work I craved it all day so I rushed to the firehouse Subs by my house and I got just what I wanted ALL DAY this FIREHOUSE HERE MADE MY DAY !!!!   THANK YOU GUYS FOR MAKING MY SANDWICH JUST LIKE I WANTED IT !!!!   You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"So I was calling an order in for myself and my co workers after I convinced my colognes they had the best hot sandwiches . When I called I placed order I gave them my cologne order first and then I went on placing my order and because I was asking special instructions on mine the lady one phone went on by telling me that what I was ordering was not a turkey bacon ranch I told her I understand I order my sandwich like that all the time and I never had a problem she continue to question my preference in the way I order my food and went on by saying \"well I am the owner and that's not a turkey bacon ranch sandwich \" I substituted the turkey for pastrami and I don't like cheddar so I asked for Swiss Cheese and still I was being told that's not how the sandwich is made so I gave up on trying to place my order and just put in an order for my co-worker ...... so I get to the restaurant to pick up the order and she \"the owner\" didn't even put in the phone order she said because I didn't give her a phone number but I had told her my name and told her I was on the way to pick it up she ones but yet the order was not put in and still I try to put my order in person and again the \"OWNER\" again kept giving me a hard time about what I wanted to eat and how I was going to eat it that I gave up and just said f*** lunch today since I only had 20 mins left before my lunch was over .  The morale of all of this I had never been question so much about the food I was going to eat and I was going to pay for with my own money it didn't make it any better that her tone and approach was so rude that I will never go there again I will just continue going to the firehouse my my house where my sandwich is always done like I like it with out being questioned about it ."}
{"text":"Every hot sub I will ever have after eating at firehouse sub will probably NEVER compare... and if it stood a chance, it'd have to be on its game!   My first sub here was the \"New York Steamer\" which comes with Corned beef brisket, pastrami, melted provolone, mustard, mayo, and Italian dressing.  I always get my subs \"Fully Involved\" (everything on it). This is AMAZING! Their corned beed brisket is to die for!  This was my favorite until I fell in love with their \"Italian\"... Try it and you'll see why. Their Italian comes with Genoa salami, pepperoni, Virginia honey ham, melted provolone, Italian dressing, and seasonings. Its perfectly well put together... every savory meat, veggie and seasoning in there compliments each other perfectly.    Very generous portions.   This is seriously my go-to sub sandwich spot! Theres also many hot sauces to choose from if you wanna add a kick to your sub!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Something local. I'm from Oregon. We don't have one of these up there, that I know of? Excellent sandwich! Had the New York Steamer combo. I'm getting one to go also! Friendly service. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and great service. Can't go wrong with any of the subs."}
{"text":"This was my first time for FH subs. Not something I'm likely to do again any time soon. The avocado and sprouts on my sandwich were old, discolored and stale tasting. The bread was fresh, but it's way more bread and a lot less sandwich filling.   The only saving grace is the unsweetened tea was fresh, and that's not always the case around Vegas. All in all, it was a waste of money.    It's on my way home and was disappointed that it wasn't better. I love sandwiches and would have stopped there more often."}
{"text":"ALWAYS feel welcome, I walk in and they say \"Welcome to Firehouse Subs\"!! The subs are amazing, meat is fresh and the service/hospitality is great!!"}
{"text":"Firehouse subs are delicious.  Even thinking about them makes me want to go back for more.  Staff always offers a friendly greeting.  I keep wanting to try new things on their menu, but the Engineer is just too great to pass up."}
{"text":"No cold sandwiches here. Every sub on the menu is served hot, or so I thought. You can get any sub the good old fashioned way, just order it ALL COLD.  For those counting calories, there are some \"under 500 calorie\" selections, including sandwiches and salads. I opted for the Firehouse Hero (I am quite certain it was a little over 500). It was the perfect combination of roast beef, turkey breast and ham, with melted provolone cheese for good measure. Outstanding, filling and full of flavor. I got the large and powered my way through. A medium probably would have sufficed, however, as they are pretty generous with the ingredients. If you want everything on your sub, order it \"Fully Involved.\" We ordered at the counter and the food was brought to the table. They offer sweet and unsweetened tea, plus have one of those cool fountain Coke machines with 120 different varieties.  Now that I have experienced the Firehouse, I can't wait to do it again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight, and I thought it was fantastic! I got the Italian sub, and substituted the ham for turkey, and it was sooo good.  Very flavorful, my mouth was definitely turned on. My husband got the (?) with turkey, swiss, and mushrooms. Comparing to somewhere like jimmy johns, firehouse definitely wins in terms of deliciousness.  I give it s 4 out of 5 because I thought the service was slightly slow in making just two subs, compared to subway or jimmy johns, but it ended up being worth the wait.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love firehouse subs which is my favorite large chain sub shop. I always get the Italian which is a awesome sub. You can't go wrong at Firehouse Subs"}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich shop! Nice take on the traditional sandwich. The dipping sauces are also great. Try the beef brisket and cheddar. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was on this side of town and decided to drop in to this location.  I love firehouse subs and go to many locations on the other side of the valley. It was lunch time and they were not too busy when I walked in. I ordered and they always ask your name so they can deliver it to you. I told her my name, I spelled it and she repeated it. As I sat there waiting for my sandwich, I saw many others who ordered after me getting their food. I asked the lady running the food to check on it. She said oh I think yours is on the counter. Not sure how long it had been sitting there but a hot sub sitting on the counter for any length of time is not a good idea. She brought it over and matched the order number with my receipt. I asked her what name they were calling. She said Joe? Like it was a question to me. I said my name is not Joe and why they would ask for my name if they were just going to make one up? She said to me very rudely...well you're Joe now. I said no I'm not and I don't appreciate you making fun of the situation. She walked off never to be seen again. Sub on the other was not as good as other locations.  Bread was not soft, turkey seemed dry and overall presence was lacking again compared to other locations.  I think they need to work on cusotmer service here. And if you're going to ask for customer's names....then use them. I watched other people seem confused when calling names as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. I often order large catering orderw for work. They are always very accommodating. The subs are truly delicious. Must try the subs here. If you dont you are missing out."}
{"text":"I usually like this place for food, service, atmosphere etc. But today...man are they struggling. Sandwiches don't normally take this long. I've now been waiting 15 minutes for a sub that should only take about 10 min to make. Understaffed and not very friendly today.  Meanwhile guy comes in after me ordered 2 sandwiches and gets his before me. Took 20 minutes to finally get lunch.."}
{"text":"This place is a very basic above average sandwich shop (compaired to subway/port of subs/quiznos). My wife loves this place and raves about how good it is. I'm not convinced. I've had the cheese steak (bland meat/not enough cheese), meatball (good), and the brisket (not enough meat). I might just be to picky but I expect perfection and the are just above average. My favorite part of coming here is the cherry lime aid and they ran out. It's their signature drink and they ran out."}
{"text":"Wow, this place definitely surprised me. It was a lot better than I had expected. I assumed it would be like any other sandwich place like subway or jimmy johns but this was way better. I was most shocked as to the complexity of favors for a simple sandwich. You don't expect that much flavor from a sandwich but this place elevates a sandwich to another level. The amount of meat in your sandwich is more than generous as you get the full mouthful of juicy meat, whereas other sandwiches like subway or jimmy johns you mainly bite into the bread with a thin layer of meat. It almost reminds me of feel you get from an Italian beef sandwich. I got the New York Steamer Sub. I would get the large sandwich as it is twice the size of a medium. Overall I think this sandwich place is great."}
{"text":"My wife was looking forward to a philly cheesesteak from Hanks, guess what? It's gone. So I jumped on yelp and found Firehouse subs. I am so glad I did.   She got a cheesesteak sandwich which was delicious. The bread was great. Lots of meat and the onions were done just right.   I got the brisket with bbq sauce. It was so good. The plan was to eat half now and half later. Yeah right, that worked out. Before I knew it,  there I was with just the paper wrapper left. Oh well. It was worth it. Great place and they support first responders. Awesome. No picture. Yep, I ate it to soon."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time today and ordered subs to go. Got home to see the sandwich I ordered, with olives, had one olive. Just annoying when I specifically asked to add olives, which they offer as an add on for free, and there's ONE on my sandwich. If I'm paying almost $6 for a small sub, it should be correct."}
{"text":"I recently went here 2 days ago to have lunch with my partner. I wasnt satisfied because  the soda machine was down, which was fine but they told us to grab a drink from the fridge. We got one each and you guys told us to pay for the second one or put it back yet when the machine is running we get free refills its not my problem its down. If i knew that was going to happen i would have never gone there to eat."}
{"text":"POOR EXPERIENCE UPDATE....I finally received a response from the email that I wrote to the corporate offices almost 3 weeks later. I really almost forgot about it, My email specifically stated I was not looking for a free meal, but however I was offered to come have a salad and a kids meal. Now I'm mad over the whole thing all over again.After 3 weeks they should of just left it be."}
{"text":"Prices here are just a rip off. Why spend 5 bucks for a sandwich that's smaller then a chicken nugget?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sub places. There are a number of them further south (Columbus area), so it was nice to see one open up on Strongsville. It's kind of a cross between a Subway and a Dibella's. The subs area always very tasty, but never too filling (at last not the mediums size). And the 120 variety Coke machine is always a fun way to pick (or mix) your favorite soft drink. On this occasion I had the New York Steamer and a Diet Coke Vanilla +Cherry flavoring. Yum."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed at a Firehouse Subs. The restaurants are always clean, the quality and consistency of the food is very good, and the soda machine maker (over 100 flavors) is good fun. They're not the biggest or best subs in town, but they are very tastey and a nice change-of-pace from time-to-time (particularly when you have a craving for a Vanilla-Cherry Diet Coke)."}
{"text":"Cool food why did they force you to write so much that's BS and this is not enough so I got to write more"}
{"text":"The prices have gone up and the portion size of meat is lacking. Much better Value at Capriotti's...Please $9+ for a sub??? maybe? If the value was there, but it's not. I used to eat at Firehouse once a week, have not been back in almost a year since the prices have gone high. Used to be a great sub at a great price. $.749...then $7.79"}
{"text":"I heard of this place from my buddies on Chandler PD as they go there often and told me to try it.  It's a cool theme in there, one I can relate to growing up in and around the firehouse with my dad.  Lots of firetrucks, hoses, and pictures around of firemen.  Lots of hotsauces when you walk in the door - that's nice. Good subs and hoagies and affordably priced - I got a great hot sub for less than what I typically pay for at Subway. And after going to their web site and learning that they have a Foundation where they give money and tools back to First Responders... I'm definitely returning and telling everybody I know about it. And for the record, all the guys and kids working there were really nice."}
{"text":"30 min wait on a sandwich.  None of the counter folk have any urgency.  If you are looking for a quick do yourself a favor and find a different place."}
{"text":"Tyler and crew tonight greeted us with enthusiasm even though they were about to close. Will definitely be back! Great service at this location."}
{"text":"Cave creeks Firehouse Subs was a delight as we searched for  salad and sandwich fare. Trying to maneuver thru the very average restaurants in the area, it's nice to know you can get a good hearty sandwich, decent salad and bowl of soup for under $20 for two. The meat and bread that made up our Turkey ranch sandwich was plentiful and fresh . The large sandwich can easily serve two medium appetites. We were very pleased with our meal at Firehouse."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed best subs I've had so far and I love the menu! Everyone loves it so far so I keep going back! They even have healthier delicious choices for lower calories!"}
{"text":"First time ordering here via door dash. Ordered 3 subs, & 2 soups.   First sub good,  decent amount of meat.  2nd & 3rd sub, lack meat, 2 slices!  The 2 soups were not even halfway full, if they ran out of ordered soup. They could have asked the dasher to call us to sub another soup, or item. Very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Horrible Service, ZERO Customer Service skills. The PUNK kid taking my order had a total attitude from the beginning. A buddy with me agreed that he was very rude and unprofessional. Slammed my drink cup down top down on visibly filthy counter and all. That was all I could take from this PUNK! Then I asked for the \"Manager\" which I could tell he wasn't and he was just as rude because he believed the kid working the register that he didn't do anything. Asked for the Corporate number and the \"Manager\" said \"it's right there\" on a sign they had posted. I said I need a bus. card he said \"I don't have one. AVOID this Firehouse Subs!!! There's better service and actual CLEAN Restaurants out there!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! I love their meatball sandwich and my husband likes to get the one with brisket."}
{"text":"Always busy...always fast...always good!  Love this location because it is centralized with so many food and shopping places.  I come here because it's fast and reasonable and healthy if you go that route...Turkey and brisket choices are my favorites. Melty-toasty-happiness combos for about $9.  Drink options are ridiculous. I dare you to get bored with their drink machine!  Staff always friendly and cleaning everything!"}
{"text":"Went tonight with my 3 year old...she loved it! I love all the subs but this location is exceptionally clean and staff nice.   I love how they offer other drinks besides soda- drink dispenser is computerized and offers lots of alternatives like flavored dasani water. I go to firehouse one a month but this location is my favorite!  Lots of sauce choices and I love new light menu. The kids get little firehats with their meal. Love it!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas instead of the try firehouse subs. Momo and Reggie helped us and gave us a superb customer service. Or meatball sub chips and drink were delicious. The Decour was the bomb. The location was very clean and cute. Great customer service"}
{"text":"This location always has good subs. Very consistent. Fast and friendly. They are on Uber eats also. The smokehouse beef brisket is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Just noticed this place the other day and since it is close to my house my guest and I decided to walk to it with the thought being that we might burn off some of the delicious calorie load we were about to take in. Neither of us had heard of Firehouse Subs before so we were curious, but no disappointments here!   The food: Firehouse Steak & Cheese $6.99 (steak, cheese, peppers and onions) Engineer $6.69 (Turkey, swiss, grilled mushrooms)  We both went with medium hot subs under $7 and decided to forgo any sides or desserts (although the cookies look really good). I want to say the mediums are 8 inches long which is a pretty good sized sub. We both really enjoyed our subs a lot! Very tasty and filling.   The theme is firehouse stuff if that wasn't obvious. One weird bit of decor though was huge painting with a kangaroo off to the side. Apparently the owner is from Australia.   Only negatives would be that everyone greets you loudly at once when you walk in. Comes across a bit forced and not so genuine as one simple direct smile and hello would. Also I think the subs take a little longer than other seasoned subs shops, but this could be because the place is new and still training/working out the kinks. Lastly it's a sub shop so not a ton of variety, but will satisfy you if you're in the mood for deli meat on a big bun.   All in all I would definitely come here again! Nice competition for Jersey Mike's and Penn Station."}
{"text":"I'm wondering why I'm an American, in an American establishment and they're playing all of the football games and stuff in Spanish. Disgusting. My last visit here."}
{"text":"Solid sub. Best sub out there for chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Over the years firehouse subs have gotten worst with their food and staff. Sloppy, fast, careless made sandwiches. Every time I get my subs to go they turn out to be a jumbled up piece of shit."}
{"text":"I love this firehouse its always clean and the staff are so friendly i got the turkey bacon ranch with banana peppers it was the best sandwich ive had in a long time the staff was more then willing to help me anyway they could"}
{"text":"I love the subs here! Much better than Subway or Port of Subs. The staff is extremely nice and attentive. Every time I go everybody greets me and makes me feel at home. The owner Michelle is a sweetheart! I highly recommend stopping by here!! The prices are about the same as Quiznos but much more tastier and better quality."}
{"text":"We tried Firehouse a few weeks ago and are telling all our friends and family to check them out! The subs are SO good and the variety on their menu is much more extensive than most places. The staff is friendly and I love the atmosphere.  Another huge plus is that they are one of the few restaurants I have been to that has the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine which is AMAZING!!  The only reason I couldn't give them 5 stars is because the service is a bit slow and they have forgotten things both times we have been there for the kids meals (the fire hat and Oreo cookie). Not a huge a deal, of course :)  We will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"After speaking with management, it is obvious they care about customer feedback and I'm glad they seem to be getting on top of things."}
{"text":"Maybe it was all the hype, maybe it was the high prices, or maybe it just wasn't that good.  I dunno, I suppose that I have high standards when it comes to a sandwich - and in all my years this is the 1st Italian sandwich I've ever had that just overwhelmed me with sweetness (for the record, NOT a flavor most want on a sandwich not involving peanut butter or Nutella).  I'm guessing it was the mustard that caused the sweet flavor - taking that off might improve the whole thing greatly - but it was also soggy by the time I got home.    Major points for the modern age Coke machine (with a gajillion flavor combinations) but that's not enough to woo me.  It's a good idea to steam your meats and cheeses, I imagine that does change the flavor profile a bit, but not enough to charge me ten bucks for a soggy / sweet footlong.  I might be back, but mostly for the freakin' cool soda machine.  Until they can be beaten, Jersey Mikes still takes the pickle for one of the best sandwich franchises ever."}
{"text":"The meatball sub was terrific. The person taking orders was a little unfriendly. The person that delivered our sub was cheerful. I'd definitely go here again"}
{"text":"Stopped by when I was in the area. My boyfriend and I are from California and we were visiting family. We looked around for a good spot to try out other than sonic (that's his go-to) and thank goodness we came across this gem. The people who work here are very nice and are more than willing to help you out. Always appreciate that. The subs here are sooo good! I got the Italian with the broccoli cheddar soup and my boyfriend got the New York steamer with a brownie. We both really loved the food. The bread was soft and warm and tastes fresh and the subs are filled with flavor. Ten times better than a subway, for sure. It was so good that we couldn't pause to take photos. Gonna be back when we're back in town."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I may have had the best sandwich to date here in Vegas at this Firehouse. Just to be sure, I've gone back on three separate occasions! I decided to opt for the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket combo which comes with a soda, choice bag of chips, and a sliced dill pickle.  First off, I absolutely adore the Coca-Cola machine in which you fill your cup. It is one of those electronic touch-screen ones you can find at places like Five Guys Burgers and Fries and Wing Stop, in which you can fully customize your soda with added flavors such as vanilla, orange, cherry, and much more.  With the sandwich, you are given the choice of white or wheat bread which is topped with deliciously moist and tender beef brisket which has been smoked for over 16 hours. Add cheddar cheese, mayo, and savory Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and you have a sandwich fit for the gods. Be sure to eat it quick before you decide to take a look at the nutrition facts! This sandwich definitely packs a WALLOP in the caloric, fat, carb, and sodium departments!"}
{"text":"We enjoy coming over for lunch! I love that they make the sandwiches fresh and toasty!! The freestyle machine gives plenty of drink options. You can get chips or a cookie with your meal or pay to get a salad, chili or brownie. Restaurant was clean and staff was friendly. There current promotion is $5.55 sub of the day!"}
{"text":"We where greeted as soon as we came in, restaurant was clean and we where able to place our order right away. When they brought the food out my order was wrong. They apologized and fixed it right away. Food was delicious! So glad that we came into this location tonight!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and I don't know if it is due to the food court almost being entirely shut down for renovations or if it's just the staff there but the food and the service combination wasn't the best. It did take a really long time for us to get our food. When we finally did it was basically slapped together. There were several people on staff at the time however they were walking back and forth as well as texting. The girl who rang us up, also made our food. And there was a second girl wiping the tables and taking out the trash. Both young ladies were very friendly though. The experience could have been better."}
{"text":"The soda fountain is so 21st century.  A touch screen and a bajillion options for your soda.  I review this first because it's the first thing you encounter when you walk into the place.  The service is fast, the staff is ok (I think the girl at the register was having a bad day because she just seemed 'over it'), and the food is tasty-tasty.  I had the 'engineer sandwich' which consisted of turkey, swiss, and mushrooms (nom nom nom), and the combo came with chips and a pickle spear.  I took it to-go as I wasn't about to hang out in a lobby full of rambunctious kids (all the more to you parents and kids, but it was too loud for me).    It's frequented by law enforcement too, as while I was there, I saw LVMPD and NHP vehicles in the parking lot and some officers chowing down.  Infinitely better than Subway or Quiznos.  Mmhmm."}
{"text":"Delish sandwich. I went for the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket. I love them. The hot Sauce bar is U.N. stoppable! My mouth is lit up!!"}
{"text":"For the first time ever I have found a delicious and healthy wheat bun! I tried the Hook & laddder light and it was delicious. The meat in the sub was very juicy, not like your typical subway sub. When it comes to this place I do believe you pay for the quality and taste.The customer service was also great!"}
{"text":"Nice to see a chain that holds on to their employees. Always see the same employees every time I am in. Ever since my first trip here I can't get myself to go to any of the other sub shops specially the ones containing \"way\" in their name. Yeah this place takes a little more time to make you food then the others and it's not a point and add type assembly line and it's not needed here. Honestly do you want to stand in line behind the person relaying every ingredient that their friend wants whit their cell phone to their ear? No. That's what makes this place great also. Now the food well it's a sub and it's good what else? Well you know you don't want to pass up the coke freestyle with a million choices to tease your taste buds with. Oh if the sub isn't enough guess what, there's a almost hidden pickle there that you overlooked while scarfing down you sub and checking your favorite social media app! Dang! At the end of the day you look back and think man I whispered such a good place would come up with a rewards system, but guess what they nailed that too! Not only that but they have a kind of but not really hidden Monday double points day that get you earning that free sub more quickly then you remember to buy one of those awesome pickle buckets cladded in their logo that supports your local fire men! By the way, the local fire support this place too. You can run into them at lunch and if they are in line behind you make sure you say yes to round your total to the nearest dollar that goes directly to the local fire fighters! Phew! That was a lot to read and it's all mashed together, I know but no one can reply and complain on here so enjoy my review and keep it to yourself! Yum!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a great sub, you can't beat this place. We go to two different locations, both off eastern and they are both very constant with there food and service. My four year old son love this place for the fireman Decore and of course the free fireman helmet (I think we have about 10 now). There staff is always sweet, personable and kid to my very talkative child. I am sure we will be there again soon to get a \"fireman sandwich\""}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experiences here lately. I enjoy these sandwiches more than other sandwich chains, and they always take their time with making sure it's quality (in my opinion). Always a returning customer, never had a bad experience, and look forward to continue eating there!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week. Went with the turkey, bacon ranch on wheat, subbed provalone for the cheddar. Very tastey! Staff was friendly and the sandwich was served to me and my coworker rather quickly. Better than your average sandwich shop like Subway or Port of Subs."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way home from work.  Ordered a Reuben sub combo and a Smoked Turkey sub combo.  Got home and no Turkey sub and no Reuben sub.  Instead we got a tuna sub and a turkey something.  Not what we ordered, not even close.  Called the store and they said oh we mixed up the orders but you can come get your sandwiches, they are here and ready for you to pick up...EXCUSE ME?!? There was no no offer of a discount, refund anything for the inconvenience of getting in my car and driving back to the store for sandwiches I should already have.  I understand mistakes happen but when you run a business and cause your customer to be inconvenienced the right thing to do is to offer something in return like maybe a coupon for a free sandwich on your next visit?  It was not my mistake but I feel I paid for it."}
{"text":"The sandwhich at first was yummy then all of a sudden my sandwhich fell apart all mushy and moist. It was terrible.  I couldn't  eat the other half of the sandwhich. The meat was the soggy part. All they were concerned was how much money they made in 2 hours. They lost us as a customer bye"}
{"text":"These are some mighty fine subs.  We stopped in for lunch today, with my wife having the Thai Chili special sub (which has pork on it) and I went with the New York steamer (brisket and corned beef).  Both were outstanding. Easily some of the best subs I've had, and I am pretty damn picky about my sandwiches.    Service was fast, friendly and efficient.  Even though the place was packed on a hot Saturday afternoon, with what looked like a little league team and a birthday party going on, our order came up quick.  Just loved this place."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is one of the best sub places around, in my humble opinion. We miss them from when we lived in South Florida. We found this Firehouse Subs just as good and consistent as back in Florida.  First of all, their meatball subs are like a work of art. It's not often that I have seen such a beautiful, mouth-watering meatball sandwich - I'm not exaggerating about that either.   I came back to Firehouse Subs and got another one the other day and it was like reuniting with that one girl; you know, that one from college you never told your parents about... aww yeah, what memories.  Their other sandwiches, while not being as visually stunning as the meatball, have their appealing idiosyncrasies. Sort of like that other girls from college - all kinds of varieties with their own appeal in one way or another.  Some were \"fiery hot\" while other were more sophisticated and refined.    This is a great place for a sub sandwich!  They food is very tasty, service is fast and friendly and they are conveniently located just south of the 101Hwy on 67th Ave.  I hope to see you there."}
{"text":"I always go to this Firehouse, and it's consistently good. Great stop for a sandwich, I usually get a wheat with chicken, lettuce, and mayo. Simple, but it's delicious. They also have my favorite Ms. Vickie's chips, which are fantastic. I highly recommend them. The brownies are also very good. Service is good, usually with a smile. One of the managers actually took the time to explain the new Coke machine and how it worked, nice touch."}
{"text":"So I ordered food from UberEATS and my order went through and then after I waited an hour for my food I went to check why it had not been delivered it said my order was cancelled without any notice and because they never gave us any notice we were unable to order any other food from a different place. After a long day the last thing you want to do is what an hour for food to find out you won't be able to eat tonight because the restaurant cancelled your order. On UberEATS it says that I was still charged and will check in the morning but completely disappointed with the lack of communication."}
{"text":"I was slightly skeptical about this place before going but after reading good reviews and seeing the menu I had to try it out.  It was packed at lunch time on a Friday, which was a good sign. I loved the theme of the place and was surprised how much personality it had, following the Fireman theme all the way through.  From the insane selection of hot sauces on the side wall, all number by order of hotness (heat?), to ability to round up your bill to the nearest dollar with all proceeds going to firefighter charities, it has a feel of its own.  The wait times are a bit long but you quickly understand why when you dig into the food. Just fantastic. Skirts the line between deli and sub shop, with really smart use of things like dijon mustard and creamy italian dressing to make the amazing meat in the sub just POP.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The owner is awesome!  He is always friendly and efficient and the location is always cleaned and well maintained.  The subs are consistently good.  I like the hook and ladder!"}
{"text":"Firehouse subs is a new fav spot!  My boss picked it up for our luncheon and boy was I impressed seeing as how I had never heard the name before. I ordered the 8 inch Turkey Bacon Ranch with the dressing on the side to avoid any unnecessary dripping, accompanied by jalepeno chips and a lemonade. The meat was very fresh along with the bread. There was a good amount of lettuce that could have been filled with other veggies, but that is usually the case with other sandwich eateries.  Overall I will be going back to try another one of their hot specialty subs!"}
{"text":"My family stopped by here while coming home from a trip as we enjoy trying new restaurants. We ordered a large Meatball Sub (regular), a small Turkey Bacon Ranch and a kids Grilled Cheese meal. My wife and I also ordered ours as a \"meal\" with a drink and side salad.   The staff was friendly and explained how they steam their meats and toast their rolls separately. Good to know. Before we could even fully sit down, the server brought out the salads. They were nicely sized for a side salad, however, a little light on dressing for my taste. Just as we were finishing those, our sandwiches arrived.   I must say, WOW was my sub HUGE ( I did get a large after all). Because they toast the roll separately, it stayed nice and crispy with the melted cheese and sauce. So good, so so good. My wife's sub was perfectly sized for her and she loved every bite. The grilled cheese, while being for a kiddo, was disappointing. Now, I wasn't expecting a four cheese masterpiece, but it was a single slice of barely melted cheese between toasted bread. if for the same price, I can get a kids meatball sub, you'd think they'd at least put a second slice of cheese in it.   All in all, we were happy with the experience for the most part. The prices being a little on the higher side and the mediocre grilled cheese lowered the review to four stars. That said, we will try them again and I will adjust the review at that time."}
{"text":"Worst Steak and cheese I have ever gotten.  No flavor virtually no cheese on sandwich and way too much mayonnaise.  No other customers and was still very slow to receive food.   Definitely will not return here!!"}
{"text":"This place is on the www.tourdesub.com list. It is a favorite so far!! The theme is awesome and they are do-gooders!"}
{"text":"Past three months the service and food has gone to hell. One time a few weeks ago I walked in to order, two people behind the counter just standing there talking to each other. Never said a word and then after about two mins one of them finally looks and me and say \"You ready\". I told her I was ready when I walked in, but since you don't seem to wait on me I'll take my business elsewhere and left.  I decided to try again and this time at least one of the sandwich makers at least welcomed me when I walked in. Another lady took my order. When I got my food the ends of my sandwich were burnt, but at least it was hot unlike two times before when my meatball sub was Luke warm and the meatballs were cold inside. When I started going there my sandwich me were alway served so hot I had to wait 5 mins to start to eat and they were not served burnt. They changed owner and management about three months ago and neither one seems to give a crap about service or the quality of what they serve you. Now Rubio's and Five Guys get most of my business. It's a shame because I liked the sandwiches and service I use to get there before. Leadership and service starts at the top and these people fail miserably."}
{"text":"Excellent, tasty subs and very friendly service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good but today the bread taste chewy like it was microwaved. For that price, quality always has to be on point. Might be a game changer for me."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and enjoyed the meal for sure. The location seems larger than other ones I have been to and is designed well. Staff were all super friendly. As for the food, I knocked out the beef and cheddar and it was very good. Barbecue and cheese, what a combination. Overall, a very good experience."}
{"text":"My family loves Firehouse Subs and we are so glad to have a location now in Goodyear.  We have stopped by twice and had great customer service and the food to go along with it. You can always trust Firehouse to be a step up on its competitors. Places like Subway and Jimmy Johns do not stand a chance against the quality Firehouse puts out. In addition to their killer subs, we love the hot sauce options and especially their homemade sauce. Great food, great customer service, great place; enough said."}
{"text":"They have great service and the subs are the best. My family love coming to this location for the great service and the great food. They have the cool coca cola soda dispenser.   If you have kids ask them for a fire men hat. Kids love those."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwich is life great service. Super friendly staff fast and great size portions"}
{"text":"Hands down the best firehouse I have been to. Just got a personal delivery of Gator Hammock to my table when I emptied a bottle. I appreciate the conscientious service and the usual \"welcome to firehouse\" when I walk in.  Manager is always visible working and ensuring patrons receive good service. Restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"This firehouse subs location at the epicenter is great....even though almost all firehouses are great lol. I came here during lunch time, but even though they had a lot of customers, they were still able to get me my sandwich in a timely manner. All the staff were really polite when I walked in and while serving me.   My turkey bacon ranch sub was amazing and fresh and ready to be taken down. It was too good...ahh the fresh bacon, melted cheese on wheat bread was close to heaven in my mouth lol. All in all, a great experience here and I will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I love the decor of this place it is clean. The food was good too. My friend  recommended  it to me and she was right. The side dishes was Yummy too. I was waiting for the good looking firemen to come and start cooking but hey the food was was great so I cannot  ask for more. Lol."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I came here. The sandwiches  here are amazing, I had the beef cheddar brisket  and this sandwich is so delicious. So if y ou are looking for a great sandwich place try this place."}
{"text":"Yum. Freakin yum. I have been mostly Paleo for about a year or so, and I've all but cut bread out of my diet, but damn these things are tasty. Like how I would make a sandwich at home if I had time and skills. Toasty bread. \"steamed meats\" I guess is their thing. And oh it is delicious. I've had the Steamer (pastrami and corned beef. yummmmmm....) and the Italian which is dripping goodness.  I love the shelf of hot sauces from around the globe, all rated 1-10 by the heat factor."}
{"text":"First time to Firehouse subs and received  outstanding service from Momo and Reggie.  Loved the meatball sandwich!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised when I went to this place. The food is delicious and the employees are great too.. I'm definitely making Firehouse my new sub shop!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and the atmosphere is fun.  Although I'm generally not a fan of subs, the sandwiches here were good.  For those who like a lot of meat, the subs here are stacked thick and the servings are big.  I though the meat-to-veggies ratio was off, but I guess that's because I like a lot of veggies.  There was also slightly too much sauce, causing the sandwich to get a bit soggy. Overall, I like this place, and the restaurant itself is nice, clean, with friendly service."}
{"text":"Always SO friendly, even when.customers are jerks... They don't take tips, instead they donate the extra change to the Chandler Fire Dept. The food is awe-some! Everything I've ever gotten is great (The Engineer, The Club, The Steamer, The Hook&Ladder). The sandwiches are always loaded and they come out fast."}
{"text":"Long Waits orders done wrong and no manager insight other customers were also waiting very long Waits I saw many other people frustrated when they're food orders were wrong"}
{"text":"This place is great if you eat it immediately in store. If you get it to go, your sandwich will be soooooo soggy by the time you get home because of how they prepare their subs."}
{"text":"First time here today and last time. Ruined my sandwich by forgetting to put what I asked for. Seems like they mixed mine up with someone else's.  Sadly it was to go so I didn't realize till I got home."}
{"text":"40 minutes still no food, we were told at least 30 minutes more before we get our food, no thanks asked for a refund.   Would have been good to know when we ordered."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!! And it was from the manager too. He just seemed so uninterested in what I was saying and was very sarcastic with his answers."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've had Firehouse Subs and I was thoroughly disappointed. Made a pickup order for the Italian sub. When I got home, maybe 10 minutes away the sub was extremely soggy. Very bready and bland, not much of an Italian taste. The meat was piled on high but all I could taste was the ham. Ordered my sandwich no tomatoes with oil and vinegar and jalapeños. Definitely missing the jalapeños and I'm unsure if the oil and vinegar was on the sandwich. Online ordering was very easy and straightforward,but my sandwich was not done when I got there. I will try Firehouse again but I recommend sticking to Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mikes!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal here. The staff is always cleaning and making sure the floors are clean. They are fast at turning out to go orders and always ask how your meal tastes when dining in."}
{"text":"I'm a big sub fan and especially love pastrami and corned beef. When I saw a sandwich on the menu with both I was excited, little did I know the sub would come out to my table 15 minutes later as a mess. It was so salty too. I don't recommend their sandwiches as they seem very high in sodium."}
{"text":"Best subs in the world.  Melt in your mouth.  Tremendous service."}
{"text":"The service and the food is so so good. This is a real sandwich shop who cares about customers love of good sandwiches."}
{"text":"Every time I step in to Firehouse Subs I am pleasantly surprised by it's cleanliness and the friendly, professional service offered by the young men and women employed there. It truly is a refreshing experience and a step above any other day food joint some town. Their sandwiches are also very good with fresh ingredients and fresh breads (white or wheat). They also offer a healthy sampling of various sauces that you can add you your sandwich yourself ranging from 1-10 on the \"hot/spicy\" scale.   Firehouse Subs really is just a nice, casual experience with sandwich offerings for every appetite and for every flavor preference, even for the most picky of eaters.   If you're looking for a great sandwich and first class service, look no further than Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"Just left the North Olmsted location and couldn't get on to review fast enough!  AMAZING!!! I had the Smokehouse Brisket. The bread was fresh, the brisket was cooked PERFECTLY (very tender), overall flavor was phenomenal.   Coming from managing and opening new restaurants I know the work it takes to make the establishment successful. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Fire house sub is great! very close to the house and delicious subs! if you are looking for something similar to subway with a wider variety of flavor profiles I would recommend trying Fire house! its great! their take on the philly is amazing and the huge assortment of hot sauces provide great tastes for any sandwich selection!"}
{"text":"I ordered 7 sandwiches and several other items.  Everything was ready and bagged when I arrived.  When I got to the office to and distributed the sandwiches, I noticed there was a sandwich missing.    The first person wanted me to drive back to their store to pick up the sandwich.  When I told him I was going to drive back to their store because of their mistake, he transferred me to a manager.    The manager took control of the situation and said she would deliver the sandwich.    Better late than never."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful sub restaurant and it benefits firefighters plus other causes. The sandwiches come with many vegetable, meat and cheese choices. It's easy to order a vegan sandwich here because the counterhelp pays attention to detail.  The employees are very courteous and helpful. I've started coming here since Subway on N. Decatur next to the Tokyo store changed managers.   On August 6, 2016 if you bring in a 24pk, 16 oz bottles of water to Firehouse Subs you will receive a FREE medium sandwich."}
{"text":"I normally always come in here for Uber eats every once in a while I get a sandwich. And the guy at the front desk is always polite."}
{"text":"Fantastic hot subs and a very clean, well kept location. However, the service during my last visit was horrible. The two women working were rude with my party and were extremely loud once we were seated. One team member would be standing by the door nearly yelling at the other team member who was at the register. Considering there were less than 10 customers in the location at the time, it was extremely unnecessary. The conversations consisted of the latest high school gossip and talk about \"walking out if management wasn't here\". It's hard to beat a hot sub from Firehouse but the unprofessional staff makes it hard to WANT to return."}
{"text":"A different type of sandwich as it is heated meat. They do come fully involved with mayo cheese and everything else so not terrific if you are watching what you eat. But you can eat healthy if you remove the fully involvement.   The bread is really good and a pickle spear comes on the side. Their chili is super good too but has enough calories to be a full meal by itself. One unique feature is the computerized drink machine. You can combine so many drink combos that you could come back everyday and not have the same one."}
{"text":"Past 2 times I've been there they have been super busy and I think they don't take the time to run the sandwiches thru the toaster they just hurry up and make them both times my sandwich was cold. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I've been here at least 3 times now, I've narrowed my favorite sub to the Turkey Bacon Ranch with everything! This is one of the largest sub shops I've seen (as far as seating goes!) The sub is served warm and they ask if you would like a pickle spear on the side. You can get chips or cookies on the side too (I like not being tempted by the choice of fries!) They have the high tech Freestyle Coke machines and I love getting the Diet Coke with Orange!  Everyone is friendly and I love the cute firehouse theme, complete with Dalmatian spotted tables. My husband LOVES the Italian sub (I had a bite and it is VERY good!)"}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars based only on the deliciousness of their meatball sub with provolone .  Yes!  It's that good.  Maybe one day I'll try a different sandwich.  But it's so hard to deviate from the meatball."}
{"text":"We love coming here the food is always super tasty and the service is always fast and friendly. We especially were impressed by Tony. Such a great employee!!!"}
{"text":"I love having the Italian sub here. So good. The soda machine is fun to use.  Here's something random: Check out the painting on the wall. Is the fireman holding a guitar??"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would.  This place is terrible.  I get that its just a sandwich shop, but they cant even do that right.  It literally took them 15 or more minutes to make my sub.  There was no one else in line.  And only two people in the shop.  It's a really tacky looking dump.  At least it was clean.  My sub tasted worse than Subway but cost more.  Don't waste your money here.  For the record, I ordered the Turkey Bacon and Ranch sub.  It was flavorless.  Utterly Flavorless, and my sub wasn't toasted nearly enough."}
{"text":"Why does this say that it closes at 10 but it actually closes at 9? Very misleading and disappointing :("}
{"text":"Update: just tried it again. It's fixed now. Less than ten minutes wait. Food and service was great."}
{"text":"Gross. Never been here and I told the girl at the counter that. My Dad & I ordered a turkey, roast beef & provolone with everything (lettuce, tom, mayo, etc). She didn't bother to ask me if that was hot or cold. So we get our food, get to the drive in, settle in and go to grub...it was a Hot Disgusting Mess. Really? Who on earth would serve someone a hot sub without asking? It is obviously not something that is done normally at any other sub shop so your best bet is to ask a new customer whether they would like it hot or cold. Am I right?? I was absolutely disgusted by the sloppy and soggy mess. I could have thrown up."}
{"text":"Only to make things worse- when we got to the ballpark and opened up our subs, one was missing mayonnaise and the other had only turkey and lettuce on it. The receipts specified it was a Malibu with turkey, avocado, bacon, lettuce only. And we got half of the 4 ingredients. So terrible."}
{"text":"I love a good sub and Firehouse is a pretty solid choice for me. I always get a hot sub and it's delicious! Food does take a few minutes to get to you so it's not super \"fast\" food but still can eat in or take to go. Prices are between $5-10 a sub, depending on size, toppings, meats etc.   Good choice, close to home, will be back."}
{"text":"I had the hook and ladder today as always and it was amazing! Of corse! The staff today was exceptionally awesome being very cool and talking to me nice. They just opened and were very fast. I love firehouse and will continue to go"}
{"text":"Amazing subs. Love everything on the menu! White or multigrain sub rolls that are absolutely delicious, topped with fresh ingredients, and hot steamed meats! Superior quality and service make this one of my favourite places to grab a quick bite. A little more expensive than Subway or Mr. Sub, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Here from out of town, never been here before and searched for one online where I live after my first bite. I got the Italian and loved it. It's a strange thing but their pickles are awesome also. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sub place I've ever had. The \"hook & ladder\" is a favorite but their steak and cheese is also the best philly cheese steak I've EVER had. The place is clean, people are super friendly and it is a laid back environment."}
{"text":"Awful service, ordered sandwich, they put the bread in the toaster, it came out and stayed in the rack, cashier picked up a broom and dust pan, but another customer came in, she talked about their baby while we were still waiting.  Another employee was in the corner texting, another went in the back and never came out.  Nobody wanted to make a sandwich, left without the sandwich, they treat customers like crap, then they won't get my business."}
{"text":"Today was my second time having one of there fabulous subs , heard great reviews on  the smoked beef cheddar briscit so gave it a try ..wow is all I have to say...having had ther  meatball sub before wich was amazing in it's self ....I am not sure wich was was better they were both so amazing hot full of flavour fresh ...the customer service at this location is bar none 10 out of 10 top notch ..if you want a great sub forget Subway get a Firehouse no comparison best in town"}
{"text":"We thought we would give them another chance as my son wanted a sub. Clearly they still don't have the cleaning portion down.  The tables were cleared off, but the floor and carpet in front of the drink station was disgusting.  The garbage cans needed to be wiped down desperately.   The manager was on site and stood by the cash register for some time. She was very attentive to the customers coming in, but nothing with the environment.   The price for what get is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly staff, great service, delicious subs, and you can choose to round up your purchase to the nearest dollar to donate proceeds to public safety."}
{"text":"Good food but service is slow slow slow slow.  Feel sorry for the manager.  He tells the employees to pick up place but they don't care and just ignore him.  They just continue working at a snail's pace."}
{"text":"As far as kid-friendly, chain restaurant, sandwich shops go, this place isn't bad. I'm actually a fan. The sammies aren't incredibly inventive but some of them are tasty. I like their beef brisket and cheddar sandwich, but the BBQ sauce they use is way too sweet.  They tend to be heavy-handed with the sauces on all their sandwiches, which is always a negative in my book. I tried the turkey bacon ranch the other day and it was drowning in mayo. Despite that, I'll still come back because my son likes their sandwiches. They get points for having a kid-sized menu plus he loves the plastic fireman hats they give out."}
{"text":"This Firehouse Subs is delicious! I like how the staff greet you as you come in.  My favs are the\"Meatball\" and the \"Hook and Ladder\". If you like it spicy then when ordering the meatball say \"make it sweet and spicy\" it is so good! The \"H&L\" was for sure my fav.  You can order online! They have a small patio area where you can sit outside and eat.  I'm so glad we have Firehouse Subs I just love this place.  The decor is cool and it is very clean inside."}
{"text":"I have been stopping by here for lunch and like the subs I have had. Inside is very clean and the employees are friendly and say hello when I walk in. They have plenty of tables if you want to eat inside, but I get my food to-go. The meat is sliced fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. Sometimes they can get busy around lunch time and since I'm on a time limit for lunch, I just call in my order for pick up so that it's ready when I arrive.   Hook and Ladder - A medium costs $5.99 and includes a pickle. The sub has smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham and monterey jack cheese. I like it \"fully involved\" which means it comes with deli mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce and tomato. Per my request they leave the lettuce off. The subs are served hot and this sub is my favorite of them all. Usually I don't like deli mustard, but there is something about it on this particular sub that just makes it taste great.   Firehouse Meatball - A large costs $8.49 and depending on your appetite could be shared between two people. This sub has Italian meatballs, provolone, marinara and Italian seasonings. I usually order this one \"sweet and spicy\" which means they add pepper sauce and red pepper flakes. I really like this meatball sub a lot. It's always hot, the bread good, meatballs good, melted cheese good, but..... there is a consistency issue with the taste of the sweet and spicy part. Sometimes it's just right and sometimes they put so much pepper sauce that it's too hot. When this sub is good it's very good, but when it's drenched in pepper sauce it's hard to taste anything else.   The medium sub is just perfect for my appetite. If you are the type like my husband who eats 1 footers, you might want to order the large sandwich. They also offer catering."}
{"text":"Yum! First time eating here. Ordered the Club on a Sub with marinated mushrooms and black olives added. Loved it. Lots of meat, veggies and just the right amount of condiments.   Only issue (which is my fault not theirs) is, it took me 20-25 minutes to get home so the marinated mushrooms made the bread squishy in a couple spots. Would order without them next time or eat in. Still great flavor though. I was very pleased. Will go again!"}
{"text":"First time trying Firehouse Subs since we were visiting from Washington State where there are no Firehouse Subs locations. Excellent food. Great service. Very friendly employees. We went twice because we were so happy with food and service. Would definitely come back if and when we come back to Vegas . Thanks so much."}
{"text":"The meatball sub was amazing. Generous portions and fills you up. Staff was friendly and restaurant was clean. No lines ever during lunch. Generous chip selections."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant with my family due to a family member recommendation.  It was terrible!  Soaking with oil, the bread was inedible.  I asked for certain items to be left off of the sub, and I was told they come as they are.  You can't have the kind of cheese you want, or the condiments that you want or even the size you want.  These sandwiches are made only one way, and if you ask for something different, it blows their minds!"}
{"text":"I went here for an Italian sub it was horrible. The staff was nice but clearly they have no clue how to make a good Italian sub just another run of the mill generic sub place. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this Place... Sandwiches are great, everyone that I have dragged to this place wants to come back for more."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey bacon ranch SANDWICH... I told him no meat and then continued to read off what I would like, (onion, lettuce, cheese, ranch and mayo)... the lady brings the sandwich out to me and I say \"no meat, right?\" And she said \"yes! No meat\"!   I get home, it's a bowl with the sandwich stuffings. No bread and there was bacon!  I called and she's says \"ohh, you wanted the bread?\" What!!!???? I didn't know I had to mention I would like bread with my sandwich?  The girl then said \"oh you didn't want bacon either\" when responding to my saying I double checked no meat before leaving!   The only thing they could offer was for me to bring the \"bowl\" back and remake me the sandwich!   No compensation or anything.. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Recently discovered Firehouse Subs and have already been back twice. The subs are delicious, full of meat and full of flavor .  The bread is very good.   The restaurant is clean and spacious.  This sub shop is so much better than Subway or a Jersey Mike's, it's ridiculous.  Recommend that you try a Firehouse Subs and it will be goodbye to Subway forever!"}
{"text":"Visited this location on 4/16/18 at about 8:30pm. Immediately after walking in I noticed a gentleman with a mustache and ponytail behind the counter throwing a fit and looking at he clock because myself and a few other customers had walked in. Extremely disrespectful to treat first responders this way. I will no longer visit this particular location. The young lady at the cash register was great though!"}
{"text":"This place was so good, I had it for the first time and then went back twice within a week."}
{"text":"I love firehouse subs! I love the pickle spears they give you worth your sandwich! So good. I usually create my own sandwich because I am a very picky person. They have a huge display of all these hot sauces. Labeled 1-10 for hotness!"}
{"text":"This subs are AWESOME!!! Seriously, have not had a bad sub yet. The meatball is not the best, try others. I really enjoy their take on hot sauce. My stomach can not handle super hot sauce, so theirs is just right.   The staff is always polite and friendly.   Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Subs are great, but they should not advertise that they sell salads.  Very disappointed in Hook and Ladder salad in a take out order.  It amounted to a bowl of lettuce with some ham and turkey lunch meat tossed onto one side.  There was no mozzarella cheese as advertised, and I ask for dressing on the side, and they neglected to give me any salad dressing at all.  If it were not 9.8 miles away, I would take it back.  Not worth the price"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! We have been going to firehouse for almost 2 years now after my friend introduced us to it, I have never tasted a sandwhich so good in my entire life! You walk in and you're immediately greeted by all the workers, they can get pretty busy during the lunch and dinner time rushes, but I don't mind waiting.   There is no way you can go into firehouse and not notice the array of hot sauces on display.I myself am not into spicy food, but my father and husband always get several samples to see who can handle the spiciest sandwhich (they have the spiciest flavors in their \"vault\", all you have to do is ask). Everytime I go I get the beef n cheddar smokehouse sub. They never skimp on the meat and the bread is always soft because they steam their subs, there is no better place to go for a sub, firehouse is definitely our fav! Keep up the good work firehouse!"}
{"text":"Amazingly good subs, friendly staff, and pretty reasonably priced for the quality if the sandwiches. Also, i thought the building was really clean. I will definetly  be eating here again. This location is awesome."}
{"text":"This was a delivery order through uber eats & was awful.had items on it I requested left off. was just a big mess of a disgusting sandwich. was upside down in dirty white box,worse sandwich ever seen! could not eat!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop.  I recommend the hook and ladder.  Really good food, nice atmosphere.  Place is clean.  Good place for a work lunch."}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly HAPPY!  =) I just finished an 8 inch meatball sub.  The bread was warm and SOFT, the meatballs were bite size, the sauce was perfect, and the cheese was just enough!  ~My brother devoured the 8 inch Steamer w/ no veggies....he said it was meaty and good! ~My sister-in-law had an 8 inch Italian....she claimed to enjoy it. ~My husband is having the 8 inch Roast Beef w/ veggies....how it tastes is yet to be determined because it's awaiting his arrival. ~I paid $28 and change for the four 8 inch sandwiches, three bags of chips and one fountain beverage.......I'm not complaining!  ~I am however, slightly dismayed by my fountain beverage......it's a make your own cherry limeade.  They provide you with the cherry syrup and you add the limes.  I tasted and tasted some more, but obviously I got the ratio wrong........I'm kinda disappointed, in myself that is! =(  Oh how I LOVE me some cherry limeade! ~Other than that, the service was FAST and oh so FRIENDLY!  Like, are you kidding me friendly! =) Impressive!   I will be back.....many more things to try!  P.S. They don't take tips but rather donations to a Fire Fighter fund! =)"}
{"text":"Tasty subs, fresh ingredients, friendly and helpful employees, and a nice clean, open dining area.  It's a great sandwich choice."}
{"text":"I really appreciate Firehouse Subs company culture and history. Their subs are delicious with flavor palates outside the normal realm of subs. That's what makes them so tasty! The staff here were friendly and the location was clean. Overall it's a very positive, quick, semi-healthy bite to eat."}
{"text":"Man these subs are awesome quick service and not a long wait. Had the famous beef sub. Very fresh bread and the sauces were amazing  you can put whatever you dread you want. no more subway for me."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak and cheese to go. I get back to the office to eat and they put disgusting heinous mayo on the sub!!!!! Never ever ever ever did I mention the word mayo!! Absolutely disgusting and a waste of money. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Enough with Subway and Mr Sub.  Start putting these in their place!  The Beef and Cheddar sub is probably the best sub that I have ever tasted.  I call it the Arbys sub.  Its so good.  Yes its more expensive than Subway.  But Subway is not good anymore.  I normally would never ever give a fast food sub place a 5 but you know what?  I would if it wasn't for one thing.  The New York steamer.  The New York Steamer.    It should be called the New York Reamer.  Because its after taste is like after reaming. This sub is probably the worst sub I've ever had.  I would say its like eating salty sheets of beef jerky, dripping with grossness, and shmeared with the poo poo and dijon mayo.  If you want steamed smoked meat, got to a proper Jewish Deli.  This place should be ashamed of serving this sandwich. The bread is great. Philly Steak and cheese is great also. Meatball is orgasmic.  Who doesn't like saucy tangy balls in their mouth? Hero is delicious. Just open more of these already!"}
{"text":"So I had a Postemates gift card burning a hole in my pocket and a craving for a good sub. I had been meaning to try Firehouse for awhile. Tonight was the night. I got a large Club on a Sub ( Turkey,Virgina Honey Ham, and peppered bacon) on wheat. Also got a large Brisket (Slow roasted brisket and sweet baby rays bbq sauce) First off the bread here is awesome nice and chewy with out being tough. The club was perfect a lot of meat if I had to pick on one thing it would be they use some super thin bacon.  The brisket was tender and juicy a nice balance of sauce. Over all a great experience we will definitely be back...1990's OOOH the cookies!!!! I almost forgot about the chocolate chip cookies. They were a last minute add on....and I'm SO happy I did. They are thick soft gooey fresh baked warm cookies. They also have oatmeal raisin...but come on??? These cookies are reason enough to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Firehouse and though I would give them a try.  The sandwich that I ordered look a lot smaller than what they have pictured on the menu.  It didn't taste good at all.  I was expecting much better.   Will not return again."}
{"text":"Every time I've come in there always seems to be at least one person cleaning. The place always looks as if it opened its doors last week. Clean, friendly, and fresh are how I would describe this place.  With a good selections of sandwiches and hot sauces with sports on the TVs it's a nice break for lunch. I also like rounding up my order to help first responders, even if it's just a couple in change it make me smile to help just a little."}
{"text":"I came across this place after a meeting and it was an amazing decision! Not only was the sandwich delicious, the huge variety of sauces were just about the best thing ever. Friendly staff and minimal wait time. All together a great experience :)"}
{"text":"It looks like there is a common theme in reviews for this location-employees! The food was good but the employees were inattentive from the order to the food delivery to the exit. Not a good experience. I would do take out maybe but no more dine in."}
{"text":"Only Firehouse Subs I have been to that doesn't have a \"small\" tuna salad.  Even tho the cashier confirmed twice I was ordering small. ..it said medium on the register so I knew it wasnt...I got a medium.  Then when they brought me a medium I told the cashier and he said they don't offer small.  Apparently he only tells you it is a small so they can charge you for a medium."}
{"text":"Honestly so disappointed. Came in and ordered a steak and cheese.. it came out cold. I payed for extra cheese. When my sand which came Back it didn't have extra cheese. My Stomach is in knots right now and I am so annoyed thanks for nothing fire house subs!!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Their prices are great and the sandwiches are AMAZING.  My favorite is the Hook n Ladder.  My least favorite is the tuna (YUCK!!!)  They give you lots of meat on the sub. Take that, Subway!  The one thing I don't like about the place is how the employees are forced to yell \"Welcome to Firehouse!\" every time someone walks in.  It makes me really uncomfortable because I know they are only saying it because they have to."}
{"text":"I'm knocking one star off my previous review because it seems like they switched from mayo to miracle whip or something equally disgusting.  I always order my sub the same way with everything that comes on it.  They call it \"fully involved.\"    The last two times I have gone in the past month, my sub was SWIMMING in mayo or fake mayo.  The first time it was kinda gross but this most recent time (since i forgot to say something about light on the mayo) it was covered again on top and bottom.  I took my sub apart half way through and used a few napkins to remove like 2 tablespoons of it and there was still plenty left.. too much still.  I couldn't finish it and felt very sick.  I was chugging Pepto for 3 hours and was sick and miserable.  I don't even know if I can go back and it was one of my favorite places to eat.  :("}
{"text":"I can't help but love the brisket and cheddar sandwich. I adore that these stores has  those fancy multiple choice soda machines. They also have a full bar of hot sauces, which I've never used, but, darnit I have the option.  I'm a Port O' Subs person at heart, but I have absolutely fallen in love with Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"Glad to see Firehouse in the neighborhood. We will be regular lunch customers.  Our experience: Warm friendly greeting as soon as we entered. They continued to make sure everything was good throughout our lunch. 5stars for service  Food: We both decided to enjoy hot sandwiches today. I hot the meatball and the gf the hot italian. Both sandwiches were excellent. But I think my favorite is still your brisket :)  Price: In our opinion it's not that bad. We normally get the medium size combo each and costs us total under $20. Yes, it's more than Subway, but we don't eat there after recent events about their spokesman.. Besides the sandwiches are way better.  Atmosphere: This location is well done. I enjoyed that it was Thursday afternoon and NFL network was on both the large tvs. Thank you. You helped remind me to set my fantasy picks...lol Normal firehouse theme, if you haven't been to one I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place to go for quick but quality food. The sub was toasted and warmed perfectly, which I liked better than subway. You have to wait about 5 to 10 minutes for your sub but it is worth the wait. Family friendly and you can usually find coupons in the local clipper magazines."}
{"text":"Well, I'm being kind in giving 3 stars and my theory is that 3 of the 4 of us were satisfied. I on the otherhand still have no dinner. Mind you it was a fluke that we even went there for dinner since I tend to stay away from quick stops.  We end up becoming curious if they're even open by the lack of patrons there. I ended up checking and saw they were open until 10 pm. The place was empty. Two employees and the four of us. I was the last to order and was trying to find a vegetarian option. I was looking on the trifold menu and decided that the Mediterranean was just up my alley (hummus, feta, marinated artichoke hearts, olive mix, cucumbers, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, onion, salt & pepper, and balsamic vinaigrette a garlic asiago cheese bread)....  We take our to-go  order home and we try figuring out which belongs to who... I open up the one sub, not mine. Second, not mine. Third, not mine. Fourth, not mine....  Well, I'm staring at 2 pieces of bread with an entire butchered chicken and a couple of sliced tomatoes and some dingy romaine... there is no way this is mine....   I called to ask. Yup, they don't make the Mediterranean any longer and I guess they figured the next best thing for someone who ordered the only veggie option? Chicken, romaine and tomatoes. Booo. Not cool firehouse, you could have mentioned this during the 10 minutes we waited for our order. Wow first time eating here and I am not impressed. I certainly won't make the choice to return."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is my go to place for a quick sandwich. I really enjoy the Hook and Ladder as well as the Firehouse Hero. The Subs are basically steamed here, rather than grilled or microwaved, which adds a lot of moisture to the sandwich and gives it a different texture than a toasted sub.  This location is usually nice and clean but sometimes the service is a little bit slow and one time the floor was being swept but they left out all the dust and trash on the floor to take orders but unfortunately left it in the way to the register."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and chose the Club on a Sub, Jalapeno chips, a brownie and a drink. Delivery was super fast (about 30 minutes or so), the sandwich was delicious and the brownie was soft, fresh and tasty. I will definitely order from here again. Convenient, fresh and the subs are excellent."}
{"text":"There's something about sitting and enjoying your sub at Firehouse that makes you want to smile.   When you walk in, the entire staff looks like they just finished laughing at some great joke and they keep that jolly disposition the entire time.  As for the subs - steaming the meat and cheese works well. The bun never suffers the fate of heat or toasting and stays soft and fresh down to the last bite.  As far as subs go, Firehouse fits me just perfectly."}
{"text":"my story starts like this .I left my wallet in my desk drawer .had to call one of my drivers to meet me somewhere to borrow some lunch money he's got 10 bucks on him already passed lunchtime and starving I pop in the firehouse and I'm four cents short. The kid behind the counter says well I need four more cents  I go out to my car scour everywhere after 10 minutes come up with a dime go back in and place my order manager brings me my food and a card for one free sub on the house......thank you so much ...Amanda ...it is just this type of customer service that is missing from the world today and I can honestly tell you firehouse has a customer for life because of her."}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches at a good price. A friend and I went for lunch. He ordered he meatball and I had the Italian. I really liked the Italian and would order it again. The meatball wasn't so good but I thought it would be better than it was. I will go back again to try something new."}
{"text":"Of the sandwich shops out there Firehouse is one of the better IMO. from the meats to the bread the flavor is always well represented at all of the locations. This place seem to stay pretty busy and finding a table was almost an issue. We were lucky to get one just before the place hit the lunch rush. If you haven't been there yet, give Firehouse Subs a try."}
{"text":"This was our 1st experience with Firehouse subs.  First impressions were clean bathrooms which is always a plus.  We had the Engineer, regular turkey, and the meatball subs.  The sandwiches were tasty.  I liked the pickle that came with the sandwich.  The employees were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Big shoutout to Firehouse Subs in Chandler. I received 12 coupons in their Water drive today and they were more than happy to make all 12 for me. These will be passed out to those in need. So water and food helping the community, prepared by a gracious staff and manager!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!! I was extremely pleased with my 9\" Italian hot sandwich w/ a bag of potato chips and a medium soda, not bad for $9.00.   The bread was soft and the provolone cheese that was melted on top of the Swiss ham and salami was great.     I would definitely go back and try another one of there made to order deliciousness!"}
{"text":"This place is so fire!!! Every time they nail it  with there hot subs I just love all the different kind of sauce  you get to pick out."}
{"text":"Excellent. One of the cleanest and best managed Firehouse subs I have ever seen. Customer service was amazing- the GM was super nice and suggested the new turkey and cranberry sandwich off of the less than 500 calories menu and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not the best service staff is not happy to be at work. I understand it's the 4th but make the best of it . Food is a little dry . Flys are everywhere."}
{"text":"first time here - first impression. Parking here can be a bit of a challenge during peak lunch hours. You can call your order ahead though. This reminds me of a higher end port of subs or subway. They have the same concept and same sort of fixings. The difference between those and this, the hot sauces. They have a ton of different hot sauces for your dipping, smearing, glopping pleasure :)  The design inside is to look like a firehouse.... Saw that comin! They do have a few TV's there, but barely any volume so it doesn't compete with the noise from the patrons eating. When you order \"for here\" you take a number and they bring it to your table... That's kind of nice :)   For a small drink and a \"fuel under 500\" Aka small light sandwich... The total came to $8.31. Food is all fresh and the staff is super nice. I had no idea what or how to order and I had about 10 people behind me. So I told the gal what I was looking for and she gave me options. Quick and easy!   The place is , for the most part clean and friendly.   Gave them 4 stars because the layout is a bit Funkey. They have the 2 order lines right in front of the Coke machine, so it's a bit of a cluster trying to find out if someone is there for a drink... Or sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok been here tons of times food and  sandwiches are good but they take so long to make sandwich omg like 10 mins to 12 Mins  tell them to go to jersey mike sandwich making or even subway.      . But next I'll Video the time of order to time of getting food.  But major problem is that twice I came with my husband at 6:30  and there's  no tea. Look I know the kids are lazy to make it    Cause you can't tell me it cost that much to make tea. People don't like soda.  Stop being lazy.  Hey leave the stuff out I'll make it."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome subs. Wow already went there 3 times in 2 weeks tried 3 different subs.  All great"}
{"text":"10:43am on a Monday morning. Dead. I had to wait probably 2-3 minutes for the cashier and food prep to finish their conversation with their friend (who was done and walking away) before I was even acknowledged. I wasn't even greeted, I just had to stand there awkwardly before looking over, them asking me if I was ready when I said,\" yeah but I'm waiting to you guys to be ready\". Completely unprofessional and very poor customer service. I give a 2 stars because my fiancé likes the food but next time I'll call it in so I don't have to suffer through these kids making hanging out a priority over working and good customer service."}
{"text":"I will have to go back and perhaps try a hook and ladder. I went for the first time and ordered the meatball. On the board it says that it includes Italian sausage but there was none on my sandwich. The service was good but I'm not convinced it was worth the price."}
{"text":"Love this location close to our house and always friendly and convenient. I always get the hook and ladder but I recently found a new favorite! The philly cheese steak is incredible I love it and the special house sauce goes great with it! I love me some firehouse!"}
{"text":"I love the taste and quality of their sandwiches. Their service is always polite and the place is always clean. The one downside for me is the price. At 17 dollars for two large sandwiches that's a bit steep for me. If I made it a meal then bam I am at  25 bucks for a couple of sandwiches, chips and a drink. I love their sandwiches but this is a once every six months type of place for me. If I am going to spend 10-15 dollars a person I will go somewhere that I get a waitress and get to take up a booth for an hour."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sub shop. Excellent flavors and portions. I really need to eat at Fire House Subs more often."}
{"text":"So we were really looking forward to trying firehouse for the first time today. I'm sad to say 1) they got both sandwiches wrong. 2) I asked for no Italian dressing because I absolutely hate it but the person taking the order was so concerned with if we wanted a pickle (she asked us each 4 times) she didn't tell the sandwich artist no Italian dressing. 3) we asked if the subs were toasted.... she said \"yes absolutely\" -NO they absolutely were not. 4) we had soggy subs and something that resembled a pickle.... not sure why the pickle question was so important. Certainly was not a magical or even mediocre pickle.  Disappointed and won't be back ........."}
{"text":"I've been curious to try this place for a while and I must say it was a very good toasted sub.  It's a little on the pricer end for a lunch spot but I will keep it in the rotation."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! AMAZING service. You've earned these five stars."}
{"text":"There was about 1/2 cup of mayonnaise on the sandwich. So much the bread was soggy. Not a good vide in this place - I'll stay away.   Oh yea and I didn't order mayonnaise on the sand which"}
{"text":"I was really looking to forward to trying this place. Everyone raves about it Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I got the cheese steak, I was thinking if this takes 10 minutes to make it is going to be fab.  Wrong this was one of the worst sammies I had ever eaten.  No flavor,  no gooey melted cheese.  Very little protien. I would have taken back but I was so hungrey. Not sure if I will go back : ("}
{"text":"Great place! Looks like a newer location and staff is really friendly and super enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Stopped in to purchase a quick meal on my trip to LAX.  Went to the counter to order and was asked if I wanted to donate a percentage of my meal to support local firefighters.  I politely declined and paid for my meal and waited, and waited....  Guess I should have paid to support those firefighters in the first place.  There was a crew of five including the manager working that shift but no one could seem to make a sub sandwich in time.  I finished my drink and left my food there.  I think my food was ready but nobody called out my name or number.  By the way the military doesn't ask for handouts to support us.  Still was billed on 01/07/15 for $12.88"}
{"text":"OMG SO DANG DELISH!!!! I never knew this place existed and it's just right up the street from me!! There are so many sandwiches I wanted to try but I ordered the New York Steamer Sub which has corned beef brisket & pastrami with melted provolone, that right there is heaven on bread!!  I have to say I am huge Jimmy John's fav, but Firehouse just might be my new number 1.  They even have this touch screen soda machine which I thought I was pretty nifty, I think it boasted 101 different types of drinks; it's a Coke machine, so except coke products but be amazed by all that it does offer.  Service was great, place was great! Gotta go back and try other sandwiches now!"}
{"text":"Firehouse is great. The subs are warm and toasty, and the cool firemen hats are fun for kids. My niece loves coming to this location, which is also conveniently located near the dollar movie theater. I've had many a cheap date night eating either at Firehouse or Cicis and then heading over to the dollar movie theater, sometimes with my Firehouse sub shoved down in my big purse to sneak in the theater.   The sandwiches are reasonably priced, and they are always pretty quick with getting your order. I can't say I've had a bad experience there, ever."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype!  The bread was ok, but they use over processed Smithfield Ham!  I can buy that at the grocery store.  Their mayo tasted funny, too!  Never going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent brisket and pastrami sandwiches at this location. Why only 4 stars? No sides, they need some things other than chips."}
{"text":"The staff here were very friendly and they helped my husband find just the right sandwich. It was a first time visit for him and he loved it. I've been many times and I will continue to eat here when I want a yummy warm sub."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is slow.  Not very busy but took 8 minutes for four people to make my sandwich.  Every person in front of me the employees said sorry for the wait.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Must go!!!!! Place is yummy! Staff is the best. Hands down, they always great you when u come thru the door"}
{"text":"One of the better sandwich shops in the valley, and the Italian sandwich is fantastic. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Broccoli and cheese soup is pretty gross and overpriced for what you get. The Italian sub was good, nothing special about it though.  Definitely not on my top three places to get a sub.  Top three are- Dave's Cosmic Subs- Jersey Mike's- Quiznos.   Probably would not come back to a Firehouse unless they was running a special."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. It's pretty close to my work but I just never got around to it until today. I ordered the meatball sub on whole wheat and it was really good. Would probably give them 5 stars if they offered delivery."}
{"text":"The best subs I ever had in my life Literally  Plenty of meet, they do not hold back!!!   I love it. All fresh cut too"}
{"text":"First off not only does this place have delicious sandwiches it also supports a wonderful cause.    The company Firehouse of America will donate 0.13 percent of your purchase in 2018 at all US Firehouse Subs locations to the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation. This percentage will result in a minimum donation of one million dollars. How awesome is that!   I swear this place has the best ham. Their Virginia ham is so good that it's one of their top sellers.   At firehouse you can get your sub toasted or non-toasted. They offer fresh ingredients and tasty bread. Firehouse also offers consistency which I like. You will always get the same wonderful service and food at all of their locations.   I suggest their Virginia Honey Ham toasted. I wasn't too fond of their chili or chicken soup but hey this is a sandwich place.   The little ones get a fire hat when you order a kids meal. I was a little jealous because I wanted a hat too."}
{"text":"It really is as good as everyone says! I had the one with turkey, cheese and peppercorn ranch. They have a kids meal that comes with a sandwich, drink, dessert and a fire hat. My girls got those for only $3.99."}
{"text":"Been going here once a week with my kids. Very friendly service. Sandwiches are delicious. So god we have this place in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is a chain of fast food restaurants specializing in hot sub sandwiches. I've been to the FS in Ann Arbor, and I feel like it is a small midwestern town staple. There are no locations in Chicago, but on a recent trip to Madison, I stopped by for a quick bite. It was near closing time, but the staff were still just as enthusiastic about making me a sub sandwich as ever.   I ordered a medium Captain Sorenson's Datil Pepper Grilled Chicken sandwich, which features grilled chicken, monterey jack cheese, Capt. Sorensen's datil pepper sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, and mayo on wheat buns. The datil pepper sauce is sweet-spicy, and I'm glad I picked up a couple to-go containers of hot sauce. I love FS's hot sauce bar. On each of my visits, I make it a point to try a new hot sauce flavor. It's nice to dip the sandwiches into the sauces like au jus.   Anyway, come here if you're craving a sub sandwich, but want something a little different than Subway or Quizno's. Service is good and prompt, and the prices are reasonable.   Free medium sub sandwich on your birthday!"}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich...Firehouse doesn't dissapoint! The wife and I were very pleased with their selection and the quality. I just finished my meatball sandwich and can honestly say, it's the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This location was like all other Firehouse locations that I have been to, and that is not a bad thing. When you get in, you are flooded with the site of many charitable donations for the firefighter funds. You know you will asked to contribute, and unless your d*ck you will give a dollar. Their charity actually takes action, and that is awesome!!  Anyways, I came here and spent twenty bucks on 1 large cheddar brisket sandwich and a hook and ladder medium combo. I fumbled around with the sauces before chowing down and found two interesting ones to sample.   I had a chance to enjoy my sandwich and see a few other patrons enjoying theirs. This place attracts a crowd that I love. The customers were quiet and knew how to have a conversation without others hearing them cackle.  The food seems healthy, but it's filled with flavor. This is on par with Capriottis and the prices are similar. I like firehouse a bit better because of the vibes I get one ordering."}
{"text":"Service was ok. The sandwich was ok. Not what I've experienced in past visits (not always same location) for the amount you pay for a sandwich it was really lacking the right amount of meat. It's been better in the past. Probably won't visit this location again."}
{"text":"Ordered the firehouse steak and cheese, the description says nothing about mushrooms! So I had to wait again to get a sandwich without mushrooms. By the time I got my food, my husband was done. The sandwiches were mediocre, but the service, awesome. We walked in, didn't pay attention to their hours, which apparently, was 5 minutes later. They didn't make us feel rushed at all! I don't plan on going back, but that wasn't because of the service in any way!"}
{"text":"Don't expect dynamite sandwiches out of this place. It is almost the lesser twin brother of subway, but lacking in almost every category. I ordered an 8 inch sandwich, the hook and ladder, and it took nearly 10 minutes to make.... but I was the only one in the store! Subway would have done it in half the time and would have tasted twice as good. The sandwiches are also a little more expensive than I would have expected. I guess that extra coin is being put into making the inside of the store look like a children's playground. The meatball sub was not very good also. If you're looking for a sub sandwich, drive another minute for a subway for an experience you'll know you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this location! The food is always great and the employees are always happy and actually look like they enjoy their job! Never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the staff is really friendly.  Move over Subway. The sandwich choices are all delicious. The meats are sliced nice and thin which really seems to bring out the flavors of the meats. The size portions are really good too. They are made and heated and brought to your table. Nice.  The owners and daughters (4 in all) started calling me by name right away. They remember their customers and are warm and friendly. They enjoy chatting with customers and making them feel welcome."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update since I've been going to this location for a few months. I've never have had a bad sub or experience  the staff has Always been welcoming with a smile and greeting! Love this place and highly recommend it. Worth the money and always clean, friendly atmosphere! Kudos to the staff and management!"}
{"text":"First time here and it will be my last at this location. 4 teenagers goofing off, not working and its not even busy. There are only three customers, my husbandand i and another man and these kids cant even clean up the seating area with all their down time.  All they are doing is laughing and playing on their phones. Not a good image for a sub place that says its by firemen.  An adult should be on shift at all times if they are only going to hire teens."}
{"text":"Worst service i have ever seen. 5 employees 3 standing around and the two prepping every9nes food are chit chatting and laughing while there are 3 people standing around that have obviously been waiting all day. Do not go here if you want your food made in a realistic time frame. Would give 0 stars if I could. Thx alot firehouse"}
{"text":"I rolled in here close to closing time last night. The chairs were up on the tables, a few people looked like they were doing closing cleaning stuff, I expected some dirty looks but they happily stopped what they were doing to wash their hands and make my sandwich.....Brisket and Cheddar. Smoky, gooey and delicious as usual. This is really the only chain sandwich place that I go to by choice. Subway is more of a time or calorie saving neccesity. I actually crave this sandwich. Fair price."}
{"text":"Everything about this locations is \"okay.\"  The food is good, its usually noisy (especially at lunch), and your food is ready in a timely manner.  The seating is a little strange, just because it is so small inside and the line can get a bit long at times. I've had some great sandwiches and these are just okay, everything about this experience was just, okay."}
{"text":"Five stars for flavor, two stars for cost! This is one of the best sandwich spots, but a family of three eats for $30+ tax for JUST sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why I dislike this place. The sandwiches are actually pretty good. Perhaps it's the way they half-heartedly mumble \"Welcome to Firehouse\" in a totally unenthusiastic way when you walk in the door. I'm certain it's because they take an inordinately long time to make your sandwich. I know I'm spoiled by Jimmy John's: they have your sandwich done by the time you walk to the pick-up area. But every other sandwich place I frequent is loads and loads faster than Firehouse. I'm also not a fan of Coke Freestyle machines- you get a long line of people waiting and waiting as each person makes their drink decisions.  One positive thing I can say, is I'm so glad they introduced the \"small sandwich\" option for lighter appetites. Unfortunately, it's the only positive thing I can add."}
{"text":"The second time this has happened so I have to write a YELP to help these people out. I head into Firehouse it is 3:30 in the afternoon and they're not too busy. Order food and ask for NO mayo and NO mustard. I wait for my food and head back to the office open my sandwich and guess what? You got it!  They put Mayo and mustard on my sandwich.  Not a little mayo but A LOT I can't even scrap it off.  Another annoyance is they made the sandwich upside down (not a big deal but annoying). Call the store and the Asst. Manager wants to know if I want to come down in get another one. NO! I'll jump in my 130 degree car and take 40 minutes out of my day because of your mistake. The part that really gets me is they were not busy but there was a whole lot of screwing around going on while I was in there. Employees off shift hanging out. Not sure where the owners are but this place used to be GREAT but beware if you go now! Check your food before you leave if it's to go!"}
{"text":"The small sandwich is half of a meduum...so like 4 inches or 4 bites...last time I order that...lol"}
{"text":"It's okay.  Nothing special.  Fun place to grab a sandwich.   Love the soda machine."}
{"text":"YUMMY sandwiches! My husband had the brisket, I had the \"Engineer\". Hadn't been to this location before, and had only eaten at Firehouse Subs once or twice before - but ordering was easy with lots of visuals and a helpful employee. The subs were tasty and a medium was plenty large enough for a really filling meal.  Only downsides were that the orange soda chose that moment to run out and sputter all over my husband's cup but hey, ___ happens! Tea was pretty strong - I did half and half regular and sweet tea, and that's usually plenty sweet for me. But this time I had to add 4 packets of sweet n low. Might have been old tea? The employee was making more as we were finishing up. To be fair, we were there at an \"off\" time - 3pm. Late for lunch and early for dinner. But it might be nice to change out the tea more often. Probably not a huge expense for the restaurant and would have maybe earned them another star."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in Arrowhead.  They are always so nice and the specialty subs- e.g. Smokehouse beef, are always fresh, good ingredients. Sliced well and the bread tastes good too. Large portions."}
{"text":"Went for lunch there were 2 other parties there it took over 20 minutes to get 2 subs. The guys making the food were obviously taking their sweet time but I was in a hurry and they just didn't seem to care. Other staff kept walking in and they would stop everything to conversate with them about who knows what. The Veggie sandwhich I got leaked sauce all over my other sub causing the bread to be gross. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The SLOWEST service I've ever seen in a restaurant, not to mention its supposed to be fast food. I stood in line for 19 minutes with only 2 people in front of me. They make sandwiches, it's not difficult. Been to this location a few times with the hope it will get better, no such luck. It's progressively got worse. Not to mention, after nearly 20 minutes in line, had to wait another 10 minutes to actually get our food. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Great place for a sub.  I think it is one of the best sub shop franchises going these days.  the mesa location had great customer service.   good sub shop."}
{"text":"Called in to order. Girl was rude.  They forgot part of order. Then when called back they said I could come pick up the stuff forgotten. Not even an apology.   Don't go here unless you want poor service."}
{"text":"My coworker recommended getting the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket for lunch.  The sandwich is beef brisket smoked for 16+ hours, cheddar, mayo, and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I took his cue of ordering the sandwich without the mayo.  No regrets on this sandwich.  That sauce is lightly sweetened but did not overwhelm or overpower the sandwich.    ENJOY!  P.S. Order your sandwich ahead of time and then go pick it up.  The line is out the door during lunchtime, seriously!"}
{"text":"Great subs and a soda machine with every flavor. I wish the staff was more friendly. I've been here twice now and no one greets me or even says hi. Two people were just standing around while we waited for someone to take our order. We were the only ones in line. Love fire house and always round up. Pick it up east mesa!"}
{"text":"Almost $12 for a great sandwich. 12\" whole wheat with roast beef, Turkey, ham, provolone and loaded with optional toppings!   They have a wide variety of signature sandwiches or you can make your own.  The service is great, polite and informative. It was my first time there and the teller explained to me how to order and what was popular which helps a lot with so many options.  12\" is good for lunch and a snack later. A dense hearty sandwich.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place was very clean and the staff were real friendly. We came in between lunch and dinner, and it still had a steady flow of customers. They greeted us when we came in and helped us with suggestions. It didn't blow my mind, but was still real good!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I tried this place for the first time and we were left wondering why it took us so long to visit! I had the new york steamer and she had the hook and ladder. This was one of the best subs we ever had. A little on the pricy side but it was well worth it. You will not be sorry you came!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean, kool concept. Staff did not know the menu. I ordered my sandwich based on the counter guys description-- turned out to be totally different.  They gave my kid the wrong sandwich which we realized after we got home.  I will try it again though after they have been around and hopefully train their employees on the menu."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse subs, the meatball sub is awesome but then again there hasn't been any sub that i havent liked. I always recommend that you round up your total so you can donate to the fire fighter fund."}
{"text":"So today I decided to use my one hour lunch break during a twelve hour shift, and go to fire house subs. Where I was forced to wait 30 minutes for a sandwich which beared no resemblance to the order I gave to the clerk. This was not the end of the terrible experience I suffered during my visit at fire house subs on mill and baseline at old Towne city plaza. My sandwich was not only made poorly but it also contained a large amount of black mold. After going to the restaurant, and very respectively asking for this to be fixed the manager chuckled in my face and said all your getting is a refund. Feeling a bit neglected I went to the owner who basically told me to take a free sandwich and shut up saying \"we have you a free sandwich now quit complaining\". I'm not expecting them to give me a million dollar settlement all I wanting is an apology and justice so other's lives aren't put in danger."}
{"text":"Went for second time ever on Saturday night. I ordered two subs to bring home and eat. Both me and my wife's subs were incorrectly made and we didn't eat them. I called and spoke with a Kyle who wanted me to bring back the subs and either get refund or remade.   I finally made it there today, with subs, and the female manager said she won't refund and could remake the sandwiches ,but they would be cold b/c they had no power. Great customer service! I said no thanks and informed her of my plan to let others know. They aren't the only sandwich shop in town!"}
{"text":"Great sub! Not the best I've ever had, but definitely good enough to make me come back. Try out the turkey bacon ranch. It's worth it."}
{"text":"If you want one 12\" sammich, a small bag of chips and a medium drink for $13+ dollars then I guess you found the place.  Not for me... I would think they would turn on the A/C.. it might have been cooler outside. When I was there, had to be 8 people plus a manager behind the counter doing something... I go to subway, about half the cost...more than half the people and it's cool... Dont forget your chips because they won't tell you. To many other places to go... won't be back."}
{"text":"They decided that it doesn't matter if they give you decent quality or even edible quality food as long as you're taking it to go. Truly dishonest, low quality business. My sandwich was complete charcoal and picking it up left my fingers and napkins black. It was promptly thrown away as I couldn't choke down even a bit of the charcoal that was supposedly the charred remains of a meatball sub. I basically paid to be their custodian and threw their garbage away for them. I should've just burned my money instead since that's what they did for me. Very disappointing and irritating. Definitely not a place I'd recommend throwing your money away on since they have no integrity"}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian and are looking for a great vegetarian sub, do yourself a favor and skip Firehouse - it's not worth your time!  (However, I have to be honest, I gave them two stars because we went on recommendation of my boss who LOVES IT and my boyfriend thought his sub was pretty OK. \"pretty OK\" doesn't seem that promising to me though. ha!)"}
{"text":"Been to four firehouse subs, I would rank this one as number 4. I tried a salad this time and really liked it. While the girls behind the counter were nice, they were super slow. Not a huge deal, but there was only one other group in there so did not understand.  Anyway, place is good, good is good.  Need to work on service time.  Much slower than others that were busier"}
{"text":"Great sandwhiches, A little expensive but at least you know you are getting a great tasting meal!"}
{"text":"This is 1 of the best sub franchises out there right now. I ordered  the hero, medium size and for just under nine bucks for the drink it's a really nice sized sandwich. The toasted bread is delicious and the flavor combinations on the sandwich are yummy. Coming back soon because I noticed corned beef and pastrami with melted provolone after I already ordered my sandwich, I have to come back and try that"}
{"text":"My new favorite sub shop! The cashier had perfect flair for the restaurant and recommended an outstanding sandwich for me. I will definitely be coming back. The pricing is cheap for most places you'd go for lunch but a little on the expensive side for a sub shop. The sandwiches are worth the extra buck though: meat which has been cooked until it is perfectly tender and fresh toppings (including a surprisingly nice balance between sauces and toppings) make for a lunch that will keep you salivating  even after your sandwich is gone."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $25 for two sandwiches and wait forever to get them, this is the place for you. Not impressed by the sandwiches or the urgency in getting the sandwich to you. Will not be back. Much rather Jimmy Johns or if very desperate....subway"}
{"text":"Yum!  Positives:   Firehouse subs is a family favorite!  It is so nice on the inside.. Nothing like a subway. It's a place you will enjoy going in and sitting down to eat.  Every sub I get is amazing, never had a bland one yet.  Best customer service you can get.   Negatives:  None"}
{"text":"Usually go to Capriotti's for the pastrami but they were closed so decided to give this place a try. Idk if it was because they were about to close or what the deal was but was disappointed with my sandwiches. I got the large New York steamer and the small brisket both of which half the bread was burnt and tasted so bad me and my son had to rip of half of the bread. The sandwiches themselves were half ass made you can tell they were rushed and the pastrami omg had so much fat and stringy pieces, which I hate, that every bite I was pulling crap out of my mouth. First and last time trying this place. On the flip side the cookies are good."}
{"text":"Wait time is ridiculous we waited for 25 minutes only 3 people working will go to another location from now on Very sad cause the food is good.... and I ordered mushrooms my sub had 3 and my hubbies 4 not happy for spending over $30 for 3 subs"}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service. Waited over 30 minutes for our food. People that came in after us got their food before us and when we called the manager he never even called us back about our experience. I love firehouse. NOT this location."}
{"text":"Came in last minute for a party platter and Chessa, Brian, and Angel took care of me! Got me out in less than 20 minutes with a beautiful presentation of tasty, good looking hook and ladder subs. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket can't get enough of it.Staff is friendly and helpful. Place is always clean."}
{"text":"Wow, first time in and yep I likey! I split a sandwich, I think it was a club, it was amazing. Really fresh, I am a fan. It was about 8pm on a Thursday, pretty slow (to be honest just myself, hubby and another couple).. The staff was friendly, helpful and prompt, the store is large and very clean! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh man this place is amazing! Everything on the sandwich is so fresh, and the bread is so freakin soft! Eat in or take away, best sandwich in town hands down.  They have one of those new fangled soda machines here, so you don't have to have soda! Woot, woot!  This location is a little small, but it is super clean and the staff is friendly, and they fix up a really delicious sami..  I eat half of the sandwich here and the other half at the library when I'm studying...  Yes, get your self in here!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today.  Had the Italian.  It was absolutely delicious!    The staff here was very friendly and the facility was very clean.  I will definitely be returning here often!"}
{"text":"Man I like this place! I've tried a couple of their subs-all delicious but my favorite is the beef & cheddar brisket. When someone wants a sammich I'll definitely recommend Firehouse."}
{"text":"Woah Momma! I don't even know where to start. I was cruisin' around the neighborhood looking for a new lunch spot and as I drove past Create Burgers I spied a new sub shop.  Now I love me a good sammich, so I had to give this place a try. Walking in I was slightly overwhelmed by the over-the-top firefighting decor: An enormous painting of a firetruck in old-time Vegas covered a complete wall, and staff were dressed it blue and red shirts that look like they were borrowed from the local fire house. \"Keep Back 200 Feet\" emblazoned on the back of a few... which made me laugh.  The menu was fairly simple - about a dozen subs named for firefighters or equipment. Choice of white or wheat bread and a variety of optional hot sauces that span most of the counter and fill a curio cabinet in the seating area.   The first sub I tried was excellent. Bread was warm, but not toasted, so it had a fresh from the oven texture. Pair that with a heap of meat big enough to satisfy even the manliest of sandwich eaters and fresh produce and you've got one great sub.   So great, in fact, that I've been back 3 times this week."}
{"text":"I got intro ducted to FireHouse subs in San Antonio.  The hook and ladder is awesome.  They are quick and have great accuracy.  I just wished they delivered."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a bite the other day. Greeted immediately, as usual. Clean restaurant and delicious subs. MMMM I love Firehouse and this location lived up to the standard."}
{"text":"Very good subs!  Meatball was delicious. Brisket and cheddar was VERY tender and the sauce was good. Also, a great selection of hot sauces is a bonus. Not 5 stars?  Gotta leave room for the amazing."}
{"text":"While a tad slow IMO, the sandwich was nice and tasty and the staff friendly and attentive.   Also, love the variety of sodas available on the fountain. And, the Coke tastes as close to what I remember as a kid. 8)"}
{"text":"We first stopped here a few weeks ago and have been back 2 more times. The place is very clean. The staff courteous, friendly and polite. And, the sandwiches taste great!  Between the 2 of us, we have tried 3 sandwiches (usually, we split one 8\" sub; can't remember what we had on the first visit. But, 2nd visit was a Meatball Sub. And on the 3rd visit, she wanted to try the Hook N Ladder Lite, so I had another 8\" Meatball sub all to myself 8) ). But, when we split a sub, the staff brings the sandwich in 2 trays with a slice of pickle for each of us. :o   But, I was surprised to see some complaints about the cost. For what I get at Firehouse subs (1, 8\" Sub and 2 Small drinks), I usually can only get the sandwich at another place that I go to.  Also, they ask for your name and give you a number, usually (only got a number 2x). Personally, this double-redundancy is probably not needed for the size of the place. But, I can't see taking off anything for it.   Overall, a great place that I'll go to again.  I just hope that the shop closest to me is the same way."}
{"text":"This place is a joke they got me for 12 bucks for this crap 4 inch sandwich...??? #neveragain"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and Fantastic.   Yep I'm a fan.   Plus the workers there on Black Friday did not stop cleaning the whole time we ate there. I mean ya'll got some great workers Firehouse!  I really like their warm subs!  Edit - addressing the portion sizes to the price comments people have made. Yes, you are not getting a gigantic sub, but you're getting fresh food that's really good.   You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Meatball subs! The wife liked the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket (hold the barbecue sauce)!"}
{"text":"First time going here and I had the \"engineer sub\". It was very tasty--the meat, cheese, and bread were superb! Also, the place is very clean and the staff are super friendly! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I love me some Firehouse! My go-to is the Turkey Ranch with Cheetos! Service at this location is always kind and courteous and they typically have your sandwich ready within about ten minutes of ordering. They certainly have a tasty sandwich menu and always have a slice of pickle to top it all off! Firehouse has a rewards program which is easy to sign up for and use and they accept Apple Pay so no need to shuffle through your wallet in line!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm a sandwich fanatic and these guys do it right. And what gives this place an extra star is the nice selection of hot sauces to spice things up. Each location seems to vary in selection, but it's always fun to try new ones."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, served fresh by friendly staff. Not much else to say. I tend to stick to the Firehouse Hero sandwich, big fan of roast beef. And as always, check out their crazy array of hot sauces, all of which are great sandwich additions."}
{"text":"Very nice soda machine, food was quick and tasty. Service was great. Can't go wrong with firehouse for a nice sub."}
{"text":"Ordered sandwiches and chili online. Arrived and was told chili was still frozen and that I'd get my money back. Frozen chili? Employees were obviously very unhappy by the way I was treated. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Classic sandwiches done right.   The subs here are insanely good. Really. They're not especially creative, they're just done exceptionally well. My wife loves their veggie like she's never loved a fast food sandwich before. It's insane!   The best part is how when you order a sandwich they tell you every single thing on the sandwich so you can add/delete items. And they have those coca-cola freestyle machines that give you infinite flavors of soda! And they give your kids firemen hats. Also they have a variety of awesome hot-sauces available.  I love their food. This location is  a good one."}
{"text":"Hey! Not bad at all.  The subs are really good.  The Hook and Ladder is tasty.  The bread's not too filling and hard like other places.   It's just a really tasty sub.  It's also fulfilling.  I also tried their Chief Salad with grilled chicken.  Not bad at all.  I like how they have different types of hot sauces on the counter varying from different levels of spiciness.  The place has enough room to accommodate a number of people."}
{"text":"I come here often since discovering it and have never had any issues except for a small one when I first came, but I know these guys deal with some crappy rude customers and always have been chill. They got a new GM who screwed up an order and said he'd take care of a sandwich, for some reason that sandwich didn't come out to free, I paid $13.97 and I came back because I also dropped half but they only offered 20% and so I called corporate who reached out to the owners who never contacted me. Jennese took care of the situation but I guess my name got removed and ultimately Marcus took care of the whole thing and I really appreciate him because I was about to take my business elsewhere. Outside of Marcus, there's another shift leader Clay whose been great. All of the team members are nice at this location.  Thanks to Marcus and his team for taking care of the situation because it seems the owners of this franchise won't unless they planned to call me a month after the incident."}
{"text":"We went for the first time yesterday. The staff were super friendly and had smiles all around. The place was busy for a reason. Had the hook and ladder sub and it was just delicious and it was packed, It came  with a deli style pickle on the side ( nice touch  ). The subs here are quite different than the other  guys. My plan is to eventually try everything on the menu as it all looks delicious. I'm happy i live close as I'm going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Love this place. So much better than every other sub shop out there! Way better food. try the Brisket! Best sandwich ever!"}
{"text":"A normal and clean sub shop. I tried Engineer sub with everything on it. The medium size was enough for lunch meal and it was very warm and tasty. It reminded me to Quiznos subs which was very similar in taste IMHO."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, the menu is meaty, cheesy, saucy and hot!  The staff is also friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to be nice to the kids.  They have one of those soda machines with just one nozzle but like a million different flavors of soda inside, I get a small soda just so I can refill a lot...Vanilla root beer, grape Sprite...mmmm  The brisket is very good."}
{"text":"My first and last visit to Firehouse Subs.  I ordered a Turkey Verde sandwich from the under 500 calories menu.  I took it to go and when I reached my destination- less than a 10 minute drive- I sat down to have lunch- or so I thought.  The sub was soggy- covered in some strange damp slime- it feel apart in my hand as I tried to pick it up.  I took a bite- as the soggy sandwich continued to fall apart - it was a soggy tasteless mess.  Ugh- straight to the trash.  So, I  just spent $9.00 on a sweet tea.  Not happy .  Too bad- I really like the idea/concept of Firehouse as I have many friends in Chicago who are   firefighters.  I like that firefighters started this place and that some of the proceeds from each sale go to to charities that benefit firefighters and their families.   On the positive side, the store was very clean and the employees friendly and efficient, however I will not return."}
{"text":"Firehouse is one of my all-time favorites. I have been eating FH since 1999 in Florida. This particular one is not that great to me. The sandwich is not hot enough."}
{"text":"I appreciate the effort management has made to rectify my bad experience.  Says a lot when they are willing to work with a customer."}
{"text":"High quality ingredients make for a great sandwich.  I am fond of the New York Steamer and particularly like their crisp pickles (I always ask for two)."}
{"text":"Great place to get a free sub on your birthday!"}
{"text":"WOW! This is the best firehouse subs I've been too!!! Every staff member is super friendly!!! Also they kept checking in on me during my lunch to make sure I was okay and ask if I needed anything. Also Steve-O who works there is amazing! He gives the greatest customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by how fresh a sandwich could taste. The bread is so good and my sandwich was toasted perfectly. It also wasn't sloppy like some places when they just throw it all together. I got a turkey, bacon, ranch without the ranch lol. I also got chips and a drink. I felt it was a bit expensive over $11 for a sub meal, but it was a good sized sub so no real complaints."}
{"text":"Meh, this location could do better. Trying not to make too much of a biased review, but I worked here over 5 years ago and I can say that the customer service is quite different, and not in a good way! Firstly, Firehouse Subs franchise is known for employees greeting customers whenever they walk in the door by saying \"Welcome to Firehouse!\", no matter how busy or what time of day it is, and I did not get that enthusiasm on my visit. I came about an hour before closing time so I suppose they were \"too tired\" to give me the same attention. Although some guests might find it weird or annoying, it's a part of what makes Firehouse Subs different from the rest.   The space is annoyingly small, never liked the layout because it's awkward, and when it gets busy in there it's packed like sardines, the lines get weird, and there's no proper way to set the tables without it barely being any space between majority of them. But to make up for it I guess, they have a really cool beverage machine!  Cashier was not very approachable but how else would I get my food, so I went up to her and ordered, what I thought, was not a very complicated order. I wanted provolone cheese instead of Monterey Jack on my Club on a Sub, but instead of subbing it out she charged me extra! Didn't notice til after I sat down but I wasn't gonna make a scene over 75 cents. Besides that, the sandwich is as good as I remember! All sandwiches (minus 4 of them) automatically come \"fully involved\" with mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, and onion. Which is nice, and also comes hot and toasted! Flavors are all there and way better than the competition. That being said, they are also more expensive than the competition, but you do get what you pay for.  The thing that really got me is when the cashier started cleaning she was mopping literally around my feet! You do NOT do that! Not only is it unsafe but also very rude. I understand that you are about to close but the way it was 5 years ago we would mop in an area that a guest is NOT in and when they leave we then mop that area! The food itself is still what makes this franchise such a success, but they really need to reevaluate who they hire nowadays cause bad customer service is a major deal breaker."}
{"text":"First time trying firehouse subs. Sorry but the bad outweighed the good and I am not a fan.   The Good: the ingredients seemed to be good quality and the sandwich was made correctly. I got the ham and turkey sub.   The Bad: the whole sandwich had a sweet flavor to it. The ham was sweet, the mustard was sweet and the bread had a sweet flavor to it as well. I just don't think a sub sandwich should be sweet. The bread was soggy too. It was warm and I would prefer this sub to be cold. I didn't know until afterwards that I could get it cold but just FYI for anyone reading this: you can get any hot sub cold if you ask.   Bottom line: I won't order from Firehouse again. I just didn't care for the flavors."}
{"text":"A generous four stars. Great concept, good service and ambience. Clean store. Only gripe?  WEAK portions. Could get five stars with better portions. Will come back and try something else on a diverse menu."}
{"text":"Just got back from our first visit to Firehouse Subs in Buckeye.  Loved it.  The rolls are soft and fresh, the meatballs delicious.  We really thought the flavored sodas were cool.   my husband had a veggie sub, very fresh tasting.  They have a varied menu, we will go back.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  They took extra time with us as we were new.  One of the young ladies was really helpful and patient with Grandma.  The price seemed comparable to what we usually spend.  Way better than the scads of fast food restaurants on Watson.  We appreciated the airy  bright atmosphere and the kids seemed to enjoy the fire hats."}
{"text":"Couldn't resist coming back here to try more of their Subs.  Last visit, I got an Italian Sub.  This visit, I got a New York Steamer (Pastrami, Corned Beef, and Monterrey Jack Cheese) w/Jalapeno Chips and a Soda.....yeah, I normally don't get Soda, but they have Coke Zero on the fountain here....so I caved, damn!  As I was waiting for my food, I noticed a huge selection of Hot Sauce! (see pics)  How did I miss that last time?  Seriously, I think I'm in Heaven!  They even have 3 different flavors of one of my favorite Hot Sauce companies (Melinda's)!  Of course, I picked two bottles of Melinda's and waited patiently for my food.  After a few minutes, it was ready.  For the first bite of the NY Steamer, I didn't add Hot Sauce because I wanted to try it in it's traditional style.....it was friggin' awesome!  The Pastrami & Corned Beef were juicy and the melted, gooey Monterrey Jack went well with the Meat....of course the Bread was awesome too.  The next few bites, I added Melinda's Habanero & Chipotle Hot Sauce.....wow, it made it even better!  Then I tried the Melinda's Jalapeno Hot Sauce....good, but not as good as the Chipotle.  I devoured that Sandwich like it was my last meal on Earth!  What a great experience.....that combined with the serious Hot Sauce collection elevated this joint to 5 Stars for me.  Will I return?  I'm already thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Subs are excellent, kinda of pricey but worth it. The staff is very friendly and to all my firefighters and EMT'S you do get a discount."}
{"text":"If your up for a good footling sandwich chips and a drink for $13, then this is the place for you. Not sure if Im willing to pay nearly $10 again for just a sandwich, myself. They do greet you at the door, food was ready with little wait and cashier was polite. The Firemen decor was pretty cool."}
{"text":"The ordering process was tedious enough but when I went to pick up our food it was a disaster. There were 2 signs on one girl. One was for orders one was for pickups. I went to the pickup side. I had to wait for two families with six kids to order before the girl would acknowledge me. My order was sitting on top of a microwave getting cold the whole time. The rest of the teenage staff was standing around talking.  I took my Luke warm sandwiches home. Food was good forget about the poor take out service. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"SECOND VISIT I really wish I could say I had a good experience here but I can't, which is a shame because I really like Firehouse Subs. But absolutely NOTHING was improved on this second chance visit. Employees are STILL gathering at the ONLY full size table in the front. (This time, I even took a picture in case a manager needs to see it!). I was the ONLY customer in the store yet the girl with my food was wondering around like she couldn't find me. The soda machine (and areas around it) were VERY dirty and disgusting- completely unsanitary. There was also food all over the floor too. Again, I was the only one there. Employees were too busy talking with each other and playing on their cell phone to do anything about the mess or just didn't care. After eating many times at FH subs where the food is always good, I can now say I actually had a BAD sandwich. Ordered the Bacon Ranch sub and it was terrible. Sandwich was very sloppy with most of the food not even on the bun and the bacon was limp and tasteless (how is that even possible?!?)!  After spending $21, I threw most of it away.  I was extremely disappointed.   ORIGINAL VISIT It's good food and a nice atmosphere. However, I found the staff lacking in professionalism. They got my order wrong. They also seem to congregate at one of only 2 full size tables in the entire restaurant. (Shouldn't such a table be available for the customers??) And it's the table right in the front near the counter where all the customers are trying to get through. In most places (and other Firehouse Subs), employees gather somewhere away from the high customer traffic area. Not here! Aside from a few (managers, I think), most employees are NOT friendly and make you feel like it's a big chore to do anything for you. They look glum and miserable, which is sad since Firehouse is normally a happy environment. This place would be much better if these issues were addressed."}
{"text":"Late night quick dinner after work and got there 20 minutes before closing.  Being in the industry, I know how he last 30 minutes before you close you hope no one comes in so you can get out on time.  Jason was AWESOME, super happy and friendly, with great customer service.  You can tell he loves his job and is a super hard worker.  It's so hard to find good customer service nowadays. Because of Jason's customer service I will be back.  Thanks Jason"}
{"text":"Very Dead and no one would take my oder for a few minutes, while I was just standing at the register. The employees seemed like they didn't want to be there. Hopefully my sub tastes good or else I'm not ever coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Firehouse subs are tasty and cheap.  I enjoy the variety of hot sauces to choose from and the touch screen soda dispenser has unique sodas to choose from, like Mello Yellow.  But the last time I was there the workers were unorganized and didn't seem to work well under pressure when it got busy.    I called to order take-out because during rush hour I didn't want to wait in line.  When I arrived my sandwiches were ready; and what I mean by ready is wrapped up, in a bag, ready for me to pick it up.  When I told one of the workers that my sandwiches were ready and I'm ready to pay, she said the cashier who takes take-out orders is on break and I had to wait in line.  There were 3 or 4 people in front of me and and the cashier must've been new because she looked like she didn't know how to take orders.  Guess they didn't want my money right then and there.  After waiting for about 10 mins, two workers came back from their break and one jumped on the other register.  Finally I was able to pay, but the cashier was confused and couldn't find my order.   I'll mostly likely go back again, but what horrible service.  After a long day at work the last thing I want to do is wait in line for sandwiches that were ready to be paid for."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and the food was delicious! Thank you for taking my last minute whirl wind order and making a crazy day so much better!!"}
{"text":"Great service great food. Andrew and Barb are awesome.  They both went out of their way to meet our need. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Excelent food, excelent service, and clean place. Donald and Marrisa treat us like royalty!!! We come here all the time because of the exceptional staff. Definitely recommed this location to all sandwich lovers out there."}
{"text":"I LOVE firehouse subs. Our week is always si busy that when it comes to lunch we always have direhouse. My fav is the bbq brisket and boyfriend has the turkey. If you're in ahurry and want food food, Firehouse always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Bad... just bad. From the cashier not being friendly after I explained my first time here. I asked her what was good, she rolled her eyes at me. I guess I annoyed her by asking what she sells at her JOB. I felt rushed. I don't eat ham and  I wanted Turkey and roast beef. She said it was not on the menu, but she rushed what was on it. I'm allergic to tomatoes. Had to take off tomatoes and wiped down the sandwich. Bread was cold. Not fresh tasting.  For what they charge, no meat on the extra size roll. Its all bread. Dried out sandwich. Had to ask for more mustard.   So disappointed. Oh well. Jersey Mike's reopened."}
{"text":"First time at this location, but been to firehouse a bunch. employees were super friendly, place was very clean also. Was pretty bummed cucumbers were on the menu but was told they haven't had them since they opened, wish they would cover it up.  Overall very happy though"}
{"text":"I have never been to Firehouse Subs before but I would definitely come back! I got the vegetarian combo with a DELICIOUS cherry, vanilla Dr. Pepper and some jalapeno Vicki's chips. I love that they have the soda machine with over 100 options...  Once I got my sandwich, I was even more excited to try any and all of their hot sauces that they have available. My boyfriend and I tried about 10 different options, some spicy and some sweet. Definitely have to say that the Georgia Peach/Vidalia Onion sauce is amazing and so was the Devil's sauce... I don't remember the exact name but it was \"Devil's ____\" and it had habanero in it.  Such flavor. Much spice. Wow. I almost forgot to mention!!! They had a lemon cookie, I think with white chocolate chips in it. So worth it for people that love lemon. Overall, the cherry, vanilla Dr. Pepper, lemon cookie, and just awesome sandwich made the trip pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"This man luke is one of the best employees he helped us fast and make my experience pleasant and delightful! He exemplified the saying of customer is always right! He did any and everything to make me happy and got my sandwich out faster than I could even sit down! We love Luke"}
{"text":"Hyped up for Firehouse for years...this location finally opened in my location, and.....meeehhhhhh...  Service was friendly, but slow, considering how many folks they had behind the counter....luckily, I was able to catch my bus back home in time.   I was recommended to get a Meatball sub...the bread and cheese presentation was beautiful and delicious...the quality of the meatball and the sauce, in my honest opinion, tasted ALMOST EXACTLY like Subway. I like Subway's meatball sandwich, but after years of eating it, I know I'm getting a tasty, but subpar meatball sauce combo...I expected more authentic out of this place. The other premium hot sandwiches on the menu looked decent enough, so I will give them a try again before I would give up on them.  I really did like the hot sauce bar they had up front.....many, many different bottles and sample size containers (a la a Filiberto's type sauce container), so I took home 5 or 6 different types of sauces i've never tried to use on different stuff later and add to my Frankenstein bottle lol.  So yeah...first impression didn't quite live up to the hype, but it did show potential."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the hook and ladder is a great sandwich. Everyone was very pleasant and Andy was nice and picked up my tray for me. Very clean also."}
{"text":"Two stars. That's it. One for the service. The other is for the pop machine( yes pop, not soda!). Everyone was helpful and friendly. The pop machine was a touch-screen and had many flavor variations for each choice. My wife and I split an Italian and a Cheesesteak. When subs are hot, they need to be baked, not steamed. Steamed=soggy. Overall the steak was just blah. Not much flavor. Better cheesesteaks back home at Sheetz( gas station that makes decent food). The Italian had honey ham on it, which is good, just not on an Italian. It gave it a sweet flavor that it should just not have had. Probably won't go back there because the food just wasn't that good. There are some sub places I haven't tried yet, and some I have, that I would go to before I try Firehouse again."}
{"text":"Always great subs! I work in the area and eat here at least once a week. They are always really nice and my order is always ready on time. Food is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Came in for dinner last night after hubby was pleading with me that he HAD to have the Kings Hawaiian sandwich lol.  We go in and we are immediately welcomed, \"welcome to firehouse!\". We sit down and Barbara comes over to help us and explain the menu. She was wonderful! She told us the meats are sliced fresh twice a day and she got fire hats for the kids. They loved that!  So my husband gets the Kings Hawaiian, a meatball sub for the kids, and I got a corned beef. They were all amazing! Really good meats.  It is a little pricy. $6 and change for a sandwich and close to $9 for a combo. But it's quality. I also love that they have a few ways to donate to first responders. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS good! It's a chain sub place but nothing at all like your average subway.  The staff I have to say is always super nice and friendly and that is always a plus in my book :)! They have a large selection of different subs on their menu but I tend to stick the the same thing the firehouse hero with 3 different meats and extra crack sauce which is their signature bbq sauce at the counter.  The whole sandwich is super fresh (from the bread, veggies, and meat) and doesn't have that \"processed\" taste like some other places that look like the ingrediants have been sitting out all day long. Who wants that?! and to add to it all, the awesome coke machine - gazillion combos of soda any way you want it. Sometimes the machine is on the fritz though and it's sometimes too sugary (like syrupy) but it's nice to have a fancy smancy machine.  The sub is always soo good you want to order a large order cause a regular seems too small. All the other selections look good as well and comes with a sliced pickle.  This chain is worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were perfect!!  Great new location.  Love the firehouse steamed meat with cheese and selection of hot sauces.  Always a Saturday family afternoon favorite."}
{"text":"This is the best sub sandwich that I've ever had. Really. I've had several Mom & Pop shop subs in Tucson, and of course Subway, Quizno's, Blimpie's, Eeegee's, Silver Mine, East Coast, Jersey Mike's, Kenny D's, Jimmy John's, Hogie House, etc. (I'm sure I'm missing a few), but Firehouse Subs was so GOOD. The bread was exceptional and the meat perfect. I had the Hook and Ladder (a turkey with melted cheese). So good.  The service was friendly and efficient.  I will definitely call upon the one in my neck of the woods in Tucson."}
{"text":"First of all I think the sandwiches here are fantastic!!! I have been to firehouse many times now. I feel that the place is starting to lack in customer service a lot. I dont understand what is the complication to make a sandwich in this shop. Honestly their customer service sucks now. They are so slow and uncaring.  1. two weeks ago I ordered a chicken sub plus 2 more. I payed for all sandwiches and they tell me that they are out of chicken.. ok fine.. put turkey.. Cashier says no problem she switched my  order accordingly. I did not have to pay anything extra. What I did not realize until later was that.. it was actually cheaper to get a turkey sandwich so I was overcharged. She did not bother to do a return. Nice. I waited forever to get the sandwiches..It was not any busier than a quiznos would be. 2. I ordered ONE turkey sandwich last Saturday from my house for take out. I figured since they have been slow making sandwiches.. I will call in to give them more time. I called.. and they said.. 10 minutes.. I left my house and got there in the 10 minutes.. I still had to wait an additional 20 minutes just to get a sandwich.. 30 minutes for ONE sandwich? are you kidding me? This place is really lacking on focus. I dont know if they owners realize this but I dont remember waiting 30 minutes for a sandwich anywhere EVER!!! I am real disappointed. If they were more efficient I would be there at least 2 times a week...now I am starting to not go because I dont feel like waiting so long. Maybe they need more training. I dont know if the other locations are this slow. Sandwiches.. I love them.. customer service.. not so much."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place and I am soooooo glad that I finally got to! I loved it. I swear I'll never pay for Sub...uh I mean that other place again. The Engineer was like amazeballs. The price was markedly higher but I'm willing to pay for a great sub like this."}
{"text":"Great food.... hard to choose which sub to get sometimes.... but friendly staff and great service and clean and bug free..."}
{"text":"Friendly service! Excellent Subs!! 12pm visit on a Saturday Food trays delivered once ready. The staff check on you to see if everything is okay with your meals. Military was out for lunch. I had no idea a base was nearby but there was no line when we arrived. A staff member was nice enough to help me choose a good sub based on my preferred taste in delimeats. These are more hearty than subway. Fresh and light bread. No heavy or bulgy feeling after eating. Nutritional information on the company's website. Clean restroom."}
{"text":"Good Italian sub as always but wish this location had my favorite hot sauces like my back home location."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs-the flavors are amazing, however, the portion size in relation to the cost leaves much to be disired. When I purchase a large sub for a little over $9 after taxes I would think it would be loaded and full of meat and veggies. Instead I was teased with an occasional bite of the delicious flavors I was craving while mostly experiencing massive mouthfulls of bread. Disappointing to say the least. I left unsatisfied and disappointed. Just sharing my experience with the Yelp community. Step it up Firehouse."}
{"text":"This was a pickup order at around 7:00pm.  We wanted 2 sandwiches and 1 Salad.  When I ordered over the phone I said I wanted a chicken salad.   The girl on the pphone said they don't have those.   I could then  heart her ask someone else if they had a chicken salad and they said yes.   Sure confirmed the chicken salad and the sandwiches.   When I got there I paid for my purchase.  They did not give me the salad .  Fortunately I noticed it was not in the bags.   When I got home,  the salad bar no chicken.   I think the problem here is training.   They should also repeat the order at the time pickup.   It's too fast to go back.   Dinner was ruined."}
{"text":"Well decided to try all the hype behind the Firehouse subs. I can honestly say I was disappointed in the subs! Nothing close the picture offered in the menu.  I had a smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket.  For the amount of $$$$ I figured I'd be eating the other half later....HOWEVER,  what I received was a sub standard sub. At sheetz or Get n Go you get a Hugh sub for that $$$, the taste was no better than either one of the above mentioned.  Save your $$$$ eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was good but the workers definitely did not like their job & you could pick up on the vibe very quickly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now & both times the workers have been very nice. Fast service & good food. We always get the Italian sub on wheat & no mustard. It's the best!!! Really you can't go wrong with any sub. Very clean place & has a 98.5 sanitation rating. Definitely beats other sub chains, tastes so amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Fast service and good quality meats! Wide selection of sub choices and a new, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of hot or toasted subs, but this place definitely changed my mind. The manager is not just on -location, but he's really setting the pace and mood of this establishment. He's there greeting you at the door, explaining how the menu works and helping you to decide on the meal that will ultimately satisfy you.   The portions are HUGE and they have one of those new coke machines that allows you to create a beautifully flavored carbonated experience.   The best part of the sub is the bread - it's the most important part, and they've conquered it with delightfully fresh loaves that will soothe your inner carb-loading soul. :)   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Well where to start. 1st of all I had no intention of liking this place. I owned a NY deli and I'm a NY food snob. Franchise sandwich shops I used to look down on in disdain. But since there's no real delis here in vegas I tried this. I was shocked. It is amazing. Firehouse in general I have learned has top boars head quality meats that are cut on site fresh. The toppings are awesome the sauces are awesome the bread is good (not Arthur Ave bakery good, but pretty Damn decent)  But I wouldn't write a review just for that. This location is amazing. Don't go to any other Firehouse this is the premier. I have never seen any fast food restaurant so spotless, had every employee in point and accurate and friendly and had an owner that wasn't just adding to the portfolio , but was enthusiastic about the product, really believed in it and gave me the motivation to bother trying it when I swore I wouldn't. I was beyond impressed, and liked this location so much that even though I'm a firehouse fan now, I would NEVER go to another location because when it wasn't as perfect as this one I would just be disappointed and disheartened. Better off to go the extra couple miles to where I know is amazing than save a few min n be disappointed. Thank you Vinnie Alba for convincing  me to just try it. When u got technical with me about the product was when i caved. So impressed"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD POOR SERVICE  First I want to say it's not the food that's the problem it's the man at the register lol. The sandwich I had was a pastrami small and a hook and latter small sub. The bread of both was super fresh and the meat and vegetables were fresh too. It was absolutely delicious. I ordered ahead so no waiting. The only issue was the order guy at cashier was so unfriendly borderline rude. I asked questions and he had such a poor attitude as if serving me was an interruption of his day. I would love to go back hopefully he's not there maybe I will try a new location all together."}
{"text":"So I was driving by and noticed that firehouse subs had a sign and it said \"OPEN\". There were people inside sitting and door was unlocked. So I walked up to counter and they tell me they are closed and they can't serve me. No problem, Jimmy Johns is across the street and it's open. You guys just opened recently and you just lost a customer. If I had pulled up or passed by and the open sign was turned off, bingo, I would have known you were closed. Again. No biggie. Jimmy Johns had my back."}
{"text":"Kicks Subway in the butt, the subs here taste so fresh and the bread is always fresh out of the oven.  My favorite part about the place is the hot sauce selection.  I am a sucker for hot sauce, and they carry about thirty different brands.    It gets pretty crowded here around lunch time, so I would hit it up during the less hectic hours.  Their vegetarian sub is delicious.  I have heard that there BLT sub is pretty money as well.  They don't get enough recognition, but they sure do deserve it."}
{"text":"Place just opened and I had not ever had it so my husband and I stopped in we shared the meatball dub and the beef and cheddar brisket both were fantastic"}
{"text":"Best firehouse subs in Vegas! Always the best experience! Always greeted by every employee coming through the door! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Everything nice and clean. The sub's are way better than subway. No more subway. Firehouse sub's here I come for my sub's."}
{"text":"I been here before. Put today I will leave my comment. Normally the employees are just there to be there and not too friendly. BUT TODAY there was a young lady there (she must have been new) she had the warmest smile, very friendly and polite. She was working with someone else whom also was really friendly and helpful.  I think that young ladies name where Zaria and Tasha. People like that make you want to keep coming back more AND THE FOOD IS GOOD!"}
{"text":"WoW, this place is so Yummy! I had the smoked BBQ Brisket n chedda. It was absoloutly delish! Brisket was tender juicy and sliced thin, sweet baby rays BBQ sauce and melted chedda cheese made for a wonderful experience. So worth the drive from wherever you are. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Firehouse subs make the best sandwiches and this location is no exception. The store is clean and the staff are polite and attentive."}
{"text":"There are not many choices in the area, and most are closed Sunday, so I chose to go online and order a Firehouse sub.  I ordered a half Malibu with NO ONIONS and NO SPICY MUSTARD, with black olives and pepperoccini peppers added.  I paid on the web, and it gave me a time of around 15 minutes to be ready.  I arrived probably 20 minutes later, and it was very busy for a Sunday.  I went to the web/phone pickup line and verified my order and got my combo items.  My order, however, was not ready.  He did verify the omissions and additions to my sandwich.  I was handed the bag another 5-10 minutes after I arrived.  Getting home, I was disappointed by my meal.  First of all, for a sandwich, chips, a drink and a brownie, it was pricey.  The sandwich had virtually no meat, and all lettuce.  It also was COVERED WITH SPICY MUSTARD AND ONIONS!!!!  Also, there were no peppers and no olives.  I appreciate the ease of online ordering, and also like the digital beverage fountain.  The choices for a guest are endless, and that is a positive.  I also like that you can \"round up\" and donate to first responders.  As a first responder, I think that's pretty darn cool (even if they are the dark side! [fire])The staff is frantic and clueless, and the sandwich not at all what I ordered.  I will not likely be back."}
{"text":"Another chain sub sandwich restaurant. Firehouse is sort of like pot belly in that you can get a choice of a bunch of hot sandwiches but they have a fire station theme going.  We stopped by on a Friday for a late lunch, around 1 pm. We decided to split a 12\" Italian sub. It seemed to take far longer than the typical sub place but once we got the food we were very pleased with the results. Unlike some of the other sub chains, this one was very generous with the meat. Also their bread was nice and light and the sauces were tasty. My wife and I had plenty to eat and the price was good - around $13 - which included chips and a lark soda as well.  I'm not usually a fan of the chains, but this place was pretty good."}
{"text":"I called to place a large lunch order to go and Carlos was amazing. He was very helpful and patient, even labeling each order with the employees name as well.   He was a pleasure to speak to over the phone and the customer service was tops!"}
{"text":"I usually like fire house subs this place is FILTHY..... We did get food here but did not sit and eat here there were 4 people working and it was dead ... There was one guy actually working doing everything he was nice , but he was doing it all .... The tables were all dirty and there was no one in there, trash all over the floor I believe this store is only about 2 months old ."}
{"text":"First visit after hearing good things.  Not bad!! Got the veggie sub minus olives but, everything else. Diet cream soda . I prefer penn station but, I would stop here instead of say, subway. The staff was nice and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Moved to NC from CT. I wanted to try this place out hoping it was like a deli with fresh meat and bread. Subs tasted just like subway to me, except more expensive. Nothing like a northern deli shop."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and always impressed that the quality of their subs are so good every time.  My favorite is the steamer sub and just superb ingredients.  Friendly staff and great customer service.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was awesome!!! My 1st time being here and I'll be definitely coming back for 2nds!!!"}
{"text":"I love sandwiches! I will pick them over almost any type of meal. This Firehouse subs is good. The staff was friendly and the sub was pretty good. It wasn't jam packed full of corned beef like you would get at a Jewish deli, but it was decent corned beef. They have the freestyle Coke machine and fresh brewed iced tea. I sampled a Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper and an Iced Tea. There is something so delicious about fountain Dr. Pepper! All in all pretty OK. It was 8.74 for a combo and I was satisfied when I left. They bring your sub to your table which is a nice perk.  I am a wuss so I didn't try the hot sauce collection but many were enjoying it!"}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, very open, tv on ESPN with slight volume. Staff asked if you were doing okay and ample parking. Love the selection of hot sauces!! I'll definitely be back as I like to see places like this succeed."}
{"text":"Ok so.. Firehouse subs and port of subs are my favorite sub shops ever! You can only imagine my excitement when i found out that firehouse just opened on charleston & decatur, right around the corner front where i live. Today my husband and i came in for the first time for lunch. Sujey M was the cashier. Im very picky about my subs so i made sure, like always, to give her my order slow and clear. I had to keep repeating my order like 4 times. I said i wanted a medium pastrami and swiss on white with ONLY mustard, lettuce and pickles. Pretty simple  WOW what a headache trying to get THAT in the computer When i asked again if there was swiss and pickles and made sure there was no mayo on it, she smirked and then fixed it like it was funny. When i got my order, it was wrong just as i expected. My husband was almost done his sandwich while i waited for mine. He could feel my stress and said maybe we shouldve went to port of subs. I understand that we're all human and make mistakes but c'mon I had to tell her THAT many times and it still came wrong but the worst part was her basically smirking at the situation Lottiera and Oshay were very friendly and quick to get my order correct and back to me. They cared. In this world today with how the economy is, restaurants (all businesses for that matter) really need to care more who they hire. This girl is clearly there for the paycheck. I shouldnt have to dread ordering lunch.  The sandwiches were bangin once it was right!"}
{"text":"Had a turkey & cranberry \"under 500 cal\" sandwich. Ordered it without mayo so I was concerned it might be a little dry. I was pleasantly surprised! The turkey, lettuce & tomatoes were fresh & juicy. The cranberry sauce added the perfect zing & the roll was soft & fluffy! Yummy! And they contribute money to emergency services & first responders (911 in case you don't know what I mean) so how can you go wrong? My boys are meatball subs & my hubby tried the siracha beef. There wasn't a leftover bite amongst the 5 of us! Added bonus, great sweet tea!"}
{"text":"I love Firehouse Subs!!!! Craving a delicious sandwich? This is the place you need to go to! Their large menu is sure to satisfy everyone, and at a reasonable price too. My 2 favorites are the Club on a Sub and the Turkey Bacon Ranch. The smell of the bacon cooking is seriously heavenly! Not only is the food great, but so is the customer service! So friendly and inviting. An extra special treat is going in when George is working ~ he is smoking!;) 5 stars for Firehouse!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I was in need of a quick dinner.  The answer was to try one of the new Firehouse Subs that have been opened recently.    I looked at the menu online so I had some idea of what I would order.  I got a small tuna and a small engineer.  I saw the magic Coke machine but since I was taking the subs home, I didn't try it out.  Also, I had Holly C.'s admonition about the flavored syrups, so that factored into my decision.  My wife and I both enjoyed our subs.  They were very tasty and the price is good.  I'll be returning and try something else, and yes, I will hit up that Coke machine.  No one was using it when I was there yesterday."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying the food here was not the immediate problem. The food (mediocre at best) was typical sandwich fair nothing to big deal about it you can go anywhere and get the same (which I will choose to go ANYWHERE but here in the future) my problem was with the cashier...Joshua V. This is not how I would hope a business trains their \"management\" to be! First off we were never greeted properly as we entered not that Thats a big deal but the fact that I STOOD IN FRONT OF THE COUNTER AND STILL WAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED is where I should have know to just turn around and leave! Finally Joshua was able to break away from his oh so important task (watching over his coworkers shoulder) he was ready to take the order. As my 11 y/o daughter was trying to place her order Joshua was very rude and started talking over her (which caused him to miss some of the things she wanted on the sandwich) he then made some awful jokes about what all else could go on..I chose to ignore his uncomical banter and continue.. I started to place another order and again rather then LISTEN to what was being said Joshua AGAIN started talking over me! My girlfriend..seeing my utter frustration with Joshua tried to continue the order specifically stating not wanting the bread toasted (toasted rolls are a bit tough on someone who just had some dental work) but she did want the meat bacon and cheese heated (last time we were there the guy behind the counter made this suggestion and was more then happy to oblige the request..wish I could remember HIS name..he is a keeper!)  Joshua in a most demeaning manor laughed and said that \"Thats just ridiculous\" looking at my girlfriends face at that moment I could tell he had embarrassed her! I was now FUMING!! She apologized to him for making the order \"confusing\" to which Joshua replied \"oh no its not confusing, not at all. Its just ridiculous. You just made my night! I'm literally making fun of you..in front of you\" ....you can best believe my girlfriend had to tell me to walk out of that store and to just wait outside because I was about ready to loose my mind on this jerk!!  Firehouse sub's, if this is the type of employee you entrust your business to you won't be around for very long! I'd entrust a sub made by Jarod himself rather then spend one more penny at any of your restaurants!! Sincerely, Lost customer for life!  Just so you know that I'm not some random hater my visit was on 3/26/16 8:11pm and my order #60756 I tried to make my complaint on your website but got booted for taking to long to type all of this out!!"}
{"text":"This isn't the normal Firehouse Subs I go to, but I was in the area.  Service was fast--there was no one in the shop but me.  The tuna sub was as good as I get at the normal shop.    I am a fan."}
{"text":"I wish I had a picture of her (manager's)  face when I walked in at 9:58pm.  Boy was it totally unwelcoming. You know, the \"we're closing in two minutes\" grouchy face. That aside, I love their subs. My favorite subs ever. Hook and Ladder with some hot sauce on the side... yum!"}
{"text":"As far as subs go this place is hands down a winner over the 5$ FT LNG place! Sandwiches are great."}
{"text":"I had a coupon and wanted to try this location. Have been to one other Firehouse previously and not wowed but like to give second chances especially with a coupon. Arrived @ 3:30 on a Monday afternoon with one other customer in restaurant. Pictures looked great. Order club sub. 3 young men working. Friendly enough but took way too long to make one sandwich. Order to go - 10 minutes tops to get home. Bread was totally soggy. Not even a coupon next time would bring me back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved be this sub shop. The meats are fresh and so full of flavor. My first was a pastrami Reuben. I couldnt wait till I had another. First was a small. Second was a medium pastrami Reuben. Today I ordered the hook and ladder salad. The salad was so fresh. This will be my go to for fast food."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to say that I have been meaning to write this review for some time now as my experience occurred a few weeks ago. I do apologize for not warning people about this place sooner..  My girlfriend and I ordered two sandwiches, two bags of chips, and two drinks from Firehouse subs online through the Grub hub app..After receiving our food, the first thing we realized was that our chips were wrong and two random bags of chips were in place of what we had ordered and that was just the beginning. (I have never been one of those customers who nit picks everything.) I said oh well and moved on..) Now on my sandwich I asked only 5 ingredients .. ham, cheese, lettuce, mayo, and mustard.. when I pulled it apart..my sandwich consisted of only ham, lettuce, and mayo..no cheese and no mustard..my girlfriends sandwich also had no cheese. At this point, still remaining calm, I called Firehouse subs myself to kindly explain that our order was not corrct..and hoping we would be able to get the correct sandwich's or something along those lines...this phone call to Firehouse subs is the main reason that I felt not only just angry but also extremely upset, disgusted by the way I was treated, and overall just completely disappointed with the service I received from this restaurant...  When calling Firehouse Subs, a woman answered and immediately asked if I could hold. While on hold I could clearly hear the woman who answered the phone apologizing to another customer about getting that customers order wrong and telling her she will give her a refund for all of the mistakes they had made! That was a red flag right there. When the woman came back on the line I asked if I could speak with the manager. The woman who said her name was \"Wendy\" explained to me that she is the manager and asked what was wrong..I nicely explained that we ordered through Grub hub and that our chips were both wrong, my sandwich was without both cheese and mustard and my girlfriends sandwich was without cheese. This \"Wendy\" woman was extremely rude from the beginning, she blamed grub hub for the chips being wrong and told me she made our sandwich's herself and that \"maybe if you would pick up the other toppings you would find the cheese and mustard\" I thought for a second let me give her the benefit of the doubt and check again..at that point I used my fingers to basically dig through my sandwich even worse then I already had picked through it in the beginning and again came up empty..seeing absolutely no cheese or mustard anywhere. I then told the woman \"I am looking through my sandwich right now, I am not blind, and clearly these ingredients are not here.\" She then got extremely angry and even more rude towards me and proceeded to call me a liar and tell me they put a very thin line of mustard and thin layer of cheese and that she knows the ingredients are there and that it's not her fault and that it is my problem if I cannot see them. At this point I picked every single ingredient off of my sandwich and sure enough NO CHEESE AND NO MUSTARD. The woman then told me to figure it out with grub hub then and hung up on me. I WAS SO ANGRY AND DISGUSTED WITH THE WAY I WAS TREATED AND WITH HOW I WAS LOOKED AT AND CALLED A LIAR. At this point my sandwich was demolished and disgusting plus was without the ingredients I asked for that would even allow it to taste good in the first place.  The best thing they could do for me is give me a 10% coupon for grub hub for my next order. If I had a vehicle at the time I would have made sure to go to the restaurant myself to show \"Wendy\" that she indeed did make a mistake and explain to her how poorly she had treated me and at the end of the day that's just not right and not how you treat or speak to customers.  I have worked at many restaurants, and the one thing I have always learned is that \"the customer is always right\". instead of yelling at me, making me feel like an idiot and calling me a liar..but most importantly not helping me to receive a new sandwich and not once taking responsibility instead of blaming the customer.. leaving me with a mangled mess that I didn't order as well as leaving me to feel angry, upset, and hungrier then ever.   In conclusion to my story..I WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN, I HAVE POSTED ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND TOLD MANY PEOPLE NOT TO EAT HERE AND ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE THEY SEEM TO TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO THANKS WENDY YOU'RE A REAL WINNER AND A GREAT EMPLOYEE. If I could give this place -5 stars I would..because honestly 1 Star is way too much."}
{"text":"Orders being made incorrectly with no resolution. Told to come back to the store for a refund, even though this was an Uber eats order (twice). I typically love their food but they must not be training new staff on what goes on each sandwich."}
{"text":"These firehouse subs are sandwiches that are stuffed with lettuce and hardly any meat I know some fireman and I don't know any fireman that go there to eat here!! High priced empty sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"Think no matter what location you go to with these firehouse places!, they just do not put a whole heck of a lot meat on their subs!!! Any fireman i know wont go here!!! Lol i think its a rip! Spent 15.00 on a sub with very little meat!!!"}
{"text":"Good place, this would be the 3rs time here and I am really full. I love those sandwiches, and the flavors are amazing. The size of the sandwiches are good, but a little pricey. I ordered a large #10 with chili and it cost $17. PS: It's not filling for some reason, I'm hungry and its only been two hours."}
{"text":"I will never understand this place. It is sooo slow. There is always like 10 people standing around waiting for their food. But what is even more confusing is that there are like 10 people working behind the counter. I always laugh to myself and think \"what could they possibly be doing back there that's makes the process so slow!\" So then you have to wait for the drink machine that the other patrons just cannot figure out how to navigate their way through. I guess there are just too many drink selections. What saves this place is the subs are actually really good. (Once you actually get the sub served to you so you can finally eat it )"}
{"text":"Just stopped in after work, I e heard good things so far. I ordered a large Italian and it is delicious. Among most sub places they only offer chips as a side. A pasta or garden salad would be a nice healthy touch but no big deal.  Large sub and a bottle of water for 12$, pretty steep but definitely worth it for a splurge... Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Very clean. Not too busy right now but the employees are we busy restocking and cleaning instead of standing around talking or on thier cell phones. How refreshing."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot!  I know it's a chain restaurant, but a difficult work week after the long holiday weekend meant I was anxious to try a new sandwich after work this evening.  [insert fire engine siren sound effect here]  * weeeeee-oooooo  weeeeee-ooooooooooooooooooo*  That was me making the sound effect with my mouth.  This location is in a super-duper convenient location right off the 101 & 67th.  Depending upon what way you're coming down the 101, you hang a right (or left) on 67th, take your next left into the parking lot and voila!  Your destination will be straight ahead of you.  As I mentioned, super convenient, tons of ample, wide-space parking stalls and plenty of places to park out in the boon docks if you loathe door-dings like I do.    First impression... the employees seem to genuinely care about this place and the work they do.  It's not often I can say that (or have ever said that about an employee at a restaurant chain) but it's obvious at Fire House Subs.  The restaurant is quaint, but insanely clean.  There was not even so much as a crumb on any of the empty tables.  My sneakers didn't stick to the floor next to the soda fountain machine and napkin holders were at each individual table.  SCORE!  I spent a minute or two browsing the menu when I spotted \"Ruben!  Limited time only!\"   So I read the description more closely... blah blah blah loads of cheese.... blah blah hot fresh meat... blah blah crispy cole slaw... pickle spear.   SOLD!  I will take your new limited edition Ruben, please.  The sandwiches come in small (4\"), medium (8\") or gluttonous (12\")  I opted for the medium because portion control is important.  The sandwich was $7 and some change and I opted for a medium drink, as well.  I was out the door for $9 and some odd cents which seemed like a fair deal to me.  Not as inexpensive as Subway, but not nearly as good either.  Enough of those shenanigans, let's chat about this sandwich, shall we?  I opted for the Ruben Re-Invented by Fire House Subs on wheat bread.  Their version of this re-invented deli classic is piled with fresh USDA Choice pastrami coupled with a hefty serving of Swiss cheese.  On top of the pastrami is their tangy cole slaw in Thousand Island dressing.  It sounds like a weird combination.  It isn't.  Trust me.  The crispiness and freshness of the slaw coupled with the hot pastrami and melted Swiss made my taste buds insanely happy.  I was going to do the happy dance at my table by my lonesome, but that would have made me look weirder than I'm afraid I already am.  So I sat down and opted to forego the happy dance.  I don't care for mayonnaise so I passed on that.  My sandwich was delicious.  And the bread?  ....so fresh!  No joke.  In addition to the sandwich, there is a delicious kosher dill pickle spear which was crunchy and as awesome as the sandwich.  But Scott, it's just a pickle!  ...don't judge me.  Please.  I'm allowed to like what I like and it was a darn good pickle!  The soda out of the soda fountain was ice cold, bubbly and well caffeinated just like I like it.   The service was awesome.   The restaurant and restrooms were beyond clean and it was the perfect way to end my Thursday after a challenging day at the salt mines!  Kudos to all of you!"}
{"text":"Good sub-sandwiches.  I usually get the beef and cheese brisket to go.  There's always a pickle wrapped in with the sub-sandwich.    The sauces available is crazy too but I've never added them to my sub.  I've tried other subs here but always stick with the thick and filling beef/cheese brisket.  The staff is nice and even though they're far from the entrance they always try to greet you from across the way.    If this was created by firefighters it must have been an old school firefighter, the foods here do not match the groceries they put in their shopping cart.  Good none the less, but for a more healthy option you probably want to go else where."}
{"text":"Ordered their medium Italian sub via app. Checked boxes for added black olives and banana peppers but hold the mayo. Got mayo and no olives or peppers. Conclusion: the app doesn't work well or the staff just doesn't care. Personal preferences make these subs. Leaving them out is unforgivable. There were less than 6 people eating during this lunch hour with plenty of staff?"}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed by a meal here! It's one of the few places where the sweet tea tastes authentic and since there are free refills, it's a smorgasbord of beverage for me! I love the brisket sub and would probably try to live on that if the sodium and calorie content wouldn't kill me in less than a month. Yum!"}
{"text":"For a \"franchise chain\", Firehouse Subs makes an amazing sandwich.  A bit pricey, but very good.  Also, love, love, love the coke machines with 120 flavors!"}
{"text":"amazing food and the staff is awesome brandon always helpfull i get the large turkey bacon ranch is delicious"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars   My mom was craving a sandwich so we decided to try something new. 4 of us dined here for $32. Not bad at all.   The staff was very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The restaurant is super cute. Lots of fun deco. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you.   Dad and I shared the turkey bacon ranch and the meatball. Both were great - turkey bacon ranch was the winner.  Zesty peppery ranch made it yum-o.  Two choices of bread, white or wheat.  Meatball was good too.  Nice flavor on the sauce, tender meatball, generous cheese.    All in all, a good sandwich, and a good lunch, served with a smile for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Wow this food is amazing!! I was expecting same ol same ol but I was very surprised. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Remember how Blimpie USE TO taste? NO? Okay, well come to Firehouse Subs and then you will know. It's all about the bread and how you dress the sandwich. I got the biggest Turkey Bacon..without the cheddar cheese though. Thought I would just eat the half. My taste buds wanted the 2nd half..and fast. I think I breathed it in. I mean, it was so good that after the 2nd bite..it fell apart and I was okay with that. A good sandwich should be of the following.. All over your face and at least 3 napkins are use to 'attempt to clean your face as you eat. I gave it Four Stars because I wanted the first employee I saw upon entering to make my sandwich, but he told me that I had to go to the end of the counter. I got a good vibe about him, I guess he likes his job."}
{"text":"Aimed to be first in line but was stuck finding parking and ended up being third. Now that I vented, this Firehouse is just like every other one, AMAZING! But with one exception, IT'S ON THE EASTSIDE! Met the franchisee and he is a great guy, him and his wife have plans on opening more eastside Firehouses. They're basically eastside Saints at this point. THANK YOU GUYS!"}
{"text":"The worst slow bad attitude service I've ever had at a firehouse! I mean at least pretend you want to be here. Brutal..."}
{"text":"Decided to give into the color red and eat at Firehouse subs for lunch. The store is very welcoming who does not love anything having to do with fire fighters anyways. I ordered my lunch at the counter with a very friendly and patient cashier. The menu is very easy to read and order from. I ended up ordering the Firehouse steak and cheese.   The sandwich itself was so wonderful and the meat as usual cooked to perfection. The cook was a master at putting it together and while I paid extra for the mushrooms it makes the sandwich so much better. The decor of the restaurant is red in color and is very appealing to the eye as one eats. They have a tele in the lobby and the flat screen is nice and clear and great at distracting one as one eats. I always opt to eat in since the restaurant is so quaint and welcoming."}
{"text":"Friendly staff...we tried 4 different subs and our favorite by far was the NY Steamer. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love ordering my sub sandwich from this place! It is the best tasting sandwich, always made with ample amounts of meats and cheeses! I never get charged extra for my sides of sauce or extra pickles, and the customer service is always super friendly - - not to mention it is always so clean and tidy!! thank you for making my sandwiches so great!!"}
{"text":"First time customer, last time customer at this location.  Messed up the order, plus sandwiches were had very little meat.  The manager was very rude when questioned, then tried to charge me for their mistake.  Also the employee appearance did not instill confidence.  Stay away from this location.  I may try another store at some point in the future, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"I work within walking distance to Firehouse Subs. I don't frequent it much because it is only okay in my opinion. Today I had the best sandwich I've had from Firehouse yet. I had the steak and cheese (minus cheese cause I'm lactose intolerant), with peppers and onions on wheat. Delicious but I've had a stomach ache since. I guess that's not saying much because I get a stomach ache whenever I eat almost anywhere. The Italian is pretty good too. Slightly expensive.   Oh, and if you are getting their cherry limeade from the machine make sure you put sprite in it as well, because I'm pretty sure it's just cherry syrup."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch online for pick up and doing so got us in and out in a flash.  Unfortunately,  neither my husband or I was happy with our subs. I ordered a hot Turkey and bacon sub with peppercorn Ranch dressing.  My sub was drowning in the peppercorn Ranch which caused the sub roll to be extremely soggy.  I requested the bacon to be extra crispy but the bacon was so thin and fatty I had to take it off.  My husband got a meatball sub. The meatballs were bland and they put on so much sauce that his sub roll was extremely soggy also.  We will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Horrendous wait time.  Severely understaffed.   The workers were polite and honest with how long it would take to get a food.  Not a great place for a quick fast casual lunch"}
{"text":"If you like sugar and bread combined then this is your kind of place.    Stopped in for lunch recently with my husband since we were craving a good sub sandwich and was hoping Firehouse would deliver.  In my opinion it failed miserably.   I ordered the \"Firehouse Hero Sub\" which includes smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, roast beef, melted provolone.  Hubby had the \"New York Steamer\" which includes corned beef brisket, pastrami, melted provolone.     We ordered both subs \"fully involved\" which includes mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a dill spear on the side.    When my sub was delivered they forgot the mustard.    The sub looked good but that's where it ended.   The quality of the meats was just terrible.   The Virginia honey ham was so sweet I thought I was going into glucose overload.   That's all I could taste of the sub.  SUGAR!!   Granted a honey ham can be a little on the sweet side but not like this.   Husband's sub had no flavor.   Simply poor quality meats all the way around.   You can get a better sub at Fry's or Basha's using the Boars Head meats.   I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Firehouse's subs are more expensive for the size than most places but you won't be disappointed by the quality! They really put a lot of meat and filling inside each sub.  Today we got the Hook and Ladder and Hero. Both were yummy! I don't suggesting waiting too long though to eat your sandwich! I don't like them saved or refrigerated, I've had soggy experiences.  This location was clean and fast. We waited until after the lunch rush, this location is in a hot spot for lunchtime eating out."}
{"text":"We ordered Club On A Sub and Turkey Bacon Ranch. Both sandwiches came out warm and packed full of toppings! So yummy!  The staff was friendly and the seating area clean. Firehouse has a lot of options of toppings, sauces, and we like how the menu is hit sandwiches!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: this Firehouse location reached out to me regarding my experience and asked that I give them another chance. They gave me a coupon for a free meal. Will update review after I redeem.  So bummed! On my lunch break today, out of all the places to eat around (chipotle, smashbox, etc) I chose Firehouse and was super pumped. Big mistake. The Hook & Ladder I got had one piece of ham, one turkey on it and it didn't even cover all the bread. I wish I had taken a picture, it was the saddest looking sandwich ever. I don't think I will make the trip back to Firehouse anytime soon, Potbelly, I'm coming for ya!"}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Firehouse!\"  Pretty good sammiches here.  A little pricey but it's well worth it.  My favorite sub is the Hook and Ladder: Smoked Turkey Breast and Virginia Honey Ham smothered with Monterey Jack and served \"fully loaded.\" For you rookies that's Mayo, Mustard, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and a Dill Spear on the side.  What's different about Firehouse hot subs is that they used a steamer to heat their meat and cheese which adds a little moisture to every bite.  But that's not what got me, it's that mayo-mustard they use for the Hook and Ladder.  It's soOo good that it makes me eat around the edge and savor the middle for the last bite!"}
{"text":"Overall, very gross. The steak and cheese tasted like a hot pocket. The broccoli cheddar soup was brown and disgusting and my incredibly hungry husband couldn't finish more than a third of his sandwich before calling it quits because it tasted so bad. Even the prepackaged crackers were stale. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Mmm, steamy!  I had never tried Firehouse Subs but I had heard plenty of good things about their sandwiches... So when a location opened up fairly close to my work I decided to give them a shot.  When I walked in, every employee looked up and welcomed me. I let the cashier know I had never been into a Firehouse, and she quickly went over the menu options and let me know that Firehouse steams all of the meats and cheese unless requested. There are two sizes available, 8\" and 12\".  I had the 8\" Turkey Bacon Ranch, no onion, and steamed of course! My sandwich was ready to take back to work about 5 minutes later, and it came with a dill pickle on the side. The sub was slightly messy due to the peppercorn ranch dressing, but not too messy.. Next time I may ask them to go easy on the dressing. The ingredients were really flavorful, you can tell the meats used are of better quality then some other sandwich shops around town.   I will definitely be back to try some of the other subs in the future.   Bonus: Come in on your birthday with a valid id, and get a free medium sub FREE!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place just opened and omg I think I've found my favourite sandwich shop.... sorry subway. Everything was made fresh to order and soooo warm and toasty. Service was amazing and everyone was really friendly and patient with our indecisive order haha. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Normally not a fan of subs but this place is pretty good ive had the engineer with sea salt chips and a cherry coke on two desperate occasions and was def happy  with my meal  the variety of hot sauces u can add to your sub is pretty cool.will be back to try the rest of the subs"}
{"text":"One of the best sub places around! They're especially good for BBQ subs. I love their Beef and Cheddar Smokehouse Brisket. Their King's Hawaiian Pork and Slaw sandwich is really good too."}
{"text":"My 1st time here and it was great.  PLEASANT was so nice and sweet.  I will be back what a great place"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Sandwiches are really good. Staff is very friendly and all of it goes to a good cause supporting firefighters. Supporting Charities ran by firefighters pretty awesome deal if you ask me you should check out Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"It's pretty tough to mess up a basic tuna salad sandwich, so I thought I'd try Tuna Salad sub at Firehouse Subs today.  It looks very good with lettuce and tomato, so I had high hopes.  Unfortunately, all you taste (and smell) is a strong fishy flavor because they use sub-par tuna rather than albacore chunk white tuna.  Quite a disappointment.  It doesn't really deserve two stars, but hey...  The place supports fire fighters and was started by a few of these heroes, so I couldn't go lower than this rating."}
{"text":"Here at 9:23 PM on 17 Dec and this place is closed up tighter than a duck's butt. Said on Yelp that it closes at 10 PM. Hmm. Good food though. That's why I just came outta the house in this wiener-shrinking cold."}
{"text":"Ordered catering for my office from Firehouse Subs with disappointing results. The online ordering went fine but everything after that was a mess. They cancelled my $300 order by mistake and then lost my credit card information, luckily when I called back they hadn't deleted my entire order. Then on the day of pickup it was obvious they had not prepared any of the food and rushed to give us something. The order was 45 min late, the sandwiches were not wrapped individually so you couldn't tell what type of meat was on each sub, and the salads ordered were either wrong or did not have all the ingredients listed. I order food for our office regularly and I have never experienced such disorganization as I did with Firehouse Subs. For this much hassle I don't know why anyone would use them for catering."}
{"text":"Yum! The night crew Ritchie and staff are great! Came in at 8:30 all confused as to what to order, they didn't rush me when I had all my coupons and discounts! Patiently made my grub and it was yummy!  Nice to have a good sandwich combo and service with a smile."}
{"text":"Been to several Firehouse subs before. Likely will not come back to this one. At every other FH I've been to, the employees walk your order out to where you are sitting, but not this one. Also, they were out of chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Food is good, but it seems to take a while to get your sub, took over 20 minutes. There's 4 people working at least. Not sure what the long wait is today."}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Firehouse!!\" That's the greeting you get from the entire staff when you walk in the door (and if you go with my boyfriend, he yells that greeting along with the staff every time ANYONE walks into the place as well). We walked up the register and the staff were wonderful - helpful regarding the menu. The food came out quick, and we could tell it was fresh. I ordered the meatball and it was amazing!   I wish there was one further east (closer to my house), but anytime I'm looking for somewhere to eat in the Chandler area, Firehouse Subs will be on my mind."}
{"text":"AWFUL for the price. My steak and cheese was subpar at best and it came at such a glacial pace I could have driven home and made my own faster. Bland and sogg, left a lot to be desired for $8."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong....I thought my sandwich was really tasty; there just wasn't very much of it.  Since this was my first visit, we kept our order pretty basic save for a total burn. The price was the real indignity for the puny portion. For two people to get descent size sandwiches and not walk away hungry will set you back nearly 20 large for a combo that includes a drink and a bag of CHIPS!  I could have gotten TWO pizzas from Pizza Hut for that price AND had leftovers. They suggest you \"round your change up\" for a noble cause benefiting firemen. Considering the egregious pricing and lack of economy for the buck, that seemed awfully presumptuous.  So there were two losers on this visit.  Again, my order was quite delicious, but I remember a chain called Quiznos that suffered the same fate of tiny portions for unrealistic pricing. I know that I would enjoy this place if I just wanted a taste treat and wasn't very hungry or just had cash burning a hole in my pocket. I'd have to lobby hard to my sig other for a return trip, but I think I'll save that play for another place we've never tried hopefully finding a new favorite among favorites."}
{"text":"this place destroys Capriottis! the new york steamer is my favorite, and all their hot sauces are amazing"}
{"text":"Good variety of subs/ ingredients. Good location. I loved the little area towards the front w/ the pub tables. They have one of those crazy, newfangled Coke machines w/ 100+ flavor options too.  My Italian sub was good. Basic, but good. Service was quick, staff was nice.  We'll likely be back if were in the area again."}
{"text":"Yummy so good!! I ordered #1 with chips a brownie and iced tea. I loved it all, the sub is very tasty with lots of flavor! Definitely one of the best subs I've ever had. I ordered to go, the young lady was nice and friendly. Super fast service and very clean.  Fire House Subs is a must try for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place !!  Our favorite lunch spot !   Very friendly and always fresh.  We have eaten at many sub shops over the years and none of them can compare to Firehouse !!  They also have the best tea!"}
{"text":"With Mr. Goodcents, Blimpee, and Jersey Mikes don't waste your time with Firehouse.  The atmosphere is a bit much and I didnt think the subs were anything to  return too.   The store was clean and the employees pretty nice, but the subs just not there for me."}
{"text":"If I'm helping firefighters then this place gets a star just for that, but they lose the other 4 for amateur food and poor service. Step up the game and this could be a cool concept."}
{"text":"First time ever to a firehouse sub. I went to this location because it had good reviews. I got the Italian sub with hot peppers combo. It was little pricey for a sub place but it was also delicious. I was just bummed out about the toasted part. It was definitely not toasted, more like warmed up bread then anything. It was soft not toasted. I think of a hot sub with actual toasted bread lol. So, I toasted the sub myself at home. Why, I rated a 4 star. But overall, very good sub. Good customer service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, nothing spectacular, it's a sub shop, it was clean, friendly accommodating staff, firehouse type atmosphere, would stop again if in the area, I thought it was better than subway, it's not a place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Was very pleasantly surprised by Firehouse subs!  Our first time visit was yesterday and we will definitely be making this a regular go-to for lunch.  I highly recommend the hot meatball sub - the cheese and spices are perfect.  So far it's the best meatball sandwich I've ever had!  And the prices are very reasonable for lunch."}
{"text":"After not having Firehouse for awhile because of the issues brought up in the last review we decided to see if it had improved. I did mention to the very kind cashier about our last experience and she went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience that evening went well. She offered to pick up the chili and personally made sure it was amazingly fresh and it surly was. I have to admit it was probably the best chili (besides my chili I make at home :)) that I've had all year. It was hot and fresh and absolutely enjoyable. This is the thing I love to see and experience when spending my hard earned money with a business. When they admit they made a mistake and correct it without question is the business qualities that keep us coming back. We eat Firehouse almost once a week every week because they do care about their quality standards and customers opinions. Keep up the good work FH!"}
{"text":"There subs are pretty good but when it takes 30 minutes to get your order for a sub, that is just not acceptable..it is not only this location but pretty much every Firehouse I go to..they either need more staff or figure out a faster process..so if you are in a hurry, I would not go to Firehouse Subs"}
{"text":"I have been to this Firehouse many times. Recently when ordering the Meatball sub, they kept burning the roll. After the last time, I sent an email and received an email back from the Manager Sharleen. She offered me a free meal on my next visit. Today I decided to pick up lunch for a family member and myself. When I asked for Sharleen, an employee told me she was no longer there. I informed the employee I had an email for a free meal and offered to show her the email. She stuck her nose up in the air and refused to read the email or honor it. I ended up paying $19.83 for two combos. There are all new employees and they aren't very friendly. When I use to walk in, a young woman would welcome me with a smile and was always happy to answer a question. The people who prepared the food were always asking how I was and after placing my sandwiches in the bag, would tell me to hold it a certain way. The food may be satisfactory, but customer service stinks! I can get a sandwich anywhere in this town, so I won't be returning to Firehouse Subs on S. Rainbow."}
{"text":"Went there about three months ago and it sucked.  Maybe new management or a different attitude-but been back three times in the last month.....great.  So if you like firehouse subs-you should like this one."}
{"text":"I like to stop in here and pick up something when i have to work a double, Subs are filling and great for later. The workers there are friendly and will greet you with smile.   Just stop here if you are thinking sandwiches way better the quiznos and subway. My favorite here is the brisket but the roast beef and meatball are good as well."}
{"text":"After burning out on Subway sandwiches and their quality dropping like a rock, I decided to give another sub shop a try. I stopped in Firehouse Subs on South Rainbow and I am glad I did. Subway has lost a customer.  I have stopped at the Rainbow location four times now. The past three times I have ordered the New York Steamer. It's a great tasting sub and they make it consistently the same each time. I have also stopped at the Durango location. Just as good!  Why only four stars and not five?  I need to sample more subs."}
{"text":"Place is nice, staff is nice but a bit rehearsed.  Always eager to take your trash.  Should come up with better system to bring your food out. Sandwich is kind of bland and not as tasty as places like Potbelly or even Quiznos though better than Subway."}
{"text":"Staff tonight was on point-they all greeted us! Fast friendly service, but most of all they were all attentive and our four orders were made just we way we asked. Thank you for a pleasant experience team! We appreciate your service today! Job well done."}
{"text":"Put more stuff on the sub, stingy bastards, great meat but meat and bread doesn't make the cheesestake take a note from brother cappriotti and put substinance on tha sandwich or don't call it a cheesestake!"}
{"text":"The New Firehouse Subs is open and they have the best subs in Town.  I have had the Steak and cheese 2 times and each time high quality food right temperature and Perfectly  cooked"}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time and loved their Pastrami sub.   I've been turned off from subs after how dismal they are from Mr. Sub and Subway so it's refreshing to have a place that can serve a good hot tasty sub.   I'll definitely be back and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Yesterday 1pm. Not busy at all. Looked to be training a couple of younger guys. Fellow that appeared to be the manager was not engaged. Waited over 10 minutes for sandwich, was okay but not nearly as good as what I have had at Ray and 101 FHS. Place seemed clean. People were friendly. Probably will return but....no rush."}
{"text":"I arrived at 3:35 pm,   And I left around 3:    This location is very clean, their customer service is awesome. They have the special flavor-coke machine,  So they like to call it  Customer service is great, they were very friendly when I walked in and I felt welcomed and happy to be a first time customer. After inquiring about several options from the employee, I decided to go with what they recommended, and a medium is sub size with a big o' chips and drink.    The sandwich was delicious needlessly to say. The bread provides comforting soothing layers of delete goodness. Cheese combine it's in conjunction with the meat flavors to provide a succinct and wonderful bite of a classic Sandwich taste.   They also deliver your order when it's finished ! Great job Firehouse tempe."}
{"text":"Very good food one of the best subs i have ever had i got number 1 hook on the ladder and blew me away"}
{"text":"When you walk in the door they shout at you, which is corny and unnecessary. It is very difficult to figure out what you are going to order with the confusing menus. As a vegetarian, I simply wanted a sandwich with no meat, just veggies and some cheese. If you ask for a cold sandwich they look at you like you're an idiot, so I went ahead and let them toast mine. I drove a few miles home, opened up my sandwich and had a steaming soggy mess. It was a hefty sandwich, but expensive and ultimately inedible. I will never go back, because it will be impossible to order anything with a staff who could care less what you're ordering. What they want, are for people to come in and order your sandwich off the board without any changes. It would be perfect for them if you could just push a button, and a machine could pop out your sandwich. The customer service was amateurish at best, worse, the staff certainly did not make any effort to please me as a customer. I am sticking with Subway, way less money, excellent service, and an average sandwich but light years better than this place."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place ever!!! Never disappoint!! Consistently delicious and great service;) The turkey salsa verde is to die for!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! friendly staff, great and cheap sandwiches, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Going down hill. They gave me the wrong sandwich last time. Didn't know until I got Home. Now going super cheap. They changed out their great bread to some cheap stuff that you get at a gas station sandwich shop. Just fell apart. Get done with that open my pickle and it's a quarter one. It use to be half lol. When you're paying $12 for a lunch you expect quality. Don't cut corners (of pickles literally)"}
{"text":"Love this place! And the donations that they do for the fire fighters to help out the community. Michael is a Great worker and owner of an amazing business! Well greeted as soon as I walked through the door, gonna come here more often!:)"}
{"text":"Tried to order online... Doesn't work. Waiting 15 minutes and watched one of the sandwich makers remove his gloves, wipe his nose, run his hands through his hair, and then touch food. Done with this place."}
{"text":"Great food nice people but i never get my damn pickle... they have good pickles and i never get it. Please for the love of fermentation give me pickles! Edit: i found the pickle under the paper thank you fire house."}
{"text":"You haven't eaten here yet!? This place tastes amazing! No joke. This is by far my favorite sub place.  Unfortunately I only go there so often cause I HATE the employees.  It's a super annoying environment and they're SO unprofessional there. Every time I go, without fail, there is some \"freind\" of an employee there hanging out. And they're goofing around and ugh... It's just an immature environment.  But the food is to die for... If only they had a drive-thru."}
{"text":"The subs are tasty -- I like the Turkey Bacon Ranch -- however, if you take it with you, expect it to be a bit soggy from condensation or whatever."}
{"text":"I have been to Firehouse Subs once and I would love to go back again.  I want so desparately to like them.  And the truth is, the one time I went, I  was digging my sandwich.  It was a very good sandwich.  I'm not sure what I was tasting (mayo, mustard or dressing), but I picked up on the slightest bit of horse raddish.  It was a welcome addition to a basically standard sandwich.  I got the combo with a drink and a bag of chips.  It seemed pricey for a sandwich shop but I still enjoyed it.  And I liked the theme with all the fire gear and named sandwiches.  I suppose what is preventing me from going back is the price.  I drive by and am so tempted to stop but then I decide on something faster and cheaper.  I usually end up at Taco Bell.  I did go back in a few weeks ago.  Then I walked right back out.  There was a crowd gathered at the counter with no defined line for ordering or for pick up.  I don't stand in clusters.  The lack of orgnaization turned me off and I went to the Rubios around the corner.  I'll go back again sometime.  Eventually.  For now, there are other sandwich shops that are more organized and have good sandwiches of their own."}
{"text":"This is the best subs you can ever get!! I am so hooked with this meatball sub!! Third day without missing a beat!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is delicious. You really can't go wrong here. Fresh bread, good quality cold cuts and melt in your mouth cheese. I have recently discovered the New York Steamer which is pastrami and corned beef with provolone and Italian dressing all melted together. It goes especially well with a nice chipotle sauce from the great selection of hot sauces from the counter and also some nice crunchy jalapeno kettle chips.   The special choose from a bunch o' drinks coke machine is pretty cool too, although I get a little overwhelmed and never know what I want. Service has always been great and the tables are always clean even when it's busy. The best time to come during the week is 2pm-3pm to avoid the crazy lunch or dinner rush. Overall Firehouse is delicious, I will be back."}
{"text":"I had the Firehouse Hero, hot roast beef, turkey and ham. It really lacked in flavor, just tasted like warm mystery meat. This is my first time eating at Firehouse and I wasn't impressed. The meat was piled up in the middle so I opened it up to spread it around and with 3 meats it barely covered the bread. Expensive for a toasted sub. Also they made my sandwich on wheat but I asked for white, not a big deal, but when I asked to have it remade they didn't even apologize. And I had to wait until they finished making the other guests sandwiches. I won't be coming back, customer service isn't there, no flavor and overpriced."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place. I love the hot sauce on display for the customers taking, the sub is always fresh and delicious, I get the Italian. Only had one questionable experience where people ordered after me seemed to be getting their food before I did. I think they forgot my order! Other than that it's great! I suggest it for a lunch break."}
{"text":"Best staff and best sub here in Charlotte.  Even though it's always busy in here the staff always make sure to walk buy to clean your trays and ask how the food go.  Best deal on Sunday for every adult combo you can get 2 free kids meals."}
{"text":"Yuck! Gross! Ew!  i have worked next to this place for over a year and just finally went in to grab a sandwich real quick in between shifts.  It was the most disgusting sandwich I have ever ate!  It was a 'veggie' but the viggies were a ton of ice burg and a few bananas peppers, it was falling apart, bread was wet. It was not good at all.  My stomach was sick the rest of the day, and I'll just leave it at that.  Needless to say I will not be returning. bummer. ;/"}
{"text":"This is the best experience I've ever had at a restaurant! If I could give 10 stars I would! We came in for dinner and not only did Tim go above and beyond to provide excellent customer service but our meatball subs were delicious!! I created a yelp account just to give this review, I was so impressed with the customer service! Thank you so much Tim for making this such a great experience for us!"}
{"text":"Had the pastrami sandwich. It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami. It was good.  Good food hAs the power of time travel.   This is a great place. Plus the coke is primo. Good mixture. The ice makes it over the top."}
{"text":"New Location, Awesome Mural, Community Friendly, Awesome staff, Great Food and amazing variety of Hot Sauces.  A Must Try."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches no doubt! Always to a good cause also. The only reason for 4 stars is just that's it's an awkward setup inside. All in all, if you are looking for a great sandwich, you will find it here"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and awesome.  The staff is always super nice and inviting.  Get the sweat and spicy meatball sub and thank me later.  I've been a faithful customer since the day they first opened."}
{"text":"First off I am a fan of firehouse subs. I have been to multiple locations in the valley and I say 99% of the time have a great experience. I usually order the smokehouse cheddar and brisket which is a barbecue brisket sandwich. For the last two months I have been working on a project in Buckeye and this firehouse is located rather close so I was excited to have one to visit for lunch during the week. Out of four times I've ordered food there to go twice they forgot to put the bbq sauce on my sandwich. How do you forget to put barbecue sauce on a barbecue sandwich?! The other 2 times that they remembered the bbq sauce the food was less than satisfactory to say the least. This location suuuuucks. What a pity and a disappointment. I might also add that our staff ordered lunch for pick up one week and  every sandwich was labeled incorrectly. A chicken sandwich labeled and Italian, a brisket sandwich(with no bbq again) was labeled an engineer sandwich and an engineer sandwich labeled a brisket sandwich. Extra Greek olives on a salad that was requested without olives. How can these people perform so poorly?! Idk if they are too new, too young, or just in a rush or don't care about serving quality food. Either way I will never get food from this location ever again and our staff will never order from this location ever again."}
{"text":"Dude, the number 10 beef briquettedont know if im spelling that right but bomb! Especially with the hot sauce selection which is number categorized from 1-holy sh*t that is too hot! I crave this place. Sub life"}
{"text":"Subs are life. I call it in pick it up. Go to work. Good grub quick service. I wish i was responsible enough to make a sandwich as good as this"}
{"text":"Four people working at 8 on a Saturday night.  No one in the restaurant. 25 minutes to get TWO sandwiches.  25 minutes! Good thing this isn't a real firehouse."}
{"text":"I dunno. I thought the bread was a little too thick and there was a little too much wet dripping out of the back end as I held the sandwich. I got the italian sub... thought it was going to be a cold sandwich, but the cheese was melted on top of the meat. Salami was a bit thin and the ham had just a little too much of that fake smoke flavor.   But Yelp is for my opinion, right?"}
{"text":"I have had the pastrami and the turkey bacon ranch, both excellent and well priced.  Only problem is a regular is to small and the large is too big.....delema"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, my kids won't bother with a sandwich anywhere else now! The kids love the new soda machine with a bunch of flavor options. My kids love the meatball sub and I had a great turkey subthing or other... it was great, I need to go back to remember what sandwhich it was :)"}
{"text":"I had heard so much good stuff about this place, I just had to try it. And boy, was it everything I had heard & better. I got the hawaiian pulled pork with coleslaw. Holy Pig! That was the best sandwich I've had in a loooong time. I will definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"Wanted to writ a review for you girls! This place was clean and their pop machine rocks! The girls that were working there at night on my birthday gave me a awesome sub for free as my birthday Sammy! They helped me pick out a yummy one and were super nice! I went on 12/30/2014!"}
{"text":"This is my daughters favorite sandwich place. Its decently priced and very fresh. This is usually my go to sandwich place. I love their chili so I was very disappointed when I went today and their chili tasted burnt. Almost as if it was sitting too long and they gave me the bottom of the pot or they just burned it. Not sure but I was disappointed about that. Their chili is usually super tasty. Has some spice to it and great flavor. We always get the #9 combo. My daughter and I share a large. She devours their sandwiches and shes only 7. I would have given 5 stars except the chili disappointed me which I was very surprised about cause the past couple times I have had it its been so yummy and fresh."}
{"text":"Terrible. Completely wrong sub. Waited over an hour for delivery. Semi warm. Offered a free medium and chips next time. I paid for a large. I will never spend my money here again."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is something that I have just recently tried. I am sad that I waited so long.  This location is great. The lobby is really big, and is bright as well. My husband and I ordered the Malibu, which has turkey, spinach, tomato, onion, guacamole and spicy honey mustard sauce. We actually split a sandwich, and asked for the honey mustard on the side. My choice. It is a good sauce, but the 'spicy' in it is horseradish. Although it is a mild horseradish flavor, I am not all that fond of any kind of horseradish and didn't want to overdo it. I need not have worried. The sauce was pretty tasty, and I ended up putting on more of it that I originally thought that I would. We were given the option to 'split plates', which they gave us each our own basket and cut the sandwich in half. We each got a pickle as well. Nice!  The bread is so fresh, and really tasty. The bread really makes the sandwich. The sandwiches are not brimming with ingredients, but what they do use tastes very fresh and is flavorful. My husband is a huge fan of hot sauces, and was thrilled to bring back a few samples of their hot sauces to the table. They have small cups to use so that you are not taking the entire bottle back to your table. They are also numbered according to their heat level. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Fresh, hot subs with nice friendly service. Doesn't get much better than that. It is a busy place for lunch though. You may have to wait a little bit to place your order and get your food. Be care to specifiy want you want on your sub or you may get something that makes you have a frowny face when you bite into it! The place is more expensive than your run of the mill types of sub places but it's worth it if you want a treat once in awhile. You have a choice of a medium or large sub on wheat or white. They offer combo meals with chips as well. I haven't tried the cookes as I have no sweet tooth. They have the fun fountain drink dispenser with the gazillions of combinations you can come up with making your soda fountain drink, including flavored seltzer waters! Enjoy your next yummy sub lunch at Firehouse. You will enjoy and have satisfied those tummy growls!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, fun atmosphere!  Food: My favorite is still the Mediterranean (see my earlier review). But today I wanted to try something different and ordered the Meatball Sub, sweet and spicy style. It was flavorful, but too sweet for my tastes.  Cost: Reasonable if you steer clear of the combo meal.  Service:  Good, as long as you don't ask for something that's not on the menu. I tried to get a sandwich made in salad form, and they could' do it. (Jersey Mike's just down the road has no problem with this.)  Atmosphere: Fun!  Overall: Fast service and good sandwiches keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. While driving by, noticed this location close to my home. I keep hearing all of the commercials on the radio about Firehouse Subs and how different they are from other sub places. Went online and looked at their menu. I saw all of the photographs for all of their subs and they all looked delicious! I decided to try the chicken salad sub. Now, I know that advertisement pictures are often exaggerated to entice you. However, when I got my sub home, opened up the wrapper and saw nothing but bread I was puzzled. In the photograph the sub was piled high with chicken salad. It was spilling out the sides. I even believe in their commercial they say things like \"piled high\" when referring to their meats. However, I had to lift off the bun, lift up the tomato and the provolone cheese to find any sight of the chicken salad. Disappointing. On top of that, I was not impressed with the taste. The chicken salad had sort of a peppery taste to it? It's hard to describe. But I have had much, much better chicken salad elsewhere. I am going to give them another try and try a different sub next time. If they strike out twice I'm not even going for a third. I will go back to getting my subs at Which Wich."}
{"text":"Great, clean place. The girl taking your order was super nice and asked all the right questions.  The sandwiches here are always soooo yummy.  The guys making the sandwiches were pretty fast."}
{"text":"I love they way they steam their meat before serving it on the bread.  Service is always nice and friendly. I can even get the kids food from here and they don't mind. Favorite is the Italian.  Kids - meatball."}
{"text":"A convenient location in the Ajax Costco plaza to grab a quick bite.  Their sub is decent.  More like Quiznos with a little extra.  I like the selection of hot sauces (20+ varieties) and the mock firehouse decor is cute.    With an average sub costing over $12 - $15, it's not the most economical option."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the subs here. They really lack flavor. Capriott's has much better tasting subs. However, there are some positives. My daughter loves the Coke machine. It is a hit with kids and I think many adults as well. The chance to try different flavors is unique and fun. The restaurant is always clean and the service is good. i like the fact that they have opportunities to support local fire departments.  At this location the new manager Ryan here gave us excellent customer service. My company uses this site for catering business lunches and he goes above and beyond to make sure our order is correct and that we are happy."}
{"text":"I was really excited when they opened up in the neighborhood. Boy was I in for a surprise. Had a brisket and cheese hot sandwich, I do believe.  Spent the rest of the day and part of the next morning in the toilet. Talked to their corporate headquarters about my visit, they sounded very interested in my experience. They offered me a free meal. So it took a while for me to give them a second try. Another surprise the person in charge was very rude and condescending when I tried to explain to them very nicely about my supposed free meal without being rude and saying DIARRHEA in front of his customers. I will stick to Jimmy Johns which is right down the street... They have wonderful service and I've never had a problem after eating there."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out.  Very expensive for what it is.  Go to a restaurant if you want to eat something a little better than fast food.  My personal experience is that Firehouse Subs is somewhere in between Subway and Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"These subs are amazing! The meatball is my favorite. They also have the mixable many-flavored fountain pop machine. I say try it for yourself. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a single sub while crew looked helpless. I've never been here before, but can't go back during lunch if this is typical."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit this location while traveling and ordered the firehouse  sub salad with grilled chicken. It was absolutely delicious! The salad appeared freshly made and cut to perfection! I also loved how the calorie count is included on the menu board. Helps you make a conscious decision."}
{"text":"WORST FIRE HOUSE SUBS IN LAS VEGAS.  i honestly dont even know where to start. I never came here to eat, i pick up orders here from time to time for grub hub, uber, and post mates. At first coming here the customer service was very professional always getting a warm welcome even if it was a mad house youd still hear someone yell WELCOME TO FIRE HOUSE. But over time i honestly dont know what the hell happen. The issue first started out when i was picking up an order for grub hub,  I saw everything on a metel shelf behind the counter to the left because thats where they put all of the togo orders. The cashier was very busy so i asked the young boy behind the counter if there was a grub hub order. He said yes and handed me two bags. I looked at him and asked if that was everything confirmed the name and he said yes. Sometimes they see more on their grub hub tablet than i see on my phone so i always make it a point to ask. He proceeced with a firm yes. Leaving the restaurant i double checked for myself and noticed there was supposed to be a fountain drink. So after returning i went inside and said there was supposed to be a drink.  One  of the older girls there said i filled it up it was right next to the other bags.. so after figuring things out i asked them if someone could call the diner who ordered and tell them i was going to be late because of there mistake. That seemed be a huge issue. I obviously rubbed them the wrong way for their mistakes goodness so sorry thought it was supposed to be the other way around buuuut oh well. Anyways the older girl there is very hostile and has the worst customer service. what is truly sad is she's probably the oldest one there always wears a golfing viser straight black hair, walks around the restaurant acting like shes doing something but really walks around with a broom and dust pan not doing anything, ive been in there multiple times and have never seen her doing anything but walk around.. just smokes a ciggerette every five  minutes out front in the fire house subs dining tables under the umbrellas, while everyone has to walk by get cigarette smoke in their face as their entering fire house subs and while their eating..  typically when you see employees take a break and smoke they go behind the restaurant completely away from the customers view. This employee doesnt seem to care like at all.I have been to fire house subs all over the las vegas valley and by far this is the worst one. Everytime i go in there another customer is either having a hard time or walking out. I went in there today for another grub hub order. Upon pick up i was greeted nicely from a new employee/cashier she seemed to Have great customer service. I said i was there to get a grub hub order and before she could even answer me this young african american girl came over cut her off and started mumbling how they never got a grub hub order and she didnt know what i was talking about. Thats seems odd because they even confirmed the order from their grub hub tablet at that fire house location.. So as i said well how can that be you guys confirmed the order the wonderful new girl at the front immediately said no we made that order we recieved that order.The girl who rudely cut the cashier off went and got the sandwhich from behind some box like they were hiding it away in a shitty spot so who ever got their sandwhich got a shitty cold one.The girl proceeded to act like she didnt have any sense and just walked away from me i said theres supposed to be two drinks. She rudley throws two cups on the counter almost both falling off the counter and said here. I said you guys are supposed to fill the order. She proceeded with we just makes sandwhiches we dont do drinks. Okay well how come every other time ive come in here to pick up orders everything is ready? She just repeated the same thing. I asked her what the drinks were because again im not supposed to be filling drinks i cant see what drink the diner ordered because...... again...... grub hub drivers arent suppose to do that and she was completely turned around facing away from me walking away and shouted gatorade and coke. Which they dont have gatorade they have powerade. I think if these employees actually focused on their job instead of getting back at someone none of this would happen. As i was filling the drinks i was talking to my gf who came with me into this establishment and out of no where the older girl with the viser who smokes all the time came out from behind the counter and shouted something very rude and hostile to me i thought she was going to come out from behind the counster and assult me. She not only rudely interrupted me and my gf talking she budded her nose into something that did not concern her she was outside smoking a ciggerett the whole time this was going on and decides to escalate things even more."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Just brought home a medium sub and there's lettuce and sauce on both haves, but the small portion of meat just covered half of it. I'm sure it's a pre-portioned amount but you're basically paying extra to get a small sandwich.  Like the thought of donating the change to firefighters, but not enough to get ripped off."}
{"text":"Good sandwich, busy location.  The soda machine was the main attraction.  You can mix any type of Coca-Cola product with any type of flavorings.  It really is cool bust sometimes it has a very long line to get a drink.   Sandwich was good but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  Parking was easy and ambiance is nice.  Basic sandwich shop stuff with extraordinary soda machine.  Good, could be better."}
{"text":"Service, service, service. Seriously every time I have been here everyone has been friendly and quick to greet me. Not typical of the fast casual enviroment.   Food: if you have ever been to a Firehouse before you know what they have sandwhiches. From hot to cold to item of the month. I have never had a bad sandwhich from Firehouse and this location is no different. Always nice. I recommend getting dressings on the side for any with Italian I like to control the amount I put on.   Go check them out. They beat some of the other sandwhich shops close by."}
{"text":"They are pretty decent with food actually, service is great prices not the greatest, but really my beef with them is that they ask for  donations for the firemen usually I say no but look like a jerk saying it. And well firemen make good money and really work part time have retirement health insurance etc. etc. as most struggle by. so corporate come on don't pressure your customers...  This is same for grocery stores etc..  The question really is do they really donate ALL of the proceeds?????"}
{"text":"Firehouse is a great place for lunch. I love the Italian sub. It has perfectly soft, yet toasted and warm bread. The lettuce is sliced thinly, as is the meat (although there is more than plenty of meat) so your sub isn't sliding around everywhere. They have their own dressing which adds great flavor.  The service is friendly and relatively quick and the place is really clean.  I also love that they have a plethora of hot sauces to choose from.  I only give it 4 stars because it's a little pricier than I'd like to pay for lunch everyday."}
{"text":"Located right off of Ray and 101, there isn't much parking around here at lunchtime.  It gets a little busy and crowded inside, especially the line for the Coca Cola Freestyle.  Prices are also a little high for the value considering meat quality and quantity.  The lettuce is well shredded from the corporate offices.    I've been here a few times because a friend works nearby so we've met here.  I wouldn't drive here out of my way when there are better alternatives on the other side of 101 or down on Chandler Boulevard.  Staff here is pretty welcoming and not just when you walk in."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was great . I had the Italian sub and it was fresh and perfectly toasted . Definitely a great choice for trying something new for dinner or lunch !"}
{"text":"**Beware:  If you are one of the few people with a cheese allergy, DO NOT GO HERE**  They will put cheese on your sub whether you like it or not.  I do not give 1-star reviews often.  Below is the reason I think this place needs corporate management ASAP: I want to start by saying I have visited multiple Firehouse Subs locations, and I have always been impressed with the service and product received.  Since I love Firehouse Subs, I was excited when the Tatum location was opening up.  My husband and I went for lunch within the first couple of weeks of it opening, and it was an awful experience.  Firstly, the manager shouting out things at the employees very loudly).  Secondly, I received a wrong order TWICE due to my lactose intolerance issues (received with cheese and then mayo).  Thirdly, I being somewhat accused of trying to steal sandwiches by the person who put together the sandiwch, since I had to go to the counter to explain my very difficult(?) order to him. Since my husband had waited and waited to eat his sandwich because of my bad orders, the guy thought we had kept a sandwich.    Anyway, we just decided it was a new place that was super busy, so we would try again.  Today, I decided to go back.  It was not busy, but the most tables were taken.  I had a to-go order and specifically told the cashier that I did not want cheese or mayo on my order.  I asked him to put it in big, bold letters!   While waiting for my order, the manager (I think he's the manager) was once again talking to employees way too loud.  He was upset that they weren't greeting everyone when they walked in.  In my personal opinion, he should worry less about greeting every customer and more about QUALITY CONTROL.  I received my sandwich and left.  Later, when I got home, open the wrapper and there it is CHEESE, again.  Once is a mistake, twice is a habit.  Part of the larger issue, is how long a person who is lactose intolerant has to wait to get the other sandwich.  In my opinion, corporate should go there to adjust and fix things.  Although I will still support Firehouse Subs, I will not be going there too often, because that location is the closest to my house. Bottomline: I will not return to a place that is inconsiderate of sandwich changes & to hear a manager talk to his staff openly and loudly."}
{"text":"I placed an order over the phone a few minutes before closing (which I usually try to avoid doing). Never once, not on the phone or when I picked up my order, did I feel like they were aggravated or annoyed that I was ordering so late. Every person I encountered was kind and courteous. And the food was delicious too! I will definitely be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"Delicious and tasty subs! They actually have flavor. The portions are very filling. I've had the salads before and they are good too. We also ordered chili and soup as part of our meals and they were good. The employees were accommodating and friendly. We didn't have to wait very long for our food. My son decided to be picky tonight and didn't like the cheese on his sub. They kindly replaced the meat and cheese on it."}
{"text":"I had never been here but I knew what I wanted from looking at their menu online. I walked in and studied their menu for a bit and went to order. I had a free sub so I was inquiring about how I redeem it, and I was supposed to put my phone number at the pin pad, but it wasn't letting me. Another employee helped and I got the smoked turkey on white sans mayo. I didn't realize there were free extras until after I ordered, oh well. Also I had to remind the cashier to give me the correct change, seems like a pattern lately.   Sub tasted fine, I liked that it was hot. Later though I did find a piece of meat(?) when I went to put hot sauce on it. Nothing spectacular, but what sub shop really is?"}
{"text":"I had the beef brisket sub today.  It was delicious!  The staff was friendly.  I wish the prices were not as high.  I guess when you are a family of four it adds up anywhere you go.  They were not super busy when we got there because it was at 2.  I am not too big into sports but they have TVs with sports playing."}
{"text":"The Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket was aweaome. Very clean. Friendly and quick service. Wish there was one in Hawaii."}
{"text":"By far the best subs in Phoenix!  I love a hot sub with just the right amount of meat vs bread, love the sauce all the flavors blended! I was impressed. This is not just another sub place.  Fast service ( went before 12 noon) they served us 3 minutes later. We all raved about the subs!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good just like any other location. However, their online ordering system was broken, so the order we placed was not ready and they could not retrieve it, despite me having a receipt in hand. Wow, in this day and age, wouldn't it have been nice to get a heads up that the system is not working? I am not sure if the management of this location is to blame for the technical glitch or corporate, but I am just glad we didn't order delivery!   We also were not comped any portion of the meal for the inconvenience, which in my opinion, is poor manners for any food establishment. Likely won't return."}
{"text":"This place is for those that don't like subs, think French bread is too hard to chew and prefer dainty party sandwiches instead of a full sub.  If you love the lunch meats on Arby's sliders and your favorite flavor is the sauce then this is the place for you.  The bread is half the size of a sub role, it's bread and soft so it will fall apart.  The corned beef flavor is in the juice and the biggest flavor is horse radish in the mustard.  Most of these reviews have a common script of new employees (they are too similar). The lesser ones have human content and from people who like real subs as I do."}
{"text":"Service sucks... took 20 min to get my sub... not busy at all... reminds me why i never eat at any Firehouse location... was charged for a medium drink then asked what size cup I wanted??"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just caught up in the moment, but on my neverending quest to find the best sub, I think I finally found it.  I can't believe it took me so long to try this place out, but I'm so glad I did.  I ordered the hot pastrami combo.  At first I thought it was a little pricey ($8.00) but that was before I took my first bite.  It only took one bite and I knew I was onto something special.  It all starts with the bread.  It was fresh, warm and very tasty.  The melted cheese, sauce, lettuce, onion and pastrami were incredible when all rolled into one bite.  Not much else to say except try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Walked in today and ordered two sandwiches. There was only one other person in the store and they already had their food. Somehow I still waited 15-20 minutes for my sandwiches. When I got home neither sandwich was correct. Normally not something that I would worry too much about but when they charge $5 for double meat and then don't give it to you it's a little upsetting. Will be going to Jimmy John's from now on when I want a sandwich."}
{"text":"I was hungry and in a hurry, and this place was on the right side of the road, so I stopped to get a sub. There was one other person in the restaurant, waiting for an order. Nevertheless, just to place my order took several minutes, as the man behind the counter was laid-back and had lots of questions. I paid for my sandwich and then I waited....waited....waited....15 minutes later I just couldn't wait any longer and left, no sandwich. I hope someone else enjoyed it.  P.S. There's not one vegetarian sandwich that I could see."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this location. Abeer and staff were super friendly and made sure my large catering order was perfect and made fresh! Everything was ready upon pick-up and the store was very clean. I will definitely be back.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"One thing you will find at #FIREHOUSE - CONSISTENCY at every location.    I went to this location on a dinner break from work.  I did not know they were there.  My amigo went to Chinese and I would rather eat a sub.   The owner was there and I was greeted, like every Firehouse, with WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE,  The sub was AWESOME and the owner made sure I visited the Spice/Hot sauce bar.  He even recommended some of the sauces.  I tried a Thai sauce and their specialty Firehouse sauce.  THEY WERE BOTH AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  I found myself out that way shopping with my wife and stopped by again and loved it.  They are FAR AWAY from my house and work.  But it was WORTH THE TRIP.    Firehouse - Great Food at a Great Price with SMILES AND GREETING!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently great and the workers are, too! We love coming here for a quick lunch while running around and we always get in and out in record time. I would always recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches here are ok, to decent... However, on more than one occasion at this location, I've had a staff member, ring my order up, take my money, and then make the sandwich with the same gloves on!!!!  Keep an eye out for this, hopefully they will address this issue; as it really ruins dinner."}
{"text":"I would literally die for this place. I come here every time I come home from college because I miss it so much!! The food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible restaurant. I ordered a smokehouse brisket on white and my boyfriend ordered an Italian sub on white they messed it them up three times each time then putting them on wheat including the final time. After being there for 45 minutes with no food and the third one coming out wrong I told the manager we didn't want them and refund our money. How hard is it to make a sub on white. Especially after I told them so many times on white. This does not compare to any of the other Firehouse Sub restaurants and I will never go to the one in Gastonia again. And I would suggest that everyone steer clear of this restaurant . sad excuse for service sad excuse for listening abilities."}
{"text":"This location is the worst.  In two different experiences they have been super rude.  It's not limited to just one employee either.  This time they were rude to my wife and got the kids order wrong.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The family was hungry and we had cooked the first two meals of the day so it was time for take out.  This location just opened so we gave it a try. The fire house theme is kinda cool and free hats for the kids all good. The menu however is hard to figure out and no were does is say what comes on any of the items. After a short wait I figured out what to order, two clubs, a hero and the chili. Then I waited twenty minutes, got my order, then I went back inside and got the chili they forgot to put in the bag. Had I known what the chili tasted like I would not have bothered. The steaming process does nothing for the flavor of the sub, my hero tasted like hot lettuce and sugar (the ham is extremely sweet). The chili was a joke it looked like soup....you would think a firefighter would know chili is supposed to be thick. It tasted like nothing with a tiny bit of heat. Long wait, expensive and sub-par food. Not somewhere I will go again!"}
{"text":"Hmm ... not very busy but things behind the counter are very chaotic. A manager of sorts isn't very polite to the staff and is very loud about it. He left so it's quieter now.  Waited 20 minutes for 2 subs. Will assume it's just because it's a new place and the staff aren't fully trained yet. 3 stars because the subs are great and the location is nearby. No stars for service today."}
{"text":"Redemption  They did a great job. Service was a one. Food looks great.  Sabrina did a great job."}
{"text":"Look I like sandwiches and this place has some really good ones. It's simple I walked in got the hero an ate it then left completely satisfied. Great atmosphere also"}
{"text":"We just moved here from out of state and use to go to fire house subs regularly, so we were excited that there was one so close to us. You walk in and automatically feel unwelcome with the attitude the staff has not to mention you dont even get the right sandwich you order. My husband was missing 2 things from his sandwich, only 10 pieces of chicken and only half the bread was used. So disappointed considering this is our go to place."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, they mess my to go order up.  Today, they decided to \"forget\". me and serve everyone who came after me before me.  I had to go up and tell them my order for them to complete it.  They forgot the pickles too.  What a mess.  Highly disorganized and like a Chinese fire drill.  I have had to call them several times once I got home to let them know they messed my order up.  They have had to refund me on numerous occasions."}
{"text":"I went here on my break from work to get dinner. Got an 8' Italian sub. It was messy but tasted good. Unfortunately when I went to throw out my receipt I noticed I was charged for a combo (drink and chips) even though I declined the combo when offered and was not given a cup for drink. It was not at all busy when I was there so I guess the cashier was just very careless. Obviously I could have paid closer attention but I don't feel like I should have to. Anyway if you go here make sure you don't get overcharged."}
{"text":"Very customer friendly and always fresh tasting subs. What more do I want from my local sandwich shop?"}
{"text":"Tried the beef brisket sub combo. Got the medium size which is totally enough but I guarantee even though you are full you will be wishing you had the larger one. It might seem like the prices are high for a sub restaurant but that is only if you are comparing it to Subway which doesn't compare when it comes to atmosphere, quality or having people that give a rat's ass whether you are there or not.   The new coke machine was pretty cool. Try Cherry Lime Aid."}
{"text":"Went there twice and both times the workers seemed confused / flustered / annoyed. The lady on the register gave us the wrong number plate so our sandwiches went who knows where. The first time I was upsized to a large when I ordered a medium but paid for the large, swipe and go mistake on my part I guess. The second time we waited almost 40 minutes for our two subs because they messed our order up, and then forgot to make it again. This place needs serious reform."}
{"text":"Maybe if your only basis for comparison is Subway, Firehouse will blow your mind! But in reality, it's still a pretty average fast food level sub shop.    The Firehouse Meatball, Italian, and Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket are all fairly decent choices in comparison to other fast-food level sub shops. They seem to excel more with their \"hot\" subs than they do their cold ones. The reason I don't visit this location more often is due to the inconvenience involved. On some evenings, I've easily had to wait 15-20 minutes for a single sub. I'd like to use the \"because it's made fresh\" excuse, but I'm sorry. Unless they're physically slaughtering turkeys and pigs behind their concealed prep counter, I really don't think their subs are fresher than other places.    The setup in Firehouse is really weird. The prep counter is closed off, so unlike its competitors, no one can actually SEE what they're doing. Also, because the sandwiches sometimes take awhile, you often have a bunch of customers awkwardly standing around waiting in front of the counter. It makes for some confusion at times - especially if you've never been here before.  Overall though, their subs are average at best. Service is okay, although I did have a couple of incidents where a girl vertically bagged a meatball and handed it to me (cringe). But hey, it's still a step up from Subway."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite spot to grab a sub!! Service is always on point and friendly. Love that they have Apple Pay and the large selection of hot sauces!!! I literally cannot think of a single bad thing about this place."}
{"text":"I love this sub shop!!  I LOVE SUBS! But here in Vegas I had yet to find a balance of cheap and yummy subs. Here they are both! As you first walk in they greet you and ask if you need any help. The workers here are very nice and answer all your questions.  They have a shit ton of different subs and a huge selection of sauces. I tend to stick to turkey and bacon esque type subs and here I got the club on a club. The only thing I didnt like was the mustard, it seemed too sweet to me. I also get my sub cold and not warmed, Im not a fan of hot meat (not that kind anyway ;)  haha) My son always gets just a plain ham sandwich and chips.   The thing I really love about here is the cherry limeaids! I always get these instead of a soda, sooo yummy!! I put like 5 limes and some sprite to make it like sonics : )  Come here for awesome customer service and delectable subs and irresistible cherry limeaids!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst, flavorless cheesesteak I have ever had. The pregnant wife wanted a cheesesteak. The reviews looked good. I will never!! Never !!! Return even if it is free ."}
{"text":"When the shift leader can not bother to take the sucker out of his mouth to take your order, it's not a good start.   When I explained to him that I could not understand his mumble, he took it out and hid it behind his back?   He then heads over to make sandwiches.  How about you wash your hands Seth.  This place is gross."}
{"text":"I came here for my free birthday sub, so I won't be commenting on the value. I got a powerade with it, so I paid 2 bucks for a drink and a medium sub haha  I was, however, pretty impressed with the place. They were really efficient, they were very friendly (said hello to everyone that worked in the store), and got me in and out in about 10 minutes.   I got the philly cheese steak, and that was really good. I loaded it up including mushrooms, and it was a perfect treat for my birthday lunch. I also saw that they have one of those 120+ soft drink machines from Coke. I had heard about them, but never used one myself, and almost bought a soft drink just to play with it.  Overall I liked the sandwich, the service was great, and I will be back next time I'm looking to a get a sub."}
{"text":"1 USEFUL LIKE=1 PRAYER FOR FIREHOUSE SUBS.  You messed my order and wont refund me? I got a sandwhich from here drove 30 minutes to my house to find out they put something im allergic to on my sandwhich and I called and told them to refund my card and they said they couldnt do it... questionable business ethics right? What kind of place are you running over there.   I couldnt eat it and like im not gonna drive across town in traffic for a replacement sandwhich lmfao. RIP my 12 dollars u will be remember in my bank account forever.  So if your reading this can I get that money back or naw? U can have this nasty looking thing back Ill save it in my fridge for when you bring me that 12 bucks."}
{"text":"I come here frequently and the subs are always good but we seem to find black hair in our subs quite often. The employees should have to wear hair nets. Over all its a decent place to eat."}
{"text":"I've been to this location dozens of times. I always say no pickle and I always get a pickle. Today I told them I was allergic. I still got a pickle. I also said no onions. There were onions. I'm not going back. I've even contacted corporate about this and the fact that they don't seem to care, well I'll probably never spend my money at any firehouse subs shop ever again."}
{"text":"Great subs! But the employees literally were sweeping under my feet while I was eating.  The management should teach them about manners and that it is common sense that while I'm eating I don't want trash swept around me.  I was so grossed out!!!"}
{"text":"The employees greet you coming in the door.    That was unexpected, and cute.  It was our first time here, so my husband asked for a (non pork) recommendation.  \"Michelle\" the owner/manager sold us a Smokehouse BBQ Beef Brisket, and also a Steak & Cheese sandwich.  My husband and I split them to he able to try both.  They were both great, and we will definetly become regulars there.  We routinely go out of our way to Henderson or Summerlin for a good lunch spot.  Firehouse subs, is close to home, but was not our destination today.  We decided to try it AFTER we decided that we didn't want to drive far away today.  I'm so glad that we came.  Michelle and her staff are very friendly people and I'm happy to suport her business.  We need more like her on this end of town!!"}
{"text":"I am done with this place, just ordered a beef and cheddar, half way through wound up with a long black hair in my mouth.  Being a somewhat forgiving person and having worked in the food industry I know this sometimes happens.  Against my better judgement I took another bite.  At least 2 more hairs, I spit it out and went and showed the employee.   His response, \"do you want another sandwich\"  I responded \"no, I want my money back\" He said \"how about a card for a free sandwich\"  me: \"no, I am never eating here again, nevermind\"  ask I was walking out he asks if I want my money back...I just told him to keep it, they lost a customer."}
{"text":"4 star sub shop with 2 areas of improvement to elevate them to a true 5 star joint.  See if you agree.   My first time there I was really put off by the crew screaming at me as I entered. It doesn't make me feel welcomed it makes me feel bad for the crew who are forced to do this. I once worked at a similar job and remember how much we all hated greeting. When you're eating you have to endure this constant barrage of people screaming 'welcome to Firehouse ' multiple times a minute and it got old fast...TIP: Go when they first open because it's slow and you can eat in peace.  Second thing that makes me feel bad is the panhandling at the register when paying for your order.  If I say no I feel bad and if I agree to pay the extra $ I feel bad that I'm paying too much.  Many others I know feel the same way. Just raise the prices 15% on everything, donate the $ and stop asking for handouts on every sale.  Why 4 stars instead of 3 or 2? The food is actually good here. The brisket sandwich is my go to meal.  I stopped going for a few years because at around 900 calories the smallest brisket sub (medium) was way too filling. Recently I found out about the new small sub size and to me it's the perfect amount of food.  In conclusion please stop screaming at us when we walk in and asking for charity contributions at every sale and this place will be even more popular than it is now!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner.  Asked 3x, no mayo.  That evidently meant extra mayo.  Had to have myself and husband ask to have it made properly.  Register girl seemed irritated we asked. Sandwich delivery guy was apologetic. Sandwich was fresh and hot, amply filled with condiments & a side pickle.  Restaurant wasn't packed but comfortably busy.  Might try again sometime."}
{"text":"Waited long time to order even though there were only two orders on their screen. Only chips were available to make a combo while menu was offering brownies, cookies, salads, soups, and chili bowl. Steak and cheese sandwich was a joke. Not eating here again. What a terrible first experience & big waste of time and money. I expected Firehouse Subs to be much better. Will probably choose subway next time."}
{"text":"Ryan and Scott took care of me totally with a remake on a delish Sicilian that ended up with Mayo which I don't eat. No questions, handed over a new one on time just perfect with a smile. Always a great product and a \"hello\" when you come in! Nice!"}
{"text":"good product, ordered out.  military discount appears as free soda.  Would rather have 10%.   Usual order: Pastrami, veggies, large, wheat with spicy sauce.  Can't beat the steamed roll, could have been a bit heavier on the pastrami.   Consistent chain food."}
{"text":"went in for my bday meal - chose the steak and cheese.  it came out, just steak, cheese and bread.   I should have ordered it like O\"Charleys:  tomato and jalapenos, lettuce and buffalo sauce, but I didn't think to until after it was paid for.    #10 sauce lit me up like it should - I keep going back to Firehouse because of the hot sauce selections, and nice sammich."}
{"text":"The sub was amazing and if I would have had just that I would have given 5 stars but I also got a salad to share with my daughter and it was brown and disgusting. We asked for a new one and that one was brown as well. So stick to subs at this place!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit. Clean, quick and delicious. As a former first responder, I even get a discount."}
{"text":"I don't think this place has a manager. Asked 2 times for ice tea and no one would make more not to mention the salad was pathetic and served without any kind of salad dressing. This place used to be good but not anymore. Will not return as there many more choices with better service"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great food! Service is good and consistent! Love the pastrami sandwich and their cookies taste awesome! A huge variety too is good and I love that they toast their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great food and an extremely warm, inviting environment."}
{"text":"First time here in the Italian sandwich is delicious. The broccoli soup is also really good. Everything is fresh and extremely clean. A great experience and I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Positive: Hot sauces galore and nice staff. They have one hot sauce that is called 357 and it made my coworker come almost to tears when he tried the smallest drop. They offer Vitamin Water instead of just soda and also they add a dill pickle with your sandwich (and pickles are pretty rad).  Bad: They're cruel enough to claim they offer vegetarian options. I went with some of my heavy meat-eating coworkers here for lunch and it goes on record as the worst veggie sub I have had. Ever. The peppers and onions were soggy and over cooked, there was too much vinaigrette, and the tomatoes looked rather depressed. I don't think I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would  This is based off of service alone as I did not make it to them finishing my sandwich. This location is by far the WORST in customer service I have ever been to. The woman named \"Nick\" taking my order was rude, short, not helpful or friendly, you could tell she hated her job, ever question I asked was followed by a huff and puff and sigh like I was wasting her time. The place was empty, ZERO customers.  I asked for my drink cup and she said \"you didn't get a drink\" I said I thought I had ordered a meal, she switched back around toward me ripped a cup from the holder and slammed it down and said \"OMG-HERE!\" This woman is the MANAGER. Rude and disrespectful for no reason. No wonder the place was empty. I stopped them from wasting time on making my sandwich and asked for a refund, Nick then walked past me and mumbled something under her breath as another gave me the refund. The employees that were 'hanging out' were just as rude and disrespectful as she was. I probably will stop eating firehouse all together because of this location and the POS manager they had running the place."}
{"text":"I love the gator sauce here. I take a bottle home with me every time I visit. The philly cheese steak is always a good choice."}
{"text":"Walked in to order a sub but first went over to the bathroom. An employee quicky rushed over and in a very rude manner informed me bathrooms were for paying customers only and that I would have to leave if I wasnt ordering a sub. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Subs!!! Hands down BEST subs - period. The Hot Italian is mouth watering. Generous meat portions like you would make at home. Clean Fireman Theme Restaurant, Fresh Delicious Food, Fast Service, Mega-Selection Coke Machine (Powerade Zero!!!!!). This is the ONLY place to get a sub PERIOD!!"}
{"text":"Alex has done such an excellent job. He took the time to explain all of the options to us and made sure we had a positive experience entering and leaving the sub shop. We would come back again because of the hospitality Alex has shown!"}
{"text":"Fantastic staff, very friendly, and clean restaurant. The manager on duty went out of her way to make my order perfect again. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Great subs! Great service! My favorite is the brisket sub, my kids love the coke machine. They round up your change to a dollar for local firehouses, which is awesome."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place as the best chain sub place and I have to say subway , I will always love you but firehouse is killing it. This particular store has a very pretty look to it. They have the newer touch screen soda machines and a bunch of hot sauce options. The sub was great , I got the firehouse meatball with steak added and man that was a Ton of food for 9.75. It was over a foot long and everything was just great . I highly recommend these subs , the girlfriend got the brisket and it looked pretty good also. Anyways the people were nice and the subs were stacked that's pretty much all you need."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken salad and a tuna sub. The bread tasted terrible.The Tuna salad was good and the chicken salad was good. But the bread ruined the sandwich. Maybe the hot subs are better. I will not go back."}
{"text":"I go to this location at least twice a week because I work a few shops down. The guys in there are so nice and at this point they know it's my online order before seeing the name! Nice boys who are always there and make me feel like a special customer. It's a shame there are a lot of bad reviews, but I never order in store, always online. If you don't want the wait that comes with toasted sandwiches, get the app."}
{"text":"It just opened so it's very clean.  I'm not a big sub eater but my husband and son are so I went along and I must admit it was pretty darn good!  Had the pastramie, which if you are a pastramie  eater, that this is risky business in untried waters.  Nothing worse than tough stringy corned beef or pastramie.  This isn't.  It's wonderfully tender, warm and juicy.  Not to sure about putting lettuce and mayo on it (that's how it comes if you don't ask for different) but next time I will just tell them to leave it off.  My son told me I could do that. Thanks son. But I for sure will be going back.  It does seem a bit pricey but I guess everything is these days. Is $35.00 to much for 3 sandwhiches 3 soda's a 3 tiny bags of chips, maybe not."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better choices for sandwiches in AZ and it's not cheap! But they have the best customer services for a \"fast food chain\"."}
{"text":"I tried the meatball sub. I thought it was going to be messy but everything stayed in place and the meatballs were so juicy and I loved seeing it all steamy after waking a bite! there's also a good selection of hot sauces, sorted from mild to very very hot.  there's only one soda fountain machine thing but it's pretty awesome- it's touchscreen and has multiple flavors! I had no idea a vanilla sprite even existed! There's a firehouse signature drink- cherry limeade I think? It's too sweet for me in my opinion.  I didn't pay full price because I brought in a coupon, I only paid for my drink, but altogether it would have been a little over 6-7 bucks. It's located in a great plaza too!"}
{"text":"Located on the Eastside of town, not a bad little sandwich joint, in fact it's very good. The must try in the pastrami, ok so it's not real deli pastrami, it's its own thing, and that's ok. I also recommend the brisket and cheddar, very good. Everything on the menu is what you'd expect from a place like this. SA a bonus you can take a survey and you get a free drink on your next order. It's worth a stop in, it's a step above the fast food fare thats out there.  Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Food is great. There are about 20 people sitting down waiting for their food very upset.  All employees are working on take out orders when half should should be working on orders for people sitting down. The franchise owner or manager is responsible."}
{"text":"A few people have told me that I need to try Firehouse Subs, so I finally got my chance today after a meeting up in Glendale .  This place has some unique concepts in both the food and décor.  They have a huge selection of hot sauces lined up to try, plus they provide small sauce cups to fill if you are getting it to go.  They also have the fancy new coke soda fountains that allow you to create your own blends of soda.  Of course, they also have several firehouse decorations and dedications to fire departments.    I chose to try the Italian sub, which had the usual combination of Italian meats and provolone.  I let them make it as described on the menu, plus their  \"Fully Involved\" combination of toppings.  I sort of missed the part that they serve almost all their subs warm, and I was actually picking it up about an hour before I was going to have lunch, so I feel like I can't accurately judge it.  I think it would have definitely been better fresh at the shop.  The flavors of the sandwich were more sweet than spicy, which I found a bit odd. I tried the house hot sauce and Thai garlic hot sauce to spice it up. The Thai was good with it, but the house hot sauce again I found to be very sweet.  For my drink I tried their special Cherry Limeade, and once again found this very sweet, not tangy at all.  The dill pickle was great and I love that they sell the old 5 gallon pickle buckets to support their charity, and for $2 a bucket that is cheaper than the hardware stores!  I would say they make a good solid sub and I will be back to try some other subs in the future, and eat them fresh and warm next time. I'll also pick up a couple buckets!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little place. Nice room and GREAT drink selection. The sub i got was amazing. I got the large and ate half.. i wasnt to hungry tho."}
{"text":"Tried the online ordering again and this time it was perfect. When I arrived to pick up my tasty goodness, there was a City of Phoenix Ford Eco van loading up with people, so I was skeptical that my order would be ready, them having just made a bunch of meals for these people. Plus the tables inside were quite full. But to my pleasant surprise, my sammiches were ready! Hooray! I paid online, and forgot about my punch card, and they didn't mention it, so I was a little sad. But that was my fault I guess.  I don't think I mentioned it in my other review, but their-brand hot sauce is amazing on any sub I've tried. I'm also determined to try as many flavors as I can from the cool Coke machine. So far Cherry Coke Zero and Fanta Zero Orange have my approval. :)"}
{"text":"The veggie is really good, but the service is VERY SLOW. Be aware of this when going on a lunch break."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this is good! Hot sandwich , ham, cheddar cheese and chips and a drink. You need to try them."}
{"text":"The staff is always welcoming and friendly. I always get the beef brisket sandwich, which has never disappointed me. This is one of my favorite sandwich shops in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered online, when I picked up they did not include all the order. I called them to ask that they remove the charge from my credit card for what I paid for and they did not  provide and was told by the worker bee \"no problem\", put me on hold to talk to the \"manager\" Then the mangler came on the phone and said she couldn't give you a credit.   Avoid this dump! The food we got was mediocre and it made my wife sick. It's a scam. You think you're helping our hero firefighters, all you are doing is enriching some sleazy ripoff artists  The only reason I gave them one star is there wasn't an option to give them zero, or better yet negative stars"}
{"text":"Firehouse is by far one of my favorite sub chains. This particular location has a large dining area that is always clean. The staff has always been friendly and quick in preparing my order.  Every sub combination I've had here has been delicious. The main sub options come in two sizes and even the smallest sub is too large for me. For the person watching calories they also have a selection of sandwiches that are lower in calories with the calorie counts posted. I can appreciate when a restaurant gives me reasonable calorie options. Firehouse also has delicious Sweet Tea. They also have a section of hot sauces to heat up your sub. The selection is ridiculously large!"}
{"text":"I travel all over the state for work and like it I when I find a Firehouse nearby around lunchtime, as it usually means I'm going to be satisfied. I can always depend on a friendly welcome by the staff, a quickly made sandwich no matter how busy they are, and a sandwich with tasty and fresh ingredients.   Then I paid this location a visit. First, I gave the person who greeted me my order and he responded with \"okay give him your order, he's making the sandwiches\" and pointed to the guy who was already making a sandwich while he was literally just standing around. After I put my order in with the right person, the cashier suddenly started shouting questions to me \"do you want all the fixings?\" \"what about a drink or chips?\"  I found this strange because there was somebody standing there waiting to be rung out.   After I paid, I went to get my drink. I love unsweetened ice tea with my lunch, but they were out. Most Firehouse locations have a back up iced tea dispenser right on the drink counter, but they did not so I returned to the cash register to ask if they had more in the back. That was a mistake as I received the iciest stare from the cashier that I have ever received from any human being ever.  Then, the only person out of the 6 people on staff who seemed to be working, finally replied with a \"sorry, I'll bring some out\". I thanked him and chose a different beverage because I was thirsty.   Last the food, worst Firehouse experience ever here too. First, they took their time making the sandwich and there was only one order in front of mine. I have been to Firehouse locations with customers out the door and waited less time.  Second, the bread was stale, the meat was luke warm, the vegetables were old, and I'm pretty sure they forgot the mustard and mayo.  After I ate, I decided to refill my cup with ice tea for my drive to my next stop, but they were still out and the whole staff back to standing around and doing nothing. I said loudly \"what a crock!\" and left.   I will be visiting other Firehouse locations regularly, but I will never return to this shit show again. Not even if I'm paid to go there."}
{"text":"New place in tempe. The staff was very friendly and everything was fresh and crisp. As we walked in we were welcomed by all the new fresh faces and the manager who appeared to be training them.  I brought in a couple of guys and we enjoyed a little lunch. The experience was great and we will definitely be back.  Pointers:  First, outside patio umbrellas were all closed and the patio did not seem very welcoming. It actually made the place look closed and we passed by it until we saw the 'now open' sign. It was a beautiful day and we would have loved to sit out there. FYI.  Second, it was our first visit to a brand new place. Perhaps a little coupon would be encouraged us to come back sooner and possible invite friends. There is a lot of competition in that area. A little buy one get one would've encouraged a faster return.  Still on my list of favorites but disappointed we weren't able to sit outside."}
{"text":"There's nothing particularly great about the subs. They're ok. I don't have anything negative to say, but nothing really glowing about it either."}
{"text":"Simply the best subs I have ever had.  We tried the meatball , hero, and steak and cheese.   I have to say I was blown away by the quality and taste.  We ordered through a delivery service and loved how the packaging kept the subs in perfect condition . A little pricey but more than worth it. These things are amazing"}
{"text":"I like this place. I have realistic expectations. I don't care if I have to wait . And I don't have any opinions about the employees personal interactions. Every time I come here, I leave with at least one delicious sandwich. My wife said it is expensive. But I'm bad at math. So I'm not sure if that's true."}
{"text":"I love this place! There is so much flavor and options here! I like a sandwich hot and the service is always wonderful! Their iced tea is really great! Their sandwiches are huge!"}
{"text":"Usually I think \"subs, meh... I'd rather real food,\" but this place has me converted after just one visit.   Not the best first impression, though. The employees are supposed to welcome you when you walk through the door and they are pathetically bad at it. I assumed they were all sleeping on the job and the food quality would be on par with the greeting, but I was wrong.  I had the Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket. I am not usually full after a medium sub, so I also ordered a large. Whoa! the large is probably 16\". At $8 it's a steal.   The brisket was delicious. I mean, I'm no snob when it comes to brisket, but I thought it was perfect. Very tender, beefy flavor. Neither too much nor too little sauce. I was there with three coworkers and every one of them found their sub to be unusually good.   I'm totally pumped about this place. I hope one opens closer to home."}
{"text":"Second time this place has pissed me off and it will be the last....Tried putting my order in online cause I wanted it to be ready when I arrived (solo at work) but got all the way to the end and received \"there was an error communicating with the store you selected\" bullshit.  If this feature doesn't work, don't offer it.  So, had to call the place and ask if my card was going to be charged and the newbie put me on hold, came back and said no, nothing came through on our end.  Then I asked, are you sure?  She said, yeah, pretty sure.....  (I ain't holding my breath).  She then said, I can take the order over the phone and it will be ready when you get here.  I was like, ok.  Gave my order and then took off to the place.  Got there, nothing was ready and waited 10 minutes.  There were two people in the place and they were already eating and no one else in line.  the guy making my sub looked to be more interested in the conversation his manager and another customer were having.  Look guys, yer making subs, not mona lisa's.  Usually wouldn't care but like I said earlier, I was in a rush.  Got the sub back and they forgotten an ingredient as well, sub was soggy from 2 cups of mayo to boot.  These places are franchised so the mgr doesn't have to answer to corporate and prob won't even read this nor give a shit.  last time i ever visit this joint and i will pass it along to my co-workers as well.  jimmy johns for now on."}
{"text":"Losing favor with me. Terribly slow. I've been sitting here 15 minutes waiting on a sandwich that should take 5 minutes max. Will most likely be my last visit to the location."}
{"text":"Good solid clean typical Subway with nice people. Ample seating and plenty of parking.no complaints... Not 5 stars due to it being Subway."}
{"text":"Great subs all around - but I particularly like the meatball sub.  The hot sauce collection is brilliant and the Coke freestyle soda machine is a hit for anyone.  Wife loves the veggie sammich (it's all she gets being a vegetarian an all that). :)"}
{"text":"Was craving a meatball sandwich! For like weeks. And once I saw my friend eat one so I was like I must have. I finally came here on my lunch break they don't open till ten so I had to stall for thirty mins but I already knew that from googling them. The cashier was friendly and funny. I ordered and the sandwich maker said my name right (saying my name right gets you extra points) lol I was worried about the integrity of the sandwich so I rushed back to work. I found it wasn't wrapped like other sandwiches but in a sun styrofoam box. Which is cool. Sandwich wasn't all soggy and what not by the time I bit into it. Needless to say I inhaled that sandwich. Despite the fact that the meatballs were still steaming and the top of my mouth is now tingling. It was amazing. And I'm pretty picky when it comes to fresh bread and good red sauce. My whole office said it smelt bomb. Which is something I am selfconcoous about when it comes to lunches. (I'd hate to be the weirdo who stinks up the office with weird smelling food) I could have taken more cheese but I'm also a cheese-a-holic! So I'm sure it was just right for the average person."}
{"text":"Our order for 2 small and one medium sandwhich took over 13 minutes to make. It wasn't made the way we asked. The only reason we came was to use a gift card, and I can't think of a reason to come back."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my go-to lunch spots when I worked from home. The staff was always friendly, they remembered me, the food was good quality at the right price. However, the last few times I've stopped in here, I've left disappointed. My sandwich is often made incorrectly these days. Last time I was in there, it appears there was a new girl learning the register. Another lady, who I assume was the manager, was harshly scolding the girl in front of me for ringing up my order wrong. The cashier was embarrassed, as was I. The whole scene was unnecessary and left me once again feeling disappointed with my experience here."}
{"text":"Very overpriced if you get a combo meal.  It was $20 for myself and my mom. On the other hand it was really yummy.  I had a chicken bacon ranch. This was my first time here and i had no idea how to order.  You are able to add various goodies like pickles..peppers for no extra charge. The customer service was great"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! The sandwiches are always really good. I like how you can order online and then just pick it up at the time of your choosing. If you wait to order when you get there, the wait is a little longer than subway but they make it fresh and it's worth the wait. The place is decorated nicely and it is clean. The employees are very friendly!! Highly recommend!! I'm practically addicted!"}
{"text":"The food at Firehouse is always great - at least there is some consistency there!   This is my second time in the new Buckeye location.. The service here is pretty terrible.  The employees seem so unhappy to be working there!  It was my friend's first time in, but no one bothered to explain the process to her. Such a shame considering I'm guessing there are a lot of first time guests to firehouse here in buckeye.  Our cashier was Emily.. She seemed knowledgeable, but disinterested and unhappy.  Sam was the girl in the dining room while we were there.  She was quick to offer to pre-bus my table even though I had food left.  On the flip side, my friend wanted a to-go container and had to go to the counter to get it.  We saw a manager (or someone of authority wearing a FH shirt) come in during our lunch.  It was actually comical to hear/see the difference in the enthusiasm of the employees after he came in.  The \"welcome to firehouse\" all of a sudden seemed to have some feeling behind it.  Also, where's the signage for the pickle buckets for sale? My friend made a comment that it seemed funny that there was trash sitting in front of the counter... Pretty sure those are some kind of fundraiser, right?  Anyway, I'm pretty bummed that the franchisee is losing out on such a great opportunity to make a great impression on people in buckeye who have very little quality restaurants to choose from.."}
{"text":"After a nice walk around Kiwanis Lake, Firehouse Subs seemed like a interesting option for a quick lunch; to-go order. Worst restaurant experience I've had in a while. I admit, i was indecisive, but my request for input on the 2 sandwiches i had in mind was met by crickets. I went with the medium New York Steamer combo, My friend got a simple kids meal.  The restaurant was empty.  A few employees behind the counter, the cashier, a manager perhaps(?) with his hands on his hips \"surveying\", and two guys going back and forth from the prep area, to the kitchen.. one yelling, KNIFE, KNIFE,.... HOT PAN, HOT PAN... I get it safety procedures, cleanup after the lunchtime rush, but hey, you have customers!. After taking 2 more orders,  the CASHIER finally started making our sandwiches ...a good 12-15 minutes later, we got them, the bags surprisingly light.  The kids meal comes with a Fire-hat, had to ask if we could go grab the hat.  Disappointed, We made our way back to work hoping the sandwiches somehow  were worth the wait.   I did a double take, and just had to show my co-workers my $10.76 combo meal, while they laughed and shook their heads at my paltry, limp, dull sandwich. So Embarrassing!  So not going there again!"}
{"text":"I visited your store today at 5:15 and there was a girl cashier and one guy making sandwiches two other families came in after me. It wasn't the usual good experience I normally have at Firehouse. It took a total of 30 min from the time I ordered to the time I received my sandwiches I realize I ordered 6 sandwiches three small and three medium but only the one guy in a blue shirt was making sandwiches the girl who's name tag said manager did nothing at all. She stood there just watching the guy.   Two more families ordered and they also waited a while. She also stood there and watched at one point he stoped making sandwiches and just talked to the girl then she left him and went to the back. Our sandwiches came out two at a time and the guy in the blue shirt who made them and brought them said he was sorry for the delay but was experiencing an emergency. He didn't say much else. We finally got our sandwiches and someone else in a red shirt got there to help out.   The girl never returned. But again she was no help because she stood there and did nothing. If her role is truly manager she should have stepped in and helped out it's the right thing to do."}
{"text":"Yet another good sandwich shop in town. They always give my grandson a fire hat. Only drawback is they serve Coke products. Sandwiches are good, recommend the hook & ladder or the corned beef. Comfortable seating and clean surroundings."}
{"text":"Better visit 2nd time around. They're keeping the warm pulled pork/coleslaw sammie, now (was limited time). That's worth stopping in for, just that one! They've perfected it. The semi-sweet Hawaiian bun seals the deal. Yummay!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. The staff at this location are always friendly and the interior  always seems to be very clean."}
{"text":"I ordered an italian on wheat with no tomatoes. After my first bite I realized I had made the biggest mistake of my life. Little did I know I would never taste anything as delicious as that sub ever again."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, if I'd posted a review for FS the last 100 times I ate there- they would've gotten 4-5 stars... However, I've moved from Boca Park area in Summerlin so the closest FS was at Flamingo & 215- they're awesome! But now I tried the 6070 S Rainbow/Patrick location & although they were super nice - the floor was riddled with spilled soda along with A LOT of trash & they were NOT busy.. I called ahead for 2 large Italian subs with dressing on the side. After dodging the obstacle course of crap, I paid & verified with the cashier the dressing was on side & she assured me it was but she didn't check & by the time I was about to pull out of the lot, the nagging sensation that she could be wrong got to me so I opened the bag & Surprise! No Dressing! I know-BIG shocker! Also the receipt in the bag was for someone else's order! So I go back inside, walked past the trash for a 3rd time & they were very apologetic but we soon realized the bag was indeed someone else's order... Got home & was further disappointed by dressing already on the sandwiches & soggy ass bread  we ate a few bites but ultimately paid $20 for inedible food & Had to throw both subs away... Not sure what the deal is with them but just from the lil but we ate, both my fiancé & I were quite ill... I'll spare u the gory details but I will say we're glad We stopped eating when We did! Seriously doubt I'll be craving FS for a while! It could've been a fluke but idk for sure.. All I know is it's almost 1:30am & we ate at 4pm but yet my tummy is STILL sounding like an alien wants to pop out!  I wish I had 2 more hands to give this location 4 THUMBS DOWN!"}
{"text":"Great subs, finally in Vegas.  One drawback, eat the hole sub the day you get it, reheating the next day, not so good."}
{"text":"Great subs, only one drawback, if you only eat the half and save the other for the next day, not so good."}
{"text":"I used to eat here somewhat regularly, but haven't in a few months.  They have changed their menu, eliminating some cold sandwiches which were my favorites.  I ordered an Italian sub and was very disappointed  --  it was greasy and sloppily made, as if made by a small child.  The restaurant was dirty, tables hadn't been cleaned while numerous employees stood around with nothing to do.  This place makes Subway look great!"}
{"text":"One cashier who can't seem to be able to tell a customer what's in a salad. Line 8 people deep so someone who works there says get on a register ...to which the girl replies..when I finish this . She stands around with a bag in her hand for four minutes. We walk out and the sandwich prep guy says have a nice day. I left not to return to this location for sure ..maybe. It to another"}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs opens up closer to me! Granted it's still a drive, but it's the closest one to me now. And it's in an area of town I often frequent.  I stopped by today while running errands in the Henderson area and the place was packed. There were only two tables open, and it was about 1:30 in the afternoon. As with other Firehouse Subs this one has that (obvious) this place is made by firefighters feel. From the dalmatian spot tables to the firefighter jackets hanging behind the place where the employees are working.  I did wait about 10 minutes for my sandwich to be made. That IS a little long considering this is a sandwich place competing with other places like Subway that make sandwiches pretty darn fast. It's kind of weird to me that sandwiches come out that slow considering how many employees there are working behind the counter. However - all sandwiches are warmed up so maybe that is where the extra bit of time comes into play - I'm not sure. Even though the wait was a bit long I LOVED my favorite Hook & Ladder.  While I waited I got a few hot sauces, and there are plenty of them. Do not miss getting some sauces to put on your sandwich. I personally like the Firehouse Subs signature sauce, it reminds be of Batch 88 from Quiznos.  Overall I will return to this Firehouse Subs quite a bit I am sure. They are still currently my favorite place to get a sandwich. Oh remember - they give you a pickle with your sandwich combo!"}
{"text":"Firemen - yum.  Sandwiches - also yum!  Hey, how can I not like a place that is owned and operated by firemen? Considering my obsession with Rescue Me, I'd say that's pretty much impossible.   On my birthday (May 1st) I decided I would try out Firehouse Subs. Because guess what? You can get a free medium sub on your birthday here - your choice of which kind of sandwich! I decided to do this on my birthday because FS is a bit out of the way for me to drive to, but it's been on my \"To Try\" list for awhile. Now I wish there was one right up the block from where I live. It's so frustrating to be faced with ONE sandwich option in my neighborhood: Subway. Boo.  As for Firehouse - they have now been moved into my top sandwich spots! I personally think they are better than Cap's and the setup of the shop is nicer than Cap's as well. I think the \"firehouse\" decor adds to the experience and of course, the multitude of hot sauces to sprinkle on your sandwiches kicks everything up a notch! Excuse my Emeril euphemism.   On my trip I got the Hook & Ladder: ham, turkey, melty cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and this nice deli sauce mustard - mmm! Without the mustard it's just an ordinary sandwich, but with it - oh my...   The staff was nice and happy about my birthday sub (yay!) and I really love their Coca Cola machine. It's like the new ones inside Five Guys burger places.  Overall - 4 Stars! Not 5 because I do think it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I didn't buy anything here, but I'm giving all 5 stars, because of the inviting atmosphere. I was greeted with enthusiasm that wasn't overbearing. Servers were so friendly even though I only asked for a fork. So friendly!"}
{"text":"Really torn on this location. I've always had good friendly service and the quality of food has always been great! But today I found a hair in my sub, which is really disappointing.   No matter how friendly or how good their food is/has been I don't know if I will be returning. I really enjoy the fact they have a student discount which will bring a medium sub with chips and a drink from $10 to $8 but the hair will forever haunt me!  I will say the manager did handle this in a professional manner but still finding a hair in food is unpleasant."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sandwich which person so for me to really like a sandwich, it must be good. I've had three different sandwiches there and all of them have been amazing. The staff are all super friendly and each time I've been there, they are busy doing things. You can tell the staff take pride in their job."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs has become one of my most favorite sandwich places! They are always thorough with my to go order, the care that the customer is happy & it shows! The food is great! My favorite is the Italian sub! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"This was one place I have been dying to try since they opened. Today was the day. I was really impressed when I walked in to see all the cool decor, large painting , and cool tables. The menu looked just as promising with rows of awesome hot sauce which I knew my husband would appreciate. Especially since I'm always trying to find one that will burn his mouth clean off.  He loves his hot sauce. Anyway back on track. I decided on the Hook and Ladder which has smoked turkey, Virginia ham, Monterey Jack, and includes lettuce, tomato, deli mustard, onion, and a kosher dill pickle on the side. That is not what I got...or at least it looked nothing like it. Meat was missing. By the time I got home with it(only a few minute drive) bread was soggy and all I could taste was the overuse of mayo. So bummed. My husband ordered the Italian and was also disappointed. He said it wasn't the worst, but wouldn't go again. My son had the New York Steamer and wouldn't even finish it. For $30 I thought it would be better. The deli meat was wierd and chopped up like it was shredded and balled up. Service was ok, but literally stood for a good four to five minutes with three employees in front of us before they even really acknowledged us. I get you may be busy, but say hello, smile, ask if we need help, something. I may attempt one more visit to try a salad or different sandwich, but after all three of us were left unhappy after our meal not sure if there will be a third visit."}
{"text":"So happy to see Firehouse Subs here in Surprise.  I absolutely love their sandwiches, they are all good. I've Never had a bad one. Ed is absolutely 100% customer focused i guarantee he will make sure your experience is awesome."}
{"text":"We were going to eat here but decided not to at this time since we had just ate breakfast and knew where we wanted to eat lunch and dinner,so this is my first review where we went in talk to the family owned place which they were  so very nice and friendly the owner,son and daughter, this place was spotless I wonder if it is like that all the time and not because they had just open for the day, this place is founded by Firemen's,there are so many fire Items around in here,from the photo's,fire coat's and hat's,the deco is so cool like you are in a fire house eating.  We will absolutely eat here so I can review the food too.Almost forgot to say that when you sign up for the newsletter you receive a free large drink when you purchase a sub.sandwich also promo's, offer's,and a free med. celebratory sub."}
{"text":"Awesome Subs I get the Club on the Sub each time & love it just the same. Firehouse not only has great warm steamed subs,  but they've got the perfect atmosphere to go right along with it that tells a little bit of their true starting story. Opened by 2 firemen with a love for food & an idea of passion.  They tend to bring a smile to nearly all their customers faces,  not allowing them to leave until the stomachs are full."}
{"text":"Waited 21 minutes (looked at time on receipt and when food was received) and my order was wrong. Bit right into an onion.  They were nice and gave my money back but still... yuck."}
{"text":"This location in particular is one I won't be going back to. There were 4 guys working when I got there, one boy took my order and that same one made all 3 sandwiches I ordered. Ridiculous. Waited almost 15 minutes. There was an employee who was acting as if he were a helicopter over poor Daniel. Chastising him speaking to him like he was a dummy. That is such a \"no,no\". Especially in front of customers."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on his lunch break, and was greeted right away, the Manager walked up and I asked what I was thinking about  getting and I told him that I ALWAYS get the smokehouse sub but wanted to try something different! He suggested a sub and I told him I'll just stick to the same sub so he offered to split his sub w me just so I can try it.... Wow!!! Now that's how u keep a customer coming back!!  Not to mention everyone is super nice always happy and if u enjoy trying different hot sauces they have over 25 different sauces!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service from Mason and Jessica at the location on Sunset and Marks in Henderson, NV.  Ordered food from them via Grubhub, got our order, missing items.  When Grubhub called them they were told, \"we are adamant all items were in the order\". Refused to refund me for the missing items. Granted the the $$ amount of the items missing was minimal, its the principal.  Will never give them another dime of my money."}
{"text":"Had their pastrami again. This time, there was very little meat in it. Didn't like because you could only taste the bread. If this keeps up, I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I was expecting something like a Subway but instead got high quality meats and a very nice experience. Pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, the pricing and the atmosphere.  Plus... They donate back to the community."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The service was terrible. It was 8pm and they had no Soups of either kind. No apology or explination. No one in the restaurant except the 3 employees i saw in the back. Place was a dirty mess. They claim to support and represent Fire Departments? This is not to code. Health and safety violations galore. I use to lile to eat here."}
{"text":"1st timer  tried it on a recommendation for a local. This will become a regular stop on my Vegas trips. The portions were big the choice of hot sauces was incredible and super clean.  See you in Jan for CES, probably several times"}
{"text":"What a great place.  Sub was so tasty, but what really made our day is the selection of hot sauces.  We ended up going back to purchase the Pass Out hot sauce and love it.  Great restaurant."}
{"text":"There is nothing like a warm steak sandwich on a chilly day. I ordered the Firehouse Steak and Cheese on white. It's sirloin steak, melted provolone, onions, bell peppers, mayo, and mustard. It was delicious! It tastes just as good as the ones I typically get at the Great Steak chains you would find at the mall.   Their soda machine also caught my curiosity because it's like one machine that serves  120 + flavors. I was going to get a Mello Yello because that is the closest thing to Mountain Dew but there were so many types. I ended up with a Grape Mello Yello. It doesn't taste as good as the regular yellow one but it was still good. This machine has so many flavors though.... I couldn't get over it! ( I'm easily amused) I had a heavy finger much like a heavy foot so my husband had to choose my drink.   Firehouse Subs not only has great food but if you love hot sauce they sell all different types here!"}
{"text":"I had a short notice class for a group of 30 people and the manager Luis had not one but three party platters ready for me with an hour notice! Great customer service and the food is outstanding! They are now our first pick for catering our functions. Team Rubicon thanks you!"}
{"text":"Some of the other peoples reviews , except Mike D's are just cheesy, working a sub shop employees wouldn't even need to consider customer service, , making subs, and helllo and thank you, there's nothing else, to it. I would not consider them hard  workers, maybe one employee is busting his butt and awesome at everything, but there is just sub making and prepping going on nothing else. They prob don't even multi task. Hard working is such a word misused and extremely vague . Trying to upsell you on some 1$ peppers and who know else, while charging 3$ for a fountain soda and a tiny bag of chips, walking out after paying 12$ for that is a rip.  Now I liked the food , but this is wrong"}
{"text":"It's a good sandwich shop. It's not super fast, expect your order to take some time and enjoy the sports on tv or hanging with some friends. Their commercials say \"best meatball sandwhich\" in the valley. I disagree. It's good. It's not THAT good. It a little pricier than I'd like for some bread with meat, but I like toasted subs and I love the selection of hot sauces. The ambiance is fun and the pictures and coats from firemen are pretty cool. I don't go out of my way to eat there, but if there's one nearby, I'll enjoy myself a good sub when I'm out doing errands."}
{"text":"I like firehouse. Navigation takes you to an empty field.  It's actually on Ocotillo and Arizona Blvd"}
{"text":"This place is usually not that busy around lunch time which is a bonus cause I can get in and out and back to work. The cashier said it might take a little longer to get our food today, but still had it out in about 10 minutes. He was very conscientious of our time and laid out the meal options very clearly. They bring the meal to your table and their coke machine with all the flavors is great...if you're in to that sort of thing.   Seating is wide open and everything seems very clean. The food is fresh and tastes great. You can customize your sandwich, but the options they have should be enough for a majority."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the hot sandwiches and they taste great. Are used to go to Quiznos all the time in Avondale but they closed it and I've been looking for a sandwich shop to replace that urge I get when I want to hot sandwich. While it is a bit pricey, they do offer some cool perks like free refills when you purchased the Firemans cop as well as a drink machine That has pretty much any drinks you can imagine, nonalcoholic of course. Also this is a great place the staff is always friendly and I always enjoy my meal. If you like a hot sandwich this is definitely a great place to go."}
{"text":"Great subs much better than the top competitor.  The food is fresh and I love the pulled pork.  We have tried several of the subs and have not been disappointed.  Live to go there for a yummy lunch."}
{"text":"A little cheaper than Jersey Mikes with a totally different menu.  Staff greets you as you walk in, food is good.  One of the new fancy soda machines that have many different types  and flavors."}
{"text":"My new favorite sub is the Italian, I've also have the New York steamer the tuna and even the veggie that's not on the menu. All the subs are always awesome at this place and I'm not sure why I hadn't discovered it sooner. It's in the parking lot with Panera and the hardware store.  All these locations are super clean and upscale casual for a quick lunch drop. I think it's my new favorite sandwich place for sure!"}
{"text":"Yes please! This is the best! Greatest sandwiches ever! This one gal who is always working when I go is so friendly and nice! I love that they have all sorts of sauces to add to your sub! The new special of the pulled pork on kings Hawaiian bun is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is mostly a review of this particular location rather than the food. I will say the food was really good and the meatball sub is awesome! I really like that and will get it again. As for this location, they need some education about the menu. I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the kids meal. It states, right on the menu, that you get a small drink, small sub, side, and fireman's hat. I ordered that and they handed me a large drink. I thought that was strange and once we got back to the table, I realized they charged me for the kids meal AND the $2.50 combo cost. So I got back in line and tried to explain this to not 1 but 2 different people. They kept telling me that the cost for the kids meal only included the sub and the combo was separate. I said a child doesn't need a large drink and just wanted the smaller size and she even showed me the kids cup. I said that is what I ordered and she told me I still had to pay an additional $2.50 for it. Even the person behind me said I was right and they were wrong but after talking to them (which was like talking to the wall), I gave up. Super frusterating and suck they don't understand a simple kid's meal."}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches, and great service from the sandwich makers! Not too bad! I ordered a 4\" Tuna with a small ice tea. The bill was $7.15! The girl seemed surprised I ordered a 4\" sandwich and a small drink like it wasn't big enough.  She even tried to upgrade my meal to a combo with chips and cookie.  Sorry honey, I  am slim and petite, and don't like to overeat! LOL"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the subs are so good.  They have the Hawaiian pork sandwich back and it is amazing.  I also love the theme - very well done."}
{"text":"Good place good sandwiches and food but it always seems like the staff just doesn't care about the customer and always dragging. It's not going to keep me from eating at firehouse subs but I prefer other locations far more than this one. The girl at the counter just took my money and walked away. Stood there with my punch card for a min, to get my punch and some else finally said something to me as the others just chit chatted behind the sandwich bar.  Sorry if sandwiches and service is too ruff!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was the bomb! I would definitely go back. The meet was juicy flavorful and everything good! I split a large sandwich, the #3 meal deal for $13. A little on the high end but it was totally worth it. I love it that they have a shelf of hot sauces you can select from, hence Firehouse!"}
{"text":"Tried the Sweet and Spicy meatball sub and it was DELICIOUS!!! I like the decorum in the place and they even brought my order to me instead of calling out my name (very nice). The menu looks tremendous, definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"The Italian sub doesn't do it for me.  The brisket is excellent but the Italian sub will leave you steaming like one of their sandwiches.  The brisket comes in two forms and both are excellent."}
{"text":"I love the smokehouse......it's always fresh clean and friendly when we go in there not sure why so many bad reviews. The only thing I saw was that they need to stock up their sweet tea for the day bc everyone must like it! I will always be back!"}
{"text":"the food was  really good!!! we ordered a hot pastrami & steak and cheese sandwiches! they were hot and yummy we will be ordering here again :-)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm very picky about subs. I'm usually not a fan of chain stores. I don't care if they bake their own bread or make their own sides. You have to have good ingredients in a great combination. Firehouse Subs, surprisingly does.      I tried a slice of the Meatball Sub 2 years ago. And I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately so did everyone else.      Now that a Firehouse is close, I took the family. Our first visit. The staff was friendly and made some good food. We had 3 meatball subs and a steak and cheese. My 2 year old grandson like it all and he's pickier than I am.       It's good food and a good price. And if your into hot, they have a huge selection of hot sauces to light up your night.      After browsing the menu we decided to come back and try a bunch more items that looked interesting."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots convenient to my work. They have delicious subs and far superior than Subway or any of those. I don't think I've ever had them get my order wrong, only thing to mention is around the rush times you might have to wait an extra 5-10 minutes but not bad."}
{"text":"First, we had high expectations because we've enjoyed the location in buckeye. This time, however, was not great. We got here at noon on a Saturday - and expected it to be busy. Not so. Unfortunately, every table was dirty and it seemed to take an unnecessary amount of time to get our lunch. Hubby and I both ordered the Turkey Salsa Verde. Neither sandwich had any salsa at all. He actually asked for a side so we could add a little flavor. He was given one thimble sized cup for us to share. My daughter had the kids meatball. Her sandwich was the tastiest of the three, but she did not get the fire hat or dessert that is supposed to come with kid meals.   Employees were disinterested and clearly lacking in the details associated with their product. We will avoid returning here and continue making Jersey Mike's our sandwich place of choice."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best firehouse in Vegas. The staff is very nice and the food was perfect. Not much else to say really. If you want a good sub and awesome sweet tea go here. I highly recommend the meatball sub."}
{"text":"Must try:  the #10 sub with brisket. Try it minus the bbq sauce & add Captain Sorensens sauce instead. YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The New York sub was delicious!!!! And I loved that a pickle came with it.... The staff was very friendly and explained the menu since it was our first time there"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Bad attitudes and thanks for making me feel like I inconvenience you to make me a sandwich"}
{"text":"Third time there and everyone is extremely nice and friendly. I dig the sauces that this chain offers. The sandwiches at this location are great! A total repeat."}
{"text":"There were three girls working today and they were so nice! I asked them to cut our sandwich such that my boyfriends half would be bigger than mine and they said \"o course!\"  I have asked this at so many other sandwich places and normally I end up disappointed. I know it is a simple request, but it makes a big difference to me.   Thanks ladies for making our lunch great! We will definitely be back to THIS firehouse purely because of them."}
{"text":"Wow, what a change a year makes. Two years ago I gave a 1-star review and this update is a long time coming. In the last year I have totally changed my opinion about Firehouse Subs and this location especially. They seem to have worked out all the kinks. Staff is friendly and helpful, food is on-par with other locations, and the most shocking of all is it doesn't take nearly as long to get the food made. We come here about twice a month and it's great every time!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this firehouse at McKellips and Lindsay basically since they've opened food is always been good friendly peope Nice place what more is there to say."}
{"text":"The meatball sub is my sons favorite! Really everything here is great. Picked up dinner tonight and everything was perfect. This is our favorite Firehouse sub location!"}
{"text":"I have no had Firehouse three times in three weeks.  I can easily say that this is my new favorite place to get a sub.  Gone are the days of cold subs and bring in the hot subs. The best one I've had (so far) is the cheddar and brisket sub.  Mouth watering and though it's 8:30AM, I could eat one right now.    The service is great and they are always there to answer any question you have.  Can't wait for the next trip!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I wanted tastes consistent weather in Nebraska or Las Vegas and makes jersey mikes subs taste like McDonald's (not good)."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Firehouse subs from from friends so I had to experience it for myself.  I arrived shortly after 11am and it was already packed!  The line moved quickly and food was served promptly as well. The customer service here is outstanding - they had someone walking around checking that your food was ok which is unheard of in sandwich shops.  The food was really good.  Bread was fresh and the sandwich was perfectly toasted.  I had the club on a sub. This was my first but def not my last visit to firehouse subs!"}
{"text":"Date of Service: 4/27/2014:  Love this location! I went at lunch time on Sunday to get some subs for take-out. They were so busy (and loud but again, it was packed!) but it's worth the wait! I have food allergies and they were so accommodating and actually got my order correct! Both our subs were delicious and we will be back!  We're from the East Coast where these are all over so it's nice to have a little piece of home out here."}
{"text":"Not really impressed for my first time I might try a different location and see if that was the issue.....I got their pulled pork sandwich on the Hawaiian bread I cant remember the name of it and it was really sweet bread with really sweet coleslaw and the pork could've balanced everything out but it was bland with no flavor and mushy great idea just not executed well ....my fiancé said his was ok but he had a different sandwich"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, but I don't think I'll be back. The food and service are both decidedly mediocre.  As for the food, the cold hoagies are usually slathered in mayo and mustard to the point that the roll falls apart in your hand. Be sure to grab extra napkins if you get your sandwich \"Fully Involved\" (with everything on it) as they suggest. The rolls themselves are bland and doughy, a far cry from the traditional chewy, flaky Philadelphia hoagie roll. The hot hoagies I've tried suffer from the same over-slathering issue, with cheese and condiments rendering the bun soggy and limp. The taste? Just okay...about as good as any other hoagie after it sat in the fridge for a day.  As for the service, don't expect anything timely or efficient. I was the only person in the shop recently, and it still took 15 minutes from ordering to get my sandwich, that is, after the employees bickered over who was going to make it. If an employee has no interest in actually doing their job, he or she shouldn't be there. It is no wonder the employee who reluctantly made my sandwich got my order wrong while arguing with his coworkers over who was going to work the late shift. I was ignored while they complained about their hours and duties. Customer service was severely lacking, even with nobody else in there but me.  I won't be back again."}
{"text":"At this particular location. I had been going since they first opened. The last 2 times the employee(s) taking my order were less than capable. I usually order online because of how often I go, and I usually get the same thing. The first incident the employee tried to overcharge me, I knew more about how the charges should be entered than she did, but she wanted to argue with me, until the supervisor corrected her. The second incident the online service was down so I had to call it in. That turned out to be a disaster. Everything was wrong, and again the  employee(not sure if it was same one from the 1st incident), tried to argue with me, telling her supervisor that she repeated the order back to me. \"No, if you did, my order would have been correct.\" I order the same thing. Everytime. I know what I order. If I changed it up, it would be understandable but I don't. So, probably won't be going back to this location until they get some competent employees.Food is good though, service is lacking."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because of all the good reviews but it was a huge WOMP for my family. There really isn't anything about this place that positively stood out to us. When we arrived, I remembered quite a few of their tables being dirty. It looked like a big crowd had just left. There were napkins everywhere, pieces of sandwich fillings on the floor and the chairs were strewn about like a tornado just hit. The service was friendly, but the sandwiches themselves were lackluster and just don't have enough power in them to keep us coming back."}
{"text":"It's everything you expect from a Firehouse Subs location plus great staff so 5 stars.    Firehouse has amazing subs.  I hope one day to try them all, but I am a creature of habit and a while ago I found a sandwich that was so awesome, it has become my go to order.  I try every time to order something different, but as I approach the counter I always hear myself say \"number 3 please\"  It is the New York Steamer, and it is excellent.    I agree with another reviewer who raves about the Coke Freestyle machine.  This is a definite asset in addition to the great food.  When you can choose from so many combinations of water, carbonated water, root beer, and various kinds of pop, how can you go wrong?  The staff is a gem, particularly Will.  Will is always checking on the patrons and making sure the orders are done to perfection.  The rest of the employees are great as well.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Placed a order for pickup , arrived there were no other customers. Two of the staff members were busy chatting up a friend who was leaning over the counter, they hadn't even started to make my order. Young, couldn't care less employees. Where is the manager ??? Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Found a screw in my bread last week...bit down on it and hurt like hell. Cashier froze when I told her. Re made my sandwich but didn't receive an apology.  Firehouse is better than this. .."}
{"text":"First time here and it's delicious. I definitely should have ordered the medium or even large it was just too good!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Wasn't told when I placed my order that the wait time would be over 30 minutes!  After waiting for 25 minutes and thinking they forgot about me, I asked a worker how much longer and they said it  would be at least 10 more minutes before they got to mine.  I told him that my daughter was in the car waiting (since this was a takeout order) and we couldn't wait any longer so I asked for a refund.  The manager on duty said he wasn't sure how to do that and asked if I could come back in 10 minutes when his brother (the owner?) got there.  I told him no, that we had been waiting long enough, so he kept fiddling around until finally the brother arrived.  I now have to wait to see if an actual credit shows up on my credit card bill because I'm not 100% sure that it will.  They did apologize, but offered nothing beyond that for our wasted time."}
{"text":"This place has the best food ever. I need a restaurant by me!! Their subs are always right on the money and fill me up. I came with with family today and they made the subs quick and they were just like the picture. Not sloppy or just thrown together. I need to get this place by me. The subs have alot of meat in it. Compared to Subway. I have been to this location several times. Always clean friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever!! I had a medium meatball sub. My husband had a large Italian sub and he could only eat half of it. The bread is soft and delicious. The meatballs and sauce are really tasty. And there server was very friendly."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches at the Firehouse Subs in Chandler so I had to check out the location in Tempe. We ordered a large size NY steamer. It was a huge size, easily shared between two people. The bread was soft with toasted edges, the meat, cheese and onions were a good portion and well balanced. The shelf to the side has a wide array of hot sauces which are labeled in levels of spiciness from 1-10. I also love the Coca Cola Freestyle here which gives you he choice of making your own custom drink. They even have holiday flavors now!   Service was excellent and the staff came by to check up on us to make sure we had a good experience.   Overall a good place for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great subs, with their very own cherry limeade blend drink at the soda fountain (with fresh lemons to go with it!).  The subs are toasty, with fresh ingredients and quality meat.  Although the cherry limeade is nice in that it's a unique feature of the restaurant, it tastes a bit too kool-aid sweet to me.  I love the selection of various hot sauces (Dave's insanity sauce, Cheech's brand, even an Elvis brand, etc.) that you can choose from to liven up your sandwich."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 sandwiches. There were 9 employees and 4 customers and the wait was still extremely long. Fortunately I checked the order before leaving and they managed to get the orders wrong. I would not recommend this sandwich shop."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place! The staff is friendly. The sandwiches are delicious. The soda machine has endless combinations. It's nice to order your food and have it brought to your table. Definitely bringing everyone here!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time tonight.  Ordered online, which was simple and had multiple options to customize the sandwich.  The service was less than stellar.  I was greeted when I walked in, stood at the ordered online register to finally have someone ask if I was Lisa and just stand in front of me with a bag.  I had to ask for a cup and if I could pick out my chips.  The sub was pretty good, Italian sub, flavorful and tasty.  Despite the service I will visit again."}
{"text":"Needed 35 box lunches delivered and called three locations of one of your competitors, but should have called Firehouse first!  Marissa took my order efficiently, delivery was on time and sandwiches were as ordered.  THANK YOU FIREHOUSE!!!"}
{"text":"I really wish we had Firehouse Subs in LA because I love their subs.   This location has great parking, a very clean restaurant and cute decor.   Also, the abundant array of sauces to add to your sandwich is a plus."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing bad to say. The Italian sub is amazing and the staff is so friendly and polite!!"}
{"text":"For chain ... This is great fast meal for dinner in the go! I had the Hawaiian pork sandwich by itself! It was huge!!! So much to consume. The pork was ok a little fatty for my liking. I'm sensitive and picky when it ones meat because I'm allergic to everything but pork. When I was on strict vegetarian diet I couldn't eat here as there are not many options. But the seasonal pork .. yes!!! The slaw and Kings Hawaiian roll were absolutely delicious and perfected the sandwich. My 6yr old loves the atmosphere and the kids menu is great for them!"}
{"text":"I like this location...  the people are friendly and they get the food out quickly.  Sometimes you just need a delicious Hook & Ladder on warm, crusty bread  :-)"}
{"text":"I discovered Firehouse Subs a few years ago and I've been a fan since. So what has suddenly inspired me to review this particular location? Simple.  (1) I LOVE the touch screen Coca-Cola machine that dispenses 120+ flavors of Coke products. We didn't spend a ton of time perusing the selection, but we noticed they had Fanta Zero (something I didn't know existed). We ended up going with non-diet Fanta Grape. I'm not usually a fan of grape soda, but I'm apparently a Fanta Grape fan!  (2) I LOVE their awesome selection of sauces. Sure they're just bottled sauces, but the selection is staggering. I picked out a berry chipotle, a raspberry jalapeno, and a BBQ sauce that comes from Lynchburg, TN (the town where Jack Daniel's Distillery is located). Firehouse Subs makes delicious hero sandwiches as it is, but it's nice to be able to kick them up with unique sauces you've never heard of."}
{"text":"I am super bummed that this place did not live up to their great commercials. Dang marketing departments.  I am disappointed to also find out that the \"high quality\" meat they use is sold by wal-mart in their deli. Charlie's pride meat. Not on my top 5 deli meat brand. At least if they run out of anything they can run cross the street to the Wal-mart. Hahaha  We spent 34 dollars. It was no better than subway. A little overpriced for a large sub. 8.99.  The bread is good. Atmosphere is nice. I called in my order and the gal took her time and was nice and repeated everything without error. Its why they got three stars. Manager was very nice too.   I ordered the Italian and it tasted like ham more than any thing. Believe me I know my Italian sub's. :)  Don't think I'll go back anytime soon....."}
{"text":"What a delicious surprise eating at this fine little Sub Shop. The food here was absolutely amazing the bread was completely on point, soft perfect in your mouth amazing. And my boyfriend I were incredibly impressed by the quality of the meat, the preparation of the sandwiches and just the overall Taste of everything. This is a great place to stop and have some grub.  My first impression wasn't very positive, but the food saved them. I don't have the best experiences when I visit an establishment that employ's a very young staff. Once I complimented the food they all became much more friendly and appreciative.  I will blame it on experience, or lack of it. Either way it was a pleasant lunch, and I'm willing to give the staff a second chance. Added note, the lack of experience in the staff made for a not very clean shop. I give the food 5 stars. But the rest I'll put at 2.5"}
{"text":"Not sure why we've never been here before but now that we have, we'll be back a lot more often. The veggie sub is seriously good and even though it did take quite some time to prepare I think that's okay because the food was delicious. My kid loves it because they have firefighter hats with pictures of fire engines/fires all over the establishment. Clean, friendly and good food - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I love firehouse, the sandwiches are pretty tasty. They have about 14 signature sandwiches that you can pick from plus a large selection of hot sauces! One of my favorite things is the coca cola freestyle machine which complements my sandwiches even more. Once in a while we do see that some of their ingredients are not the best (yellow tomatoes!!!), but overall, a good quick and cheap lunch spot. If you have kids do not forget to ask for the fire hat!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place and I don't really love subs.. so I think that should count for something. There is just something about their subs, there are pretty flavorishhhh !! the place is usually very clean, reasonable prices and the best part is their soda machine!!!  They  have a million coke choices so you can be super creative if you want to... Oh, and the tip of the day is..... If you have kids or you still have your inner kid, make sure to ask for a fireman hat!! There are pretty awesome"}
{"text":"Great Service, even though my second order was lost.  I still received a great welcome when I arrived.  This place was very busy, but those guy work hard and fast.  The manager got in touch with me after my first review.  I told her that the employees are really great and the food is excellent.  Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  I've never been a big sub person however I could see myself eating here.  It's better than subway, or that awful jimmy johns nearby.  It's about the same league as Which wich.  They have assortment of varying hot sauces nearby to try and taste.    The place has a theme of a firehouse.    This would be a great place to get several sandwiches from for a party or work function."}
{"text":"First time to Firehouse Subs a couple of weeks ago. The sandwich was surprisingly meaty, though for the cost it seemed about right. They had cute plastic firehats for the kids--always a crowd pleaser. It did take a while to get my sandwich--I'll give them a pass though because it was during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! Tasty bread, pickle spears, fresh, juicy meat, melty cheese... Perfect. And the firehouse theme is so cute! I love walking in and seeing the decor, plus the charity work is always great to see. Try the signature cherry limeade as well, so yummy!"}
{"text":"They welcomed me when I first got in there, one of the employee's was cleaning the floors so the restaurant was very clean! I used the restroom and it was also very clean! I ordered Togo food and the sandwiches were amazing! My fav is the turkey bacon ranch. The guy who took my order was nice and informed me what was on the sandwiches.. which was good because I can be picky. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"It's the Moe's of subs ! They all say welcome to Firehouse when you walk-in, I was there probably a total of 5 minutes and heard it approximately 12 times,it was entertaining really. I went with the Italian which was about $6 for the sandwich sans combo. I thought it was MUCH better than Subway and really enjoyed that it was steamed and not-skimpy ingredient-wise. I will say next time I will go light on italian dressing as I did mayo since it was a bit borderline soggy by the time I was ready to eat (my fault). Overall I'd go back again as it had a lot of flavor for a chain sub-shop."}
{"text":"Today I tried the pastrami, it was very good.  I don't think I've had a bad experience at a firehouse yet.  The sandwiches are always good.  I usually get the hook and ladder but wanted something different."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place - Helps public service jobs, good food, nice stores.  I walked in ordered my food, everything is totally normal. I paid for my food and wait....and wait some more. No big deal. I like food that isn't ready in 2 minutes. But when they handed me my sandwich and its this little slider sized meal.  Not impressed.  You know when there's a problem with your sub when the pickle is almost the same size.  At least the flavor was good.  I probably won't be back anytime soon though."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Firehouse.  I had heard a bunch of rave reviews from people I know, but it wasn't really for me.  The location was clean and well staffed and the food was okay, but I won't be back unless someone else insists on eating there.  I got the Italian combo.  The sandwich was fresh but loaded with sauce and seemed to sit like a rock in my stomach.  I guess I just like a good simple sub sandwich.  This place just seems to be overdoing it for me when it comes to what they put in their subs.  Next time it's subs for lunch I'll be at Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! My first visit was perfect.  I ordered the Smokehouse Brisket. It goes perfect with the BBQ sauce,  and the bread is tender and tasty.  Restaurant is clean and spacious.  The staff could not be more friendly and professional. I would highly recommend this place. It's 7 minutes from my office. If it was 30 mins, I would still make the drive.  I will be here weekly."}
{"text":"Let me first share my general prejudice against subs before I give you my review proper. Hopefully, you will read the review taking my slant into account. I am not a fan of subs in general because they are not hard to make at home. On occasion I (or anyone) can make a great sub at home at a fraction of the price of a fast food sub place. When I eat out I like to have/order things I cannot make at home.   Firehouse Subs is another US import and has been here for some 6 months.  The shtick is that they are a ... well a firehouse and project that look and feel. As a bonus they offer a myriad of hot sauces (Twisted sauce by a member of Twisted Sister, Captain Sorensen, etc.) here. It is cool to have so many choices to compare and contrast.It is also cool that a business tries something different and has a special atmosphere. The catch here, however, is that firemen and houses are generally low-end and do not project quality or high-end anything.   Their website mentions a small sub, but on location we were only offered a medium or a large for $2 more. I recommend the large because the medium ended up not being filling, which means the small sub is meaningless really. A medium sub with taxes is $10/person. The $10 is problematic because their subs are small and we had not opted for a combo or all the additional toppings they sell for extra money....   The subs are reminiscent of Quiznos and are served in similar baskets. I had the Engineer which is toasted smoked turkey. It was fine, nothing special, a little too small to be enough and came with a quarter of a pickle on the side. They have the usual steak, club, meatballs, etc. subs and toast a number of them. One can order chips and bla bla bla...  The idiosyncratic atmosphere aside, the staff were funny. When we entered there was no mention or cheer or attention. A person who, I believe, is either the owner or the manager walked in from the back and the next two persons who came in received a cheerful loud welcome. Then the manager disappeared in the back and someone else walked in and... you guessed it. Oddly, the subs take as long as at Mr. Sub or Subway.. but those places have 1 or 2 employees while this place had 6 when we were there for lunch!!! Finally, the aforementioned manager or owner was a contrast to his employees and jovial and friendly and was making the rounds personally thanking customers for their business. I find that cool."}
{"text":"Came in to grebe a sub on the ran, I stand next to the counter for 10 minuet and no one care about taking my order, I left the place a drove to jimmy johns, you guys have to work on your service"}
{"text":"I am a fan of firehouse subs, but this one is not on the top of my list, only like one person was working, place was empty, took forever to get food, no sauce, then he disappear, waited like 5min for him to come back, asked for sauce and he hands me two little packets for 3 people, I asked for more and even offered to pay for it, he reluctantly handed me two more and disappeared again, had to finish sandwich with no sauce.  Every firehouse sub across the country I been to give you a big bottle of it, it makes the sandwich great.  I hate this place is like this, we now live across the road and I don't want to even go back and deal with it."}
{"text":"I visited Firehouse Subs for the very first time today and what can I say? I loved it!! The decor in the inside makes for feel like you stepped right into a Fire station. I was surprised to see that my boyfriend and I were the only two customers in the entire restaurant, since I had hear so many good things about this place, I assumed that it would be packed. Of course I was happy to see that it wasn't given the fact that I was so hungry! I built my own sub but was a little disappointed that they only offered white and wheat bread for subs, but it isn't a huge deal to me. I ordered a medium sub combo with a drink and chips and for my meal alone it was $11, which isn't terribly expensive, I always just assume that you are paying for quality. I'm happy to say that I wasn't wrong! The sandwich was delicious and is the type of \"everyday\" sub that subway should be living up to. The staff was friendly but nothing over the top, about what you would expect. I was happy to see that they also offer catering. I would have rated this a 5 star experience if they offered a few more bread options but I will most definitely visit again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ten stars I would in a second! It's not a typical sub-chain. Firehouse actually takes their time in making a quality sub! There's multiple creative subs to choose from, and they even have some very unique and tasty salads. It helps that there is really good customer service! Great place for casual dining, and who could say no to great subs!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars    When my appetite is burning for a delicious hero, Firehouse extinguishes the fire. Just this weekend alone when I was spending a lot of time in the Sunset Station area, I visited the local Firehouse.     This Firehouse is in the far end of the Mark's Street Walmart Supercenter Shopping Center. The upshot is that parking could be an annoyance. The parking lot is busy. On the other hand, inside Firehouse was busy on Friday night where it was dead on Sunday afternoon. Regardless, they make the sandwich from scratch and it takes a few minutes. If your the kind of person that gets fired up about waiting, the neat firehouse theme might put some water on the flame. Firehouse was started by real firemen. And that fact shows in the attention to detail from the wall to the trash can. There is even a donation jar for firemen. Besides, if you order a combo you can snack on the chips, brownie, or cookie. Firehouse features the Coke Freestyle machine.    At Firehouse you can get the combo medium or large. Regardless of size, the price is slightly large. For close to $10, they really should serve the large size. With that said, a half star deduction for a price that would be too high with a large upgrade. Similar to the price, the taste and amount is large. I ordered the meat ball sub on Friday and the Engineers Club on Sunday. The meatball sub smoked away the sub I recently chowed down in New York -New York and is a few steps up the ladder above Subway's meatball marinara. The texture, temperature, and quality was just right. Over and above the meatball sub, I appreciated the Engineer's Club. This is a delicious sub with the same wheat or white bread option that Firehouse offers. The Engineer's Club is loaded with turkey, swiss cheese, mushrooms with tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, and other ingredients.     When it comes to the sub industry, the fires always been burning. People love subs and the landscape is full of sub shops. Firehouse is one of the better sub chains. When I am chowing down an Engineer's Club, I can honestly say \"My taste buds are on fire.\""}
{"text":"By the time, I finished hiking on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail, my appetite was on fire. At the conclusion of the hike, I made a beeline to the Firehouse to put out this fire.      It is no surprise that out of all the restaurants in the City of Las Vegas that I would chose Firehouse Subs as my post-hike dinner. I have grown fond of Firehouse Subs since I first stepped foot in a Firehouse Subs at the Durango and Warm Springs location a couple of years back. I made the Charleston at Hualapai Smith's and Petsmart-anchored shopping center my trailhead. Walking along the shopping center, I set eyes on Firehouse. Hanging on the window was this advertisement for their Smokehouse Beef &  Cheddar Brisket. This would be the light at the end of the tunnel that was my Peccole Ranch Walking Trail hike. All the cards were in the right deck because when I headed back on the trail, I breathed in the olfactory delight of barbecues from the  adjacent homes.  By the time I returned to the picture of the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar photo, I had burned a few calories and gained an appetite.      Instantaneously upon entering the spacious eatery, the staff greeted me with \"Welcome to our firehouse.\" I greeted them with a smile and $9.31. This paid for the Smokehouse Beef and cheddar brisket sub meal that included a cup to fill up from the Coke Freestyle machine, chips, and a pickle. I ordered baked Lay's barbecue chips. They asked for my name and when I later replied they brought the post-hike grub to my table.      This is an entertaining Firehouse Subs to eat in because they do a spectacular job on the theme. An example is that the doors to the restrooms read firemen and firewomen. The centerpiece is the mural on the wall opposite the counter. This is a cute and droll made up scene that takes place in Red Rock Canyon National Recreation Area. Before I go on, I must address that it is a neat touch when a fast food restaurant personalizes the dining area. Going back to the Red Rock Canyon made up scene there is a firetruck parked where Route 159 would be. A fireman appears to be chasing the firehouse dog who is in pursuit of a Bighorn sheep that is running toward the Calico Hills with a bag of Firehouse Subs. In the same mural, a turtle is taking sips of the fireman's cola. Talk about a fast food restaurant having an imagination. I posted the mural picture below the review. I could also talk about the football game that was playing on the TV above. However, I will talk about the Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket sub.      There is little doubt in my mind that this was as delicious as the olfactory scent of barbecue I was breathing in on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail. In exact style to the Firehouse Subs I had in the past, it was exceptional. Between the white bread were USDA beef brisket that Firehouse alleges has been smoked for over 16 hours, melted cheddar, mayonnaise, and Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue sauce. There was just the right amount of barbecue sauce decorating the sandwich. This post-hike sandwich was four stars until it was gone.       Just like hiking, I am a fan of Firehouse Subs. You can say that their exceptional subs set my tastesbuds fire."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I celebrated National Cold Cuts Day with a delicious Firehouse hero. When my appetite is on fire for a first-rate sub, the Firehouse has successfully extinguished it. On National Cold Cuts Day as soon as I left my job in the vicinity of Eastern at Serene, I made a beeline here. It was my recent experiences at other Firehouses led me to this location to celebrate a day honoring cold cuts.       On account of the fact that this was National Cold Cuts Day, I exchanged nearly $11 for a sub meal featuring cold cuts. This made ordering a breeze. A few minutes later a friendly employee delivered the Firehouse hero (in some parts of the country they call subs heros) to the table. This was a thick sandwich stuffed with USDA choice roast beef, Virginia honey ham, smoked turkey breast and provolone cheese. This was a quality sandwich unlike some places where the bread is falling apart and the ingredients are to one side. This sandwich was smoking good. And where there's smoke there's fire. When you add mayonnaise, mustard, tomatoes, lettuce, and onions; this delectable sandwich had my taste buds on fire. On the side was a kosher dill pickle and small bag of chips. At Firehouse, Coke instead of water extinguishes thirst. The restaurant features a Freestyle Coke machine offering approximately 100 flavors. This worked out well for me because my favorite soft drink in the world is strawberry soda. In addition to the Freestyle machine there is a cooler selling other drinks.      This Firehouse theme permeating throughout the restaurant creates an upbeat and even interesting dining environment. The centerpiece of every Firehouse is a hand-painted and custom-designed mural. The interesting mural adorning this location is one of 850 that Joe Puscas has created. When I took breaks from chowing down the Firehouse hero, I'd look at the droll scene above of firemen putting out a blaze at the legendary Sands where one of them is singing into the firehose. Everywhere I saw neat things including a picture of a check dated February 16, 2016 showing that Firehouse Subs gave $191,888 to the Nevada First Responders and Public Safety. It is safe to state that dining in Firehouse is the antithesis of a  depressing experience.      The employees were friendly. Instantaneously they greeted me when I walked inside the Firehouse. They delivered the food to my table, and asked me how everything was. I was satisfied with the service.      On National Cold Cuts Day, I walked inside Firehouse with my appetite on fire. After a rough day working, it was burning. Firehouse extinguished the fire. This has been the fourth Firehouse that I have reviewed highly on Yelp. It seems that the only fire remaining is a burning love for their subs."}
{"text":"Firehouse extinguishes poor quality overpriced subs. There is a fire spreading into certain Subways and across certain Port of Subs. It is a fire made up of the elements of too little for too much $. Not all Subways, but certain Subways put too little meat on their heros. And all the Port of Subs I have been to are overpriced. This gets me on fire. But Firehouse Subs has served me quality and delicious subs at decent prices.    When I stepped inside the North Decatur at 215 Firehouse Subs it was my second visit to one of their locations. Months earlier after experiencing the Durango at Warm Springs Firehouse Subs, I was up to visiting this location with my brother. It is a location in the Winco/ Target parking lot. In a way, this is a glorified eatery for Winco and Target. When I walked into Firehouse Subs, I walked into you guess it, a restaurant that resembles a firehouse. This is not a theme restaurant made up at random. In 1994, two former firefighter brothers Robin and Chris Sorensen founded it in Jacksonville, Florida. The restaurant is fairly large with plate glass windows to the left overlooking Decatur Boulevard and a counter to the right for ordering the subs. The employees at the counter were friendly and professional.    The majority of their heros include meats and cheeses and are steamed hot and placed on a toasted bun. The medium subs range from $5.79 to $6.09. An additional $2.29 upgrades it to a medium combo whereas an additional $2.54 upgrades it to a large combo. For the record, I noticed a slight difference between the medium and large combos. Both size combos include a fountain Coke beverage and bag of chips. Firehouse utilizes the new state-of-the-art Coke machines that feature over 100 flavors of Coke. Peach Fanta and Raspberry Coke taste good with a sub. According to Wikipedia,  Firehouse Subs is the first national franchise to utilize the state-of-the-art Coke machines in all franchises. As far as the subs, Firehouses' s selection is smoking. They include the Hook & Ladder, Firehouse Meatball, New York Steamer,  Italian, Firehouse Hero, and Engineer. I ordered the Firehouse Hero. It burns away some of the competitor's heros. The hero was warm and filled with substance. The substance between the buns was USDA Choice roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and provolone.     When certain sub shops that charge high prices for so little gets me on fire, Firehouse extinguishes this bad taste. The deal is there currently only twelve locations in the Las Vegas market. And the deal is I plan to return to one of these locations in the future."}
{"text":"Great Service, and really delicious Food at this location, always clean and very good prompt service!"}
{"text":"This is the third time that this location has messed up either one or more of the sandwiches in my order. Last time my parents and I met at this location for one we waited almost 20-25 minutes for our sandwiches. When they arrived, my mom's sandwich wasn't even the sandwich she ordered so she had to wait another 15 minutes for the right sandwich and needless to say she was not happy. Additionally, all of us had pretty dry and hard bread and none of us got the extras that we had asked for at the register.  Today, we ordered four sandwiches to go. It appeared to be very busy as there were most tables taken inside and a line of four people waiting to order. However, like the last time we were there, it didn't appear like there was any actual manager working and I'm not sure if that's just because weekends are slower but there was no one looking like they were in charge. We only waited for about 15 minutes this time which was an improvement from last time! I ordered a #6 with oil and vinegar, salt and pepper, banana peppers, chopped pickles, and jalapeños. And we also got an Italian sub with no extras, and two turkey bacon ranch sandwiches with a couple extras too.  None of the sandwiches with extras HAD the extras on them! Why offer extras if you're not even going to add them onto the sandwich? The reason why I'm giving them the extra star is because the sandwich still tasted good without the extras because they serve quality meat and the bread was much fresher today. But if you're going to offer extras like jimmy johns and subway and jersey mikes, you should actually put them on the sandwiches! I don't know if it's just this location or what but I think I'm going to steer clear of this one. Plus, the customer service here was pretty terrible: no \"welcome to firehouse\" which I know is their signature greeting, no smiles, and just didn't seem like any of the workers were happy to be working today. Might go back and see if they can surprise me and cause me to update this review."}
{"text":"It's a good sub from a chain. Better than Subway, but what sub place isn't? However, not as good as Capriotti's or Earl of Sandwich.  The highlight of any visit to Firehouse Subs is the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine. I love this thing. I don't really need 120+ drink choices, but it's fun to try a few new flavors on each visit."}
{"text":"Not only is the staff super friendly but these subs are amazing. Super fresh tasting and you can tell you have higher quality ingredients. Love the entire atmosphere. Yes it's a little pricier, but you get what you pay for and the back story for the company leaves you feeling good too. Subway doesn't hold a candle to these. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Trying to translate sandwich names into contents is kind of a chore but no worse than any other themed eatery. Seems to be an awful lot going on to get my sandwich made but on the plus side ordering it really only gets as complicated as you want to make it: a) Ask what's good b) Have that! -OR- 1) Start at the top of the menu boards. 2) Try the first thing that sounds good. 2b) poll the table 3) Come back and try the next one. 4) Repeat as often as necessary. Got the Hook and Ladder on recommendation and liked it well enough, hard to go wrong with turkey, ham, and cheese w/ mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a dill pickle + sun chips and Mellow Peacho from the SodaMatic. Gonna have to find out about hot saucing to-go next time in because there is going to be a next time and I like a dash of hot sauce on hot sandwiches :-)"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I went to this Firehouse Subs at approximately 8:30 p.m. (place is open until 9:00 p.m.) and there was already one teenager mopping the floors, leaving the floor wet and possibly slippery for new customers walking in. We placed our orders and took seats at a table. Our orders were prepared quickly and served to us. My wife started eating her brisket sub and noticed that it was mainly fatty pieces of meat. She could not eat this sub but didn't want to make it an issue. Then we noticed that there were only teenagers visible working at this restaurant and they were arguing with each other about cleaning duties. There was one person tossing buckets around as if there were no other customers in the restaurant. Customers continued to walk in and the cleaning continued and was more of a nuisance. Then someone else started using what sounded like a vacuum cleaner. My complaint is that if a restaurant is scheduled to be open until a certain hour, they should be business as usual until that hour. Once you officially close the doors for the night, then that is when you do the cleaning of the main dinning area. This is what happens when you leave unsupervised teenagers without any adult supervision. It is sad but I would highly recommend avoiding this location an hour before closing because of the extremely rude actions of the staff."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a couple days ago. It was OK, but maybe a little soggy. Two sandwich meal deals was almost $18. Feels a little pricey to me. Overall not bad, but I probably won't be a regular."}
{"text":"I have always had good service at the Firehouse Subs, and really enjoy being able to order through their app and run in to get it."}
{"text":"So.....a sub shop born in Jacksonville, FL comes to Southeastern PA - basically the home of the hoagie. I'm skeptical, but my curiosity to try a new place so close to home quells the apprehension.   The Good: My bf ordered the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket - this was very good albeit a wee bit salty for my taste. I had two bites to be certain.   The Bad: I ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch on wheat. I'm really sorry, but they didn't really do any better than Subway. The bread was soggy, despite the fact they were economical with the Ranch dressing. The bread nor meat were of the best quality. The whole sandwich was the same texture.   The Ugly: This place is competing with Primo's, Jimmy John's and every pizza shop from City to Shore. Unfortunately, I don't think they can compete in this dog fight.   The bf reported that the decor was a lot like Jimmy John's discerned by the Firehouse theme (Dalmatian statue and gear on the walls) and a bar with an extensive array of hot sauce.   For 2 large subs, a bag of chips and one drink, the bill came in slightly under $20.   I really wanted this place to be great, so with much regret I post this 2 star review."}
{"text":"Great chain sub sandwich spot for lunch!  This place is fast, the service is usually great and sandwiches are pretty decent.  My top sandwiches here are:  The Italian - super flavorful, hits the spot with the melted cheese!  The Steamer - a good dose of pastrami and cheese, but a little more pastrami would be even better.  The Turkey Bacon Ranch - a good spin on a classic club sandwich.  The Engineer - not bad for a sandwich, but the mushrooms sometimes come bland so I have to add some hot sauce to it.  One of the best things here is their hot sauce collection, if you love hot sauce you can mix and match hot sauces to add to your sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This is the best spot for subs. I got the steak firehouse sub and it was amazing. I'm sure the other subs are just as amazing. Great service these workers really take pride into their shop.  Had to leave a comment because these guys are awesome!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Foods ok. I ordered and by the time I got home half of it was soggy from the tomatoes. Kind over price for a blan sandwich."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a sub. I'm not a meatball fan but the spicy meatball sub it's crazy good. If you aren't into meatballs then try the chicken bacon ranch. Love the staff as well. I will never walk into subway again."}
{"text":"While staying i Las Vegas for business we were searching for an option to cater a small party of people.  My fiancé found them on yelp and called.  They were incredibly  accommodating, from beginning to end.  Communication was great, and so was the food.  Amanda went out of her way to ensure that we received our food on time and that we were able to bring it into the  hotel as well.  Most hotels frown upon this because they want you to use room service - but we were able to circumvent that and Amanda helped as well.  All was perfect, food was fresh and tasty and we appreciate it all!  Thank you FIREHOUSE SUBS for all your hard work and efforts!  GREAT VALUE as well."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Firehouse Subs. The employees were amazing and very welcoming. They made sure to welcome every customer and thank them for coming as they left. The wait for the sandwich was a bit long so just expect to be there for a few minutes. However, when I got home I realized that almost all the ingredients of my sandwich were missing. I was pretty bummed but didn't have time to go back and ask for it to be fixed, otherwise I would of. I would probably return but definitely check my food before leaving."}
{"text":"There really need to be more Firehouse Subs.  They are so much better than the other chains.  We especially love their brisket subs.    This stop was no exception.  The employees were friendly and even served our table.    The brisket sub was amazing.  We love this place.  Everything is so fresh and good."}
{"text":"We love Firehouse Subs and this place was no exception.  Our order is usually their brisket sandwich.  There just isn't a sub place that does a better job on these than Firehouse.  The service was great, food delicious and price okay."}
{"text":"We love Firehouse Subs.  This location was no different.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  The bread was fresh and the brisket sub delicious.  Service was fast.  We sat outside at one of the tables.  Everything was cleaned and picked up immediately by staff.  Firehouse Subs is our favorite \"Sub\" place to eat."}
{"text":"So when did they stop adding tomato, lettuce, onion on the subs???  It wasn't that busy and for how long I waited I figured they were making a master piece. I got my order to go and when I got home all I can say is I am very disappointed on spending almost $8.00 on such a pathetic sandwich."}
{"text":"This is my first try at this location and it was great! Rae was the one who helped us and she made the experience wonderful. She came to check on us and was very polite and had a fun attitude. I will definitely be back to this location again because of her"}
{"text":"I never much cared for Firehouse in the past. But, they are quickly becoming a top contender on my list of sub creators.  This location recently reopened after a short remodeling stint which has, as a result, increased in square footage allowing for more tables and chairs.  The ladies are very pleasant towards customers, which is much appreciated and hard to find in todays society.   The service is quite fast even during the super busy lunch phase. That's a plus when most of us need to travel to/fro and eat all within an hours time.  Along with that fast service comes fresh delicious sandwiches. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. You'll enjoy it.   Although not a fan, this is location is equipped with the futuristic Coke Freestyle beverage contraption."}
{"text":"Back in the dark ages, there was only Subway when you wanted a sub. Now there are so many more options. And one of the better ones is Firehouse. Heck, they even give you the Freestyle, so you have hundreds of options for your drinks alone!  When it comes to the sandwich, however, the sub is a bit more than that - it's more like a meal. You have to figure out what you want on that baby, and that can be a bit of a chore. It's less of a sandwich and more of ordering from a menu. Not that you aren't ordering from a menu at a Jersey Mike's or a Subway, but hopefully you get the picture.  Perhaps the best part about Firehouse, other than that Freestyle machine, is their selection of condiments. They have all sorts. But that Datil pepper (whatever that is) adds some nice flavor to your sub, so it's definitely worth trying. The difficult part is finding a bottle that doesn't look like it hasn't been cleaned in a few months..."}
{"text":"With all the times I have been to Concord Mills, I realize that I rarely get to the food court. In fact, I rarely go to the mall. Most often it is just to the theater. In and out. I don't really like to deal with those crowds, either in the parking lot or in the halls.  For whatever reason on this day, I made it not only in the halls, but all the way down to the food court and was hungry, so stopped at the Firehouse for a sub. While they have become fairly plentiful in the area, I haven't eaten enough to know what I like, so I perused the menu (all the while backing up the line for the impatient folks in back of me who were in a rush - maybe I should have stopped for free samples at the Chinese place first).   Eventually settling on one of their tasty warm subs and some of that nice Datil Pepper sauce, it wasn't a bad visit at all, other than the crowd to get there and the grumbles behind me. Now if only I could get a 5 gallon bucket of that sauce to go."}
{"text":"I am on the fence about Firehouse.  The store is nice enough and all, but we are talking about subs here, right?  You look at the board, choose your sub, order toppings and... then you wait.  There is no doubt that the problem has to do with comparisons to Subway, because the two stores look a lot alike.  You order from a board, you check out the toppings behind glass and everything.  What I really do not get is why it takes Firehouse so long to get the subs to you.  Even if you want a toasted sub at Subway, it takes a few seconds, not several minutes where you have to sit down and then wait.  The sub itself is good enough, but it just puts a damper on eating it when you order it, they make it and then you have to go away and wait for your name to be called."}
{"text":"I like Firehouse Subs. Yes, I know it's a chain. But so what. It's sparkling clean and polished and the service is attentive and fast. My usual order is a New York Steamer with corned beef brisket, pastrami, melted provolone, mustard, mayo, and Italian dressing. But they have one thing that really stands out. On the counter are approximately 40 different kinds of hot sauce from Dave's Insanity to sauces you may have never heard of. And you are free to try any or all, if you're brave enough. I took a picture of the sauce rack...I'd hate to know the Scoville count of all those bottles.   This place can be counted on for a good quality sub pretty much every time you walk in the door. Parking can be interesting sometimes and getting back to Eastern to go North can be tricky. But it's worth the time to check out."}
{"text":"They are quick to get your order. Chili is awesome and hearty. A little pricey for what it is though. I love the collection of hot sauces. Hook and ladder is my favorite. Customer service is always awesome. There is someone always at the register and someone cleaning the dining area."}
{"text":"I am sorely disappointed with this location since we were so excited to have one so close to home.  I ordered a salad and it was horrendous!  At least a fourth of the lettuce was brown, another fourth was wilted and had obviously been frozen previously. It was not edible!  Whoever made the salad obviously didn't care and quite frankly I don't know how the person that served it did so without as much as a question.  Never again!  I know it's a sandwich shop, but come on!"}
{"text":"Yum! Best service, fast and Yummy! It's hard not to stop when I go to the park. I can't even pick which sub, I love the most. Now that they have sub of the day, how can I resist?"}
{"text":"Good, but seems a little overpriced, especially for the brisket sandwich for what you get. Still, if you're looking for something different than Subway, Jimmy John's, Milio's, or one of the other umpteen sandwich shops in town, this is a good choice amongst its mostly cold subs competition."}
{"text":"damn good sub, but 30 minutes to wait AFTER ordering is too long!  yeah it was a busy day, but still...."}
{"text":"First time ever went great so far, until I asked if there was to go sauce. I got the what are we jimmy johns. There's sauce and lids there. Ok never been there do I get a bag, do I ask for one from the angry kid? Never been there in my life. Doubt I'll go back unless this sandwich is good. It's sad that horrible service only a fraction of your store. Maybe a bad day? Not my fault i smiled and paid."}
{"text":"They are friendly. The food is good. I miss being greeted at the door. They no longer bring your meal to the table. Same with to go orders. They call your name to pickup at the counter.  I miss the personal touch. It was a Firehouse exclusive and now gone. Four solid stars."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say, i ordered my food about 40mins ago and still no food. There are 3 guys making subs and they have giving out roughly 3 orders maybe/10 subs and that is pushing it.  I love the food but the sloth style of making food is horrible. It's not that busy only 7 total people in here with me. Sorry firehouse- won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Surprise, friendly atmosphere and great food at a reasonable price. We eat there quite frequently and never had a problem but I am betting if we did, the owner or one of the managers would take care of it right away."}
{"text":"Interesting fire house themed sub shop.  Pleasant greeting upon entering establishment.  The beef brisket was satisfactory."}
{"text":"I love firehouse, but this location is horrible.  1st time I went in 3 weeks ago and the guy says we're 25 min behind, yet 3 customers in the place? I've never had to wait 25 min for a sub.  Today I thought I'd give them a try again.  I tell the guy I want a build your own turkey.  I start telling him what I want on it and he says, no... tell me what you don't want on it cuz that's easier for him.  I'm done, walk out.  This place is the worst."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a one star because of the service. It is so slow here. It takes 20-30 minutes to get a sandwich here. There are 6 people working here and 3 of us have been waiting for our food for now 25 minutes. They are all chatting and hanging out and only one person is making sandwiches. If the service was faster I would give this place a four star. This is my 2nd time here that I have waited 30 minutes. I will no longer be going here."}
{"text":"Very good sub, good service Plenty of meat, pleasant suprise, first visit.  Much better than most competitors"}
{"text":"So I ordered a sandwich off UberEATS last night and specified that I wanted oil and vinegar on the side. You might ask why, well from order to delivery was 45 minutes and I didn't want the bread to be mushy. So what did Firehouse do?! They put it on the sandwich and by the time it got to me the bread was completely soggy. I had no problem with paying $18 to have one sandwich delivered to me but the least you could do was get it right. So I spoke with Clay the M.O.D and he tried to put it on the driver but I told him the driver doesn't make sandwiches, YOU do and he had the nerve to ask verbatim \"what do you want me to do\"?! I don't know Clay I just paid $18 for a sandwich that I didn't eat. I rarely come on here and always reach out to management before I do to give the chance to make it right, and this time they didn't. I guess I'll have to speak with Jose their GM about customer service."}
{"text":"I kept hearing this place was great no nearby my home  So I brought sandwiches home for my family and nanny.  Spent about $40 but got drinks and add ons  The sandwiches when I got home were filled with meat and cold cuts and cheese not shabby and cheap like Subway.  Everyone in my office had said that this was a good sandwich shop  I then ordered 2 trays from here for a business meeting 3 had and another for Open houses. This all in a 6 month time frame   Definitely a locals favourite  Not sure if they are nationwide.  I don't eat beef, bread, or mayonnaise so I'm a picky one...   I like Blimpies but they are extinct in Vegas. Next  Best is Port of Subs   This is a nice place  You will always see police and firemen inside grabbing lunch"}
{"text":"I really like the sandwiches here, only problem is that it's far and I gotta drive 19 miles just to get to this place.  They have a lot of hot sauce you can choose from which is really great because I love my ghost chilli powder.   People are friendly and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"I ordered their club sub which was really good, but I'm mainly on here because I had great customer service here. They all greeted me the second I came in with smiles. I ate in. One of their employees checked in to see if all was good at some point. When I was done, I still had the other half of my sub left over and again he came up to me and asked if I would like a to-go box. Little things like that show they pay attention and care! Great customer service. Great food."}
{"text":"Just average in every sense of the word..  Don't get me wrong I've had Firehouse plenty in other locations, but this location is not on par.     Seems like the quality is suffering due to its location and the staff unable to handle the crowds of being in such a busy area.  Every time I've ordered my sandwich is drenched in mayo and lettuce. No resemblance of a decent ratio.  Just thrown together to keep the line moving.    Try not to eat at this location unless your out options or for pure convenience."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop! My favorite sandwich is the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket. I like their different selection of hot sauces and bowl of chili is excellent!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yummy! Love the turkey cranberry sub!!! My whole family eats here on a pretty regular basis. Sometimes we all go together. We all love it! My dad buys a bucket each time (I think he's obsessed with buckets) LOL! Whatever keeps the old folks happy, right? I definitely recommend Firehouse Subs. Way way way better than the other sub shops."}
{"text":"This location is one of the cleanest I've been to in the valley, it's also the largest, so props to them for that. I usually show up during dinner and there aren't many people here - but there is a constant stream of people picking up their call in orders or DoorDash or whatever they use.   For some reason this location is ALWAYS out of SOMETHING and that something is 90% of the time on my order, I'm not sure how it is mathematically possible this happens between two sandwiches but it does. The people who write the prep check lists and do the ordering need some more training to get it nailed down.  Why, every time, is one of the tvs blaring loud? Is the person in the back doing dishes trying to catch up on his sports or something?  I WANT TO LIKE THIS LOCATION but sometimes the employees make it hard to do. If you hate your job please find something you like to do. If you are just trying to make it to the end of your shift, please don't work the register - I can taste your sadness in my sandwich."}
{"text":"We came in late afternoon, missing both the lunch and dinner crowds. First time eating at a Firehouse Subs, I took a little extra time looking over the menu and options. Fortunately, the employees were patient and courteous the whole time, which was great.  We ended up splitting a foot long Engineer sub with turkey, swiss, and mushrooms, chips and drink. Yeesh, the combo ended up to be over $12 which is pricey for a sub sandwich for 1 person, but it was definitely plenty of food for 2. Some additional toppings are free, and they had a host of hot sauces with a few barbecue sauces to customize it even further.  I couldn't eat here everyday for lunch but I prefer subs over the more traditional sandwich and soup spots."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a grilled chicken sub, the girl asks \"white or wheat?\" Hubby says, \"white.\" His food comes and it's an actual SALAD - not a sub. So the kid that delivered it, takes it back, hubby looks at receipt, and the girl had pressed SALAD, even though she asked him, \"white or wheat.\" Unbelievable. Then I asked for roast beef with only mustard, it comes with spicy mustard. Horrible. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"So gross and all soggy by the time we got our food don't order online at all  I got the hot veggie one and ordered another sub and it's was a horrible"}
{"text":"Hearty fulfilling sandwiches.  Must try the Chili and the different hot sauce flavors.  Steve  has great customer service.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ordered online but when we got there on a busy Fri @6pm there was no one at the pickup register and quite a line at the order register. After standing at the pick up register I had to skip the line which is awkward...one kid working register was not enough. Anyway subs were ready by then. The steak n cheese was ok but didn't seem toasty...was soggy by time we got home. Didn't like the italian at all...ham too smokey for me, had no pepperoni and we got no pickle. Our fav is still Cousin's subs!"}
{"text":"First time I've stopped in. I had the Turkey Bacon and Ranch Sub and it tasted nice. It was a little slow but worth the wait. A friend had the salad and said it was delicious.  Looking at the menu I didnt see a sub with chicken? All Turkey but you can make your own. The firehouse theme is nice, Ive been a volunteer firefighter since I was a teen in Australia. I'll come back again."}
{"text":"The subs are great but the place is always filthy. Floor in desperate need of sweeping and mopping, bathrooms garbage overflowing. When I see the front this dirty, I wonder what the cleanliness is like in the food prep area? The staff has always been polite and service good, just wish they would keep the place cleaner."}
{"text":"This place is on fiiiirrrreee!!! We absolutely love the sandwiches!!! I order them on my way home from work over the phone and the staff always have them waiting for me with the best smiles! Not only do I not have to cook, but I get to dig in to the best sandwiches ever! The only reason I didn't give Firehouse 5 stars is because their chili isn't very tasty..."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food yet but tried to use a free desert coupon with check in just after I paid, while still waiting for my meal to arrive. They said no. Don't offer yelp check in specials if you won't honor them while the customer is in the store and even before getting the food :/ Not about the desert, it's about the yelp community. lol isn't the point of the free with check in special to help you get a positive review or feedback? Fail."}
{"text":"I've never been to Firehouse Subs before and after my visit today, I'm now a fan. I ordered a small smoked turkey on white and chicken noodle soup. With the combo I also was able to get a drink and not just any drink, a huge drink for the same size as a small. They have one of those drink machines where you can choose from a ton of combinations. I got a diet Barq's root beer.   The staff was very friendly, quick and efficient. I got my order to go and was pleased to find that it was correct when I got home.   My only negative is the size of the sub. I had no idea that a small is actually a mini. Had I known, I would've ordered a larger size. The sub was fantastic. I asked for new onions and really enjoyed my sandwich. The bread was fresh, the turkey was light and not too smokey, the lettuce was shredded and easy to eat, and I love mayo on my sandwich.   The chicken noodle soup was good too. Will definitely be back and try some of their other sandwiches. Overall I was very pleased and impressed."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend this week. Twas alright. It actually looked really cool inside, and you could tell it originated in the Midwest. There was a firehouse theme, naturally. The tables were polka dotted like dogs. Maybe there were too many chairs and tables though. I had the chopped salad and it was good. I really want to try the cranberry turkey sandwich next time. A lot of their subs are toasted. They post a lot of nutritional info which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Eh. I've been here a couple times, but I can honestly say I've had a lot better elsewhere. The bread here is extremely soft/doughy, and doesn't have much of a decent flavor. The staff here seem a bit disorganized, and the food itself doesn't taste particularly great.   It's honestly not really worth the price that you have to pay to get food here. There are several places for sandwiches that taste better in the area. If given a choice between this and Carl's Jr in the same parking lot, I'd pick Carl's anyday."}
{"text":"Such friendly employees!! Really great customer service (and it was super busy!!) the food was delish as always!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! We hadn't planned on going here for lunch but after the first two places we went to turned out to be closed, we went here after starvation kicked in. Our subs were delicious and made correctly and the staff was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I e only been here twice in my whole 30 years on this planet... the first time I hated it, the second time(today) I loved it! Keep up the good toasted subs!"}
{"text":"The service was good, the restaurant was clean and nice inside. The food was less then not very good. The meat (the little that was there) was dry and had no taste. They have to put all those sauces on their subs to give them flavor. Today was our first time and last time we eat there. At least we tried."}
{"text":"Very welcoming atmosphere! It was our first time in and my 4yo was super excited to see all of the Firehouse decor (like crazy excited, lol). The staff just went with it. There wasn't anyone in line behind us so the gal taking orders spent a few minutes talking about the 'station' making my son laugh about the Dalmatian table tops and so on. She even gave him a plastic fireman hat (which he now wears everyday).  I ordered 2 subs to-go. My hubs had the meatball sub and was satisfied. I ordered the cheesesteak but unfortunately, my order was not correct. It was made on wheat instead of the white bread I ordered and did not have mushrooms that I specifically requested. That being said, it was still pretty good. I didn't bother with a complaint because I ate every last bite.  I enjoy spending my money at businesses that give back to our community. Not only do they support fire stations, my son's school recently did a fundraiser at this location.   We love sandwiches at my home and Firehouse is tasty and close. I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time when I was just a kid in Florida I put heaven in my mouth. Excuse me, let me translate. Heaven is an Italian Sub from this place. Holy mother of Sandwiches. This is the greatest sandwich of all time. This sandwich wipes it's butt with other sandwiches... Then cuts it's own butt off so you don't have to taste the impurity of lesser sandwiches in your glorious meal.   On the side? Psh, I just toss in a bag of salt n vinegar chips for a little extra awesome. Your choice but the chips add a little extra flavor to sitting down while you wait on your sandwich being made. Which is awesome because it keeps me from drooling while I wait on my sandwich from the gods.   Drink? Well they have a drink machine that makes 4.5 billion different combinations. I maybe fudged the numbers a little because I don't actually know but that machine can make just about whatever kind of drink you could want with a sandwich.   Service? This is a pretty easy one to nail. Be nice, make a sandwich. Place sandwich in front of customer. And they nail it every freakin time. If you are expecting more you should probably hire someone to follow you everywhere and play music while they compliment you because you shouldn't really be criticizing the sandwich shop for not high fiving you.... Wait, that would be friggin awesome. I've never gotten a high five with my sandwich made from pure concentrated awesome. Deducting 0.0000001 stars.   Cleanliness. This particular firehouse is clean as can be anytime I've been there.  Surprisingly in almost every firehouse I've been to the standards remain freakishly the same unlike some other popular chains. It's always clean, service is always good and the sandwiches taste just as awesome.  I'm sorry that I only have 2 thumbs to point in an upward direction. If I could bath in a toxic spill so that I could grow more thumbs, let's say... Infinity Thumbs. I would give Firehouse Subs infinity thumbs up. Specifically the Italian sub."}
{"text":"I'm most certainly a fan of this particular Firehouse Subs location. I used to work in Huntersville, and this Firehouse was just a few blocks away from my office - delicious & dangerous.   Major note of importance - I am quite the carnivore when it comes to sammies, so I can understand that Leanne C. (and other vegans & vegetarians) might have a tough time finding a satisfying meal here. Their salads are really great, though.   Things to note about this Firehouse Subs...  1) Seriously some of the nicest staff around. Yeah, I know they are trained to say, \"Welcome to Firehouse!\" whenever someone walks through the door, but they say it with such gusto. Also, they are just generally jolly here.   2) Pickles, baby! Crunchy fresh and delicious! They come with every sandwich order.   3) Firehouse Subs, in general, is a bit on the pricey side, compared to Subway and such. I typically order the Hook & Ladder sandwich deal (comes with chips & a drink) and it runs me $8.50, including tax. Now, it's not ridiculously pricey, but that adds up after a handful of visits.   4) That being said, the sandwiches are tasty tasty. Meaty and satisfying. My faves are the Hook & Ladder and the New York Steamer. On wheat please, no onion, no mayo. Thanks.  5) Show up to any FIrehouse Subs on your actual birthday (you'll have to show your I.D.) and you get a free medium sub. Nice!   Hooray Firehouse!"}
{"text":"My ode to Firehouse...  In the EpiCentre you lie, Tasty sandwiches are made on the fly, Friendly employees work here, And they're open late, no fear!   You can drop by for a quick lunch or dinner, And save some money, too, That makes you a winner.  I prefer the #3 steamer, It makes me so happy,  But not so much leaner.   Stop in for a sandwich, some chips and a Coke, That Freestyle machine is awesome, no joke, Enjoy your sub with gusto and style, Firehouse has your back, with a smile!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in this location, very dirty floors, drink stations and bathrooms, employee's who seem to be \"bothered\" if you ask a question, soggy sandwiches even when you dine in."}
{"text":"Came in and had dinner with a friend. Ordered #7 firehouse steak and cheese. It was ok, the meat was not heated all the way. Cappriottis makes the best philli cheese steaks. Anyway, my partner let me try his firehouse meatball and it was delicious. The service was great and the staff was friendly. The seating area was very clean and tidy! Love the soda machine!"}
{"text":"OMG, talk about one of the perfect sandwiches!  My family and I usually stop in before the Rebel games and grab a bite to eat.  If you want a really good sandwich, stop in here.  Right when you walk in, \"Welcome to Firehouse!\" Oh, why thank you! Sure I'll order a sandwich.  Walk up and they are super friendly.  What you want is what you get.   My order is always different from what is described, but is still really good.  I love the peppers in my sandwich. The melted cheese, with the warm, toasted bread. Goodness! Soo delicious.  Ratios are on.  After eating mine, I always want more.  My stomach says no, but my taste buds are telling me yes!"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service could be better. .. this is one of my favorite places to dine..."}
{"text":"Ordered using UberEats and first time they missed an item. But uber solved it. Next two times I ordered they were awesome. Love the sandwiches. Today the UberEats driver couldn't find me. (This happens 50% of the time with UberEats delivery, no matter who I ordered from!) But Eric at firehouse was amazing and helpful. Totally put out our fire on a messed up situation...   Thanks"}
{"text":"love the soda fountain. This is my favorite sandwich place, food is always fresh and the selection of sauces is awesome."}
{"text":"Cool location, messed up sandwich order but fixed it right away. Then they forgot jalapeño peppers. To their defense they were extremely busy. There Italian sub it super good!"}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs never disappoints. Their deli meat is so delicious and tastes like it is higher quality than other fast sub joints such as Subway and Quiznos.  My husband loves their chili and all the different hot sauces you can try.   This location is maintained very well, the facilities are clean. The employees are friendly and courteous. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Firehouse has been my favorite subs for many years. Always fresh produce, great spices and great service. I called in a sub tonight 15 min before close and Tahara (a lady that worked the closing shift) was SO delightful and cheerful. She could've had a sour attitude but instead asked if we wanted lemons for our water! Love Firehouse and their Military discount! Loyal customer!"}
{"text":"For hot sandwiches this is my all time favorite, the meat is great, the bread is one of the best (besides Jimmy Johns but they are my favs for cold sandwiches) the staff at every Firehouse we've been to has been nothing but friendly and fast and every place has been very clean. They are very accommodating when it comes to fixing my sandwich (cause I'm picky). Just love this place,  have tried to eat at one where ever we go."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! Business is great as well  service i had a little issues but manger took care of it. Thank you Erika for a good experience"}
{"text":"So I'm not a big sub person but I do really like this place. This location is in a cute little area off the freeway. The staff seems like mostly high school and college students. They were extremely nice and helpful. This place was super clean. The food is always good except I'm dumb and thought randomly maybe my sandwich needed salt. Well I went to sprinkle salt on it and BOOM all the salt comes out. Luckily it all fell on the lettuce so I was able to take it off lol. I won't be doing that again.   Anyway. 4 stars"}
{"text":"I think this is a step up from subway  I get the steamed roast beef. It is super tender hot and juicy.  You can't go wrong with the meatball ( with extra sauce) either I like that you can add hot sauce. You can't do that at other places I've always had good and fast service"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the turkey bacon ranch. It's delicious and has never let me down. However this time I was accompanied by my girlfriend who order the brisket and cheddar. It was delicious as well! I will definitely recommend this location to friends should they be in the area!"}
{"text":"The Engineer...very delicious, turkey, cheese with sauteed mushrooms...AND they heated it up, nice touch firehouse!"}
{"text":"My parents rave about firehouse subs back home so I thought I would give it a try. I ordered the smokehouse cheddar brisket sandwich. Holy smokes! That was one of the best sandwiches I have had in a really long time. The combination of a traditional sub and a BBQ joint are amazing. Definitely the  best of both worlds and a great ore work meal! I will definitely go back and try other sandwiches here. If you need your sub fix head to firehouse!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this weekend. Amazing sandwhich place. As soon as you walk in they greet u, Everyone that works there are very nice. Definitely better than Subway."}
{"text":"I had a feeling since the moment we parked to not go in but my love insisted to go here!   I wanted to go to Teriyaki Madness because it's one of my favorite lunch spots in the southwest.   We go in and greeted by sandwich makers with this tone in their voice that sounded like they've been slaving away for hours.  Asking us how we are doing but facing the chip rack is a little strange. At least make eye contact, what if I was a celebrity or something!! Jk   Our order came up, we ended up getting over charged for an extra sandwich. It was annoying and we didn't realize it until we were waiting that we just paid $25. We could have a nice 2 for $20 at chilis for that...  Anyway, they came out with the right sandwich and out change for the refund but it was just really bad quality for the amount of time and (lack of) effort put into the food.  The quality was just not there. I was considering going to glaziers and getting my lunch meat special (1/2 lb meat&1/2 lb cheese) which would come out cheaper than a meal here    Might be back if there's nothing in the area that suits my appetite."}
{"text":"Better than Subway or JJ's.  Different than DiBella's but I'd rate them both the same.  I usually go for the turkey and bacon sub.  I love the variety of hot sauce and who wouldn't love the Coke Freestyle machine?  They steam the meat and cheese so it has the perfect temperature on your bun, unlike a microwave or toaster oven.  I've been going to Firehouse Subs down south for years and I was very excited that one finally came to NE Ohio.  Hopefully it isn't the last."}
{"text":"My wife and I always have great quality subs here. The best meatball sub I've ever had. I wish we had one in Wooster."}
{"text":"This location is amazing. I have never had firehouse subs before and I thought I would give it a try. Danny R. helped me and was so patient when I couldn't decide what I wanted. He suggested all of his favorites and the most popular sandwiches in America and specifically Phoenix. I went with a meatball sandwich with sweet and spicy meatballs and would highly recommend it to anyone. Danny even checked on my half way through my meal to make sure it was good. Thanks for your service."}
{"text":"So much hype that i had to finally give it a go. I went with the meatball sub and added jalapenos. MMMM. Very tasty. Much more flavorful then somewhere like subway, or even capriottis. Bread was awesome, and the cherry limeade machine is a godsend. Definitely will have to be back. Not too pricey either."}
{"text":"This place is very quick and a healthier alternative (if you get the deli meat choice subs on wheat bread).  I love this place because it is a tastier version of subway.  They also have a get variety of drinks with their high tech fountain drink dispenser.  I would recommended to get the:   -Engineer: if you are a mushroom lover this one is for you!  -Hook & Ladder: This one has a bunch of deli meat so it is healthier, but still with that amazing taste!   The workers here are awesome they usually clean up after you which is definitely not expected because it is a fast food joint.  I will probably be here on a weekly basis.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I seem to be fond of this place although for a sub it's a little pricier than regular but hey it floats my boat so I am good. Right when you walk in the staff welcomes you.. They aren't soggy like other places I have been too. Actually has a little bit of sweetness. Maybe it is because of the wheat.   If you go I would recommend that you try Hook and ladder or Smoke house beef and cheddar brisket Plus the pop machine is amazing you have lots of options for pop."}
{"text":"I love there subs and friendly workers and very yummy I love going there every month with my friends from church"}
{"text":"Clean and tasty. I love the hook & ladder light. My husband loves the meatball. No complaints here."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally have one close to Santan where I live.  Subs are great and staff is awesome.  I love the extensive selection of hot sauces.  Location is perfect and parking was not an issue."}
{"text":"We ordered through grub hub.  45 minutes to get two subs and two side salads.  The sandwiches were warm at best.  Hardly any meat.  I've eaten at firehouse many times and know their sandwiches to be tasty and very filling.  It's as if because the order was delivery and they didn't have to look us in the eyes they felt fine cheating strangers.  The proportions of the ingredients was laughable!  Very little meat, nearly half the sandwiche's weight was in onions-on the smaller of the two subs.  Won't be going back to this location.  It's sad to see complacent, entitled, lazy people's desicions take money from what are otherwise good business models."}
{"text":"Food usually is always great, but I almost always call ahead because it takes awhile. Today I was put on hold and was able to drive to the store, order, and get my food before anyone ever came back from putting me on hold...on hold for over 17 minutes."}
{"text":"What a place, I really love that fact that they reuse out fire house things, as that is their theme and what a great one it is; place well, the food is great too and the CS is well top of the line.  + from the fact that you have a very roomy sitting area to that fact that you can see that they love what they do.  + for the CS, is always top line and well, very friendly too,   What a great place for kids, as well, what better way to have some family fun and see life happening in action, lol, okay, the after the fact action; for as, they reuse the fire house stuff for the over all great place of FIrehouse Subs."}
{"text":"I have noticed that they were opening here for a little while now, after  finishing my taxes down the road I drove by and noticed the sign said open! So my wife and I stopped in this was the first time at a Firehouse subs. The place was fully staffed I assume to create a good impression as they are just opening, needless to say the service was great, I had the turkey bacon ranch and my wife had the Italian both were very good. A smokey taste is added to the subs making them a little different from your everyday sub shop. We will be visiting again soon and also can't wait for the teriyaki madness to open next door as well!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite firehouse sub.  Employees are focused on great customer service.  The food is awesome.  Have never been disappointed.  Always a go to when in this area.  Love it.  Keep up the awesome service.  That will keep my family coming back.  I also love the cause they support.  Our first responders should be supported n valued more.  Thank you firehouse sub for supporting those men n women."}
{"text":"Food was great service sucked ! We came in at 8:45 pm and ordered food by the time it was done it was 9:10 pm they put all the food in bags told us us we had to leave . I didn't realize they were closing. when I walked in the door they should have said you can't eat here we are closing in 15 min. I stopped in here after football practice if I wanted to wait until I got home to eat I would have eaten at home. I can say this was a first.  I have never had this happen and I have been in a restaurant an hour after closing ! I"}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to get a sandwich but it'll do if you've got that craving and you're in the area.   Cons: On the pricey side and slow  Pros: clean, friendly staff, fair quality and you can donate your change to a worthy cause."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE firehouse subs. I invest so much of my money on this establishment because their sandwiches are the best. Today I was disappointed in not only the product, but the way my situation was handled as well. I ordered a medium Italian, no cheese, no seasonings or dressing. Add cucumbers. Now this isn't my normal location so it's definitely not the one that's closest to me. I drove past it and stopped in. When I got to my destination, my sandwich was wrong. I called the store and explained my situation, the first team member didn't say much and a manager hopped on the line. She told me the sandwich came fully involved. (I didn't know what that meant because I've never ordered it NOT fully involved and never received the sandwich how I did today) so basically, I spent $10 at your restaurant, can't eat the sandwich because of how wrong it is, and they didn't offer to refund my money or anything. Usually firehouse hits it out of the park, today was not one of those days. I will continue to eat at Firehouse, I just won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"This was my first time eatting at Firehouse & I was very pleased! I was immediately greeted by Kenji.. (hope the spelling is right) He was cleaning the lobby, but stopped to help me take my order! I was very pleased with the customer service I received and the quality of food! I will definitely be back! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"One of the best subs I've ever had. The bread is enough where it doesn't fill you up. The meat is really juicy and flavorful and they give you more meat than other sub-sandwich shops.  The assortment of hot sauces is a really nice touch too. I had the Hook and Ladder and tried a little bit of Tequila Lime hot sauce which turned out really good.  The people at this location are really friendly and quick. I picked up a catering menu so my company can start using them for catered lunches."}
{"text":"I had been avoiding this place despite it being near my home because of the negative reviews. But my experience was great. It was very busy, but I ordered quickly, and by the time I had gotten my iced tea and chips, my sandwich was already ready. The iced tea was great and ginormous for a medium. They also had lemon and the sweetener I like--nice. The employees were friendly and fast, and the sandwich was tasty. No complaints here. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here during a busy weekday where the whole place was literally packed and full. Since the place was completely packed during lunch, I got my order to go which didn't take too long to get my sandwich. I got the cheese steak sandwich which was absolutely amazing.  I can't remember when was the last time I had a decent steak sandwich. The whole firefighter theme was pretty cool and the fact that they have all these hot sauce labeled with a number indicating how spicy it is."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches you can get in Scottsdale... Even more impressive considering they are a national franchise. Why only four stars do you ask? Because the dining room is freezing cold every single time I come there. While generally this is not an issue in Arizona considering you can eat outside, this is not the case here. Sadly, the dumpsters for several restaurants is located nearby and stink.  Owner: while I understand it maybe warm back there near the ovens, the customers comfort should always come first.  Raise the temperature please!"}
{"text":"5 stars for me every time! We come to this Firehouse location every Monday for the Meatball Monday sub. This is the best meatball sub you can find at any sandwich shop. The meatballs actually taste, perfectly seasoned, the sauce is perfect, and you have your choice of white or wheat. I always get my with banana peppers. The ingredients are always fresh and the subs are made right in front of you. All subs come with a pickle too. One thing I like about this location is that the staff is always super friendly and greet you when you walk in. Also love that they have the customizable Coca Cola machine so I can have a Barqs Rootbeer with vanilla flavor!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place the theme is so adorable and it's pretty cool that they have the custom soda machines. Their subs are way better then the cardboard you would get anywhere else. My daughter loves getting the little fire hat to wear. She looks so cute in them!"}
{"text":"Very happy with Firehouse Subs. This is my 4th time coming here and they are always consistent with their subs. Delicious, fresh, and relatively inexpensive subs. Your tastebuds will thank you. ;)"}
{"text":"I placed a complicated order through ubereats asking for every item to be wrapped separately they went above and beyond to accommodate me. The sandwich was delicious, I'll be back"}
{"text":"If you have never had a Steamed Sub you must try this place. Be sure you get your sandwich \"Full Loaded\". This place has the largest selection of random sauces from BBQ Hot including all your habanero favorites."}
{"text":"Wow I was amazed with the subs, I will be a regular customer here from now on.  Yummers."}
{"text":"Came here for a sub and left with a big ole smile on my face!  Firehouse subs totally hit the spot.  They serve hot subs, and was amazed at how good they tasted.  I had the #3 which was roast beef and pastrami with all the fixings.  They do have a great selection of hot sauces here, but I didn't try any of them.  The subs here come in 2 sizes, 8 inch and 12 inch.  Prices are actually quite reasonable, and I feel like I got a lot more then I paid for.  Tasty bread, a filling meal, and enough sub to make me happy.    They even sell their pickle buckets here.  Their those big drum looking things that are probably hold at least 5 gallons of goods for $2.  I guess the $2 goes towards a fireman's charity or something, but either way, its for a good cause.    Anyways, this place is worth checking out.  :-)"}
{"text":"Very Impressed! I was helping my daugher move and this is right by her new place so we ran in for a sandwhich. We got the italian sub with chips and a drink. The italian sub was fantastic. So flavorful and just the right amount of stuff on it, including a very flavorful italian sauce. The sandwhich was perfectly toasted and good sized. The drink fountain was fun! It actually was fun! You can pick the type of soda/tea, etc and add flavoring. I had a raspberry lemonade and then when I was leaving I filled it up with cherry coke. Ok, I felt like a little kid playing with the machine! The service was fast and friendly. The food excellent and the location perfect for my daughter's new place. I will be back for an awesome sub!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE sandwich place! I love the Firehouse sub. It's the only one I have tried."}
{"text":"Went in here and got totally ripped off two medium subs $26.80!!!! I asked for a cheesesteak no papers and the girl says but mushrooms are ok so I said sure then she charged me $1!!! My daughter orders a ham and pepperoni sandwich and they charged $2 for pepperoni this place sucks and they try to up sell as they have their tip jar out!!! Never coming back to this rip off place again my daughter and I could have gone to a decent restaurant for the price of two poorly made sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Love me some Firehouse subs. I always want to offer 6 stars but tonight I went in during the Friday rush to an understaffed mess.   4 combos took way too long and 2 of the subs were wrong, not to mention I got a handful of meatball sauce on the outside of the bag. Which my shirt did not enjoy.  Food is always great but it's better when you get what you order and it's not a mess :(.   I will be back because they have have always done so well before!"}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs has great subs, excellent service and a great atmosphere. The subs are made rather quickly and are very tasty. The people who work there are very friendly."}
{"text":"Yes. Food is good and parking is tricky. But the employees are what makes this place. Super friendly and accommodating. Hayden was so helpful when I went with my mom and three kids, and we accidentally created a mini disaster area."}
{"text":"We just moved to this community and tried it on our house hunting trip and again after moving here...Great price and very friendly staff! Food is excellent with lots of meat and perfect amount of veggies and sauce! It will be a regular for us"}
{"text":"Wow how this place has gone downhill. Ate from here yesterday, our food was to go. The employees all look like they woke up 10 minutes prior and the lack of consistency with getting a pickle for not just one sandwich but both sandwiches paid for. I'll never eat here again just because the sandwich did not sit right."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service starting from the owner to the general manager. Rude and disrespect. No customer service skills. Will never ever eat here. 0 stars"}
{"text":"Not happy with last experience. The food as always been pretty good. But $15+ for a steak sandwich meal is a bit steep. The soda machine was out of 50% of the drinks so I waited for 10 minutes for that. The phone was constantly ringing with no one answering and some beeping or notification sound was going off behind register and it was annoying. WTF. My sandwich seemed a little skimpy this time as well.  Anyway, not worth the $15 for a lunch. And just to clarify I did not vote for min wage increase. So don't blame me. There are better options for 9-12$"}
{"text":"Food is consistent! Service we'll can't say the same! It shocks me that a place that represents the hero's who work so hard to keep us safe would employee lazy gossiping employees who do not put customer first!"}
{"text":"Food was good. I dot need management telling me I cat tip. For this I won't be back and I won't recommend them. Your not paying 20 an hour tipping is my option stop  trying to control your employees that make you money."}
{"text":"Counter service is very helpful, my order was taken immediately.  The dinning room is clean and relaxing for a lunch place.  My sandwich was very good, I will be coming back the next time I am in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"Impressive place. So you get greeted by a chorus of \"Welcome to Firehouse\" by everyone as soon as you walk in. VERY clean and very nice location. The place literally sparkles.   Now to the food.....Awesome! I had the medium Club on a Sub. It was great. The meat had a lot of flavor and the proportions were just right when it came to the meat/veggie/condiment ratio. I literally devoured it like I was starving. I then raved about it to my wife who got upset that I tried Firehouse subs for the first time without her...whoops!  Moral of the story: Eat at Firehouse, but ask your wife if she wants some first ;)"}
{"text":"I personally love firehouse I believe it to be one of the better sand which chains in the market. The smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket is like no other. I'm always satisfied"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience here. It was my first time at firehouse subs- I finally decided to try it after my boyfriend continuously raved about it for weeks. This was a new location for him. As we were walking in, he commented on how happy and loud they always greet their customers when they walk in. However, as we walked in, I made eye contact with one woman (who I later presumed to be some sort of manager). She then looked back down and we were given no greeting whatsoever.   I was flustered that the menu posted on the wall did not match that of online. I began to order with a young man, and requested to create my own veggie sub. He asked if I wanted \"their\" veggie sub, which was not posted on the menu. I commented that I'd prefer to just create my own. He became annoyed and commented that he was \"just going to ring it in as 'their' veggie sub or else he'd have to push a lot of buttons\".... ok. I proceeded to order anyway.   We paid in cash and the cashier's register was short $1 bills. He leaned over at the (presumed) manager and asked for some $1's. She acted annoyed and rolled her eyes, but proceeded to help him, again without acknowledging the customer.   Long story short, my order was not made correctly. Service was disappointing, especially out of someone who is a (again, presumed) manager of some sort....she shouldn't be working in customer service.   One plus: There was one blonde woman working there that night who was very friendly and helpful, she stopped what she was doing and helped someone in my group get water when we tried one of their hot sauces that was too hot! :)"}
{"text":"Have a GREAT experience EVERYTIME I come in here! Staff. Quality. Everything is just friendly and precise"}
{"text":"Upon entering this place, the air was a little smokey from the food being heated.  They really go with that NY firehouse theme, LOL.  Anyhow, on the right side of the place was a fake brick wall with fire hats hanging.  Also, I noticed the little kids were given small hats too.    If you like pastrami get the New York Steamer for $7.88 with chips and drink.  Very delicious.  My wife and I split the large New York Steamer. It was our first time and we kinda just wanted to sample something.  After we were served they were nice enough to say, \"next time tell us you're going to split the meal so we can put them in separate baskets\".  Something else that goes a long with fire theme is the barrage of hot sauces you can choose from.    If you're into pop, I mean soda, Firehouse has a very unique soda machine that is touch screen and has up to 120 drink combinations!  Definitely would go again.   I'm really glad I went but, I would suggest to take it to go if you go on the weekends cause this place is packed!  I give Firehouse Subs 4 stars."}
{"text":"So about a week or so ago I tried this Sub Shop. The people were very nice, although robotic in their welcome to Firehouse  Subs Yell. I liked the fact that you got a pickle with your sandwich. But the bread tasted like day old bread. This is not acceptable. It really wasnt worth the money."}
{"text":"Wow,  two Firehouse Subs within about 2 miles on the same road!  Must be doing good!  a. Location - 4 star - located on the southeast corner of Horizon Ridge and Eastern, this place is very easy to get to and plenty of parking.  They are located next to some hopping retail stores so it is well placed and busy area which I like.  b.  Restaurant - 4 star - Plenty of places to sit down, much more than the one down the road.  c.  Service - 5 star - Fantastic.  From the sandwich assembler to the person taking the order, everyone is young, friendly, pro service and providing great service when they have young work place maturity.  d.  Food - 5 star - Really great subs.   - Had the Hook and Ladder Sub, with Smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted Monterey Jack. This was great. -Smokehouse Brisket and Cheddar -  choice beef brisket smoked melted cheddar, special sauces. This was a bit barren. - Special Hawaiian Pork on Roll - Teriyaki pork special. the port was awesome and the bread really great.  -  Fully Involved is the way they do sandwiches and it means Loaded complete with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion and a dill spear on the side.  e.  Prices without drink and chips is under 6.00 and with under 9.00.  Overall very good.  f.  Drinks - 5 star - They have one of those choose your drink vending machines that has so many choices. These are great!"}
{"text":"I like this place for a chain restaurant. It has a mystique about it and a certain \"cool\" factor to it.  1.  The Subway menu got weird and difficult. 2.  Port of Subs, the franchise owners are very inconsistent 3.  Quiznos - I don't care to eat there if their advertisement is an annoying mouse.  Firehouse subs...I was on my weekly or semi monthly jaunt to Freed's when I saw a line out the door in 100+ degree weather at the restaurant. I went in finally another time and   a.  Their menu is very easy to order from b.  All the meats are warmed, adding a nice taste. c.  Large eat in area, great for the kids, positive atmosphere. d.  For a \"non\" service restaurant, they provide pretty good servicee.   e.  All those bottles of spices...  very nice.  You will like this place. I won't blow your mind, but it will be just decent food."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are extremely good! I recently ordered the meatball sub because I haven't had it in a while and it wasn't as good as I remember but my go to is the hook and ladder with the firehouse BBQ sauce (captain F or something). I want to try something new but every time I see hook and ladder I just gotta have it!"}

{"text":"I hate that I have to give this one star just to review because it doesn't deserve it.Downloaded app and tried all the way there to get it to work,it wouldn't.God why didn't I realize this could be a sign.Ordered 2 white engineers,and even though there was only one person ahead of me my order took over 20 minutes.Nobody spoke,unlike Jimmy John's were I got subs from last night (don't cook unless I have no choice).When I finally heard order for Wilson yelled-I mean come on I was the only one there.After a 15 minute drive home,we opened the bag to find a soggy mess.The bread was very wet,I was hungry and couldn't even force myself to eat half.I would say I went to bed hungry,but to be honest the wet bread and greasy meat had made me very sick.Took app off my phone,cause 0 service + 0 food quality =never again."}
{"text":"I was in the area and ate at his location.  The employees were friendly and my sub was very good.  I always order the club at firehouse and it was as good as the other locations I have tried."}
{"text":"Tried this place again and frankly it just got worse .. They took a really long time to bring us our food and when it finally came out guess what? My daughters meal was Incorrect even with a receipt that said no cheese and not toasted it comes out toasted ham and cheese with pepperoni so we have to send it back.. I got the mommas homemade chicken salad again but this time as a Sandwich which goes for $6.09. I kid you not it arrived with bright GREEN tomatoes it was so gross I literally couldn't believe it was even worse quality then subway but it mostly seemed like the staff just doesn't care. We came here again to get some food before grocery shopping cause it's never a good idea to shop on a empty stomach but I ended up sending my food back and getting a refund. The one star is for their cookies both the lemon and chocolate chips were winners .. The guy checking us out was really nice but tori and the people making the Food really don't seem to care at all"}
{"text":"Good thing I ordered extra mayo on my sub, I might not have got any at all.  Prices are a bit high compared to the quantity of product delivered, unless you consider lettuce as a primary ingredient in an Italian meats sandwich.  The amount of meat on the sandwich was barely noticeable as was the flavor of the meats.   Delivery was slow, it took about 15 minutes to get my sub, there were only three people ahead of me and four or five people behind the counter making sandwiches - don't break out of the \"system\" - they have a system for a reason!  I was really not impressed, the sandwich was filling and while I did not partake the computerized beverage/ice dispenser had a lot of options for mixing your soft drinks.  Unfortunately, I don't drink soft drinks, so I had to wait for the young woman in front of me to decide which flavor combination she wanted before I could get my ice.  She was having difficulty, maybe there are too many options?  Or maybe the ice dispenser should be a separate device?  On a positive note, the tea was fresh, although not freshly brewed."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, & awesome restaurant! You have to try it for yourself!! 10/10 recommend. Everybody can find something on the menu, it's fabulous!"}
{"text":"The sandwich I had was delicious, my only complaint were the younger women working and gossiping very loud about how much they hate working their and how bad the other coworkers are. My friend and I, and one other table were the only ones in the restaurant so it was very noticeable and distracting from our meal. I went in on 8/27 @ 5pm"}
{"text":"Love this place! Even though they aren't always the quickest, the yummy sandwiches are worth it. The sandwiches may be slightly pricier than others, the the punch card is a plus. Nothing beats a free sandwich. Their soda machine rocks."}
{"text":"First time here, the wife and I split a \"Club on a Sub\".  It was very good, unlike other sub shops when we asked for black olives they gave us a lot, not three little slices!  They have the 120+ drink machine here as well which is a nice twist.  The final note that will definitely bring me back is the fact that they PROUDLY FLY AN AMERICAN FLAG in their establishment.  The boys devoured their food and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The bread was extremely fresh. I went there with my work crew and all of our food was great!  I had the Philly steak very very good!"}
{"text":"I said NO MAYO, and I got TONS of mayo in my sandwich. It took forever to get the 6 sandwiches I ordered, but next time I know you can place orders in advance.  I prefer Lenny's. My sandwich was soggy."}
{"text":"Never had a bad sub here. The Firehouse Hero is definitely delicious (along with their oatmeal raisin cookies). But while Firehouse's quality is superior, I could get a cheaper sandwich at Subway."}
{"text":"Taste good but the amount of meat they give is way too little. Their motto is \"we cater to firefighter-sized appetites.\" More like baby of fire fighters sized appetites. The taste of the sub is good but don't know if it is worth going back. I had the brisket and you could see what I mean about the amount of meat they give."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff knows me by name after only been there a handful of times. Makes me feel welcome. Staff is always super helpful and suggests something new every time. One of the cleanest firehouses that I've been too. Yum!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I think it's great that every time you walk in the door everyone on the staff greets you with a \"Welcome to Firehouse!\"  I always get the Club on a Sub, fully involved except for mustard and love how it melts in my mouth when I eat it. Plus you get a pickles on the side with every sandwich and they are always crisp and delicious."}
{"text":"Best subs in NC!  Love the abundance of hot sauce. I thought I could hang with something that had a 9 on it given my predilection to make everything spicy as hell. I was wrong, it was too much and I couldn't hang.  The philly steak was awesome and reminded me of my time in Philly minus the fact that the bread was a little softer and the place definitely cleaner.  I bought into their Cherry Lime-Aid thing and it was meh.  Tasted like Cherry Kool-Aid so I don't think it's worth it for them to hype it up.  That is all.  dmo out."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the customer service I received tonight. So I'm standing at the counter to order and a girl names bailey took her time to walk up to us. When she did she didn't say anything so I had to ask are you ready for my order? And again she didn't say anything other then shake her head. She had such a bad attitude towards me and my boyfriend it's was crazy! While she was taking our order she wouldn't even look at us. Once we paid she walk away and I had to ask what size cup we get and she just said talk any. I get it's 8:15 pm and you close at 9 but your still working. So I hope the customer service gets a little better then what we had tonight."}
{"text":"I had some bad luck with a few places and cut down on the dining out for a while. As a result, I was left to painfully prep my own meals. Some days you're just too exhausted after doing the whole adulting thing and you can't help but seek convenience. Well, I gave in and decided to drop in for a sub. The smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket is my favorite so I ordered the usual. Staff was friendly. It was hitting the spot until I bit down and received a complementary hair floss. It was brown and curly. I look over and both the guys have long curly hair. I didn't complain. What's the point? Nothing is going to convince me to come back. Disgusted, I tossed my stuff and left."}
{"text":"They have awesome hot sandwiches here. I have never really had any issues when we've ordered in store or ahead online. The staff has always been prompt and friendly everytime that I've stopped by."}
{"text":"We've never had Firehouse before, so on a night when we wanted something quick we decided to give it a shot. This Firehouse Subs location is located in the large plaza at the north east corner of Thickson and Rossland. It's in the newest section of the plaza.   They offer subs in 8-inch and 12-inch. They have 8 or 10 sub options, like turkey bacon ranch, meatball, New York steamer, beef and cheddar brisket and a build your own option too. They also have a few salad options as well!   We both opted for 8-inch turkey bacon ranch sub. I opted out of the ranch dressing and got their Italian instead, which they compared to subways sub sauce. It comes with turkey and bacon and their standard set of ingredients, mayo, mustard, tomato, lettuce and onion (? Not sure about that one).   And it's heated up in the process? The counter where they make your sub was too high for me to see over and I'm 5'6\". Didn't take too long for our order to be ready and then we headed home. They nicely put a number sticker on the sub that had ranch dressing on it so we could tell them apart!   The sub was surprisingly great, nicely heated through, melty and almost rich? The mayo they use is pretty good and makes this feel like a more decadent sub. I did think the 8-inch was too much food, but they're generous with the toppings and it adds up. All of it felt really fresh. I look forward to going back and trying something else off their menu, they have some interesting sub options and I bet they do a really good steak sub. Will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"My brother, his girlfriend and I were looking to get soup but the place was closed.  Lo and behold, we found Firehouse Subs to be having its grand opening.  They greeted us and we decided to check this place out.  All the firehouse items in the restaurant are authentic and have been donated by the local firehouse.  I've gone back to this restaurant a couple of times and have enjoyed several of their sandwiches.  Some of them are spicy for those with weak stomachs.  The absolute highlight of this restaurant is the soda machine.  It is one of two in the state of Pennsylvania.  You can mix and match the kind of soda that you want.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"Best meatball sub..light marinara..some on the side...yummmy. the meal for 1 person does tend to be on the high for deli style subs. For now it is my go to shop for my meatball sub. I gave it three stars for the price and because it never fails i always gave to wipe down my table before having a seat. Always crumby and ate on from previous folk.  Next time i go back i will get a free pickle bucket for when i donate 2$ dollars to charity!"}
{"text":"In a recent prior review I warned vegetarians that the sautéed mushrooms (a normal ingredient of their veggie subs) were soaked in anchovie sauce.  Um now informed that Firehouse Subs has been phasing-in mushrooms that are truly vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Steve saved my order and earned my loyal business! I was the second person in line, and the lady in front of me was ordering like, 15 subs and paying for each one separately. (Apparently she's picking up lunch for her entire office.) Since I was on my lunch hour, I started to think that I should just leave, cuz this lady's order was clearly going to take forever. While the lady was still going through each order, Steve asked what he could get started for me. By the time I officially placed my order with the cashier and paid, my sub was almost ready! I was impressed and thankful for Steve's consideration. Oh, and the sub was delicious as always. (Italian is the best!)"}
{"text":"Damn! I'm in love!  More expensive than other sandwich joints, and worth it.  Ignore the fact that they give back to the fire department LOCALLY at every turn, are always clean, have free for what's for me and My Kayden.  Ignore, if you have no soul, the soda machine that dispenses dream mixed AND has Cherry Limeade, in Sparkling or Non. Not to mention Vanilla Rootbeer or Cherry Dr Pepper.  You cannot ignore the Barbecue Beef sandwich. The exact name escapes me at the moment. It's 3AM and I am insomniac, drinking coffee in bed. The counter people will absolutely help you. I add fresh onions, they also offer sautéed! Little cups of one of the 40 flavored of Barbeque sauce on the counter to personalize it, too. Damn. Best thing I've had in my mouth in way too long to count. (Sadness) Anyway, go. Get it. Eat it. The UFC me. You'll want to.  Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?"}
{"text":"I love the salads here because they chop the ingredients in tiny pieces. This allow the pieces to distribute evenly throughout the salad. I love their peppercorn ranch dressing.  If I had to give some critics, I would say that the lettuce could have been a little fresher. Some of the pieces were a little brown."}
{"text":"This place is the best sub shop out there.  The bread is by far the tastiest compared to other sub shops.  It is a little pricier than other places, but well worth it!! Highly recommend Firehouse subs."}
{"text":"I heard from friend that this place is good. So since one opened near my house I decided to try it. I got the turkey bacon ranch. Very expensive the sandwich was not so great bland nothing special. So one day decided to try another sandwich. I went with the steak and cheese. The meat was luke warm the veggies were very cold. My friend also had the steak and cheese and had same problem cold. For as many employees the place has you would think the food would come out quick and the place was dead took 15min. I returned both of the cold subs and they made new one this time hot. For the price think I will stick to subway"}
{"text":"I love this firehouse!! Friendly staff and delicious food! Very clean too. I got the turkey bacon ranch sub...sooo good! Make sure to try some of their house sauce with your sub!  Delish!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Firehouse Subs several times and have had consistently good experiences: good sandwiches and fast service.   If you're going to Subway for a sub, you must not have tried Firehouse Subs or there's not one nearby.   Check out their menu online and see if you can resist.  Oh, and let me know how it goes."}
{"text":"As far as chain sub shops go this is my favorite. There is no lack of meat on the sandwich, fresh veggies, and I don't have to spell out each item for the sandwich.  AND HOT SAUCE!!!   OK so hot sauce is not something I would normally look for in a sandwich place but when there are so many choices... I try something new almost every time so I always get a new experience. I do and have recommended this place to many people."}
{"text":"this place is over rated, nothing more then meat on bread.  flavor was blah, bread was hard,   guess that's what you get at the end of the day, and they are skimpy on the toppings.  other sub place are much better.  can't say I will never go back, but there are to many other place doing much better."}
{"text":"The service was unimpressive and the food took a long time to get to us. But it was tasty. Never been here before. Would try it again sometime but with lowered expectations on quality of service and speed."}
{"text":"Place was great! Came in and it was super clean and friendly. The service was really fast and they did whatever they could to accommodate me &a my boyfriend. We will definitely be back soon for his favorite (the brisket sub)."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It's new and clean and of course it's got 'firemen' parafanalia all over. The staff was friendly and attentive. It had some interesting combinations and my food came out pretty quick. I enjoyed it and 1/2 a sandwich was just right for me. It was pretty much the same price as JerseyMike's but with more creative menu choices.  Let's just say this;  \"It ain't Vita Mia's on Harrison Avenue in Garfield\"..... but you're not going to get better on the westside.  I give the Firehouse subs  a good solid 7 out of 10  Pepperoncini's."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great friendly service. I have finally found a great sandwich, better than Chompies."}
{"text":"It's my first time here. I had a take out order. My sub was the firehouse meatball. It was really good. The food was made very quick since I'm just down the street. They were very friendly and the place looked cute. The cookie and brownie were yummy. I love the fact that they had the subs in a togo box and not wrapped. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for my first Firehouse Sub and I wasn't disappointed. I had the medium pastrami sandwich on white bread. The bread was fresh, a little crispy, and very tasty. The pastrami itself was cut thick and also had a great flavor. They have a hot sauce bar loaded with great, hard-to-find, hot sauces. The only complaint I have is that it does take a little while to get your sandwich, about 10-15 min. Now this certainly didn't ruin the experience for me and to be fair, they were getting slammed with orders. Overall, it is very easy to recommend this sub shop. I'll certainly be coming back...next time for a Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket!"}
{"text":"The staff was very nice, the food was great, and the restaurant was clean. They even delivered out subs to our table. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews I honestly feel this might be my first one from this email, I tried to call and speak to the manager but was told that by Mariah that Joe couldn't come to the phone and wouldn't be able to help me anyhow. I order firehouse quite frequently on GrubHub my kids love the subs. Today we are going to be out and about driving so we picked up the order. I wanted a soup and salad I got absolutely no dressing no fork for my salad and no spoon for my soup. The kids love their sandwiches as always I just was not able to eat my meal no one likes dry lettuce or cold soup by the time I got to spoon. I called and wanted a refund on just my salad portion as I couldn't eat it offered to send pictures and was told the only way that I could get a refund was if I brought my salad back which is now 25 miles away, not happening. Mariah / had a cheerful voice but has zero idea of what customer service means. I didn't want to write a review wanted to talk to a manager but was an able to so I thought this is my only way to get this information across to you guys. Very disappointed today!"}
{"text":"For get subway,port of subs, jimmy johns or jasons deli   Fire house is the best theres nothing like it best subs hands down always clean always fast service and always good"}
{"text":"My to go order took 15 minutes, then when I got back to work I bit into a hair in my sandwich and almost threw up..."}
{"text":"Would've given 5-stars but the cashier Matthew doesn't seem to want to talk to customers or listen to them at all. He seemed disturbed when I was ordering & made me feel like I was doing things wrong when it was on his end."}
{"text":"I went here because I had a doctors appointment in the area. Its an amazing concept that is so poorly executed. First off when i walked in... there was a unison greeting.. .I don't know what it was... everyone talking at once made it almost impossible to understand... something ...something... firehouse subs..... Another person walked in and got the same greeting. I still could not understand it. One of the men working said, \" Oh huh first time?\" then sarcastically said \"my wonderful manager will explain what we do.\"  Not exact but close to what he said.  He then gave me a  menu. I ordered my sub after being awkwardly explained how it works.. As I sat waiting for my sub I heard the manager go to an employee. \"Hey you could finish putting the bag in the trash can... its part of you know what they call a job\" That's not an exact quote but similar. Joking or not that's rude to say in front of a customer. I could hear that, and if i think that employee's are being miss treated it does not make me want to go there. So I got my sub.. Looks good... Until I found one blond hair on one Side of the sub and a long blond hair cooked into the cheese on the other side of it.  I do not have blond hair. The two men who were working there had short black hair. The two women cooking the food both had long blond hair. One was not wearing a hair net or a cap.... VIOLATION. The food was actually good. But the hairs kind of ruined it. Once again proof that, that area seems to miss a lot when it comes to sanitation."}
{"text":"Great example of a Firehouse sub location. I go here a lot when traveling for work....but this visit was after a Cleveland Browns home game. Location is in a strip shopping mall, nice stores around....easy in and out. We visited on a Sunday night at 5:15pm. Short wait at the counter from 3 customers in front of us. I ordered a 12\" BBQ brisket, with Swiss cheese and tomatoes added, and my buddy got an 8\" club. Both sandwiches were correct, fresh and hot, and in front of us in about 4 minutes. Every table we noticed was clean and orderly, and the 3 guys working the kitchen were polite and friendly. Only possible negative was that the men's soap dispenser ran out of soap as I was using it, but I alerted the staff who went to fix it right away. If you've never been to a Firehouse Subs before, this is a great example to start you off....and if you're a regular, you'll get exactly what you're craving."}
{"text":"Not only does this place have consistently delicious subs, but the staff is always super friendly, helpful, informative and you get the feeling they actually want you to be there! Their customer service is top notch and their food is nothing short of fantastic. Life long customer here."}
{"text":"I had a really tasty sandwich here, the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar here. But I will agree with other reviewers that the sandwich could stand to be a bit bigger for the price. I liked the fact that if you accept all defaults (they ask you every step of the process how you would like your sandwich), this BBQ-sauce filled sandwich also gets mayonaisse. Most people may not like that, but I do. The combination of sweet-tangy and creamy works for my palette.  Didn't sample the impressive array of hot sauces available for spicing up one's sandwich, but always happy to see a wide selection of condiments available.   I'm tempted to come back here and try their other selections. I also liked how you can buy the house BBQ sauce in a fire-hydrant shaped bottle."}
{"text":"I love the customer service here!!! With that fun happy energetic team, I'm sure to enjoy my Meatball Sub!"}
{"text":"Welcome change to the local sub scene. . Check out the custom murals. Each location has one that is site specific. .Future Favorite for Las Vegas Flavor."}
{"text":"Their veggie sandwich is very good. Full of mushrooms, peppers, onions, and more. It is very flavorful and is a punch to the taste buds. It's a bit messy, be sure to grab a ton of napkins."}
{"text":"Came here with a co-worker. Got a dr pepper from their really awesome modern soda machine. My co worker got a meatball sandwich. He said he was the best meat ball sandwhich he ever have. Which is saying a lot because his from ny, I believe they ate a lot of sandwiches haha... The service was fast. The place was really clean. Tried a bite of the meatball sandwhich, I hate meatball sandwhiches, to my amusement I really enjoyed this one."}
{"text":"I don't think I visit firehouse subs enough to know if other locations greet you with an instant \"Welcome to Firehouse subs\" but it was a good start to a quick afternoon meal . Considering one of their competitors is literally around the corner I was impressed with this Firehouse subs quickness and attention to detail . The manager stood out because he really seem to lead his staff to create a structured assembly line , he took all the orders making sure to acknowledge their survey link on the bottom of the receipt , I left a great review . I'm not much of a cold cut sub gal so I tried something new and it was satisfying so if you are eyeing the Philly cheese steak sub here , go for it . I normally just eat a medium sub because the fillings aren't lacking."}
{"text":"Very clean and neat. The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable when it comes to their menu and options. I enjoyed their meatball sub, but it could of used a little extra sauce, but that's just me. My sister had a vegetarian sub. I didn't try it, but it looked appetizing and she liked it. I highly recommend this restaurant and rate them an A+!"}
{"text":"Love the meatball sub! Best I've ever had. Just one thing, it's very minor and maybe it's just me but whenever you walk in you get barraged by every worker saying, \"Welcome to Firehouse Subs!\"  Hearing that five consecutive times gets a bit redundant. One greeting is sufficient.  I'm tempted to yell back, \"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\" When I walk into a sandwich shop I want attention but not the bells and whistles, look who just walked in kind of attention."}
{"text":"I have visited this firehouse at least 10 times.  Always fast friendly service.   Firehouse always makes their Italian on point.  Yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the turkey bacon ranch sub and it was really good! The wait wasn't long at all either. As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted and one of the girls asked if I wanted a run down of the menu! They were all nice and helpful and I'll definitely pass the good word along!"}
{"text":"This place is so good I seriously couldn't stop thinking about my left-overs and actually got pretty excited around dinner time knowing I was having the second half of my sandwich.  I highly recommend Firehouse Subs and plan to eat there as frequently as possible."}
{"text":"I was not a big fan of the sandwich. The selection is very limited on toppings and you don't really have a choice in what you get. I ordered the roast beef sandwich, the bread was really good, but the cheese was melted and the roast beef was broken up into chunks of meat instead of slices of roast beef. I suppose this is a more polished place than subway, but when I want a cold sandwich, I want a cold sandwich not melted cheese."}
{"text":"Hello friends,   1st off, be prepared to walk out smelling like you've just put out a 5 alarm fire. But why though? They steam their meats and bread. My suggestion is to turn down the smoke machine about 100 percent.  As for the menu, it's not like the other hoggie/sub shops. They don't offer the same amount of toppings which is fine by me.   TTFN"}
{"text":"Hello Friends  WE went in early 10:30am. WE were greated with a friendly \"Hello, Welcome to Firehouse\".  I ordered a LARGE (12 inch) Firehouse Hero Sub, which consisted of Premium roast beef, smoked turkey, Virginia honey ham, provolone. 8.09 plus tax 8.76  I walk pass this place often on my way into the gig. around 7am. Sometimes i can catch an early employee stocking, cleaning and getting ready for the day ahead. Pretty clean inside.. but then again.. I was so early they probably thought i was a health inspector or something. No biggie.  The prices aren't that bad (not that great either), but for what its worth, between this place and my favorite Jersey Mikes.... I'll keep an eye out on this place.   I like it! and I'lllllll be bauk!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them negative. My spouse and I walked in and not one staff member greeted us. We got to the register and my spouse was ordering and another couple walked in (Caucasian) and was greeted by the entire staff. Since this was our first time in a firehouse. ( just moved here from Cali) we weren't aware of the normal greeting. However I instantly got annoyed and told my wife that were not eating eating here and walked out. Highly disappointed. But I'm not sure if we were ignored because we are African American or because we are lesbians. Either way I will never come back."}
{"text":"My little girl says it's DEEEElicious. She's right. I really enjoyed my roast beef sandwich. I should have stuck with the small, sandwiches are really big. Im from the Bay Area and I love the small mom and pop places, this is as close as I can get. did knock over a bottle of hot sauce and it burst. The staff was really cool about it."}
{"text":"Both sandwiches were a hot mess! They were falling apart and don't bother asking for extra crispy straws on the sandwich since I literally had one extra one. Staff overall wasn't very friendly so most likely we will not be going back and will find another sandwich shop."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place for one reason and one reason only:  THEY HAVE ONE OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SELECTIONS OF HOT SAUCES I HAVE EVER SEEN ANYWHERE.  I am kinda a chilli head at times and love to search out food that is stupid spicy.  I have found that Las Vegas in general lacks trully spicy food, however Firehouse Subs has changed that.  They have a pethora of various hot sauces and not sauces like tabasco or Tapatio.  I am talking caspician oil based sauces that like up your mouth like a douglas fir on christmas day.  This is the only reason I gave this place 4 stars.  A man's man's selection of hot sauces.    The sandwiches are just good enough to not take away from the not sauce selection.  If you love hot food go here!"}
{"text":"Great and very friendly!!  Best subs EVER!!  Always fresh!!  I cannot say enough how they are always smiling and make life easy to order and take home that the family always loves without being normal fried fast food!!"}
{"text":"They have lots of choices and different types of subs. Service was good and subs came out fast. I got the Italian sub on whole west. No combo but they do have that too. Great place to go if you are craving a sub and it's just walking distance to the LA Fitness next door if you want to go burn off the calories after."}
{"text":"We decided to enjoy a day on the west side and looked up a place to eat a good sub before heading to edgewater. We both ordered the Engineer, and LOVED it. Of course we added things to our taste like banana peppers and my boyfriend (the one with tastebuds that require a kick) had jalapeños added. I like the option for a small medium or large sub with the medium being 8 inches, which is great when my appetite wants more than a 6 inch sub."}
{"text":"I first got turned on to FHS when we had lunch catered here at work and fell in love right away.  I was a fan of Subway for a long time, like most people, but these FHS are much more tastier, it has to be the meat.  I haven't ate at Subway in 4 yrs now, nothing against them though, FHS are to die for."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad sandwich from here..never and I will continue to support the company and the firefighters.. I am a creature of habit so I order the same sandwich every time.. smoked turkey breast on wheat with all the fixings, except mayo..every place that I have been in, they have been super friendly and the service has been on point.  Always a fan"}
{"text":"This is a popular destination for my friend and I when we go out to eat. It is always a good sandwich. It's a step above subway I believe, in quality and service alike. And with that the price is a little bit higher, but not much. Super reasonable for a casual lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Note to franchise owner and franchise board when you guys say grill chicken I expect grill chicken not boiled chicken looks like it got the bird flu otherwise all your other sandwiches are great I love this place but I would love to be able to get a real piece of grilled chicken not no boiled chicken was really dissappointed"}
{"text":"Funny thing! I come in here all the time, but not after today! So, the last time I came I ordered a combo and forgot to grab my chips(guess I should've called)so today when I came in I let them know what happened with my chips the last time I was in and asked if it was okay to have a bag with my order this time!? Not too much to ask for right? Wrong! I was asked for proof that I forgot my chips!? Even with a receipt, what type of proof would it provide to confirm I forgot a bag of chips?? Anyway, I said no I don't but you have my word and I wouldn't be so petty as to lie about a small bag of chips (which I paid for with my order, last week). The girl looks at me and says no sorry I can't !!! Really? Greeeeat service and nice way to basically assume the customer is a liar! Definitely not coming back or eating firehouse anymore at all!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service each time I've come to this place.  Only gave 2 stars because I like firehouse and my subs are always good but I've never been greeted by employees here when I walk in. Will not return. Subway it is!"}
{"text":"They just put this Firehouse franchise in the building of what used to be Wendy's. Great place to grab a sub and chips. They have hot and cold subs, healthy options, soft delicious bread, and they're own signature soft drink \"Cherry Lime-ade\" which comes in Light and regular as well as sparkling or not. This is a franchise but of all of the things that could have replaced the Wendy's in this location, I love this option. Something for everyone, staff is friendly, and the place is super clean."}
{"text":"Very very good subs grear staff will go back to this location for sure thanknyou Fire subs."}
{"text":"Horrible service, waited over half and hour for my sandwich. Rude staff. Absolutely horrible experience. Def will not go back."}
{"text":"Firehouse subs best Subs no other is close as far as my taste. I always have a great sub here and at all the other locations that I have been to. Will continue to go to Firehouse and bring my friends."}
{"text":"Was not a good experience. My sandwich was very sloppily made. I asked for extra mayo and my sandwich was literally dripping with mayo. Everything was soaked in it. The roast beef was tasteless and wet. It was also just thrown on top of the sandwich. Ordering a sandwich for lunch you'd think its just not that complicated but apparently it is. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to grab a bite and Firehouse subs is in the same shopping center as my gym. I had the hook and ladder light and it was good but nothing special.  Maybe I'll try something different next time."}
{"text":"First time trying this firehouse subs place.  They have opened a new place  in my community. So I decided to give it a shot.  All of they're subs are hot subs. I had the meatball subs  With sweet and spicy  sauce. I was afraid that it was going to be too spicy for me. So I ask how it was made they told me about the sweet and spicy sauce and they top it off with red pepper flakes. So I told them to hold the red pepper flakes.  My sandwich came out perfect. To my liking. The staff is new and friendly. I hope they do well and they're here to stay. I will go back and try some of their others subs."}
{"text":"Do not visit this location. I ordered a sandwich to go, and when I arrive home and take the sandwich out of the bag it looks floppy and wet. I open the wrapper and the whole sandwich is completely soggy and falling apart and the tomatoes were squishy and old. I could not even eat half of it because it was just like mush bread and slimy meat. Never going there again."}
{"text":"This is my first time and this is a quality sub sandwich house, founded by firemen really, that's kinda cool. I had the steak and cheese $7.59. Sautéed sirloin steak, melted provolone, sautéed onions and bell peppers, mayo, and mustard. The sandwich was large with very tasty ingredients."}
{"text":"This was my mine and my boyfriend's first time here and we had a few questions on the menu. The cashier Kaycee made us feel like a huge inconvience and was less than friendly. I'm hoping it's not like this everytime, horrible first experience."}
{"text":"I was hungry for a sub sandwich so checked my yelp app for something closeby. Firehouse subs had a high rating and closeby. I decided to try them.   I walk in and was greeted by multiple employees. I start looking at the menu on the wall and Linda comes over and asks if this is my first time here. She explained the menu, how things work, what already comes on the sandwich, what could be an extra added on, different size sandwiches. She explained the rewards and how that worked too. She was SO friendly and amazing and helpful!   I ended up ordering the 8-inch tuna fully involved and it was SO delicious! As i was eating Linda came and checked on me to see how i was enjoying it.  The place was clean, great food, quick service, friendly staff. This place was awesome all around!! I will be back to try something else! Thanks and keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Just passing through and stopped at my new favorite sub house, yummy!  Great friendly staff, perfect toasted sandwich.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best warm subs in Champaign. You'll have to drop $7 for a sub and it's pretty darn delicious. You get a choice between white and wheat bread when ordering as well. Uh, thank you firemen for this."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I Ordered the steak and cheese footlong.  You get the same thing at subways.  What's the diff?  You pay twice as much too.  I'll stick to subways, maybe I shoulda tried some of the other more unique items instead.  You get more veggies at subways too."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!! If you're from the east coast, do NOT get their Italian sub without telling them to NOT heat up your sub! Who heats up an Italian sub! GROSS!   We had a sub par experience the 1st go round w the meatball parm and figured we'd give it a shot again.   Asked for NO tomato and almost seemed like they gave me extra... Also neither of our subs had cheese on them and my roll was mush!   So needless to say, we won't be back!   I usually use Yelp to RAVE about places but not this time!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great food... I always have the smoke turkey breast, fully envolved. Never disapointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Not sure it's worth the wait though. I like the quality sandwiches but why it takes 10 min to make a sandwich with 5 people working on the line is frustrating.  It's definitely not somewhere I can stop real quick for lunch."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to eat but one thing that stands out most is the team. Every time I come in the members always great me with expectation hospitality but more importantly they always remember my name.  My personal favorite is the Italian Sub but would also recommend the meat ball sub as well. The sub shop is a true \"get what you paid for\" as I feel when going to subway where I'm getting light meat and most likely fake beard. If you become a regular like myself I would strongly recommend downloading the firehouse subs app. You earn points to get free things like 12 in/8 in subs, double meat, salads or snacks.  Love it and if you have not tried it yet. Go!"}
{"text":"The inside looks interesting and their computerized drink machine has 100 flavors.  That was a good start.  It's like a huge drink iPod.  At 2pm, service was slow. I expect to wait 15 minutes during a lunch rush for a sandwich but not in a nearly empty place.   When I finally got the food, the corned beef sub on wheat was decent if not overwhelmingly good.  Definitely better than Subway but I can't expect them to compete with a local hoagie place. They load it up with mayo and cheese which satiates the part of the brain that enjoys saturated fat.  The steaming adds a nice touch to the overall texture.  The lineup of hot sauce bottles to choose from is a bonus.   The chili was Wendy's quality, which is to say it tasted fine but really isn't worth more than 99 cents. So for $3.89 it's far from a bargain. A little too watery for my tastes, though flavor-wise it wasn't bad.  It probably could have benefited from a combination of 5 of the hot sauces.    You have better choices in the shopping center to have a great sandwich. Dixie Picnic comes to mind  But this place is squarely in the \"not too bad\" category."}
{"text":"I'm not lazy, but at the same time, when we have get-together's, I'd rather spend my time with guests instead of the kitchen. I LOVE the selection I get from the catering menu - and the staff and owner, Michele - always make sure everything is perfect. (Besides, I'd never be able to make the variety of subs on the Firehouse menu!)  Thanx to Firehouse Subs on Nellis - we can finally enjoy our own parties!"}
{"text":"Came here because we wanted a relatively quick and easy dinner because kids. Anyways this place is such a disappointment.  First of. Kids combo is about $4.50. Very reasonable price for a hefty size sandwich, drink, dessert and fire hat.... cool. But what happened to the Rice Krispies and fire hat my child was suppose to get?   We ordered double meat on one of the sandwiches for six dollars more. Although I'm grateful for the huge insane amount of meat that made the sandwich super heavy. Oh well I got the protein count in.   Taste wise - definitely good. The bread is soft and doesn't take over the whole sandwich. If you squish it down a little you can take a bite of the whole sandwich. Flavors def match up. I had the engineer sandwich and it was great with the mushroom addition. You can't beat simple sandwiches with a twist. Always a soft spot for me to get sandwiches. Nothing overly exciting that I would go out of my way to always get these sandwiches."}
{"text":"#8 Engineer turkey and mushrooms; it is a great sandwich.  The bread makes or breaks a good deli.  Excellent white hoagie bread. I am a fan.  The kids sandwiches come with a rice krispy treat (used to be oreos) along with soda and chips.    The soda machine offers dozens of varieties.   So many flavors of Hi C for the kids.  Always a friendly staff.  Tables inside and out."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs makes me happy. Despite being a chain, they consistently serve good sandwiches, have great customer service, is clean, AND they donate to firefighters. I make a point of eating at FHSs at least once whenever I visit Arizona, it's great as a casual sit down. Even my picky husband is able to eat here, they make customizing your sandwiches very easy. Thanks FHSs! Support your local firefighters!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for my first visit, and I have to say I was impressed with the food.  Also, they have a selection of about 30 different hot sauces that are rated on a 1 - 10 scale for hotness.  I love hot sauce, so hot sauce selection alone warrants a good review from me.    Most of the subs are hot, which wasn't what I was expecting, but it turned out to be fine because they were DELICIOUS.  I had the Italian and the wife had a Turkey, Bacon Avocado.  Both were great and came with a pickle spear (another plus).   The place was clean and well decorated with the fireman related theme.    The only thing that keeps me from leaving a five star review was the aloof employees.  It wasn't busy, and they made my sandwiches in a timely manner (which takes slightly longer than your average Subway experience), but the 3 employees that were there were clearly bored and were having a somewhat inappropriate conversation as if I was not  there.  Nothing offensive, just not professional.    I will be back.  The two DELICIOUS eight inch subs were about $6 each after tax.    Very worth it for the quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"Really upset with my experience this evening. If you are intending on closing early change your hours. I arrive with a coworker for a quick chat and sandwich at 8:45 15 minutes before closing. After ordering and sitting down waiting to get our sandwiches she said we close at 9 so you guys can't eat here. I asked if we could sit on the patio she said no. Had I known we wouldn't be able to dine in I wouldn't of even ordered. The entire reason for my visit was to eat, donate my change to the fire department and chat with my coworker for a few minutes. At least my change when to a good cause because my sandwich that I took to go was cold and soggy by the time I got home to eat it."}
{"text":"Really good sub and not bad on price.  So far, I like this place more than Jersey Mike and Jimmy Johns, the sandwich was good, lightly toasted, soft bread and yummy.    I'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"Was trying to decide between 3 and 4 stars for this review, but gave them the benefit of the doubt based on how much my wife loves this place. Their sandwiches are pretty tasty, and the soda machine is awesome, but their service always seems to take about twice as long as I'd expect for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here. 1 sandwich was right. 1 sandwich was made on the wrong bread. 1 sandwich was made with cheese when I wrote no cheese. None of the sandwiches were very good. I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Subs...great tasting with plenty of meat and other toppings. Not like Subway. Where the only thing they offer are Hero bread varieties, 2 slices of some Oscar Meyer type lunch meat, a slice of a Kraft singles type cheese ...cut in half on a diagonal to simulate 2 slices of cheese instead of 1 & some crappy toppings!!"}
{"text":"I thought this would be a good experience. I ordered two sandwiches and a side of chili to go.   When I got home and started to eat the chili, the paper bowl fell apart at the bottom, burning my hand and dumping chili all over my rug as I ran to the sink to drop the bowl.   Waste of $3.99.   The sandwich I ate was soggy from the drive home and lacked any sort of veggies except for a tiny bit of lettuce. I had asked for the works, pickle, tomato, etc.  The staff was friendly and the shop was clean.   However, I feel this stop was a waste of $18.00.    I don't think I'll go back.   2 stars for the employees, otherwise it would have been lower."}
{"text":"UPDATING MY REVIEW after talking to Ed. The sub I had was a smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket. While I personally did not enjoy this sub firehouse didn't make any mistakes. It's just my personal taste. After a brief conversation with Ed I can say as a small business owner myself I'm very impressed with Ed's level of commitment to customer satisfaction.  That's something you just don't see anymore. Most large corporations and small businesses act like they are doing you a favor by allowing you to spend your money with them. I'll give Firehouse another shot."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches!  I haven't stepped into a Subway or Quiznos for ages...but when I crave a great sandwich at fast food prices, this is the solid choice.  The quality blows away the other guys, and the taste is amazing.  Portions are large, but most importantly, you get great bang for your buck.  Go for it!"}
{"text":"I won't be going back to this location. We got a to go order and found a very long hair in my sandwich. I called and spoke to the asst manager.  Instead of offering my money back for something completely inedible she offered for me to drive back and they would make me another sandwich. I don't think so. After something so unappetizing I wasnt quite feeling like another one."}
{"text":"Holy smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket, Batman!  Love this chain, this is a clean & friendly location.  They have the best kid menu options IMHO of any sub chain.  Someday I need to try the other subs, but I keep going for thay brisket."}
{"text":"The wife & I love the subs, the kids dig the grilled cheese & the plastic fire hats.  My 3yo thinks the red & white tiger on the painting is goofy & wonders why the Trojan h Native America dudes are partially naked.  The subs here aren't the cheapest, but they are delicious and they have some kids menu options unlike the awesome local chain in the area."}
{"text":"I LOVE Firehouse and have never had a bad experience at one. The service is so slow and terrible. Not sure what the problem is, we didn't have a complicated order. We've been waiting over 20 minutes for two sandwiches :("}
{"text":"Greeted by workers promptly, and they were patient as I looked over the menu (1st time here)   kids menu is super kid friendly (yummy grilled cheese) high chairs were clean too!   Tried Chicken Caesar Sandwich, (recommended by young man making sandwiches) it was a tad bit salty for me but was still a good sandwich! The bread was perfect.   & yummy cookies   Overall good place to relax and grab a sandwich."}
{"text":"The Italian Sub is great.  All subs come with a pickle.  Also, they give you the option to round up your change and donate to the public safety fund.  The locations also have the new Coke machines that are super awesome.  A medium sub + chips + a drink costs about $8.50 with tax depending on the sub you get."}
{"text":"First time here. Has to be the smallest sub ever. Tasty but with a name like Firehouse I expected something more hearty. Don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"The absolute meanest, strangest owner I've ever seen in an establishment. They had a broken bathroom door and when I exited the bathroom immediately slam shot knocking me forward hitting my elbow and arm. When I told the owner He told me to get the fuck out of his restaurant. All I was trying to do was warn him because a little kid literally could have been killed by that door.   I have spoken to many people that live around the area and they've had very bad experiences there as well."}
{"text":"Very average food at best I don't understand the mediocre popularity of this place. Unfortunately, the owner at this establishment is a very horrible man. I've been to other locations and met owners and they all agreed about his very bad temper and not easy to deal with."}
{"text":"Three strikes and your out......I love the bbq brisket when it's made right..But when they forget the bbq sauce it sucks..so then you ask for bbq sauce on the sandwich and extra on the side...you get none on the sandwich and a tablespoon on the side and its a Large Sandwiche...IT SUCKS..I'LL TAKE BY BUSINESS TO THUNDERBIRD ."}
{"text":"Out of all the Firehouse Subs in the valley that I have been to, this is the worst.  I have had many long waits there, but today was the last straw. I waited 45 minutes for my order, which was placed on-line and should have been done when I got there. After waiting 30 minutes, I asked the manager (I knew who she was from a previous visit) and she said they were bagging up my order. I still had to wait another 15 minutes, so obviously that was not true. An apology for taking so long would have been better than lying to my face."}
{"text":"I work right next door it's easy to walk right over and get lunch. When you walk in they all love to shout welcome. A little much sometimes. Everyone has always been super nice to me. The manager is very friendly. The food is very good. It's evil how good their sandwiches are."}
{"text":"This is not my local area, but it was the closest place to my sister's house and for the love of god I just wanted an ice cold sandwich! lol. The gentleman who rang up my order was so friendly, and so were the other staff there that day! I also didn't mention that I wanted my sandwich cold (I guess they automatically toast everything) so I let them know and they remade it for me, no problem at all.   The sandwich was deelish! Nice staff! Fresh ingredients! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The service here was great! Everyone behind the counter was very friendly and the service was quick. I tried the Italian sandwich (toasted) which was just OK, definitely wasn't a meal I'd be rushing to try again."}
{"text":"The Subs here are Fantastic. The Coke machine is unbelievable, I don't think I will ever go back to Subway again. The prices may be a dollar higher. But it is well worth it. Clean Bright, Friendly."}
{"text":"I previously gave a bad review only to reverse it on my next visit. The staff was very fast and friendly.  Our sub's came out in very good time and the quality was on point. Very positive experience here! Can't go wrong with the Turkey Bacon Ranch either!"}
{"text":"Ordering quick and easy. It's my first time here and the cashier helped me out just fine. Thanks Alliyah! She also smiled at me which helped me feel better. The store was clean and the price is decent. I like the atmosphere here, it's relaxed yet still has a firestorm decor. Happy with the service!!"}
{"text":"Always Great food and Great customer service!  It's nice that they have specials for car dealers on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great and I love the firefighter motif. I also love that they donate a portion of their revenue to a charity to help firefighters. They accidentally gave me the wrong take out order once but more than made up for it by giving me 4 free sub coupons when I realized I had the wrong sandwiches. The food is good and I love the vibe I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never eaten at a Firehouse Subs.  This is is such a cute chain.  We ordered the Hook and Ladder, Brisket and the meatball.  All 3 were amazing.  Best Meatball sandwich ever....!!! Top it off they have what I call the Majic Soda Machine... If you have never tried it, give it a chance.... you will never think about another sandwich place!"}
{"text":"Great greeting with great food.This location is usually extremely busy during lunchtime. I love the modern coke machine."}
{"text":"I have been to this location dozens of times and on this visit the service was downright horrible. No greetings to any customers. Kids on the line touching their face and hair.  At least 30% of the meat on my small sandwich was fat. I've never experienced such poor quality meat at any Firehouse and believe that it should not have been served. I was told that \"sometimes that just how the meat is.\"  I discussed the poor service and negative atmosphere with shift manager and received a quick unauthentic apology with no remedy.  I refuse to patronize businesses that don't appreciate their customers and provide quality service. I will not be returning up this location."}
{"text":"Great greeting followed by great service. Had 2 sandwiches, both tasted good. The place was clean, including the restrooms!"}
{"text":"Service, food and atmosphere are good. I eat here often for a quick lunch. Can't understand why there are only two stars. It's a nice and clean sub shop."}
{"text":"Bread couldn't be any fresher. So to for the ingredients. I had the #1 combo. It was delirious. The staff there is very friendly and helpful too!  I will be back for more."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door, we were instantly greeted by smiling, happy, nice employees! The service was impressive! Everyone seemed to be genuinely invested in my family's experience. The food was sooooo yummy! We all kept saying, \"I'm so full!\" as we would take another bite. The store was clean and so cool with the firemen memorabilia, that we ended up dining in instead of taking our food to go. The store was clean and well run. Excellent casual dining choice!"}
{"text":"I love the meatball subs at firehouse subs! The ambience and the Decore is great. Perfect family restaurant and I like that they support the firefighters and give the kids a glimpse of a fire house with a free hat!"}
{"text":"Love this firehouse subs location. Great food. Friendly staff. I always get my food to go and it's always great. Best meatball sub around."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Just sat in here waiting for an order to go for 40+ minutes. They apparently lost my order. Attention to detail is ridiculous, how do you lose an order?!? Finally an employee behind the counter noticed I was still waiting and I had to basically reorder my food. Very disappointed overall since I was in a hurry to actually get my food. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"There toaster broke the bread not toaster is like eating a sponge they should have not sold me  the food"}
{"text":"First item when there are three or more people in line waiting to order open another line. Many of us do not have an extra 10 or 15 minutes to stand behind someone who can't decide, can't work his credit card and argues over a phone coupon that is no good. The #4 was awful and that is being nice. Loaded and overloaded with some type of mayo that soaked through the bread and made the meat totally inedible. If I had the time to drive back and return it I would but at least none of us will go back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant caught my attention as soon as I entered Buckeye. I didn't know what to expect, plus I've never heard of this place nor did I look at the reviews prior to attending. I like the fact that the combos don't only consist of chips or cookies. The combos could come with soup, a brownie,  chips, cookies and two other items. The subs come out warm, which is not what i had expected...but it made the subs taste great!!!. The customer service was good and the restaurant was clean. I will come back."}
{"text":"I recently tried  firehouse subs....people were telling me how delicious the subs were...they kept going on and on about how soft their bread was...so I must say....the rumors were true to the fullest....absolutely a must have....delicious in everyway...I can't wait to go back...Ummmm"}
{"text":"An employee on her break was using a straw to shoot spit wads in dining area and messing with other employees working behind the counter.  I use to come here a lot.  They lost my business today.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"All employee here needs a good training. We ate her 2 days in a row and both days we have problems with our orders. Missing add ons and they don't ask if you have rewards to put in. They do serve good food but the service ain't that good. I think if they would do like subway do the toppings or add ons they will do better."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse! Each time I would come into this location the store manager would always be upbeat and attentive with your order. There were a couple of times when I came in for a fundraiser event and although they were busy they had consistent and quick customer service. Check-in for the student special and when you show your student ID you'll get a free drink. The top three subs that I usually order are Brisket and Cheddar Cheese, Firehouse Meatball, and Steak and Cheese subs. All three are delicious and savory and portioning is pretty enough to leave you satisfied. Depending on if they are busy and how staffed they are then you would get your food as quick as 10 minutes but it could take loner if there's like two of them working."}
{"text":"Firehouse always tastes good. I love the beef and cheddar brisket especially. A great sandwich joint."}
{"text":"Umm talk about accidental! Drove in looking for a quick port of subs was surprised to see it was FIREHOUSE SUBS. Lol coworker and I were in a hurry and neither of us had ever been here so we decided to take a chance and try something new. Let's talk about walking in to this place, I was greeted at the door by the person handing out people's trays. She didn't only greet us as we walked in but served those two trays gracefully. I should of gotten her name. . Then it didn't end there, let me start with what I ordered, small steak and cheese with mushrooms and jalapeños. Can I say I regret not getting a medium? Lol it was very filling don't get me wrong but it was so good I could go for more! As some of you know service is everything to me but this time it was a double win service and quality was received.  Oh did I mention I got a pickle slice lol! Another Win!   Translation Spanish   Ayyy que hablar de accidental, entre manejando busando un port of subs y me di una gran sorpresa cuando me di cuenta que era un FIREHOUSE SUBS.  Ha ha mi compañero y yo teníamos un poco de prisa así que aunque ninguno de los dos lo había comido antes decidimos intentarlo. Hay que hablar de el momento que entras al establecimiento. Me saludaron al entrar aparte de que la señorita hasta también entregando órdenes con mucho gusto. Sé que debí preguntarle por su nombre. esto no termino ahí, voy a empezar con lo que pedí yo, un cheese and steak sub con champiñones y jalapeños. Podría decir que me arrepiento no ver comprado un mediano y no porque me quede con hambre ese no fue el caso. Si no que estuvo muy bueno. Como algunos de ustedes saben el servicio es todo para mí, pero en esta ocasión gane y doble buen servicio y muy buena calidad.  Les mencioné que me dieron una rebanada de pepinillo en vinagre? Gane otra ves"}
{"text":"Good standard sandwiches and helpful staff.  The place seems clean and well maintained"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and they always get my order right, which is tough to find at a sandwich shop. Food is always good. Then again, I always get the same thing (turkey sandwich). Clean and comfortable. Recommended."}
{"text":"Some days, you just can't decide if you want Taco Bell, or if you want to try something new, like Firehouse Subs.    On those days, you let the fates decide:  Which one will we pass first, on the right side of the street?  Firehouse won this weekend, and I am SO glad that it did!  We've been wanting to try Firehouse for ages, but always seem to forget that its around.    The restaurant was clean, and the service was super polite.   They don't have a huge menu, but all of the sandwiches looked great.  I decided to try The Engineer, which is turkey breast, mushrooms, and swiss cheese.  I ordered it \"Fully Involved\" (mayo, lettuce, mustard, onion, pickle, hold the tomato on mine please!)  Fella had the New York Steamer with corned beef, brisket, Pastrami, mustard and dressing, with veggies added.   They have a hot sauce bar, where you can take little to go containers of hot sauce home with  you.    The drink machine is bad-ass, too, with a TON of different options, including cherry vanilla coke!    The sandwiches were great.  My 8 inch was very filling.  I have every intention of coming here more often, and trying everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Firehouse is one of my favorite sandwich shops! I have always gotten the Italian and have never regretten it. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Okay I really want to like this place and sometimes I do but last night we got subs and the bread was stale and they messed up my order no lettuce no tomato and the roast beef tasted off. I am almost ready to go back to Subway. Can you guys try and do better?"}
{"text":"Since I've moved here from the east coast last month I've yet to find a locally owned deli everything here seems to be a chain with your generic lunch sandwiches nothing creative turkey ham roast beef lettuce mayo... I thought I would give this place a try even though it's a chain and it was pretty good I got the sweet and spicy meatball. Meatballs were very good so was the sauce my only complaint is they advertise these hot toasted subs but my bread wasn't toasted at all... Even subway toasts the bread on meatball subs and subway is terrible.. For the food itself is 3 stars like I said good but just your average chain deli I added an extra star for the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff I will probably be back for the meatball sub but hopefully I can find a local deli around here"}
{"text":"My wife likes to go back to this sub shop over and over again.  The staff is very pleasant and helpful they customize sub sandwiches to have one of the cool drink dispensers.  The owner of the restaurant is usually around invisible comes out and talks to customers in the restaurant and ask for feedback.  The food is good!"}
{"text":"One morning at work minding my own business and doing work like a good worker that I am, my subordinate came to me and started to bug me about this Firehouse Subs place...and how he has coupons, and that we must go to this place for lunch.  And how it's like a bazillion times more better than any of the leading sub places.  I don't like subs much, so I said I ain't going.    I went to the copier to make copies and there my subordinate was, hogging the machine, and while I was waiting to use the machine he went on rambling on about how clean Firehouse Subs was, and how friendly and freaky fast they were.  I told him I'm not interested in subs.  I went to the loo to do my afternoon two like I normally do, one minute into nuking the toilet and like a scary movie I learnt my subordinate was in the stall next to me as he started to ramble about how Firehouse Subs quality is decent, and how their food was tasty and how we must go and that he'll pay for me with his dad's black coloured credit card.  I should of put on my poop shoes..  Shoes specifically for wearing to restrooms so you can't be identified.    I eventually broke down and we went to this Firehouse Subs, and you know what?  Everything he rambled on about all morning was true!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the staff is friendly, but there is too much socializing going on. We were the only people here when we ordered our food and when we sat down, a co-worker who was obviously buddies with the guy who took our order, walked in. At this point everyone working went to the employee area to chitchat with him and no one was making any of the food we ordered. Took around five minutes before anyone made any effort to prepare food. All the employees were really young and it did not appear there was any managerial type person around.  Other than this we really like eating here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure some people understand what the food handler gloves are for. If you're running the cash register wearing them you still need to change the gloves before handling food.  Also there seems to be a lack of supervision of newer employees.  Kids ahead of us ordering food were horsing around with cashier on their phones while customers were waiting to be helped.  The manager happened to be outside at the moment. We like the food but there is need for improvement here."}
{"text":"Firehouse is pretty good. I come here mainly for my man. But they are always nice and I ha e never had a bad sandwich. It does get pretty busy between 11:30 am - 1 pm, so if you are in a hurry avoid those times. I do love the beverage options :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to like the sub here but it just didnt taste good to me.  A big hot damp mess that sat in the bottom of my stomach afterwards like a zombie carcass at the bottom of a well. Nice service and decor though."}
{"text":"When I arrived at this location it was packed during lunch, at first I was a little annoyed because the menu was so hard to read as it was placed so far from the counter where you were supposed to place your order. But after finally reading the selections I saw they had a general selection of ham, turkey, roast beef, pepperoni, and meatball sandwiches; including veggie sandwiches as well.   I had the Firehouse Hero, it was a delicious combo of turkey, ham, and roast beef. The best part is the honey mustard sauce. Not to mention the wide selection of hot sauces available to add to your sandwich. What I liked most was that they delivered your meal right to your table(if you're eating in). And the to-go service seemed quick and easy. These sandwiches are a tad bit better than Subway sandwiches but not as good as Capriottis or Jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"I went back on a Saturday afternoon.  Even though it was much busier than my first visit, it took only 5 minutes for our food (I timed it)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Steamer. Amazing! Only thing I would've changed, a bit more meat. The meat kind of got lost in that wonderfully warm and pillowy roll. My daughter ordered the meatball sub. She groaned in pleasure with every bite."}
{"text":"Avoid the veggie sub pretty much just lettuce. Much more toppings at any other sub place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I asked for EXTRA pickeles I only got \"1\" asked for \"WHITE BREAD\" got \"Wheat\" soooo annoyed with this place."}
{"text":"I'm only leaving a good review because I love the food, but the staff at this location is horrible. They talk about personal things right in front of people who come in. Me and my boyfriend were eating here and they were yelling across the place. It was very odd I've never been anywhere where I've experienced this. It was very unprofessional. But over all the subs are good service sucks."}
{"text":"My sandwich, (#10 brisket) was good. The Service was great. But it it's Too expensive for what they offer in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow. Worst service EVER! Just drove 15mins to firehouse and as we went towards the door the punk ass employees inside locked it at 8:59. Pretty sure you're open until 9pm. I will go to subway next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hook & Ladder Light (turkey & ham) plain and got an order of chili to try/share. The chili was very good and the sandwich was really good and then I decided to try a spoonful of chili on my sandwich... It was amazing. I may always have to order chili with my subs going forward. That combination just made my day."}
{"text":"This Firehouse was busy! And it was between lunch and dinner so I was surprised. I got the Hook & Ladder Light, plain. They were out of unsweetened iced tea and I had to let them know. Took a little bit before the tea was ready and I could make my way back up to the drink station (lots of people), but it's always good food at Firehouse."}
{"text":"Delicious meatball sub! Got a large with split baskets to share with a friend. The white bread was toasty yet soft, the meatballs were hot, and the sauce was tasty as always. The tea was also good. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Tried Firehouse Subs for the first time and it was great! My friend and I ordered a large meatball sub on white to share and the girl at the register asked if we wanted split baskets. Yes, please! That sub was LEGIT. Big, yummy meatballs covered in tasty marinara sauce and melted cheese on a soft sub roll. Really good. And we each got a pickle too. The decor is fun with the firefighter theme and Dalmatian-spotted tables. The dining room was clean and the employees were friendly. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good subs love the smokehouse brisket can't get enough of that.  A little pricey but i think it's better than subway."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever at a Firehouse subs. I ordered 2 subs to go and the total was $20. I was not expecting to pay $6 for double turkey and $10 for a footlong! After 20 mins my subs were ready and I left the restaurant.  I went home and opened the subs. They were hot and mushy and gross. I was unaware that the subs would be hot and was very angry that the girl did not mention this to me when I ordered. I called to see if we could bring the subs back and get cold ones. The manager said no. He said all subs are hot unless you tell us otherwise. They were not friendly. Most places would redo your order and give you a fresh sandwich, but they did not. I will never go here again and I can't believe that the poor customer service."}
{"text":"Always go with the club on a sub. Tastes great. I'm here about once a week for my fast food night. Service is good. Order is always correct. Love the sweet tea."}
{"text":"Vegan option available which is must for me! My son had his favorite meatball sub looked gooey and he thoroughly enjoyed it!! I had toasted bread with mushrooms and vegetable sub with humous and avocado (tell them to hold the mayo and hold the cheese)  it was delicious !!"}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've had better\" sums up my experience at Firehouse Subs. I dined here to support a UNLV student organization fundraiser with my better half. To start with, the cashier was impatient with us and could have been much friendlier. This was our second time at a Firehouse Subs location and we're still trying to figure out the menu, pal.   VEGGIE SUB ($6.39): I added mushrooms (less than $1) and requested that my sub not come with any dressing or oil/vinegars. The cashier looked at me and sighed, \"Yeah. It only comes with that if you ask for it\". Okay...I get my sub and there it is. Whatever dressing/vinegar they put on these subs - it sucks. It makes the sub taste extremely bitter. No bueno. And no, I didn't ask them to fix it. I took two bites and then pushed my plate away in disappointment. I ended up going next door to Baja's Grill afterwards. 1/5   HOOK AND LADDER HOT SUB ($8.49): After a recommendation from the cashier, my husband ordered this popular sub. My husband loved it. At least one of us enjoyed our meal! 4/5  Worth a Return Visit? I will never order the veggie sub again! Which leaves me with 2 options: 1) a salad - nope 2) a grilled cheese kid's meal - maybe. I'm just really not of fan of bitter dressing and the grilled veggies inside the sub. As a vegetarian, I prefer sub places that offer a faux meat substitute (Subway and Capriotti's). Our total bill came to $19, and I feel like there are a million other places I could eat at for that price and be much happier. However, I have a feeling I'll be back for another fundraiser. I hope they let adults get kid's meals. Who knows? Maybe their grilled cheese will win me over.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #78"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Firehouse Subs Restaurant.  We went during the first month of this location's grand opening.  The place was packed but we were able to get our orders surprisingly quick. The cashier was really friendly too.   My husband loved his sirachi burger but I was disappointed with the veggie sub. The dressing used in the sub was a bit bitter to the taste. Portions are on the small side and prices ain't cheap either. The custom cola machine was cool though.    My husband is set on coming back but I would probably stick to Subway's veggie subs instead."}
{"text":"Glad to see that Firehouse Subs has made it to Surprise.  Located in the same area as Rita's Italian Ice and Buffalo Wild Wings with lots of available parking.  Lots of seating inside and out. The restaurant was very spacious, well lit, very clean and wasn't noisy.  Staff was extremely friendly, warm, welcoming, and came with genuine smiles!  They even made suggestions and recommendations.   The sandwich ordered tasted great - fresh with complemented ingredients, warmed to perfection and tasted great. They also have a variety of chips or soft baked cookies to choose from. Prices were comparable to other local sandwich competitors. One can also use their app to order prior to coming  though I haven't tried it yet.  Will most definitely return to sample some of their other sandwich varieties and options!"}
{"text":"So I just had an amazing experience here. When I was ordering the girl at the register (must've been new) overcharged me for the add-ons. Well not a minute later the manager caught the overcharge and came over to my table and gave me back the overage. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before and that in itself will bring me back here. The subs were amazing but the service, the service will bring me and my family back!! #veryhappycustomer"}
{"text":"Here's a first... the subs we took home didn't look anything like the ones on TV or on the online menu. That aside, they were pretty decent. I had the New York Steamer and the wife had the Philly Steak with mushrooms. Sadly, they forgot the mushrooms. For $20, it was a lot for two subs and a drink, but I might give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Subs were amazing and the customer service was awesome, just as I entered to the time I left, great customer service. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm am giving this restaurant 5 stars solely based on team leader Jennifer. I came in today to pick up subs for a lunch I was hosting. It was a little last minute for me BUT they had over 10 orders for me ready in less than 10 minutes.  I asked Jennifer to help me w/ allergy information, no eggs and no dairy. Jennifer took out the boxes for the bread and showed me the ingredient. She went above and beyond and specialized my sub to be completely vegan. She was so nice and patient and I appreciate that she didn't just answer questions based on if she \"thought\" the bread contained egg or dairy. I appreciate that so much.  I never ate my sandwich, because, there were a lot of chemicals in the dressings and the bread and everything else. I did however open it up and pick out the veggies, so, it was fine. Like I said, this review is based solely on Jennifer for going above and beyond w/ an amazing attitude.   Way to go Jennifer!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Firehouse twice in the last month and so I'll write one review for both trips.  On my first visit, I ordered the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket sub.  I sat down at a nearby empty table and then I heard my name called.  I picked up my sandwich and drove back to work.  I quickly proceeded to my desk and began the ritual.  I opened the wrapper, took a look at the cheesy goodness before me, and took my first bite.  The sub was still hot and it was tasty.  I can't say that I loved the BBQ sauce.  It was just okay.  The beef brisket was tasty, but I found myself wishing I had more.  Same went for the cheese...I wanted more.  I could've sprung for the larger sized sub, but that would've been too much food for one sitting.  Maybe if I pay the extra money for double meat?  This sandwich did not delight me.    However, there are many other sandwiches on the menu.  So on my second trip, I decided to go with the Italian.  This time, I ordered in with some co-workers and I got the combo.  As I was waiting for my sub, I picked up a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos (love!), and approached the interesting fountain drink dispenser.  This is the first time I have encountered such a device.  Apparently, there are over 120 soda combinations?  Cool, I thought!  So I proceeded to push the Hi-C button, at which time, about 10 new buttons appeared on the touch screen allowing me to select any combination of Hi-C flavors.  I kept it simple and chose the Orange Cream flavor.  I love Orange Cream anything!  I sat down and took a sip of the tasty beverage, just like Jules (Sam Jackson) in Pulp Fiction.  He was like, \"You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?\"  Only, I wasn't eating a Big Kahuna Burger.  No sir.  Instead, I was about to eat a tasty Italian sub from Firehouse!    The weird thing about this place is, once you place your order and give them your name, they ask you to go sit down.  Then, when your sub is done being assembled, they walk around the dining room shouting your name until someone (you) perks up and says, \"He is I and I am him!\"  And if you order with a group of friends, the subs arrive one at a time.  So you are reduced to sitting and watching your friends eat (at least a couple bites anyway).  Come on, we're guys...we don't wait for our guy friends to get their food before consuming mass quantities.  It is what it is.  Anyway, the Italian sub was very good.  It had tasty meat that was hot and it had melted cheese that was yummy, delicious even.  This Italian sub was much more satisfying to me than the Brisket sub of days past.  However, what this sub lacked was some peppers.  Most of the Italian subs that I've had have included some form of sweet or spicy peppers.  I'm sure I could've ordered them, but I assumed that they would be included in the baseline offering.  Guess not.  The Hi-C orange cream soda was delicious.  And while I usually don't drink pop, I drank a full monster-sized cup of it!  It was really good and much smoother than regular orange pop, which can give me heartburn.  Lots of cops in here because it's next door to the Mayfield po-po station.  I am told that the New York Steamer sub is great and it should be the next on my list to consume.  Maybe it will be!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:30PM. Crew had all of the lights turned off, chairs on tables, etc. Website says they close at 9PM so I'm not sure why they thought it was OK to close half an hour early. Hope mgt sees this feedback. Will try another night (if it's open)."}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Firehouse\" is what you hear echo as you walk in. If you aren't familiar with them they will happily give you the low down on what they do and how they do it.  Price is a bit higher than a 5 dollar footlong from Subway but the quality makes up for it. Their food is made with pride and their service is better than. Any sandwich place I've been before.  They certainly are a needed and welcomed addition to High Street since there is now something on the property for us working stiffs.  My wife and I came here the week they opened. I had the Italian.  With the exception of the ham being a bit too sweet for me, it was good. Toasted to perfection and juicy without being soggy.   My wife loved her club on a sub too.  The only let down was the Firehouse cherry limeade. It was all cherry and not much lime. We added lots of  limes to ours to help the flavor but it was still all cherry.  If I were to choose between here or Jimmy Johns, I would choose Firehouse every time. No contest."}
{"text":"It seems like there is a mile of differences here between how some people are treated and how others are treated. That might be a reflection of their location in image-conscious North Scottsdale, I don't know. Numerous reviews comment (both positively and negatively) on \"the greeting\" of every employee stopping what they're doing to yell out a welcome to each person who walks through the door. We visited on a weekday evening after the crowds had long gone. There was a small group of quiet well-mannered teens having dinner and one other diner. I had never heard of Firehouse Subs and only came in because their sign was so clearly visible from North Scottsdale Road in the new mall. I had an errand nearby and fast food subs sounded good.  Having never been to a Firehouse Subs I initially missed seeing the \"order here\" sign at a counter way at the back of the store so we stood at the tall counter where a guy was preparing a sandwich (I mean that's where the menu board is, logical that you would order there, right? Wrong!).  There was no acknowledgement of any kind from him or anyone else, certainly not the much-discussed yelled out greeting.  It was then that we started looking around for help and saw the \"order here\" sign and walked over to the counter, and it was only then that a woman approached us to take our order. The first thing I said to her is I had never been to a Firehouse Subs before and she recommended her favorite. I can't complain in any way about her competency or helpful friendliness, she came across as being sincere and she didn't sound like the typical bored fast food employee.  Firehouse Subs is not the place to go if you like to make 100 choices of condiments and breads like you would at Subway, and it's also not the place to go if you like restaurant employees intimidating you that you should have your sandwich \"Mike's Way\".  Thankfully you also don't have to do their work for them by writing your own order on your own bag. The reason is that they have a surprisingly limited menu selection for a fast food sub shop and very few variations of those sandwiches, all of which are served hot except tuna and chicken salad. From there you get two choices of bread and everything is made \"fully involved\" unless you specifically say otherwise.  After ordering we stood around and waited. Remember we were the only customers except for people who were already eating. The one (and only) sandwich maker reminded me of Kenny from the TV show \"The Middle\" in that he never looked up, never spoke, and seemed to be in a trance.  Considering that ours were the only sandwiches he was making it seemed to take an inordinately long time, it doesn't make sense that he had to wait until the order clerk finished taking our order before he even started making our sandwiches, couldn't she just shout out to him what to start?  The sandwiches are on the high end of the price scale but to be fair they have more meat and they do taste better than the other sub shops in the area. That's the plus side. On the negative side, by the time we got them home (10 minutes away) they were a soggy, soppy mess, literally impossible to pick up without it falling apart. Big suggestion to Firehouse Subs is to do something with your bread (which is pretty generic tasting) to make it crustier. As it is now it's almost like Wonder Bread.  Also, remember when I said that I told the clerk this was my first visit? Every other sub shop wants you to join their \"rewards club\" to get discounts and earn free sandwiches. I looked around and didn't see any promo materials and ended up forgetting to ask BUT the point is that she never offered anything like that to us and it wasn't until I Yelped it to write my review that I found out that they do have such a \"club\". Maybe she didn't want us to come back?  Oh and one more thing ... if you are going to make a point of including a pickle spear on the side, consider changing your source to something with more freshness, snap and flavor to it, otherwise don't bother. These taste like supermarket shelf pickles.  Rating \"A-OK\" which means I would come back for food quality and not-bad service but not for the prices or if I intended for my order to be to-go."}
{"text":"I'm officially hooked. The meatball and Italian subs are great.  The bread is soft and I could eat it dipped in marinara sans meatballs, yum!  I'm going to try half the subs on the menu, since they all look so good.   The firehouse theme is fun and incorporates local pics and firehouse gear.  They have plastic fireman hats for the little ones and the upgraded Coke machines with the fun flavors (e.g. Cherry Vanilla) that I love.   I do wish they had a better variety of spicy peppers (like Jimmy Johns), but they have tons of hot sauces to choose from.  Speaking of which, these are some awesome hot sauces and go from mild to kickin'."}
{"text":"Another great lunch! Service was excellent! Even though the restaurant was busy because of a soccer tournament, it was clean and the staff provided excellent customer service keeping the line moving, the food coming out hot just the way it was ordered, and the customers happy. Someone even brought our sandwiches to us and picked up our trash when we finished."}
{"text":"Been twice and both times wished i had passed by. Realy the worse cheese steak i ever had. Too many questions when you order and a tasteless sandwich when you are served. There will not be a third time."}
{"text":"I try to support firehouse subs when I can because i am a firefighter paramedic and firehouse subs supports us.  I am in Charlotte for a conference and FHS is close to my hotel. I skipped out from the conference today to get some dinner and veg in the hotel for awhile.  The store is located on the 2nd floor and I was greeted right away by two employees who were both very nice.  They were attentive to me and made me feel important to their business. I was waited On right away and my food was prepared fast and correctly. The store was clean. I didnt visit the restrooms so i can't speak to them.  Parking is limited but I think this store probably caters more to downtown workers, sports fans and hotel goers. I would definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"I wish there was a NEGATIVE star rating because i'll never eat at this place ever again. We drove by 15 minutes before close. Open sign still up, we pulled up & before we could even get out of the car the girl behind the counter double flipped us off. That's the service you get here & im never eating here again"}
{"text":"Today I had my first Firehouse sub and I must say it was delicious! When I walked into the establishment I told the worker behind the counter that it was my first time eating at Firehouse Subs. She was very helpful and explained to me how things worked around there. Everything on the menu looked delicious but I decided on the Italian sub and it was amazing! I was surprised to see that the place was very empty however."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Firehouse sub shop. Great customer service and the store was really clean. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Chopped Salad and it was very fresh and a great size for the price."}
{"text":"Good subs, friendly employees and fast service. The bread tastes very fresh and the sandwiches are pretty simple -- my wife and kids are 'holders' and they don't have to ask to have anything left off their subs here.  I've never been there when they have been crowded, so take that into account. A but pricey, but I'd go here over Subway or Port of Subs any time."}
{"text":"Excellent Subs!  Nice size dinning area with outside patio area.  My wife loves the Italian sandwich!"}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered my food which was taken by a young man who look like he didn't enjoy his job. I placed my order and he didn't say anything after I gave him my money. I didn't know whether to wait at the counter or have a seat. I decide to take a seat and they brought my sandwich out but no chips. The food was good but they should consider replacing the staff with a robot that can talk."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and was very good quality. Everything tasted great.  Make sure you get Get the cherry limeade."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly, subs are really good one of the better sub sandwich shops in the valley. Have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place needs more training on customer service.  There is no point in having an online order capability if they ignore customers who put in an online order.  There are 2 lines at the cashier counter, 1 for walk in orders and 1 for online orders.  I am the only person at the online order cashier and the walk in cashier continues to take 3 more orders from patrons that walked in after me.  I got no acknowledgement of I will be with you in a min..nothing.  Terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Great subs, great staff very friendly and helpful. Try to go several times a month. Food is great."}
{"text":"First visited Firehouse in Chandler and was super excited to see one open a few years ago closer to home. Sadly, I've have yet to be impressed with this location. I've tried a few times, going back grudgingly because I do love the subs. The staff may change but service never gets better. Last visit was worst of all."}
{"text":"My first time coming here was a few months ago, I always eat sub sandwiches for lunch from subway or jimmy johns or capriottis that's close by.. This place is by far the best sub shop around! I've been a huge fan of sub sandwiches since I was about 12, I always try different sub shops all the time but this place has the BEST, most flavorful sandwiches I've ever tried. The steak & cheese is my favorite, today I tried the club on the sub on wheat bread and the sandwich just had so much flavor, it has so much meat, and veggies! They forsure don't skip out on the meat or vegetables. I work across the street and always come here for my sandwiches, i refuse to go anywhere else now lol. I always tell my family & friends if they want to get me anything for Christmas or my birthday to get me a gift card for fire hours subs. I love the environment & the employees, they always greet me right away & are super friendly. I recommend this place to everyone who loves a good sandwich. Thanks for the great services & amazing fo"}
{"text":"Meats seem to have very little flavor. I got the Italian sub cold and all I could taste was the ham and the overly sweet Italian dressing. I pulled the pepperoni and the salami off separately to taste them. The the pepperoni was completely without flavor and the salami wasn't far behind. Tried my wife's roast beef and it was the same. Almost no flavor from the meat. For the price I'd expect better quality and flavor.  I will come back however if I ever feel the need to eat flavorless meat. In the mean time I will just go to Jimmie Johns!"}
{"text":"Staff is unable to follow directions printed on receipt they then had one female employee bad mouth me and swear she didnt put mayo on my sandwich you can clearly see it she says its ranch .... Ive been eating this sandwich all over the states since im traveling for work the management kept siding with her sayings ok while bad mouthing me ... Will never give them business again .... Period im calling the corporate office and franchise coordinator amd deal with this properly."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try a Firehouse Sub since they seem to be popping up everywhere and I pass by them pretty regularly. Finally did and I wasn't disappointed. Tried the pastrami and meatball subs and both were excellent. Will definitely be hitting them up again."}
{"text":"First time here today. Wow what a great experience. Food was amazing. Service was amazing and everything else is amazing!! I got the brisket sub. Best sub ever!!"}
{"text":"Terrible attitude from staff. If you want a ok sandwich but want to get pissed off, go here. I called in an order for 3 large sandwichs and one small sandwich, 3 bags of chips and 1 extra pickle. The bag is ready when I get there...great. Except for the extra pickle. Rather than put them is the bag, the dude just hands them to me. He says the bag is already stapled shut. I asked for another bag. I pay and leave. When I get home, the small \"steamer\" is not is the bag. No food for my little girl....so I call the restaurant and start driving back. The phones rings and rings the entire drive. It's only a mile away though. I walk into the restaurant with my phone and can hear it ringing at the counter. I tell him it's me on the phone and hang it up. He says he was busy and couldn't answer. Even though I walk right up with no wait. I showed him the receipt and explain that one sandwich wasn't in the bag. He says I'm lying and that he made the sandwich personally. I said that may be so but I don't have it and drove all the way just to get it. He then proceeded to make my sandwich but is pretty much an ass about it. I watched him the whole time because  he seems like the type who would spit in someone's food. Finally he calls my name and places the sandwich on the counter. No apologies, nothing. What he did get though is someone who won't go back to his sandwich shop and with repeat this story whenever possible."}
{"text":"I was just looking for a snack, it was either sprouts 3$ sandwich or firehouse subs, no other real choice. Look I haven't been to firehouse in a while, what is good on menu? Number 10 is real good, alright. You can get 12inches for extra 2.50, alright.  I thought I would just take half in a little bag. I couldn't get up and leave I eat the whole thing. It 10$ for sub like that is worth it.   I gave 4 stars because their soda machine was designed by Sarah Winchester"}
{"text":"It kinda reminded me of Arby's pressed meat sandwiches, just alot more pricey.  I ordered the brisket sandwich and it was hot and fresh but I'm just not into the pressed meat sandwich (although the BBQ sauce was really good). It just didn't taste anything like brisket to me and I had to ask for extra BBQ to cover up for it.  My daughter ordered some kind of a turkey sandwich which was quite a bit better but it was also pressed meat and not the real thing (but at least did taste like turkey).  The employees have such great attitudes and the atmosphere was very fun for kids as they pass out fire hats to the little ones.  My daughter did think it was alot better than subway so I would go back if she wanted to, but otherwise I'd skip it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is friendly, as they always greet you with a hello when you walk in.  I've never encountered a grumpy employee here.    The firehouse hero and the italian sub are two of my favorites.  However, my husband and I agree that we have never tried a sub we don't like from here.  They are all so warm and flavorful.    I appreciate that they have a healthy menu for carb conscious people like us.  I also get excited every time i find a place with a touch screen drink dispenser like this place does!  Fits my palate every time with its many options."}
{"text":"I ate at the firehouse sub in spring valley and enjoyed the service and food so I thought I'd try this one closer to my house.  No other customers were in the store and none of the workers appeared busy which I thought was good luck considering it was the dinner hour.  I ended you that was a mistake.  It took them 30 minutes to to make the sandwich I had ordered 'to go\" and they had not refilled the sweet tea so I missed out on my drink (I had to inform them it was empty promptly after paying I paid for my.  I never got the tea and they will never get me as a customer again!"}
{"text":"**Summary**       - Hot subs - Their hot subs are hot from the inside out. From their heated meats to the melting cheese, they're simply delicious.       - Drink Machine - They have one of those drink machines that let you mix sodas and flavor shots. It's quite novel if you haven't seen one before. **Ordered**       - Hook & Ladder - Turkey, ham, and cheese. This hot sandwich is definitely my favorite. It has the right combination of salty meats and melty cheese.       - Firehouse Meatball - This is definitley one of the best meatball subs I've had.       - Engineer - Turkey, cheese, and sauteed mushrooms. Unfortunately, the mushrooms are out of a can and ruined the taste of the sandwich for me. **Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice quality hot sub."}
{"text":"Another Subway at twice the price. The place is clean, subs are average, and the staff is friendly, but I fail to see why I would pay so much more than the Subway down the street."}
{"text":"Subs are overpriced but the worst is the young clueless staff. Before paying had to correct my order 4 times then they made it wrong anyways.  I could understand if it was just an item that was wrong but I had to continue to correct my order 4 times and was left with the feeling I would have to watch everything  they do to get it right. All with them having this juvenile giggling attitude. (Which isn't bad if they're doing their job correctly and you feel like they take $28 you spent on a meal over other options seriously)   I had to repeat the salad order three times then I noticed they rang it up charging me extra for salami when it was already included. So then another person comes over to help correct the mistakes and says oh you should've selected this salad for what he wants, she then asked me do you still want the other salad on the order ? (I never ordered another salad ) the guy at the cash register then proceeded to tell her it wasn't him that put that extra salad on the order it was you or it was already their, she said \"you put it on there you knucklehead,\" now when reading back the sandwich order (all that where standard)  it now somehow has no pickles, I said I never mentioned removing pickles. The salad was ordered with no cheese, luckily before driving off in my car I opened it up and sure enough it had cheese. I went back inside and had to wait for them to make it again. I'm not sure if it's age, maturity, training, lack of adult supervision or mixture of personalities but 2 standard sandwiches and a salad shouldn't be that hard to order and make. It definitely had the feeling that the real boss was not in and what they do is not that serious or important."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the New York Steamer sandwich, but when I went in today to place my order, I was distracted by the cashier inquiring about my adorable grand-daughter (who I was holding) and I guess I said Engineer instead of Steamer.  Imagine my disappointment when I peeled back the wrapper to reveal turkey and mushrooms instead of corned beef and pastrami.  Fighting back tears of defeat, I sunk my teeth into my tender regret.  You know, it was pretty good.  But next time I'll write down my order and just hand it to the cashier."}
{"text":"I was looking for a different lunch place and found this on Yelp. I have never been to a Firehouse Subs before. The staff was very helpful and they help me make the right choice. I chose the new brisket sandwich and let me tell you it was oh so good! Probably one of the best sandwiches I have had recently. I can't wait to return to this place. Yum all the way around.."}
{"text":"Okay, we are normal day to day folks living on a budget. My multi million dollar trust fund ran dry a few years ago due to my addiction to Pez. That's the back story. Last night my wife worked late and we decided to grab a fairly cheap dinner of sammich's from FIrehouse. Well BAD NEWS cowboys and cowgirls, it ain't cheap! Holy Schmoley! We travel in a pack of 4. Our kids are just getting to the point where if they like what they are eating, they hit the adult size portions, so we are getting used to slightly higher tabs when we eat out, but after 4 subs (3-12 inch subs and 1-8 inch sub) with chips and drinks, we were over $40 in the red! That's just too much for sandwiches.  The food is fine. Fairly tasty hot subs, tons of hot sauces and the nifty \"Make your own Coke\" machine is certainly fun for the kiddo's, but in the end we will NOT be swinging in to slide down the fire pole again. (We realized later that the whole fam-damly could have eaten at Golden Coral for less!)   Sorry Firehouse, your food is palatable but your prices burned us.  Eat well,  V-dub"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed tonight when I was told that I'd have to wait 30 minutes for them to make my sandwich.  No other customers were there and there was only one employee making food.  They said they had a big call in order."}
{"text":"So I must start off by saying Smokehouse Cheddar Brisket and the Hook & Ladder are amazing!!!! Those would definitely be the 2 sandwiches Id suggest to anyone that comes here. Yes they're a little bit more pricier by a few dollars compared to other sandwich places but the quality/taste makes it worth it. They also have those modern coke machines that lets you choose what ever soft drink you prefer which is a plus. They have a low cal menu option too. They don't work off of or accept tips. The background story of how this place first started is interesting in itself too."}
{"text":"The food was great,cooked just how I wanted, staff was excellent and soda machine is a plus"}
{"text":"So this time the food was much better but staffing was sub par.  Sunday night, there seemed to be a lot of employees but only one was making subs so the wait was a bit longer than expected. Maybe he lost a bet or something but why do the customers have to pay the bookie?  Yum! to the Firehouse Hero though."}
{"text":"It was my second visit to Firehouse, the first time it was one of those cases where we're on our way somewhere and needed a quick bite to eat, we were not disappointed. The subs are delicious with lots of flavor, toppings are plentiful and taste fresh. The rolls are yummy, soft on the inside and just a tad crusty on the outside. I've been turned off by Quiznos lately, they don't make em like they use to, they've gotten lazy, and I've tried different locations and it didn't make a difference. I'll still go to Subway for convienence sake only...they are everywhere. I still adore Capriottis, I'm from the east coast and this is as close as you can get out here to a \"hoagie\" that I've experienced (hate the cheesesteaks though).  Never liked PortaSub. So we tried the Hook and Ladder and the Turkey Bacon ranch...both were delicious, you get a pickle on the side and they have a hot sauce bar if you wish to spice things up. If you decide to share a sub with someone, they will cut it for you and put it in seperate baskets...its the little things that edge them up the ladder, get it Ladder, cuz its a firehouse. LOL. They recently opened one near home, so I will definitely try that location soon."}
{"text":"Killer subs! New York Steamer was full of win. Get it double toasted for sure. Double meat not necessary!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best sandwich place ever! They offer cold and hot sub sandwiches. My favorite sub and I highly recommend is the smokehouse cheddar brisket, so full of flavor.  Add a bit of the Captain Sorensen's Datil hot pepper sauce and oh emm gee it's completely amazing! It gives a little kick to your sandwich for you spicy tooths! So my preference is their hot sub sandwiches. If your more health conscious then cold subs are for you!  Don't forget to add a cookie or brownie... mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"A little less food than Subway for a little higher price--and worth it because it's better quality.  The massive dining room was deserted--just me; I think they do mainly take-out. Odd thing to note: the employees all mutter some weird incantation in unison whenever someone enters. It's spooky. It can't be English--possibly Aramaic. I think a retired demonologist and some dusty ancient tomes could shed some light on the matter. Service was friendly once the Summoning was complete.  The atmosphere is the interesting thing here. Grungy used firefighting equipment on the walls, lots of red trim, and faux dog-hide table tops. (Seriously. Like they skinned a Dalmatian.) A step up from fast-food ambience... except for the lighting. Unpleasantly super bright! Normally, that amount of light from above means you're about to get probed."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best sandwich joint in the area!  Had the Firehouse Brisket sandwich, it was amazing.  My friend had the HookNLadder and look great and she said the taste is one of the she had ever had!  Only problem we in counter the three times we have been here is the young lady working the counter taking orders has blow our order each time.  If your in line make sure you read the servers name tag and try to stay away from Sujey three times she blown our order.  Once we get our food it's a amazing, but ordering it's a crapshoot.  Ps:  I get the impression that Firehouse Subs don't check Yep...."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly and subs were great.  Love the \"Red Pepper' souce.  I would recomend Firehouse Subs every time."}
{"text":"You have got to try this place. Every sandwich looks delicious. However I have the light version of the hook and ladder for under 500 cal and it was extremely flavorful, toasted, and all-around extremely yummy. I've been eating there once a week I love it!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service could be a bit better. I found the the preparation of the food took longer than typical at Firehouse and the workers seemed a bit pre-occupied. I believe I waited about 15-20 minutes for my food. However, this location appears new, so they're probably working out the kinks as they get going."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Firehouse Subs from some friends, so I ordered a Club sub combo for lunch. I was starving and all the menu items sounded so good.  I was totally impressed with the price of a combo. $12 for a medium sub, a drink, and a snack. I thought I was going to get a smaller sandwich than I did, and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my sub was PACKED with delicious smoked turkey breast and honey ham. Tons! The veggies were fresh and crispy, the bacon was cooked perfectly, and the sauce inside was the perfect finish.  After that sub, I don't think I'll ever be satisfied with Subway ever again. This is definitely the place to go for an amazing sub and the price is pretty much the same as any other sandwich spot. You will NOT leave here hungry. Thanks for a delicious lunch! Time for a nap... major food coma."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fast service. Friendly staff. Clean location. Great lunch staff: Anthony, Mindy, Chris. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Meh is the best way to describe Firehouse Subs. Several years ago this was a place I went often and then not so much recently, but we stopped in last week and had a disappointing experience. The soda machine seems to be broken all the time, because the employees were not surprised at all when I said that the machine showed it was out of all but three or four sodas. They had to reset the machine which took several minutes. I can't tell if Coke is just being cheap and making them stick with this junk machine or if maybe Firehouse is the cheap one and won't replace it. Either way, inconvenient for the customer and certainly irritating for the employee. The subs were just meh and previously had been very good, so maybe we hit an off night, but it will be a long time before we go back, based on our mediocre experience."}
{"text":"The Malibu didn't take me to Malibu it took me back to elementary school where we would have pre wrapped sandwiches. The bread was very plain and the vegetables weren't so fresh. I can honestly say I've made better sandwiches at home. Will I be back to this place? Maybe not. But if you do go, try something besides the Malibu, and let me know where your sandwich takes you."}
{"text":"Love there subs...Drive all the way from the other side....Cashier is awesome...great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT !!   This was my first visit to a Firehouse Subs and I doubt I will ever go to a Subway again.  This is actually REAL meat and REAL cheese with GREAT customer service.  Dylan realized quickly, and confirmed by asking, that it was my first visit and took extra time to explain the sandwiches, the menu, and the condiments.    I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich and will be back for sure!  Friendly employees all the way around !!"}
{"text":"Meatball sub = awesomeness.  Large size is indeed large.  Service was prompt.  Like the decor, especially the mural."}
{"text":"I've given this chain sandwich shop three chances to see if they stand out from other sandwich places and they don't. The decor is nice and it's founded by firemen and they help their community and they bake their sandwiches and all of that is nice. But their sandwiches aren't good. Having a ham sandwich with warm lettuce is gross. Having left over bread because they put a small amount of meat is frustrating. After three chances this place is on my Never Again list."}
{"text":"Dear Durango & Warm Springs FireHouse Subs Owner  You take orders and call customers by their 1st names yet you only do veterans discounts for people in uniform...  I understand that not everyone does military/vet discounts and don't really expect it but the \"only in uniform\" stipulation made me think of all those I served with that may frequent your establishment with their families and not get the discount cause they are not in uniform.  A Fire Fighter certainly doesn't stop being a firefighter out of uniform, I doubt he or she would just walk by a burning house.  So how does it make sense to say a military member only gets the military discount when in uniform...the military member is on call 24/7....   In short, change your silly rule and honor our choice to serve the same as you do for the name your establishment carries"}
{"text":"So the food is good, they have yummy cookies, sweet tea, and a good chip selection. This location is clean, but the staff is lack luster - not my usual Firehouse experience. Service is slow at both the register and at the sandwich station.   I would eat lunch here a bunch, but not up to the level of service that I have experienced at the other locations from Arkansas to Washington."}
{"text":"If I pay $10.50 for a sandwich I expect for everything I asked to be on the sandwich on the freaking sandwich. Stopped by on my way to work got to work and nothing I asked to be on my sandwich was on the sandwich there wasn't even bacon on it and I ordered a club! I called they told me I had to bring the sandwich back I told them I was in Scottsdale because that's where I work would be happy to take pictures and bring receipt. Well that wasn't goi g to work for them they needed the sandwich by the end of the day. Well I guess I paid 10.50 for a $5.00 sandwich back to jersey mikes I go. Smh."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a great sandwich shop besides the typical subway/jimmy johns. So I decided to give this place a try for the first time. I typically eat cold sandwiches so this time I chose to do the bbq sandwich. It was pretty good, the meat was saucy and the bread was fresh. I wish I would have chosen a cold cut sandwich if I'm completely honest I guess that's just my preference. The seating area is actually really big which I was surprised. It didn't feel cramped at all. The decor.... Can you guess? lol fire house type Decor.... I guess the question you all want to know is will I be coming back here? I think I might just to try out there cold cut sandwiches. Over all great place, a bit pricey but what sandwich shop isn't? I'll have to write a second review for next time!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwhiches which are not toasted but hot. They are hq in georgia and i had the no. 1 with sun chips. The 1 had turkey and ham with cheese and fixings plus the soda machine was awesome here they allow you to pick ur drink and add a flavor i got lemoande and raspberry flavoring. Definately going baxk"}
{"text":"First time eating here and tried the siracha roast beef sandwich. Super good. Not too heavy and just right. Definitely a good recommendation."}
{"text":"It's a less guilty sub experience than Penn Station.  You can splurge a little because you're not even going to have the option of delicious grease covered french fried potatoes.    The soda pop fountain is totally futuristic.  You can add different flavors to any of your drinks and they even have 'recipe ideas' for you.  That was what made me most excited.    The employees unanimously greet each customer as they walk in, however it is a bit intimidating and sounds a bit forced.  \"Welcome to Firehouse Subs\" in your most monotone voice.  Sometimes, less is more.  The food was good, and I'd like someone to survive in this location.  Go there-it's a good quick lunch in a not so crazy parking lot."}
{"text":"My family had lunch at Firehouse Subs today for the first time.  They were very good and we will be returning.  My son said the Meatball Sub was the best he had ever had. I had the Steak and Cheese, the sandwich was really excellent. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Well came another time after the first visit at this location was terrible and I really hoped it would be better this time around. When I first park and walk up you have an employee sitting on the chairs smoking a cigarette right outside the doors. Off to a poor start, walk in and again no enthusiasm at all. Young man takes my order wearing gloves and goes back to making food with same gloves(gross). Got it to go as I was working and ordered the beef n Cheddar. First bite was great till I noticed not a drop of BBQ sauce. Had a $15 order and the sandwich was dry aside from the ends of the sandwich with mayo. Really wanted to get impressed after the first visit but found my initial opinion to still be correct. Even though you are less than 5 mins away from my work I will never come back and will recommend others to do the same."}
{"text":"This FIREHOUSE location is outstanding.  Although there was a bit of miscommunication regarding the ingredients on my sandwich...promptly \"Ginger\" (store Mgr.)very politely & willingly \"fixed\" the error.  She redeemed the unfair reputation that I, and many others have chosen to avoid \"fast food\" or carryout restaurants. KUDOS to superb customer service (and of course)... delicious sandwichs.  Thanks again for EXCELLENT customer service."}
{"text":"We go here often after church. There salads are wonderful, always fresh and for the most part are quick. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I decided to head over to the Epicentre and try out Firehouse Subs for lunch.  I went around 11:30ish and the place was packed.  The line to order your sandwich had about 4 or 5 people in it ahead of me, but they had 3 registers going so it moved quickly.  I had just the right amount of time to check out their menu board and figure out which sandwich to order.  I ordered the #9 Combo, the Firehouse Hero.  The combo is sandwich with chips & drink which came to $8.94 which is pretty pricey.  The Firehouse Hero has  roast beef, smoked turkey breast, honey ham, and melted provolone.  You can get it \"Fully Involved\" which is mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a dill spear on the side.  I got my drink and sat down to wait for my sandwich.  I didn't time it, but it probably took about 5 minutes to get my sandwich.  Which to me seemed a long time.  But, I was able to order immediately and get my drink so I didn't have to stand in line while they made my sandwich.  The sandwich was hot and the provolone was melted across the top.  The meats were juicy and tasty.  Overall a pretty good sandwich.   If there weren't other sandwich shops I would probably go here, but $9 for a sandwich, chips and drink is just to high when you can go to Subway or Quiznos and get about the same thing for less money.   Firehouse just isn't that much better than either to justify the premium price for its sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to this sub sandwich shop for a while. I like any type sub, be it toasted or not, so when we finally stopped by, I was ready to try one of these great sandwiches I had been hearing about.   We were greeted by everyone in the place, it seemed they all shouted out a welcome, but it was crowded and didn't like crawling over all the patrons, tables and chairs just to get to the counter to place my order. I guess going at a busy time for such a small place wasn't that bright.   Once I looked over the menu, I decided on the Smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket. It's stuffed with beef brisket that's been smoked for 10hours and covered with melted cheddar cheese. There is a sweat savory BBQ flavored sauce smothered on top a toasted bun.   The \"beef brisket\" isn't what I thought it would be, it turned out to be more like a slow cooked roast sliced thinly and covered with cheese and BBQ sauce. I know brisket and this wasn't what I expected. It was good and in a pinch I would eat it again. But all the hype I have been hearing left me not sure what it was all about."}
{"text":"My first experience with a firehouse sub wasn't so pleasant, so when this one popped up in the neighborhood, it took a while to go in and try it again.  What a surprise, it was actually good!  I got the Turkey Bacon Ranch.  It has smoked turkey breast, bacon, and sharp cheddar cheese with peppercorn ranch to finish it off.  The bread was fresh, the turkey was moist and tender, and the bacon crisp.  I was very happy with my sandwich.    Service is not bad, they make it when you order, serve it when it's ready, and you self serve your own drink, the place is clean and is more spread out than my first experience, so I didn't feel I was sitting someone else's lap.  With this experience, I will be glad to go back."}
{"text":"Customer service was great and the barbecue sandwich is my favorite!! It was delicious and cooked fresh! I love when my order is perfect with no flaws and made just to my liking. Big thanks to Kristina !"}
{"text":"Sorry to write a downer..  I ordered the Club sandwich fully involved (without the spicy mustard and onions), it was warm and drippy.. Warm is good, taste is good.. all good so far.. but the Drips from mayo :(, ugh i dont want wet spots on my slacks from lunch.    I also felt queasy afterwards, couldnt get the sub i had off my mind..   Ive had Firehouse sub in Florida years ago, it was fine. Maybe it's this location?  BTW i ordered online and i arrived a minute early from the expected time and my sub was ready, that was cool.    Subway seemed to be better?  maybe next time ill try a different sub and ask them to lay off on the mayo to prevent drips..i'll also ask around for favorite subs from firehouse.. maybe the club wasnt their specialty..   I felt like i was in a little firehouse with a lot of patrons.. :)"}
{"text":"Oh yeah!!! Getting my grub on at tasty 'ole Firehouse subs!!!  If you like sandwiches and you like um toasted then you can't go wrong here. Myself of course get a veggie sub and usually they go extra hard on the veggies and such for me since I'm minus the meat and dairy. Today they did my sub deluxe justice with the topping. Oooooeeee deliciousness and tastyness overload. Get on in here and get your grub on!! Wide variety and selection of subs and salads definitely something for everyone. Plus they have a bad as soda machine that you can customize your drink a gazillion different ways so be ready to get your weird on with the flavor combos. After you meal grab a cookie or brownie to really do yourself proper.    The dining area is open wide, clean and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.   Today's visit gets a \"oh hell yeah\"!! Get in and munch one up for yourself."}
{"text":"Always great. Very consistent in service and food quality. Always will go back."}
{"text":"its a shame I work so much I have to take out all the time. I ordered the Italian sub meal,and ask for no mayo and no mustard,they did that right forgot the cheese. have the bread was soaked with Italian dressing, the other half smelled stale,and hard. When they called my name, the Spanish Girl'ssss, were very rude to me. This location was my first and last. they are over rated. I'll stick with Capriotti's"}
{"text":"So anyways been here a few times....meh it's ok (could be better).  Last few times we went for some reason the sandwiches just came out so soggy.  This most recent time we got the steamer and a steak n cheese. It wasn't bad but it didn't seem fresh. Hate to compare but port a subs actually is fresher IMHO.  Real reason we go here is the coke machine.....saw other reviews and saw the post about the hair....disgusting!!! It hasn't happened to me so we'd prob go back if we really were desperate for a sub but I wouldn't rush back here for a sandwich. I'd much rather travel a little further to Jones for a port a sub."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly, welcoming service. However, their delivery speed is very slow. I have been to this location twice to order a medium turkey sub on white bread and it took over 10 minutes to get my order despite the restaurant not being very busy. I understand the restaurant just opened on December 7 and that they might still be working on training and kinks. However, I do hope that the delivery speed improves and I can change my review....otherwise I simply will not be a frequent customer. Kudos on the quality of the sub itself though."}
{"text":"Since I noticed yesterday that I have 30 check-in's at this particular location, I figure it was worth a review update.    I have 30 check-in's because everything I wrote in the first review still holds true.  The quality of the meats, cheeses, bread and how they put it all together remains high!  I've zeroed in on my favorite sandwich, the Engine Company, no onion, no tomato, add Italian dressing.  Perfecto!  That sandwich no longer exists on the big board but, they still make the roast beef and turkey delight.  This location in Huntersville is well managed and the staff is very friendly and quick with the customary, Welcome to FIrehouse when you walk in the door."}
{"text":"This review speaks to pretty much any Firehouse I've ever been to no matter the city or state. The staff is generally nice and always enthusiastic, \"Welcome to Firehouse!\". They use quality meats in their sandwiches and the bread works well with how they do a sub (toasted and then loaded with steamed meat and cheese, then dressed). That being said, you better like a hot sub or Firehouse is not really for you. I just like subs period. Hot, cold, whatever.... I'm stuffing them in my face and enjoying the heck out of them!   My two favorites are the New York Steamer which is corned beef, pastrami, cheese, Italian dressing and mayo/mustard and, the Engine Company which seems to not be on the menu board anymore but is still available if you ask. roast beef, turkey, cheese and whatever fixings you want from their list.   The only location where I've ever had a problem is the one at the EpiCentre. 3 visits to get a sub to go for lunch and 2 of those times I got back to my desk only to unwrap something other than what I ordered.  Definitely not enough to sour me overall however."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly! Subs are really great, my favorite is the turkey, ranch, bacon-but they have a lot of sub options! It was too busy when I was there, so we got our food fast. Store was clean and I would recommend this place! They have hot and cold subs, options with low calories and salads."}
{"text":"The #10 is amazing!  Only sub I've tried from there, but why ruin a good thing right?! Frequently visit this place when I am craving a good brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE  Go try it for yourself, you cant go wrong with ANY of the sandwiches and they have a cool soda dispenser there, you can add flavors to your soda, its a bit confusing at first but you have to be smarter than the machine."}
{"text":"We really like the sandwiches and the snappy sauce they have to go with them. I think the prices are a little high for what you're getting but it's a national chain and that won't change.  You need an engineering degree from MIT for the fountain machine :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly, pretty quick making our order, and the sandwiches were delicious to boot! Definitely recommend this location after our lunch experience today."}
{"text":"Popped in to grab a few subs. I had the Hero and I can't remember the turkey sandwich the wifey had but both were excellent. Friendly service and good food but they could stand to speed up the time it takes to make the sandwiches. About 10 minutes to make 2 sandwiches so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Thank god for somewhere being open till a decent hour (10pm) on a Saturday night in the far east valley.  This strange sub shop in the Dana Park area was better than I hoped.  I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak (which they call a \"steak & cheese\") not expecting a whole lot but still having visions of the amazing cheese steak sliders from District.  The whole process took a bit longer than I expected since there were 5 guys behind the counter and we were the only ones there but it was still quicker than any Mr Goodcents I've ever been to.  The sandwich was a lot smaller than I expected.  The bread is similar in girth to a hotdog bun only longer.  They crammed a decent amount of meat and cheese in there to make a pretty good value.  I would have been happy if it had come toasted or baked but instead they gave it to me steamed.  Why anyone would want their bread steamed is beyond me.  It makes it soggy and spongy.  Really, it ruined what would have been a great sandwich.  If you are feeling adventurous, or you like steamed bread, then go check this place out.  Otherwise, maybe just ask them to microwave it."}
{"text":"Very disappointing we have had great service and great food in the past but today may have put us over the top soggy bread, rubber sounding green peppers, and tough meat.  Hope this review helps them improve"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. My Italian was kinda bland. Not sure what was missing but it needed something. Otherwise everything was great."}
{"text":"My husband is a disabled veteran in a wheelchair, won't give a military discount because he isn't active, really? Employees expressed only active military is supported.  Thanks for supporting active duty veteran but please reconsider ones who sacrificed."}
{"text":"Love the lighter fare Hook n' Ladder sandwich! It's delicious and the people at this location have always been friendly. This is definitely my \"go-to\" sandwich shop."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. The ingredients seem fresh. I would probably compare them to Quiznos (maybe a little better).  The service is average. The prices are a little higher than normal.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Just an average sub shop."}
{"text":"The food is always tasty and the staff is always friendly at this location.  You can't go wrong with any sub at firehouse"}
{"text":"Its worth a try if you like subs. Typical fast food. Sometimes the teenies that work here can be little jerks, but it's typically a good experience and great pickles!!"}
{"text":"Was passing through and never had Firehouse before so gave it a try. Ordered the Italian and it was pretty damn tasty. I liked it and would go back again. I wanted it cut into thirds but I wanted to eat a third there and the other two wrapped to go and they accommodated me."}
{"text":"I seem to agree with some that the sandwiches are great but the service can be off-putting.  Every time I order they always want to make sure I'm ok with what comes on it \" so you're ok with the honey mustard then?\"  Or this one - \"Would you like to donate to a charity?\"  Stop asking me questions, let me slide my card, and start making the sandwich I ordered please.  One other mild nuisance (they add up!) is that sometimes you need a key to use the restroom and sometimes you don't.  Huge bonus IMO are the pickles they serve with your sandwich, very tasty."}
{"text":"Great food! The mobile app works great now for advance orders. The flaw is the restaurant was designed by a moron. It's hard to get in the place and harder to get out without brushing up against people trying to eat at tables that block everywhere."}
{"text":"Good food and cool decorations.   Got my son a 5 gallon red bucket for $2 and proceeds go to hell firefighters.   Love the hot sauce selection."}
{"text":"I went to Firehouse Subs not too terribly long ago.  Readers well know my affinity for sandwiches, and this place....  Oh, this place.  Really friendly service, nice, open area, and a lot of sandwich options.  But one of them really stuck out to me and called my name:  The smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  Wow.  I rarely describe the standard sandwich as \"savory\", but this one was so full of flavor that I actually mourned its loss upon completion.  It was truly a sandwich that was so good, that nothing needed to be added or taken away.  And all of this, of course, came at a reasonable price.  They even had one of those Mega Coke dispensers.  The ones that have what feels like 100 different varieties of sodas in a single machine.  I went crazy and sampled a few unique drinks while I was there.  Orange Coke?  Not so bad.  While I will definitely return to this place, it may be hard pressed for me to try another sandwich after this one (unless someone can offer another  recommendation).  As for my recommendation?  The smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  You're welcome, as you punch that ticket to \"Sammich Heaven\" (which is a real place, by the way, and is just like regular Heaven.  But with sammiches)."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is as good as a chain sub shop can be for kids. It's not just the four Kids' Combos (meatball, turkey & provolone, ham & provolone, grilled cheddar cheese) priced at just $3.99. It's that they include a drink, dessert AND FIRE HAT!!!   First ate at a Firehouse Subs several years ago while visiting Durham, North Carolina. I had never heard of Firehouse and loved the hot subs and the vast array of sauces they had on hand. Believe it or not, Firehouse was the first restaurant in which I ever had Sriracha sauce!  So happy to see that Firehouse's rapid expansion has not undermined their appeal. The employees at this location are fast and friendly. Even gladly changed a television channel for us."}
{"text":"Whoot! SUBS! I love sandwiches. I love bread. I'm a fatty. They have an awesome veggie sub here full of delicious tomatoes, onions, peppers, olives, and mushrooms! Yeah and lettuce and that stuff, but MUSHROOMS! They usually put mayo on it with oils, but I opt out of that, just doesn't seem necessary to me. Not only do they have really great bread too (gah! so good!) but they give you a pickle! PICKLES! Any place that just hands you a pickle with your food is alright with me."}
{"text":"My friend ordered me the Veggie sub for lunch, knowing I'd never had them before. They are a little more than Subway, but you can taste the difference in the quality of the produce. Their bread is much better, very tasty and you can actually TASTE the tomato. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was a great compliment. All for around 7$, plus a pickle slice! Yay pickles! I want to come back and try some other things now, and get my boyfriend to have one!"}
{"text":"This particular Firehouse Sub's is located inside Concord Mills Mall. However, I was so happy there was not a line. It was pretty easy to decide what I want - and I believe all of their subs are served hot (unless requested cold). The bread was really fresh and tasty, just the right thickness and airiness. They had an abundance of sauces to add to your sub - like, seriously, a crap-ton of sauces from all over the world (Sriracha, Mexican sauces, BBQ, etc.). I was really craving a subway sandwich, but this was the next best option.   Despite my skepticism, this was REALLY good! I would go back. Lastly, I want to close out my reivew with a really unique, and charitable, requst they make. So... as you might guess by the name, it withas founded In the 90's by two brothers (I think) who were firemen, and firehouse 'chefs.' They opened a restaurant and the chain took off.  In keeping with their roots, they ask you if you want to \"ROUND UP\" to donate to first responders! I love this. Rather than asking if you want to donate $1, $5, etc-dollars to a charity, they simply ask if you want to round up your amount to the next dollar. I like this because I imagine a lot of people say \"sure!\", and I imagine it adds up. Very clever! #CharityIsSexy"}
{"text":"Second time at a Firehouse sub shop. This place is great. Fast and delicious. The beef brisket with bbq sauce n cheddar is off the hook. Can't miss here. Wish they would come to California especially Sonoma county."}
{"text":"Delicious subs definitely growing fast. Expanded their menu now including sandwiches as well served on whole wheat buns which is definetly a plus for maintaining good health. Very pleasant employees at every location ive been to. Place is quiet and homey. Not many choices for vegans though. Nice and simple & quick service is always a pleasure. We watched a bowling tournament on tv while we were eating which we enjoyed rather then watching something usual that's on every other tv in a business you walk into. Walking distance from our place in a convenient location. Also loved that the bathroom has a motion soap and papertowel which really helps control spreading germs. Definitely not the first or the last time. Ill always support firemen, my dad hopes I carry on the family legacy and become 4th generation!"}
{"text":"Io would give these sub shop 5 stars but there was one and only one flaw! Ok so I was craving a mediterranean-style sandwich...I usually go the WYNN CAFE for this affordable and delicious style sandwich.  I just moved down the street next to Metro PD Headquarters so I wanted to stay near...Low and the hold a firehouse subs open down the street I walked in the clerk at the desk greeted me as I walked in to this unbelievably extreme clean pristine restaurant told me they just put a sandwich on the menu that's brand-new.  I ordered the chicken Mediterranean sandwich I had the clerk read out loud all of the ingredients then had a sandwich and brought out to me.  I expected to get my name hollered and I would get up and get it but they came around the counter brought the sandwich out to me .....it was so beautiful I took photos and I was biting into it and it just seemed kind of off .....they forgot to put the chicken on the sandwich I went up they corrected the problem apologize profusely and honestly it was delicious and very very reasonably priced I will definitely definitely be returning.  Again I was going away at how kind the staff was and how clean that restaurant is."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious meatball subs. Definitely way tastier than subways meatballs. Quick stop, but a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Firehouse Subs, I can't believe I have not tried Firehouse sooner!  The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly and the Sub was delicious.  It was so delicious that I forgot to take picture of my Sub.  I ordered the NY Steamer, which is a Sub with pastrami & corned beef on wheat bread.  The sub was perfect length and I added lots of vegetables...I would get the NY steamer again.  I need to go back to Firehouse Subs to take pictures of my sub.  Update coming soon!"}
{"text":"Always love it when we come here for their sandwiches.  Never have been disappointed with the food, service, or cleanliness."}
{"text":"The bomb.com!! These subs are deelish!  This place gives Subway a run for their money and I was a big fan of Subway!  Every sandwich that I have tried at Firehouse is perfect!  They have great locations as well all across the Valley and the 3 locations that I have been to have great employees and clean restaurants!!"}
{"text":"So...  I like firehouse.    This is a pretty good one.   Yes, their prices are a little high but on par with a Penn station.   They also donate a portion to local fire stations for equipment.   This is a new location and people were friendly and we were served promptly.   Food is made to order so there is a slight wait."}
{"text":"I must admit I stayed away for a long while because someone told me that the sandwiches started at nine bucks.  Well today bravery, hunger and convenience collided and in I went.      First impressions:      What friendly folks working there.  They all piped up for a really warm greeting.         What a clean, cozy establishment.  Firefighter paraphernalia all over the place.  Very male centric.   Big screen Televisions on either side of the store broadcasting sports.           Vast, descriptive and colorful menu.  It was a lot to take in and read through.  The super friendly red-head at the counter made it easy.  I said \"can I just order a turkey sandwich?\"  There was no nickel and dime add on's for cheese etc., just a toasted sandwich on fresh, delicious bread and way more meat than I was prepared for.         And...  The price was right!   The sandwich and pickle was $5.55.  With a large beverage and a bag of Miss Vickie's chips, my lunch came to just under $9.  I was satisfied.        You ask:  Would you go back again?          My reply:  You just try and stop me!"}
{"text":"Look, if you told me that I would be sitting here at midnight on a Saturday night writing a review on Yelp not only about a sandwich but about a chain sandwich joint I would tell you to call an ambulance because something is clearly wrong with me... Well, don't call an ambulance but feel free to call the fire station or in this case fire house subs.   We call ahead quite often from work to firehouse to grab a few hook and ladders and some of the other hot subs they offer. Now, to be completely honest I think the sandwiches are just okay but they are very organized and usually do not mess up orders.   What brings this place up to a 4 star review for me is the customer service not only during the call in order process but also when I have been into the location with my family. True story, I have a friend that offered to bring my 3 year old a real fire helmet to borrow and wear around the house and my son said only if it is from Firehouse Subs... Does that mean we have a sandwich problem or does Firehouse just have an amazing marketing scheme with those plastic fire hats they give out?  Now for the meat of this review, which if I may mention is not fresh and heated like the meat at Firehouse. The sandwiches are normally on point and fresh to order, my only complaint is that the way they heat the meat when it is ordered to go they are normally a little moister than I would like by the time they get to us because of the steaming process they use. I would imagine that if they put all hot sandwiches in the trays they place the meatball sandwiches in that problem would be fixed. As mentioned before the customer service is always spot on from the hello when you walk in to the have a great day when you walk out.   A great place to grab a sandwich quickly and fill up when you are on the go, and don't forget to go over to the hot sauce bar and grab a 10 and take you taste buds for a ride."}
{"text":"Oh, no. Never again. So much buzz. So many positive reviews. Perhaps different strokes for different folks.  I was in after the lunch rush. The crew was polite but they all looked like they needed a nap. It was my first time in (and my last) and there were missed opportunities. I suppose it's a bit much to ask employees in a fast food place to greet with something like, \"Hi! Welcome to Firehouse Subs. Have you dined with us before?\"  I picked the New York steamer. The meat was good. The bread was OK. But, the sandwich was just murdered with a huge slathering of mayo. I had it to go and couldn't deal with scraping out the mayo while also driving.  Had I been asked if it was my first visit, I imagine the employee could have really helped me get a great sub.  One star due to lackluster staff who clearly didn't care one little bit about service and a sandwich which, if made to the recipe, tasted gross."}
{"text":"Eh...it was decent.  I had heard about this place and knew that I wanted to try it out.  A few weeks back, I decided to place an order online and drive down here on my lunch break.  Pick up was fast and efficient.  They have a dedicated area for call in/online orders which is nice.   I ordered a Large SmokeHouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket.  It sounded like the best sandwich they had.  They claim to smoke their brisket for 16 hours.  The \"large\" is probably 12-14 inches long.  The subs are really skinny though.  I mowed down the whole thing and was not stuffed to the gills.  Pretty much $11.00 for a sandwich.  A little steep IMO.  Good but far from great.  Brisket was tasty enough, the cheddar was not really noticeable, the BBQ sauce was good (Sweet Baby Rays) and the bread was just ok.  Not sure if I am specifically driving back here again for a sandwich, but I would hit it up in a pinch if I was in the area and wanted a sandwich.  Eh...it was decent."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs are good but they are extermly pricey for what you get. You can literally go to a sit down restaurant be served with a complete meal, not just chips for a side. Sandwiches even for a small, which they call a medium is too big. So, if you have a normal appetite or not want to eat more than you should then half will go to waste or the dog making it even more expensive. Very Good but pricey. So I give them a 2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop. Delicious subs and sandwiches. Tasty and addicting with friendly workers."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 sandwiches 1 was supposed to have no bbq sauce and the other was supposed to have extra tomato  and onion mine didn't have any tomato or onions and the other had bar b que sauce probablywoll not return Too bad cause the place is cool ."}
{"text":"I don't live near this location but happen to be near it and was craving Firehouse so I decided to stop in. The place was hopping and the service was phenomenal! However there was one problem, the food was not as good as the one by my home which is the Concord Mills location."}
{"text":"Why wouldn't they be a 5 star?   Great service team and awesome sandwiches.  I prefer Firehouse over other companies.  I have tried the first 6 sandwich and everyone of them were top notch.  I don't think you will go wrong with any of the choices."}
{"text":"Waited over 25 minutes for a meatball sub. Then when I received the sub it was lukewarm at best. Manager refunded me the money for the sub only since I had eaten the chips and drank some of my soda. Offered to remake the sub but I did not have another 25 minutes to wait. He never even offered to rush the sandwich so I could eat with my husband. I will never come back here again.   Ed in response to your response  I have lost all respect for you. As far as the events here is what transpired. Yes you did offer to remake the sub but you never offered to remake it in a expedited manner. You never tried to make good on anything. Never offered me a sub on my next visit. I was very upset that you did not do any of these things. As I sat there and watched my husband eat his sub. You want to make me out to be a problem customer and that you did everything to make me happy shame on you.   Ed again to your response. I would be more than happy to meet with you Just so you can look me in the eye and call me a liar. I am more upset with you for that than a cold sandwich. I did not know that I was such a distraction and that I was so inconsolable for the 10 minutes I sat there as my husband ate his sandwich. During that time I was also refusing to accept the coupons you were giving me to come back for a free sandwich. Oh yes also you delivering an expediting a hot meatball sub. Which why aren't the meatballs kept at proper temps. Oh and the apologies that I was ignoring. Ed really I would have loved you to do any of these things. But again I was storming back to my table to sit. Is it so worth it to you to admit to truly dropping the ball on your customer service that you have to call the customer a liar."}
{"text":"Firehouse is a good option for lunch. Their turkey cranberry is pretty good. It has always been clean when I've gone, and the customer service is good. Sometimes the wait is a bit longer than other places I've been, but that's fine.   The first time I went there, when you would walk in, all the employees would yell, \"Welcome to Firehouse!\"  They seemed to have stopped doing that!  Thank God!  I didn't want so much attention drawn to myself. I just want to eat my lunch in peace!"}
{"text":"Great turkey bacon ranch, always fresh, great friendly service, for me fresh bread makes the sub, and I never have had stale bread there. I just wish they were a little cheaper, but they do have a rewards program, so with that it makes it a little more affordable."}
{"text":"Saw Firehouse Subs and the wife and I thought we would stop and check it out. OMG!  Has to be the best sandwich I've ever had. I had the smokehouse beef and the wife had turkey and Swiss. My first thought was I can't wait to come back!  Atmosphere was very relaxed and the ladies behind the counter were amazingly friendly.  I would rate more than 5 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"We went to this location yesterday, and were very disappointed. No meat on one of our sandwiches, and there were no pickles. When I went back in, the kid at the counter apologized, while the 2 seemingly confused employees \"fixed\" the sandwich. I was hoping for maybe a new one, or maybe even an upgrade to a medium sandwich. Anyway, it took too long, messed up the order and just overall a poor experience. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak was great and their captains hot sauce is amazing"}
{"text":"I had a salad and it was excellent. The service was great and the owner stop to introduce him and his wife. Great people!! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time to a Firehouse Subs before, and they had remarkable customer service. They helped me figure out what I was in the mood for, and the Turkey Bacon Ranch sub was amazing!! Very clean, and a great atmosphere. Thank you Firehouse!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the first of many more visits!  Everybody said welcome when we walked in... (it's nice to be acknowledged... reminiscent of Waffle House).  I built my own sub with corned beef and all the regular fixings (except mustard).  Served warm, I was impressed that the bread wasn't too crunchy that it hurt to eat it.  My husband enjoyed his Italian sub with the same bread comment as mine.  We chose brownies for dessert... delicious!  We dined there, appreciating the decor, which was different and interesting... We enjoyed our supper and, like I said before, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"So I have been here twice. I don't remember the first time, but I went again yesterday for my birthday. I will say that their subs are a little bit on the smaller side as far as size goes. HOWEVER, the New York Steamer was absolutely amazing. I'm not usually much of a beef person, I usually get turkey or chicken on my sandwiches, but this sub was probably the best sub I have ever had.... okay maybe tied with the crab salad at Which Wich because I absolutely love crab salad. But I think it is about $6 or $7 for the medium sub and for two dollars extra you can make it a large. Small sub, big flavor."}
{"text":"So after always seeing fire house bar and wishing it was this place they finally opened here. They have great subs I prefer the NY steamer. Medium is about $6 and combo about $8. Served with a pickle and deliciousness."}
{"text":"I was really hopeful when this new location opened up. Sadly it just didn't meet my expectations and I likely won't be returning. I tried the Firehouse Hero along with chips a drink and was underwhelmed, especially when the total came. The overall quality is just sub par for a sandwich shop. You may have better luck with a different sub but I'm not hopeful enough to go back and find out."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious ! I get the Turkey Bacon Ranch sub and well worth it if you are in the Las Vegas area. The service could be a little faster I guess but well worth the few minute wait and the people that work there are always friendly. One of the best ways to knock out a lunch for 10 bucks."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse subs and have been to many different ones, never disappointed. You get constant great serves and food looks likes the picture so they don't skimp on the meat. Not the case with this joint. Great friendly service, but everything was disappointing from there on out. I order a brisket with lettuce and tomato and received a small bit of brisket in bread.  I sent it back for the rest of my sandwich and my pickle. I had to wait 10min for them to fix."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular Firehouse location 4 times because it is close to my wife's office. I usually get 4 or 5 sandwiches each time I go for her employees as well. 3 of those times over half the order was wrong and I called to lettl them know but did not ask for any kind of replacement or reimbursement. Today was different, I only ordered 3 sandwiches and 2 were wrong so I went back to get the 2 replaced. The owner was very condescending when I asked for my receipt back (tax purposes, but none of his business) He implied that I was going to try to get more sandwiches replaced off the same reciept. I was so offended that I will NEVER go back to this location and the owner should be embarrassed that he even implied that to a paying customer that usually just takes whatever his amateurish staff messes up."}
{"text":"Usually Firehouse makes their food fairly quick, but this location is terribly slow. There was no Firehouse spirit at this location. We waited, waited and waited...you get the idea. We were waiting for about 20 minutes for two sandwiches. When I went up the counter, it turns out they forgot about us. -_-   You would think someone would have wondered why we were sitting there with a number stand and not eating for that long when the restaurant wasn't busy....Only one employee of 3 available jumped on the order.   They offered my money back to apologize, but then couldn't figure out how to put it back on my card...so they ended up giving me a gift card. I truly appreciate the urge to make things right. That's huge customer served in my book, but I won't be returning. Thank you to the employee who jumped on the order, came up to our table to apologize and attempted to correct the situation.

{"text":"Visited firehouse subs after a longing gap. Not sure whether this location is careless about making subs or firehouse subs recipe has been altered to cut the corners.   The subs came after 20 minutes wait , still ok. However all the subs were too \"dry\".  I checked with server whether they missed cheese completely on it or not. It seemed like almost half part of subs were totally dry.  The person who made it explained that that's how it is now.  I wished I had gone to subway instead.    Might try different location in future to give one more try."}
{"text":"We love Firehouse Subs, and were so glad one finally opened in Tolleson!  Today was my first time eating in, and I was surprised how big it was inside....other ones I've been in have been much smaller.  I tried one of their new cold heroes and the Malibu was very good.  It had a spicy honey mustard dressing on it, that had a horseradish kick and I loved it!  I also tried their sweet tea and it was perfect.  Not too sweet at all, like some other places.  Just perfect.  The service was great, too.  One worker even brought my mom an extra pickle because he noticed she didn't have one.  It's not that they forgot to give her one, she just ate it first when her sandwich arrived!  Another worker cleared our trays for us, too.  Very friendly!  So glad it's only a couple of miles from my house."}
{"text":"The subs are very good, we had the corned beef and pastrami and the ham sub. They are made with quality meat, and the amount of meat in the sandwich was good.  The staff is helpful and friendly.  The price is right and the place is clean.  As a plus they have a big selection of hot sauces, rated from 1 thru 10, so that you may eat them with your chips or add to your sandwich. We tried the \"100% Pain\" and found out the name was right on.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at the Rocky River location yesterday, which will prevent me from returning.  I placed an order using their app, and when I arrived at the store, the clerk told me that the payment hadn't gone through. When I placed the order, though, I received a response from the app saying that it was paid for. I also received an e-mail indicating I had paid. The clerk was insistent, so I reluctantly paid a second time. Firehouse sent me a survey asking if I was satisfied, and, for obvious reasons after the terrible customer service and the uncertainty as to whether or not I had paid twice, I let them know that I was not satisfied. I then received an e-mail from the store's manager informing me that \"My crew member did handle this correctly as she has no control over the process.\" Look I get that computers don't always work perfectly. However, if a shop's system fails, I expect the store to shoulder the burden of that failure, not the customer."}
{"text":"We rolled in tonight at 9pm and everyone in this place greeted me!  They asked if I'd ever been to a Firehouse Subs - I replied NO - and they told me about how they do things differently.  I wasn't in the mood for a sub (I came with friends) so I got a bowl of CHILI.  It was fairly standard but good.  They added some cheese and chopped up some onions and put that in too.  I was very pleased.  And once again let me say - the people were very friendly and welcoming.  I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"My daughter and I drove past this location after a soccer game, and decided to give it a try....  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  The meat was fresh and moist. The bread was perfection.  They have a large selection of hot sandwiches, large enough to split for two people.  I ordered a turkey sandwich with cranberry and my daughter ordered a ham and cheese. Both delicious and very flavorful.  The place was very clean and everyobe was super helpful in answering our questions.  We cooled off, refueled and hot the road, deciding that we would definately comeback to the shop the next time we were in town for Soccer."}
{"text":"Ate here and it was pretty good.  I wouldn't compare it to capriotti's because they are completely different sandwiches.  all of the sandwiches are hot.  all of them.  And they steam them, not toast them although the bread seems to be toasted, so I'm not sure what they do back there.  I'm not sure who paid 16 bucks for two small sandwiches, But the small sandwiches are just 5.50, the large ones are 7.50 or so.  The smalls are pretty hearty.  And not that I care but there's not a single vegetarian option.  If you're looking for veggie, I wouldn't go here."}
{"text":"This is the best sub shop in town. Not only are the sandwiches made to perfection, but the staff is always so friendly, and helpful. The atmosphere is perfect for a family sit down or take out.  It is very clean and well decorated."}
{"text":"Came here just before noon on Christmas Eve and glad it was open. There was a couple there and no line. I was given the time to decide on my order and the server/cashier was quick and pleasant. I order 8\" Hook & Ladder on wheat with extra onions and I must say, I'm glad to finally try out this sandwich spot! You'll get a good sandwich here for sure!"}
{"text":"Great spot, one of the best subs places I've been too. The fire Fighter knew what they was doing when they started this spot."}
{"text":"This is probably not one of the best Firehouse Subs locations, I ordered a Italian sub which was super cold. Hope they can get it together. SMH"}
{"text":"Great service & yummy sandwiches. I am always greeted upon entering with smiling faces. Very clean store too."}
{"text":"OMG the subs here are amazing! I got the brisket with cheddar, bbq and mayo it was absolutely delicious. Brisket was cooked perfectly, bread was nice and soft. Medium sub is pretty decent 8\". The meat is a perfect serving so you're not just eating bread. Place is super clean and staff is friendly. Also reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It's always interesting to read past reviews, like Kate M.'s or Georgie M.'s and feel like you've had the same experience. Yet one was 4 years ago and the other 2. How could things not have changed? Well, they haven't.  First, the flow. Yep, as Kate M. says, take a shot of whiskey before you walk in because if it's busy, you'll just pull your hair out. If it's not, you'll probably leave your hair alone but you'll still get that uneasy feeling inside your stomach that something just isn't quite right. What's not right? Quit simply, the flow. You order at the far end of the counter, not at the front end where you enter the store. Yes, there are signs posted hanging from the ceiling that tell you where to go but when you walk in the door and the guys behind the counter welcome you it seems natural to just walk up and try and place your order. Wont work. You're at the wrong place.Sure, they're kind and are more than helpful directing you down to the cash register to place your order, but then you feel like an idiot and just want to get the experience over with. Luckily, the food and the Coke Freestyle machine are just moments away from washing all the bad feelings away. And don't worry about it. No one is watching you. Well, at least I don't think they are. I ordered the Engineer. Large. ($9.69). Now, yes, this is a large sandwich. And I did take half of it home. But... 10 bones. Doesn't even include the bag of chips or drink. That's ($2.70) more. So, just for me I was almost at $13.50 out the door. If C was with me, that would have been $27 bucks for the two of us. That $27 goes so much further at so many other places. But, I digress. Forgetting about the price, the sandwich was great. The wheat bread was fresh, soft and flavorful. The fillings, which on the Engineer included smoked turkey breast, melted swiss, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and mayo, were also great. I did switch out the mayo for mustard though and I wish there were more mushrooms on it but all in all, a good wich.  The chips came in a bag so what is there to say about that. The drink, well now that came from the most amazing thing since the bread slicing machine. The Coke Freestyle machine. My first purchase when I win the lottery. Check out the super secret menu hacks on YouTube for this machine and your soda drinking days will never be the same.  The restaurant was pretty clean. The food was good. The prices are a bit high. The flow of ordering is backwards. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Good Hotsub and really fun soda machine."}
{"text":"The people are always so welcoming when you walk in everyone shouts \"welcome to Firehouse\" . The ordering process is so easy and the food is always perfect. I really enjoy this firehouse and I plan on coming here more often !"}
{"text":"Clean, polite (even when nearly closed) staff, and FAR larger portions than expected.  Definitely a fan of the franchise now."}
{"text":"My go to sand which place close to work. I always order the turkey and bacon number 3 I believe. So good. And they have powerade zero on tap which I love."}
{"text":"I had never had a Firehouse Sub so I wanted to give them a shot. Most Disappointing Service I have ever received! Called to have sandwiches delivered by Uber Eats, the shop cancelled my order and did not have the decency to call and let me know.. I had a house full of starving people. Apparently they ran out of ALL their food and could not make our sandwiches. I placed the order at 8:15 PM and I believe they did not want to make the sandwhiches since they were closing at 9 PM. It was rude and personally I feel they lack in customer care. I thought Fireman were much more upstanding than what this shows. In the end we went to the grocery store and purchsed the makings for our own subs... Unfortunately I still have not had a Firehouse Sub and I never will since I refuse to order from them ever again. SHAME ON YOU for such poor service and making Firemen look so terrible!"}
{"text":"Well first time decent experience friendly staff but no one here 4 people behind the counter Took 15 min just to make a sandwich. They put mustard and ranch on the second half of my sandwich which was just suppose to be ranch first half was great second was so so. I was just gonna give 3 stars but decided to give a 4th."}
{"text":"Quite disturbed by no team work, seems to be some kind of division with manager on call. Notice she was not very nice to many of the employees, rude, very intimidating, putting them down in front of customers. What can you expect working with someone as such. Maybe she was having a bad day. Will not ever step into a Firehouse Sub. Upper management is non existent."}
{"text":"Friendly service...Fast Service...Sandwich was awesome. They have a select number of sandwiches that are under 500 calories. I've only tried one (Turkey Salsa Verde) and it was awesome. Can't wait to try the others."}
{"text":"Let's just say my daughter couldn't tell the difference between turkey or ham. The meat lacked flavor. The prices were too high for the quality of sandwich. Save a couple bucks and just go to Subway."}
{"text":"Ugh so I haven't been here in about a yr or so because it kept declining in service and quality. Well not much has changed in fact I was very disappointed  to see that a employee there was using foul language and making rude comments about another customer who came in after me with a disability very sad and disrespectful. I get home and they also had forgotten my salad dressing for my salad needless to say we will not be returning again."}
{"text":"Over priced subs. Not sure if I would go back. Great staff but price point is over what the quality of subs are."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best for subs. I've never had a better sub from anywhere else. It's a shame I'm moving to Seattle, Wa where there are no locations close by. I'm going to miss my weekly Saturday night fix."}
{"text":"Love their specialty subs, ESPECIALLY the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket *drools* its by far my favorite. Also like the New York Steamer (corned beef) and steak and cheese, chicken salad, tuna salad, and turkey, but often times I find myself ordering the smokehouse. The beef isn't like thick slices of brisket, its more like thinly sliced deli meat but they still pack a lot in each sandwich so you're not getting gypped. It's smothered in their delicious bbq sauce and melted cheddar and served hot.   They also do catering as well and we recently ordered from them for a meeting on Midwestern University's campus. After having a less than satisfactory experience with Which Wich's catering, I was a little nervous about ordering from another sandwich place, but Firehouse went above and beyond. The catering package I ordered came with a gallon of iced tea which was forgotten with the initial delivery. I believe it was the manager delivering the order, and he not only went back to bring us the iced tea but also brought some coupon books as a courtesy. The catering order came with all the fixings like 2 different kinds of dressing, condiments, and veggies. Will probably cater from them again, and definitely will be returning for the smokehouse!"}
{"text":"I thought the service was great, the selection is good, and the food was also good, I would put it better than subway if given the option, seemed fresher."}
{"text":"I went for lunch here. First time ever eating here. As I walked everyone happily greeted me. The girl at the register was very nice and walked me through the menu, as it was a little overwhelming at first sight. She suggested the #10. And I ordered that. It was delicious. John was also very friendly and came up and asked how everything was.  Will definitely be coming back, and soon."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs proves there's a reason why the Subway franchise is closing. Firehouse Subs brings it back to basics by simplifying the way they make subs.  All ingredients are fresh and made on the spot and I highly recommend the steak and cheese sub.  All subs come with a set of ingredients already on it and you can add extra items if you want (every item comes with a juicy pickle).  This place hits the spot every time I visit and if you have a chance, try out their in house special drink from their soft drink machine it is awesome.  It is a bit pricey compared to other sub places but the quality of ingredients justifies the price you pay. Also, you have the option to round up your order $$ amount to assist local firefighters. All in all, give this place a chance and I can assure you, you'll have a different perspective as to how a sub sandwich should be."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice in the last few weeks and both times ordered the New York Steamer...corned beef brisket and pastrami with provolone, mayo, mustard, Italian dressing and dill spear on the side...excellent.  The problem they have is the ability to fill orders quickly...20 minutes for one sandwich of this type is a little long.   A number of other customers appeared to be trying to figure out what was taking so long for their food as well."}
{"text":"El mejor lugar para comer un sub rápido. Imperdible: Sub de meatballs con provolone. Tienen un pequeño bar de salsas (enumeradas del 1 al 10 dependiendo del nivel de picante) bastante interesante. Probe el número 9 y estuve con lágrimas en los ojos por media hora Rápido, fresco y delicioso."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service is VERY slow. Be prepared to wait 20+ minutes at lunch time. Even during odd hours they seem to take forever to get your food out. Also, make sure your pickle is with your sandwich before leaving. It's about a 50% chance that it will be. The only reason I gave 3 instead of 2 is because the sandwiches are better than most."}
{"text":"The thing that really sets Firehouse Subs apart from its competitors is its amazing service. Even over the noon hour--the busiest time of day--at least one employee greets you at the door. Everyone who works there is cheerful and courteous. They deliver the food to your table, And the food arrives quickly.  The food is consistently flavorful. Their menu is standardized, so if you want a sub made your way, you would be better off at Subway. They will leave off certain ingredients if you ask, but the options are limited. I don't mind this because it makes the line go quicker. You don't wait 20 minutes for the people in front of you to pick their ingredients.  The soda machine with 200+ flavors is way cool. One benefit is that there is normally a single line behind the machine. You don't have people crashing into or cutting in front of each other as happens with traditional soda fountains. I happened to talk recently with a fellow who works for Coca-Cola. He said these machines cost around $17,000, so any business that has at least one of them must be doing well.  The cashier always asks whether you would like to round up your purchase to the next dollar to benefit the Firehouse Public Safety Foundation. Normally, I dislike it when cashiers ask you to donate to the store's favorite cause because I already give to my own favorite causes. However, I always say \"yes\" at Firehouse because donating to first responders is definitely a good cause, assuming that the money goes where they say it does.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the food is pricey. For a few dollars more, you could get a decent meal at a sit-down restaurant.  Sadly, I no longer eat at Firehouse Subs because I recently became a vegetarian, and they don't offer a vegetarian option. I'm sure they would leave the meat off one of their salads on request, but when I go to a sub place, I want a sub. So I eat at Subway instead, even though the quality, service, and atmosphere are lacking by comparison.  If you are carnivorous, I highly recommend Firehouse Subs.  UPDATE:  After posting this as a four-star review, a representative of Firehouse Subs private messaged me to address a few of the concerns I expressed above. She informed me that they do indeed have a vegetarian sub on the menu. She also explained more about the Firehouse Public Safety Foundation.  Since posting the original review, I have returned to Firehouse Subs in Chandler twice. Each time I ordered the veggie sub. The reason I wasn't aware of it earlier is that it is not on the big menu behind the counter. I found it listed only on a small revolving menu on the countertop. I would suggest that they do more to promote the veggie sub because it's good. It is much more flavorful than its counterpart at Subway. If you order The Works and ask them to skip the mayo, it's fairly healthy.  Also, I want to clarify that in the original review, I did not mean to imply that their Foundation is shady. I was simply trying to be objective, i.e., I did not want to state something I could not verify. After learning more about the Foundation and reading more about it on the Internet, I think it's well respected and does great work. Certainly, there are few causes more important than helping first responders.  Primarily because I like their veggie sub, I have upped my original rating to five stars. I may be taking some risk in doing so because Yelp seems to be more likely to filter five-star reviews. But I believe the rating was earned."}
{"text":"I really like Firehouse subs. They are a little spendy but the quality of the food shows. This location is usually very fast and always friendly. My favorite is the beef and cheddar. The pastrami is also really good. You also get a pickle with every sandwich and don't forget to order a cookie. They are super good!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite sub place since it opened , their subs taste so fresh and and the bread is my favorite sub buns this side of the Mississippi! What grinds my gears is that they raised the prices of all their subs, at first I didn't care but after this last visit I think it will be my last.  The last two times I got the brisket sub it was lacking the amount of meat that used to be on them.  It was pretty much all bread and bbq sauce. For a $10 sub I expected it to be filled with meat like it used too.  I have had other problems with this location so I'm hoping it's just this one that is doing this.  I'll have to check out a different locations before I write them completely off."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch for our team and went to pick-up them up. I asked if everything was in the bag and was told yes, only to return to the office and have a missing sandwich. I understand mistakes happen; however when I called and to inform them of their oversight I was made to feel it was my fault and then promised I would be sent a coupon for a free sandwich only never to receive it. the customer service was horrible. I gave them one more opportunity and again experienced poor customer support, there was only two other patron ahead of me and they had been waiting for 5 - 10 minutes and my wait was too lengthy for the number of customers compared to other proprietors in the area."}
{"text":"I was in the area and it was around lunch time. Craving D&D, but wanting to make it to the pool quicker, I remembered Firehouse Subs was located in the same complex.  Having never been before I went ahead and asked if I could create my own, and yes, I could. Yippee for me as I am quite pickey when it comes to my sandwiches. I ordered the regular with turkey, bacon, lettuce, extra onion and swiss cheese. I received my receipt and cup and headed for the interesting soda machine. You can pretty much choose from a variety of sodas by just tapping what you want. I will say the Sprite I got just didn't taste like a Sprite, but oh well. I arrived at the pool and my sandwich was made to prefection. It has a perfect amount of turkey and the cheese was melted to perfection. I enjoyed it very much and will definitely be back..and was surprised to see only two and half stars for this location."}
{"text":"O.K., so I was in a cantankerous mood when I tried this place for the first time. Upon entering, every employee yells out a welcome to you as if they've known you forever. Of course, all of the other customers turn to look at me to see what the fuss is about . . . as if I'm a celebrity or something. But before I could order a sandwich, I got bombarded with: 1. Here is a card to download our App. 2. Take a picture of your sub and post it online for a chance to win $500. 3. Join our club to receive points for your next order. 4. Would you like to contribute your change to benefit the Fire Dept. (as if I've been exempt from paying taxes for this service already!)?  Sometimes, all you want is a simple sandwich for a quiet lunch."}
{"text":"It's tough to rate sandwich shops, in my opinion at least.  A lot of them tend to serve close to the same types of sandwiches.  This place included.  And yes, the Italian sandwich was delicious and well priced.  But what sets Firehouse above the rest is they sell their used 5gal pickle jugs to customers to gather donations to give back to the public safety community.  I have never seen that before and love the idea.  They also have a freestyle Coke machine too."}
{"text":"Popped in today for lunch. When you walk in you're greeted with \"Welcome to Firehouse Subs\". Puts me in mind of Chipotles, where they do the same thing. Atmosphere is warm and there are enough table and chairs to hold a fair amount of people. We made our way to the cashier and placed our order. I got #10 - Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket combo, on whole wheat, and the person I was with ordered a #7 - a Firehouse Steak and Cheese. Each combo included a bag of chips (or Doritos) and a medium pop. We both ordered a medium sized sub. My #10 was fantastic. The bun was ultra fresh and warm. The Firehouse BBQ sauce was more on the sweeter side, but had a nice smokiness to it. I added one of the litany of side sauces they have available (rated on a heat factor scale of 1 to 10...I added a 6) to take the heat factor up a notch. Next time I'll go up to an 8, as 6 was still too mild. There was plenty of beef and it was very saucy (it reminded me of eating a California sandwich) and your hands will get covered in BBQ sauce.  It was perhaps one of the best subs I've ever had. Holy hell it was good. My friend loved his as well. He didn't add any heat to his but he raved about it. Staff member came by to see if we were enjoying our meal...very friendly. A great experience all around. 2 medium sized sub combos came to just over $28.....a bit steeper than other sub places, but it was worth every penny.  I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We love Firehouse Subs! This particular location is new and hopefully the staff will become friendlier after the newness wheres off!  Food was awesome and made correctly. I love the steak and cheese, but hold the mustard ;) Each of our sandwiches were correct, we ordered four different ones.  There was no \"Welcome to Firehouse\" when entering the door, this was disappointing, since it always made you feel welcomed when you entered.Maybe a Sunday night isn't the best night to come in, but it was around 6:00 so they shouldn't of been wanting to close it up.  The place was very clean, but I do not like people sweeping when I am trying to eat my dinner. I know call me CRAZY but I really do believe that NO ESTABLISHMENT should sweep when people are at a table eating. Dust goes everywhere even if you can't see it.  There was only 1 other family in there, very quiet. I found that odd compared to other Firehouse Subs, but being that they are new, I hope that will change.   Love the soda machine with all the options available!  My other problem is the cost. It's now over $8.00 for a combo, which I believe is very high. I can eat at a sit down restaurant and pay less than $35.00 and still have a quick but nice meal."}
{"text":"Good bye Subway!! This place is awesome!! Very friendly staff, fresh bread, tasty sub!!! Two thumbs up I will be back!! If you have not had it make sure u stop in!!! Daniel welcomed me at the door and Justin even picked up my tray when I was done so I didn't have to take it to the trash."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches. Roommate introduce me this place and now I am addicted. I really enjoy there hot sauce selection. I recommend backdraft, it's a 7, feels like a 9."}
{"text":"The good:  Nice place 15%military discount    The Bad: The tall, fat, white chick was rude. I asked if a sub only had that one type of meat displayed and got all rude on me.  Would be 4 stars without her attitude. The guy named Jose was great."}
{"text":"They have really gone downhill from when this place first came to Vegas. It's dirty and the cheesesteak meat was tough (not to mention the pickle they gave us was a joke). They use to make sure to take the time to greet you and welcome you and we got all the way to the register before we got a \"welcome to firehouse\" and it was far from enthusiastic. Nonetheless it will be a while before we come back if ever. Hope corporate fixes them before they close doors."}
{"text":"Sadly this really wasn't that tasty.  For how many calories are in these subs, they should taste amazing.  I think it was just \"meh.\"  I do like that they have all the hot sauce options though.  I might have to try a different sandwich next time."}
{"text":"This location is very close to my house so it is super convenient. They have always been nice when you walk it there. I always get the same sandwich. The drink dispenser is one of those fancy ones where you have a touch screen where you choose the drink you want and then push a button. Lots more choices of beverages then normally."}
{"text":"My favourite sub place in Vegas, the sandwiches aren't obscenely large like in most places, but they are intensely flavourful and delicious, very satisfying. I always get the NY Steamer on white, which is hot pastrami and cheese, simple and very very yummy."}
{"text":"The facility is very nice and super clean. The employees are very personable and food is exceptional.  I have always loved firehouse subs!! It truly is my favorite place to get a sub!!   I have done and update to this review. I am updating it from a three star   to and five star.  After,  I will refer to it as a \"misunderstanding\" at this establishment; the owner contacted me and is making the situation right.  He did so very promptly so I deleted the incident all together.   I highly recommend this location to get a great sub and great personality by the staff."}
{"text":"Sick.  We walked in about to order and the girl wearing gloves making sandwiches was scratching her noes and her face. PREPARING sandwiches. Sick sick sick. I don't wanna see this.   Yuck yuck.   So we turned around and walked out.  It was so gross."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do, but today's New York Steamer was probably a Top 10 disappointing sandwich of my life. Soggy, lifeless, unimaginative, and overpriced.   I'd been to Firehouse one previous time, and the meatball was better. Far from spectacular, but much more satisfying than the corned beef/pastrami number I ordered during Visit #2. It was steamed meat, cheese and mayo on an old-tasting white hoagie. No veggies, no color, no texture, no good.  The Firehouse concept and story are cool. The employees are nice. The fountain drink vending machine is second to none. And I enjoy being able to watch college hoops while my sandwich gets steamed to death. But these pros cannot save an underwhelming experience that cost me $9. Subway's $5 Cold Cut Combo would have been a better investment."}
{"text":"This place (shaking my head) is super slow. Also someone was picking up food for delivery and one of the girls making sandwiches was wearing her gloves to touch dirty stuff where everyone pulls bottled drinks out of. She seen me watching her so she took off one of her gloves and when she thought I wasn't looking she put that damn dirty ass glove back on and started preparing sandwiches. It was disgusting, she is he heavier set Hispanic chick. She also wiped her nose with the glove. Thank god someone else was preparing our sandwiches while she was busy because I would have asked for our money back.   I'll never come back to this particular firehouse again. I have always love firehouse but I've had some bad luck at three of them here in Vegas. I think I'm going to give up on this restaurant in the Las Vegas area.    Our sandwiches weren't bad, my husband and I both ordered soup: one chicken noodle and the other broccoli. They didn't even put them on the correct trays. The pickles tasted like dirt and the drink machines weren't working. It was a hot mess in there.  It wasn't all that clean except for the tables, there was a male that was making sure the tables were clean.  The bathrooms needed to be cleaned up too.  The staff other than the guy cleaning tables lacked personalities."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs!  Thank you!  Your food remains great and your service has become great as well!  You put up with me running in at 5 till 10 for a sandwich and they've been great everytime!  Thanks so much for excellent service and food in our great neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Second time I've tried this franchisee location and it's still terrible. The kid taking my order young black hair could not speak well, could barely hear him, it was like he was mumbling. Was not helpful with explaining the subs. I then asked the girl making the subs to put peppers on the sub and she never acknowledged me. I asked again and she said I heard you. It's kind a hard for me to understand when she didn't respond because I don't have ESP, I have ESPN. This franchisee needs to work his business and take pride of ownership in his establishment. Last time I come here or any Firehouse Subs."}
{"text":"It's like when you walk into CiCi's Pizza or Moe's, they welcome you too! The employees are always super friendly and ready to serve you. The Italian Sub, the Hook and Ladder, and the Meatball sub are superb. Now that they have a \"lighter options\" menu, I have eaten about 10 Italian Subs in the past 4 months."}
{"text":"Stopped here cuz I was in the neighborhood and was curious.  I guess firemen eat a lot of sandwiches, what with hungry, burley men spending a lot of time in firehouses and cooking for one another.  They should be experts, what with burley, hungry mens' affinity for sandwiches.  That was my theory at least.  These sandwiches were not hearty, just weird.  They steam their meats seperately and to order which made for a soggy sandwich.  More of a 2 star joint, but I like firemen so I'll bump 'em up to 3."}
{"text":"We used to love this fire house but now everytime we go it takes at least 20-30 minutes to get our food. Even when there is a very small line. Subs are sloppy because they are obviously in a rush. Not sure if it is the workers or if they don't hire enough people, but we're done eating at this location."}
{"text":"My favorite warm sub shop in the valley by far. Steemed subs are amazing and much better than toasted subs. Come eat here and never look back."}
{"text":"This place makes tasty subs but my favorite part is the hot sauce bar, I like to try a new one every time I visit! The Engineer sub is my most recent choice, as well as the club sub. The staff is always friendly here too. I'm also a fan of the soda machine because of all the options you can choose. I'm glad to see more locations opening up around the Vegas valley, this sub shop is easily one of favorites!"}
{"text":"i have been to 4 different firehouse subs now. people must really like the theme, because the sandwiches are NOT any good. 2 stars instead of 1, because the people are always friendly. but, the meats are not that good, bread isn't anything special.... maybe i tried the wrong sandwiches? well, i get what i like, and firehouse doesn't make them very good in my opinion. i just don't get the hype."}
{"text":"Yuck!!! I witnessed a staff member eating while making sandwiches. He even had his gloves on and they touched his mouth. Agree with other comments, staff is young and not professional. Owner better look at tapes and get it together."}
{"text":"Good subs but they are pricey.  They do not skimp on meat that's for sure.  Place is loud and could be cleaner but the service is fast, very fast.  I ordered at 1145 and had my sub by 1150.  Coke mixup machine and a tea machine as well.  Wish they had better sides other than chips though, over all its a good sub."}
{"text":"This sandwich just opened up right around the corner from me a few weeks ago.  So the other day I decided to try it.  It was an awesome experience!!!  I love the atmosphere of the whole firehouse theme!!  When you walk in on your left there are turnout coats hanging up and on the tops of the tables there is a Dalmatian print.  Behind the register there is an American flag made with the names of the people who died on 9/11.  The items on the menu had clever names to like the hook and latter or the engineer.  The sandwich I had was a ham sandwich on a white roll.  Very good!!!  The customer service was also very good.  They were friendly and when they call your name when your food is ready they bring it to you.  Now that's customer service at its best!!  If you have a small child they give them one of those red party fire fighter helmets!!!  I would highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Firehouse subs for almost 8 years, since I ate at one of the very first restaurants in Jacksonville, Florida. When I stopped traveling for work, Firehouse was one of the chains that I missed the most.  One day, I was at Cars & Coffee across Eastern, stomach growling, grumbling, nay, SCREAMING for food. When it gets to this point, there is no easy decision, everything and nothing sounds good. Something caught my eye as my head turned to check out a loud car, a familiar white and red sign, no, it couldn't be. Scanning actively for the sign again, staring at it incredulously, I thought I had to be imagining something in my hunger induced haze.  Fortunately, I was not imagining it! I made my way across the street to make a Hook & Ladder intimate friends with my belly in short order. Ordering my food, I brought out my trusty Firehouse punch card from the East coast and asked the lady how long they had been open. I was absolutely SHOCKED to find out that they were celebrating their one year anniversary. How could such delicious food be so close to me, and they not advertise at all?!  My go-to order is always the Hook & Ladder with a sweet tea. The heated turkey and ham, with melty cheese, mayo, lettuce and tomato just hits the spot, even if it doesn't fill me up, check the nickname, bottom-less pit, remember?  I will say that aside from the register worker, most of the staff does seem rather aloof and distant, when busy or slow, they have always been that way at this location. My sandwiches are always good, so that is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"First time eating at Firehouse Subs.  Great sandwich with fresh meat and vegetables.  Cashier was friendly and patient.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quality is diminishing every time we visit. Our first visit monthsssss ago was great! We stop here every time we head back home to California for the last 3 trips. The second & third trip I've found no guac or avocado but we just drive on since we are in for a 20 hour drive. On top of not getting the avocado I paid for, twice, today's sandwich was pretty pitiful. The workers don't seem very stoked."}
{"text":"Always greeted with a friendly Hello every time I walk through the door.  After placing my order for a meatball sandwich combo, the cashier asked if I wanted to \"round up\" the dollar amount of my purchase and donate the change to charity, which I happily agreed to do.  Of all the sandwich restaurants, Firehouse definitely has the best meatball sandwich. Add some Oven-Baked Potato Chips and a lemonade, I've have yet another wonderful experience at this location"}
{"text":"I love it here!  The sandwiches are tasty and full of flavor.  They have such a big selection.  I enjoy the Captain Sorensen, Siracha Beef, and brisket.  I enjoy the combo and the service is good.  I don' t think you can ask more from a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Great sub, clean, excellent service. I had a brisket sub which was absolutely delicious. The manager was delivering food, cleaning tables and thanking customers. For a chain, Firehouse never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are pretty good, meriting 4 stars, but they lose a star because I HATE the shakedown you get when you pay, where they \"offer\" to keep your change to fund some sort of charity or fireman's ball or something. What exactly it is isn't clear, and I'd be much more likely to contribute if they just had a little stand set up with a coin drop and explanation of the cause. It's as if Jesse Jackson were the cashier. Not a guy I want to hand my money to, and certainly not letting him keep the change."}
{"text":"Let's see... I usually really enjoy the Firehouse shop, food, service, etc... And rarely write reviews unless it's absolutely the best experience or in this case the worst.    1. Let's enforce the \"employees must was hands\" but not have soap or paper towels, splendid.  2. Let's not listen to my order and get it wrong then roll your eyes at me and talk crap about me while making the second, only to forget to make it all together, helping 5 other customers that weren't even in the place before me.  3. Let's give me a soda cup for their awesome new soda machine but only allows you to choose between, diet, diet, annnnnnnnd you guessed it, diet.   4.  Where should we sit?  The tables covered in crumbs or the tables covered in crumbs... Guess we'll take crumbs.    Overall experience was terrible and has been the last two times I have been here, every place deserves another chance but you failed miserably."}
{"text":"I always see this place every time I drive by so I decided to stop and try it out..  Good very fresh"}
{"text":"Food is always awesome which is why 3stars. Service isn't really that good and def slower... that being said not really that horrible but online says open till 10 pm everyday, but I got there right at 9 and they were closed. Closed at 9.  I know they didn't have everything closed down so they should've made my order. Right at 9, come on. Have a little heart w the customer service. I work in the industry so I know last min orders suck but I would have never sent a person away right at 9. So sad"}
{"text":"I have seen Firehouse Subs in several areas and finally decided to check this one out.  I did enjoy the pastrami sandwich I had and the homemade bread for the bun.  I would definitely return to try the other choices available. The service was friendly and quick but not at the expense of quality. The customer service was a plus in helping with the enjoyment of my experience, bringing our food and friendly conversation ."}
{"text":"Came here twice and had our orders messed up twice.. not really worth the hassle or the bad costumer service. The 2nd try was enough to see it's probably just going to be that way if we keep trying to go here."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Yum!!! Yum!!! We're hooked on the Hook & Ladder! Did I say Yum?!"}
{"text":"Really delicious subs - way better than anything you would get at Subway and better than Quizno's too! Firehouse offers a couple of different meats that you won't see at the other sub places - corned beef brisket and pastrami - so avoid the usual ham and cheese. Firehouse also does things a little differently than Quizno's - they steam the meat and cheese first.  Taking the order to go, I got the \"Hook & Ladder\" for myself (ham and turkey with Monterrey Jack cheese) and the \"Engineer\" (smoked turkey and sauteed mushrooms) for my wife. Both were what they call \"fully involved\" which means, as you can guess, with all the usual toppings.  While the staff was friendly and the sandwiches were excellent, by the time I had driven them five minutes to get home, they had become a little soggy. I'm sure that it is the steamer that does it. No biggie - have it \"eat in\" rather than \"to go.\"  Try something different!"}
{"text":"This Firehouse has just opened, but it's just like others I have visited. Clean, welcoming and decorated with fireman type stuff - firehats and axes and even a giant mural depicting the nearby firehouse.  Lots and lots of seating here so there is plenty of room for you to have a table and then a buffer zone so that you don't have to be eating near anyone else. Because people have cooties, donchaknow?  Walking in the door, I had planned to have something nice and normal. Meat and cheese on some sort of hoagie roll. But dangit, their Carolina Pork BBQ sandwich on the menu board practically shouted out at me. So that's what I had. A messy pile of pulled pork BBQ and cole slaw. Delish. With a bag of chips.  This Firehouse has the Coke Freestyle machine, which I find to be useful even if I still have a boring enough drink. Hey, I happen to *like* Seltzer. You got a problem with that?"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great service. Had the hook and ladder and daughter had the Italian. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"In a rush to get lunch and I see a sign for a King's Hawaiian smoked pulled pork, pepper jack cheese, and Hawaiian cole slaw sandwich . Quite simply the best  fast food sandwich I ever tasted. It oozes with flavors and that bread puts all others to shame. I can't wait to go back and although it will be tough to not have the King's Hawaiian, I am looking forward to trying their other items."}
{"text":"After hearing the commercial a 100th time on the radio I decided to finally try this place. First impression was the shitty attitude of the girl working the register. When I finally got my club sub I was really unimpressed. I won't be coming back anytime in the future. There's way better options in Tempe."}
{"text":"We don't live far from this establishment making it the convenient choice for decent sandwiches. Fortunately, the food and the service has been consistently good. The menu is easy to follow, and making it through the order process quick enough. While I don't mind donating on occasion to charities, I get a little uneasy that they ask if i want to round up and donate to their cause every time we eat there. Somehow I feel guilty saying no if I elect not to. The dining area is a bit crowded, but it is fast food after all. Overall a great choice to get a quick meal. Tip: call ahead and order for pickup."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place to get subs at. They were so good and well worth what I paid for. Spent about $30 on my last visit here and was completely dissatisfied with what I got. Employees making the subs were too busy in their conversations to have a clue as to what they were even doing and got 2 of my 4 subs wrong. You have lost my business and have failed to respond to my e-mailed complaint."}
{"text":"The workers at this location are always so effin friendly!  Went last Saturday around lunch time and decided to try something different there ( I usually get the philly cheese steak).  I got a meatball sub HOLY BALLSACKS have you ever tried a meatball sub?? IT'S AMAZING! The bread was all soft and the meatballs were hot and it was smothered in cheese.  And I got a salad and loved it as well.  This place grows on you."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for lunch with my wife. Placed our order and the total was $33 For 2 subs a pop and chips.  Instantly I thought I made a mistake. But when I ate the sub I realized the quality was on point. Same meal at subway would have been $25. This is a premium place. The size and taste was amazing.  Generous portions. Wow. You can tell everything is fresh and the highest quality. Design of the place is also great. Super satisfied. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a quick sandwich to go for dinner. I had the Engineer sandwich and it was pretty good. Staff was friendly and fast. I will definitely come back to try a few more of the options."}
{"text":"Went to Sahara and Nellis location Firehouse Sub. First time ever going to a Firehouse... And last! Very limited selection! They didn't even have tuna!! And only 6 inch sandwiches, no foot longs! This business is supposedly owned by firemen. As a former firefighter I can say that firemen know how to eat! Apparently these guys don't know that! I guess it's back to Subway!!"}
{"text":"Yum! From the bread to the Italian dressing! Let's start with the freshness of the bread. You know it's fresh when it's so soft and fluffy. The amount of meat in the sub was huge. The sub was very juicy from the sauce but I enjoyed making a juicy mess to the last bite. My husband and I shared a large sub and while I should've stop mid way I could not find it in myself to stop. The pig in me said to keep digging in...and so I did. We'll definitely make another stop in."}
{"text":"Great location close to home! Second time at this location and our sandwiches were delicious and the service was great!   It was busy but we did not have to wait long so they must've worked out the kinks I've read about. They were staffed and ready for the lunch rush. The place was clean with the typical firehouse subs decor.  We'll be back to this location over and over again!"}
{"text":"I won't step foot in this place again. Ordered the meatball sub and was up all night. Won't go into explicit details. I know it was the sub cause it was the only thing I had eaten within almost seven hours before that. Maybe it's just the meatball, but proceed with caution."}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Firehouse!\" says every employee in the ENTIRE BUILDING!   Geez Louise....I hope this isn't the new \"corporate smile\".  I get it.  It's better than being treated like garbage...but wow owners, do you really have to hold the gun to your employees' heads to say that?  Anyway, things I really love about this place---great subs and all the hot sauce options you can dream of.  They didn't have the Pickapeppa sauce when I last showed up, but I dealt with it and decided to try one of their brand sauces...wow.  They should just put that in every single sandwich it's so good.  I love the Freestyle Coke machines.  I think the sandwiches are too expensive for what they are.  The subs are good, but if I'm throwing down more money because they provide this amazing \"customer service\" of everyone inauthentically shouting \"Welcome To Firehouse\", I'm not interested.  I came here with a coupon for this place.  If you're charging that kind of money for a subs, make them a little bigger and be liberal with your sandwich ingredients.  I am giving this place a 4 star rating--it get's a 3.76 rating in my book, but I'll just do what the cashier usually asks me to do...even it out to donate to a good cause.  I usually say \"no\", but I like that they try to give back to the community."}
{"text":"Great food! The sandwiches have great flavor and taste. Given that America now is a fast paced country and we want things fast, at a restaurant such a this it should have a positive vibe to the shop. Walked in to the shop, one person said hello. Ordered my sandwich and the cashier (SABRINA) Did not give time for us to look at what we wanted and/or what we didn't want on our sandwich. Rudely cut me off with every word I was trying to say. The food was good but filling the position atmosphere of the firehouse sub feelings should be priotitized."}
{"text":"I asked about a vegetarian option, and I never did see it up on the board! But it was great! Cheese, grilled onion, peppers and mushrooms with some fresh veg as well. It was a little soggy on the bottom but still tasty! The workers were very nice- efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"I like Firehouse's subs a lot, but my experience at this location has been pretty bad.   During my most recent visit I was treated poorly by the staff. I walked in a little after 7 on a Thursday night and all of the employees were hanging out in the back room. I stood there waiting and one of the guys saw me and put his indexing finger up motioning for me to wait. He the impatiently walked over and grabbed one of his female coworkers and told her to help me.  Good food. Bad vibes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub shop! Best Italian sandwich out there! Everything was fresh and tasted delicious. Love the toasted bread and steamed meats and cheeses. The restaurant is immaculate, staff is super friendly and accommodating. it's a father & son team and the service is fantastic. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Smokehiuse Beef & Chedder Brisket sandwich. It was good. Good choice for a quick moderately priced sandwich"}
{"text":"The restaurant appears to be clean. A sanitation grade of 98.0 is posted.  The employees were nice and the food was warm and good. I love their Italian sub.  They had enough employees working to get the food out quickly."}
{"text":"Okay so in full disclosure, I did go in to grab a take out sub 15 minutes before close cause that's when I got off work and I was starving. Also I do go to this location frequently for lunch.   That being said they get a 3 because generally my experience is a 4ish but this time would have been a 1.  We got there and everyone was clearly pissed we came in. Two of the kids working didn't even acknowledge us. Then a third come from the back clearly irritated with every question. My bread choice apparently caused him extra irritation.   Also a dumb thing I generally enjoy is the section of hot sauces for the subs. This location had like 7 of the normal 20 only 4 of which were labeled with how hot the sauce was. I know this is dumb but it's a dumb thing I look forward to. It's the little things right?  Otherwise way better then Subway, though you'll get nicer reception near closing at Subway. If you want a better sandwich and friendly service try Cheba Hut."}
{"text":"I wasn't really happy with the end product. The customer service was ok, but my sandwich was soggy and they forgot the bacon on my nieces sub,  I would rather drive further to the one off of 74 where my bread is always perfectly toasted and made right."}
{"text":"Every time  I come here I get a solid sandwich. The new containers that they use stop the sandwiches from getting soggy.  This is my go to firehouse."}
{"text":"This is my 1st time here, and I have to say they have the best meat ball sub I've ever tried. Hands down!!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this review four stars mostly because of the staff. It's a hit or miss with them at this location. However, the food is amazing each time. Their sandwiches are very fresh, and I have never left disappointed, just stuffed! The coke drink machine is pretty cool here. Strawberry water?! Yes please! :)"}
{"text":"Not being a particularly big fan of sandwiches, I really only patronize one when I'm short on time, there's nothing around, or I'm following my group.  I've only ever had a handful of great sandwiches/subs, with the only one standing out at the moment being the Air France lounge at Dulles (they also have killer rice pudding).  Wanting a quick lunch and Firehouse being across the street, I decided to give this very well-rated chain a try.  Surely they must be better than Quizno's and Subway!  The fast food set-up and ordering belies the time it takes to actually get an order.  Not sure what they do, but it takes me (along with everyone else) about 10 minutes to get my order of combo #10 - Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket sub with a bag of chips and soda.  Big plus - million choice soda machine, and I choose Grape Fanta this time.  Love that machine.  $9 for the combo, which seems a bit high but surely the sub must be fantastic.  Anyway, 10 minutes later I get my sub, and my first bite is somewhat... underwhelming.  Now, I thought the bread was really good - not great, but really good.  And the meat and cheese inside also seemed fresh and well made.  But the combination didn't quite work because the taste of the bread basically overpowered the stuff inside.  It was like having really good bread...  And the size was also underwhelming, causing me to question whether I should have paid $9 for this.  And the biggest question of all, why did it take 10 minutes to prepare this??   Firehouse is certainly a huge step up from the two aforementioned chains, and if I'm in a hurry I will probably come back here.   I'll give it a 3-star rating, but certainly with room for improvement.  Maybe it's what I ordered, and next time I should try something with more ingredients in them.  But before I do that, I think I'll try Port of Subs next, which is also across the street."}
{"text":"Huge fan of sandwich shops and Firehouse is one of my favorite chains.  The meat, bread, and veggies are all high quality and toasted nicely.  My favorite is the hook and ladder but I have tried many and never had a bad sub here.  Firehouse has a couple cool features that set it apart from some restaurants.  First of all, they have a massive hot sauce collection that is rated 1-10 based on spiciness.  Try the Firehouse hot sauce (I believe its called Datil Pepper Sauce).  It is a slightly spicy bbq flavor and really adds a kick to sandwiches.  Most locations also now have Coke Freestyle machines which I think are just plain cool.    I wish there was a Firehouse closer to me so I could eat here more but for now I will have to stick to tracking them down on road trips."}
{"text":"I live and work close to this location so I frequent it quite often. I know most people are only inclined to use Yelp when there is a problem so I wanted to take the time to write a positive review because I LOVE this place. Not only is the food great, but I love the people. As mentioned, I work close. I go in to this location for lunch as often as possible (which would be SO MUCH MORE OFTEN IF YOU DELIVERED - all of us at work are wishing for that day! we often get stuck with another sub place just because it delivers but we all yearn for your sandwhiches) the staff is friendly and you can tell they attract a good clientle. A few regulars always come in which they know by name and are welcomed and it just makes the whole place feel nice. And the manager, a woman whom I cant remember the name of right now, is so on it. She is nice, welcoming, always is pleasant to converse with, and came to my business park and promoted the company with coupons. SMART. (We are just such a small office we don't meet the quota for catering or we would!)   All in all, I just wanted to write that this place is great, the food, the people, the atmosphere, and I LOVE the painting on the wall too!   Only fix is the delivery ;)"}
{"text":"Long wait for one salad.  Dining room was not full so was expecting a short wait.  Girls behind line kept asking how to make each sandwich.  Employee out on the floor cleaning with gloves on would handle food with the same gloves.  I was able to talk to one of the managers.  The manager corrected the behavior right away.  Food is good."}
{"text":"fuck this place. I ordered a make your own sub and halfway through telling the cashier what I wanted on my sub she cut me off to ask if my order was for here or Togo.. which I already told her. after I ordered I went to the counter to let the kids making the sandwiches know what I wanted on my sandwich since the girl at the cash register was less than interested. they looked at me like I had another head growing out of my shoulder even though I made sure I was nice and polite. after that.. we waited 25 minutes for two subs only to find out they were soggy and gross when we got home.. wow. get your shit together guys. also.. turn the air conditioner on"}
{"text":"Firehouse subs is AMAZING! Frankly I am shocked to read the other less than positive reviews. Everytime my family and I go here we are greeted by everyone. \"WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE!\" is what they cheer. The subs here are truly set apart from the rest. I used to always go to Subway after class, well now that has changed. my personal favorite is the New York Steamer: Corn beed and Pastrami... YUMM!!! can not be beat. They also have one called the Beef and cheddar Brisket, its a rather unique BBQ sandwhich with an awesome flavor.  I think what suprises me most about this place is how much bigger the sandwhiches are than other places. Definately get your money worth.  The employees there are amazing, they are always willing to answer questions and the cashiers are some of the friendliest I have ever met at a resturaunt establishment.   My little brother loves the Coke machine they have there. Its all computer run with a touchscreen. it looks like something out of the future. it has more sodas and flavors than i know what to do with.  Definately make the trip to Firehouse! You will not want a sub from anywhere else."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops I have ever visited... And I have visited a lot! This place makes most Subway Restaurants look very amateurish and disappointing. The sandwiches are exceptional, quality as good as it gets, and the level of service is beyond what a business like this should be expected to deliver... I highly recommend Firehouse Subs... Once you try this place, you will go back."}
{"text":"Bad night there tonight. First the order was wrong had to turn around and get the correct sandwich. Second one was made to order correctly sadly it was not edible by the time I got home. Must have not toasted the bread or dumped a half gallon of dressing on it because the bread was soaked through and it was grossly inedible. Fell apart and was turned off by the site of it. Gave it to the dog. Too bad large steak n cheese. Second time I've had an issue there. Gave them a second chance and was let down again. Won't return to this location ever again. I'll head to the one on S Rainbow instead."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I must say this is one of the worst firehouses I have been too. I went today and got lunch, used some points and the girl who had to stop making a sandwich to help me because her co workers were \"busy\" was awesome. However I asked for a little ranch on my sandwich and they drowned it in ranch. It wasn't even edible I scraped off the entire layer of cheese(meatball) just to remove the ranch. So my sandwich wasn't that good. And to top it off when I asked the gentleman behind the register for a plastic hat for my 4 year old. He huffed and seemed annoyed that he had to get a cheap plastic thing for a child. Serious lacking of customer service. And quality control. I am not saying I won't return to firehouse, but I am saying I won't return to this firehouse ever again. Shame though I liked it when they first opened."}
{"text":"My roommate and I dropped in here for a quick sandwich. I had the Hawaiian bread pulled pork and slaw, and he had the brisket sandwich. The food here is always pretty good and these were no exception.  We did manage to sit with an angle into where they did the prep. The floor was covered in food, and my roommate saw a girl take a wet rag and squeeze it all over the floor and some food containers.....ewww. All the workers were teenagers, no manager around. This is not good. 4 stars for the sandwich, -1 star for the scene behind the counter."}
{"text":"wow! condiments galore! I've never seen so many sauces in one place :P  this was my first time experiencing this chain restaurant. I love how their rolls are made! You get a non messy perfect ratio of meat and bread in every bite!  Overall both my husband and I enjoyed our sandwiches and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time at any Firehouse Subs. They steam the meat to keep it super fresh and moist. Very good job and we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my go-to meal for a quick lunch or dinner option! It's flavorful, fresh, and filling!  I love the sandwich sizes, their pickles, the free kids fire hats, and their philanthropic donations. It's a little pricey compared to their competition, but I'll pay more for quality and convenience.   All that's missing is a Dalmatian tied to a fire hydrant outside their front door."}
{"text":"I love a good sub but I was getting real tired of places where they use tweezers to peel off slices of meat so thin you can see through them and then carefully counting them to make sure you don't get an extra slice. God forbid!  Needless to say a good sub was hard to find....  Until now! Firehouse subs are frick'n DELICIOUS!!!! And what a cool place! I love the Firehouse decor and the customer service is spot on. Although my first time there they DID forget to put on the extra toppings I requested, but after the first bite all was forgiven. The bread was warm and fresh, and the meat! Ahhhh the meat!  Tender, tasty and stacked high.   Firehouse subs might cost a little more than the others but when you consider that your sub is nearly twice the size of the others, has fresher ingredients and is waaaaay tastier, you just can't go wrong.   Good stuff Firehouse! I now have a new favourite sub place."}
{"text":"Unreal went back to give them another try. Bought a meal and a kids meal. I asked for a piece of bread for my other son who is super picky, they charged me $2.79 for a piece of bread 2 inches by 2 inches. I'm done with this place. I mean I didn't want it for free but they charged for a sandwich and just removed meat and cheese........ Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Sorry to see the poor reviews. I had a great customer service experience tonight. The guy that took my order was very friendly and then another guy helped me out to my car with all my food. I'd pick this over Subway down the street even though it's twice the price."}
{"text":"First timer. Super friendly. Went over the menu. Made suggestions. Toasted bread, hot meats. Salads. Smells delicious! Like hot sauce?  Zillions of bottles to choose from. Dining room is a fun firehouse decor."}
{"text":"Horrible outcome. First time eating here and definitely last. My husband waited over 20 minutes for two subs, (not busy at all) and when he asked what was taking so long they said \"oh your subs are right here\" didn't even tell him the bag was ready to take. My turkey sub was gross, thrown together and with cheese even though we asked without, and hubbys steak and cheese was all steak and no cheese."}
{"text":"First time there.   It was a holiday and I needed a quick bite and they were the only place open.  So I tried the chopped salad with grilled chicken.  It was \"A\"wful   The chicken was cubed cold and old. I was hungry so I ate it.  It didn't take long for my stomach to tie up in knots.   I'm sill sick ... Just stay away."}
{"text":"We went to this location and got $20 worth of food and drinks. We ordered all the fixings. We were asked 2x and advised both times we wanted all the fixings. We get home 15 min away and the sandwiches have nothing on them. We called and spoke the manager Lisa. She told us to come back in to have the sandwiches remade. We aren't driving back 15 min one way then back home again another 15 min for fixings on a sandwich that should of been done right the first time. We requested a credit. She put us on hold and after several minutes she told us she talked to the owner and they said to come back in. Once again we aren't driving 30 min to get what should of been right the first time!!  Very disappointed as a big fan of firehouse subs."}
{"text":"We visited at lunchtime. We had a short wait for our food and it was well worth the wait. The hot steak and cheese sub was delicious. The roll was soft and the steak, onion, pepper and cheese was warm and not greasy at all. They offer the largest selection of hot sauce I have ever seen.  I am an unsweetened iced tea lover and they have the best thirst quenching tea. My grandmother made awesome sweet tea when I was a child and they have the only sweet tea that taste like hers.   There is no doubt we are return customers. I will even stop by for just an iced tea!"}

Great marketing.  Decent space, if not a bit deep - it makes me feel like I should be ordering as it's made (ala Cafe Rio/Chipotle/Subway) but their preferred method is the whole \"tell us how you want it\".  Would I eat here, again?  No.  Probably not on my own volition, but if someone asks if I want a Hook and Ladder, sure.  I'll have one.  But I'd rather have a Jimmy John's/Subway if I have the choice."}
{"text":"My sandwich was soggy my lettuce was scarce and it was shredded so thin it just made everything wet! a foot long with three thin tomato slices yuck  the pastrami was seasoned well but the bread was so gross that all i ate out of the sandwich was the meat and onions?  just a waste basically"}
{"text":"Fun and friendly staff (okay, all the women working there are really cute, too) Great food, televisions all over the place. Nice place to meet other for lunch or take a break to get some work done."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch yesterday and ordered the Hook and Ladder sub.  Food was fresh and made perfectly with no problems. It is rather expensive but it has the best food quality of any sub shop that I've been to. Excellent hot subs at this location !! I highly recommend Firehouse Subs !!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to get a good sandwich for lunch.   I do a lot of things in the Main Line area but when I'm around Frazer I stop in and get a hot sub from Firehouse Subs. They have a large selection and reasonably priced. The building is clean and the staff is friendly. I gave it 4 stars because it's pretty good for a chain sandwich shop but definitely not the best. Just good for a quick easy lunch."}
{"text":"1st time going to this location and as usual we had a complicated order.  We had to go back to get it corrected and this is what ended up being the best part of this visit. They were extremely helpful and offered to remake the sandwiches immediately before we even told them why we were back. This was amazing customer service and we will definitely be back to this location in the future.  Plus the sandwiches were great."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant every time we go the food is delicious the environment is calm and it's not overcrowded or even crowded. Their soda machines are consistently working well in their sodas also taste delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place, foods always good. Their app helps you save. The customer service is good! Always clean and my soda is never flat!"}
{"text":"My last review for Firehouse was 5 stars but they recently stopped offering tuna salad. What kind of sub shop does not offer tuna?! When I questioned about a meatless option I was told they were adding a new Mediterranean sub with artichokes & hummus which sounds absolutely disgusting. Unfortunately with tuna no longer an option, Firehouse has lost a very loyal customer."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Firehouse for years now. It's always delicious. This location is very clean and the workers are nice! I just wish they had avocados....."}
{"text":"First of all, kudos to a sandwich shop for being open until 10 pm. I was very impressed with my first firehouse subs experience and have been very satisfied with my repeat visits. The subs are always delicious and best served nice and hot. Their meatballs are fantastic and my picky one year old daughter loves them.   My wife and I find the mustard that they use to be way too strong and tends to overpower the sandwich. We always ask for our subs without the mustard, but maybe that's just us. The service has been great and they have been very helpful meeting the dining needs of my little ones every time. Bonus points for having the coke freestyle machine, but where's the ginger ale?!?!?!  Love this place. We will be returning often."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to a Firehouse Subs, and I liked what I discovered here.  I ordered a Medium Firehouse 'Hero\" Sub sporting hot Virginia Ham, roast beef, turkey, Smoked Provolone, tomatoes, lettuce, White Onion, and oil & vinegar on a warm Wholewheat Roll, along with Miss Vickie's Sea Salt & Vinegar packaged Potato Chips.  The vegetables were all fresh, meats juicy from application of vinegar & oil, and cheese nicely melted over the meats.    Service was friendly.  And the atmosphere was nice and casual.  A Rat Pack fire crew wall painting was rather cool.  And, diners were seated at Dalmatian spotted wooden tables.    How fitting for a firehouse ambiance!  I expect to be back."}
{"text":"Hook and ladder or the meatball sub...enough said! The service at this location has always been great. Mmmmm thanks guys keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I never heard of this sandwich chain before and since I was starving after my flight, I decided to check this spot out. As I entered, the employees were super friendly and explained everything really well. Everything looked great on the menu, but I ended up getting the Engineer. This toasted sandwich comes with smoked turkey breast, swiss cheese, and sautéed mushrooms, mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a kosher dill pickle on the side. The sandwich was quickly made and was perfect to satisfy my hunger. Overall, if you're looking for an upgraded sandwich experience then forget about Subway and come to Firehouse!"}
{"text":"We always have great service & good food. We also like the desserts.  Sometimes we order online & Go pick up."}
{"text":"Same great taste and service as the Oshawa location. Staff is friendly and the location is very clean. The ingredients are fresh and high quality. Love the collection of hot sauces!  The only reason I gave four stars is because sometimes one topping will be forgotten on my sandwich. It's always been corrected but it should be correct the first time."}
{"text":"i'm not much of a sub fan, but i was blown away by what i got.  it was the new york steamer and it was the right amount of juicy without soaking through to the bread.  it melted in my mouth and tasted awesome.  it's a firehouse theme so it was cool that there was an actual firetruck out front- and city of Mesa firemen eating there.  I guess that was just a timing thing, but my son got a kick out of it.  Plus they've got one of those fancy digital Coke machines that are all the rage.  Too bad I gave up soda a year ago.  Hey, how bout a digital beer machine..."}
{"text":"My first time here and the small Hook & Ladder was quite yummy.  The quality of the meat and freshness of the wheat bread were surprisingly good.  There's definitely a difference you can notice between the subs here and the \"$5 guys\".  I thought the decor was quite eye-catching and who can resist the back story of how this franchise was started by former firefighters?  Thanks to all those who have served and are currently serving by the way!    The food was great, the employees greeted you with a smile and a \"Welcome to FIrehouse Subs!!\" about entering, the store was clean and next time I'm in the mood for a quick sandwich on my travels, I will be sure to add Firehouse Subs to my list.  Lastly, for those with kiddo's...the kid's meals come with a cute red firefighter hat.  How adorable?!?"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are delicious, but there is one problem....Why is it that only the fire department and police officers get a discount in Las Vegas? I am in private EMS, and even when in uniform I am told that there are no discounts for us. Police, Fire and EMS are a TEAM... we work together as public safety guardians! Please fix this error!"}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs is a great place to eat a tasty sandwich.  The subs are hot, but much better than Quizno's.  This location is very friendly and there is just an abundance of hot sauces.  Maybe 50+, could be more.  You could get the same sub and have a different meal each time.  I enjoy their cherry limeade, which is basically a cherry drink where you squeeze your own limes to add the tang.  It gets pretty busy during lunch time, and they crammed a lot of tables into a small space, but usually people move in and out so seating isn't an issue."}
{"text":"I am new to Firehouse Subs and I can say I'll be going back there a lot for sure. Nice to have a hot sauce collection (won't find that at Subway or Quiznos). Also a nice touch having some flat screens for my viewing pleasure. Reminds me of hero places on the east coast."}
{"text":"Ordered over phone. They said 10 mins. I arrived in 15; order not started yet. One girl was restocking chips, and the other one told me she was cleaning up a flood in the back. I understand that things happen, but she wasn't really apologetic, didn't offer a concession or upgrade for me having to wait when my order wasn't even started yet, and it seems the girl that was restocking the chips could've been making my sandwiches while the other girl was cleaning up the so-called flood in the back. I was not a happy camper."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to a Firehouse when I lived in Chandler and while I am not always big on a hot sandwich the meatball sub is the only thing I get! I've had the roast beef and it is just as tasty but the bread and melted cheese on top of the meatballs is just delicious! And having a dad that LOVES sweet tea when I discovered they had sweet and unsweetened ice tea I knew I would visit frequently! Firehouse is my go to for meatball subs, not to mention I live so close to one now."}
{"text":"Best subs. A little pricey but worth it. Service is quick and friendly. Easy access from the beltline."}
{"text":"Hot subs, hot sauces, million mix a match Coke machine, and friendly service with a smile and eye contact.  Wow, like this place for sure.  Nice simple menu to keep things going, good choices though, including a hot veggie sandwich.  Located on SE corner of 67th ave. & the 101 next to ACE Hardware.  Can't miss it."}
{"text":"First off, I love their sandwiches. I always get the Turkey, ranch and bacon. But, I cannot stand the new Coke machine all these places are getting. Every drink comes out tasting like it has lime juice in it. What's up with that? Even if I let it run for a few seconds it is nasty. I cannot eat there because of this reason. Too bad because the sandwiches and staff rock! I guess it's take out or nothing."}
{"text":"Not sure how someone that comes in after me gets their order before mine.  Think the workers need to concentrate on making food instead of discussing 80's music videos. To many bad experiences here, won't repeat."}
{"text":"Great shop with good variety.  Love all the hot sauce varieties available.  Never had any problem with the service.  Friendly and open to requests.  One of the \"management\" guys stopped by the building where we've been working in town on and off for the last couple of months with coupons.  I wouldn't have known about this place otherwise so that was cool.  Sandwiches are good and ambiance is nice.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I like a lot of their subs but their steak and cheese is the closest you can get to a Philly cheesesteak. I change my order on this one, extra meat, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and no sauce. Makes it a perfect Philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good here, it's just a little pricey. The service was very friendly and it didn't take long to get our food. I'll probably visit again if I'm in the mood for subs."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you like a warm sandwich for a change.  The environment is naturally lit up with sunlight, employees well cater to everyone. I love the arrangement of the condiments is up front, and to the right hand corner is the soda fountain, lots of seating in the establishments and it is a decent place to relax and have a meal during lunch time."}
{"text":"Yes!!! I am so happy this is open!! My husband and I love Firehouse, so when I was driving by and saw the sign saying there was a Firehouse in RR, I nearly lost it! After moving from Columbus to west CLE two years ago, one big thing we were still missing was Firehouse Subs. And now, we have it!  Everyone here is so nice and welcoming, the food is delicious, and the restaurant clean. My husband loves the spicy meatball sub, and I'm more of a Hook and Ladder fan. I'm not sure what it is, but their ham here is freaking delicious! It's perfectly sweet and juicy. Truthfully, all of their meat is really good, and I love their warm and toasty bread.  If you want a delicious hot sub, I HIGHLY recommend trying Firehouse!"}
{"text":"Great place...friendly service!  My husband and I enjoyed our sandwiches but thought the bread was a little soft and flimsy for the stuff inside...gonna try the white bread next time."}
{"text":"Friendly employees, a great menu and yummy, fresh sandwiches! I couldn't be more thrilled with the free birthday sub! Just show your license and the free sub of your choice awaits!  I had a sandwich from the new lighter choices menu, the Siracha roast beef. So good, and spicy hot sauce hit the spot! Really tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"My favorite sub place, most firehouses do a good job and have good service some are eh. but overall I love firehouse!  Italian is awesome! best one."}
{"text":"I'm sitting down eating my sub right now, and the dining room is gross. I had to wipe off a table to eat. The beverage station has like 3 things in it. Nobody welcomed me in the store. The woman has her hair down. The boys shorts aren't tucked in. This place is dirty. Not coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to come here every once in awhile when we're craving hot subs because they're pretty good here and there are tons of hot sauces to try with our subs! I always get the New York steamer and my husband gets the philly cheese steak sub and we swap half and eat one of each kind. The service is pretty fast and friendly, can't complain there. The soda machine is pretty cool because you can select any flavored soda. If you love hot sauce, you'll love their selection! We found that the Marie Sharp habanero pepper hot sauces taste the best and has the best flavor. Great tang and a good kick!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Good place, I like the concept and how it was started by two brother firefighters.  This place can get crowded during lunchtime [in a good way] their sandwiches have people coming back and their service is quick and efficient.  The parking lot can get a little cramped and tight, but other than that it's a good place to go for a sandwich, chips, and a drink."}
{"text":"Pretty typical Firehouse Subs here... the only exception is that you are probably used to driving up to a location, parking, and walking in.  Since this Firehouse is in the EpiCenter... depending on where you are coming from, park in the EpiCenter Parking Deck and take an elevator up.  Since I work downtown and walk everywhere, I usually just use my two feet to get here.  When you walk in, you are instantly greeted by the friendly folks that work here and also the smells of sandwiches and other hot subs they are preparing.  You have to make your way to the back to order at the registers.  The line usually moves pretty fast, unless you have those folks that can't decide what they want and just stand there staring at the large menu on the wall.    Like all Firehouse locations, this one has a Coca Cola Machine that lets you choose your drink creation....  I usually try something new other than the regular flavors of soda.   Strawberry Sprite isn't bad.  Your sandwich comes out in a couple of minutes and you are chowing down in no time.  A decent lunch option.  Lately they have been asking to \"round up\" your total amount so that the change can be used for charity.  Pretty smart - you can easily say no too... they don't put pressure on you at all."}
{"text":"Going to Firehouse Subs, you always know you will get a filling meal pretty quickly.  The sandwiches are decently priced and I always get chips and a drink to get a big gulp of their Cherry Limeade.  Most times I mix the cherry limeade with sprite to cut a bit of the sweetness out and give it more carbonation - it's actually a pretty fun game to play with yourself in mixing the \"perfect limeade combo\".  Walk in, order at the counter and they will call out your name and bring you a nice hot sandwich.  Along the order counter there are a ton of various hot sauces to choose from.  I haven't tried any yet since I think the flavor of the sandwiches are great and don't need anything extra."}
{"text":"The subs here are wonderful.  Full of flavor and just plain FULL.  Unlike some other sub places that put a couple slices of meat and a cheese on a roll, Firehouse stuffs their sandwiches.  They also steam their meats which is an added touch.  The rolls come out soft and chewy.    This location gets busy for lunch so be prepared to wait to order.  Also they have one of those new computerized coke dispensers so be prepared to wait for that as well.  If you're an newbie to these machines, it may take a minute or two to figure out what to do.  But you get the hang of it.  This is probably one of the 3 better sub chains in my opinion."}
{"text":"I don't eat at Firehouse much but this was my Plan B for lunch when the line for Panera was out the door.  I am still not too familiar with Firehouse's menu so it takes me a while to decide on what I want.  This time around, I went with the meatball.   It was decent, about 5 small but flavorful meatballs but I was craving a bit more sauce.  I guess I need to go to an Italian place for that. Everything was steamed so it was soft and easy to bite into.    Firehouse has one of those fancy coke machines.  I'm still old school so I spend too long trying to figure out how to get ice out.  (Hint: There should be instructions somewhere).  And then trying to decide on a drink takes forever.  So at a busy lunch time, you hold up the rest of the line trying to decide what combination you want.  I went with the Cherry Limeaid and diet sprite which I should have used more Diet Sprite because this drink was way to sweet for me.    Anyway, firehouse is decent.  The staff is always friendly here.  I just don't know if I can pass up my other favorite sub joints for this.  But it's a good change once in a while."}
{"text":"Awesome crew and always friendly. Subs are fresh and hot every time. Owner Vinney is a great guy also and very friendly. Keep doing what you are doing."}
{"text":"Favorite firehouse around town, people are always friendly! Clean! Food is always good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The bbq beef brisket is to die for. Very clean, friendly staff, and yummy foods. Yep, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I have to say this is the best location on Eastern! The general manager rocks! He truly cares about his customers, staff and the store. The energy in the restaurant is great! Styran takes care of everyone in the location.  If you want a quick warn hearty lunch stop by, grab a number 4, the Italian. Also, there is state of the art coke machine, it has 100's of different flavors. The fresh brewed iced tea is the best I have ever tasted. There is a great assortment of chips, cookies and brownies as well.   The parking is nice, there is always room to grab a good spot with no worries. Don't forget your bucket of pickles and to round the change up so you can donate.   Be sure to take the survey on the bottom of the receipt so you are able to get a free 32 ounce drink.   Be sure to recognize management!! They rock!!"}
{"text":"Recently ordered an chicken Italian salad. It was great, lots of chicken, salami, veggies, and the lite Italian dressing was good. If you are in the mood for a salad, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great subs with lots of different options to choose from! Love their hot subs the best!"}
{"text":"They need to learn how to take care of their pick-up customers better at this location.... slow service here.  One positive not since they hadn't even started my subs they were warm when I got them 20 minutes later...."}
{"text":"Craving a delicatessan style sandwich and not finding one in our area. So we popped into Firehouse Subs on a Saturday afternoon and they were hopping busy. Gave our order to the friendly clerk and waited (and waited and waited and waited) for our order. The sammies were quite good and definitely worth the wait. Soft bread roll and a tasty turkey sandwich. The dill pickle was crisp and cold. Would I stop in here again, you bet I would. But... I'm still craving that deli sandwich."}
{"text":"Great service. When calling in orders it is always ready right in time. Great when u are in a hurry. Their meatball sub is a family favorite. Salads are always crisp and full of vegetables. I highly recommend eating here or ordering from here when you are in a rush."}
{"text":"I am not sure why, but I keep coming back here. I really like the food and the hot sauce bar is my favorite. They are a friendly bunch with good food."}
{"text":"Same subs offered at the other Firehouse Subs locations, except this one is still brand spanking new!  They have a lot of staff working, but most seems to still be working to get their sea leg. But they are all very friendly, and trained to greet guests cheerfully when one does walk in or leaves.  While I was waiting for my Firehouse Meatball sandwich, I noticed that I was the only customer there (2:50pm on a Wednesday). So the current guest to employee ratio is at least 1:11! (there might be more people working in the back that I didn't see).  Speed of sandwich prep was good, but not Jimmy John fast. To their defense, the ingredients were all cold of the sandwich I ordered at Jimmy John, and they have to make a hot meatball sandwich for me.  Once it was prepared my to go order was delivered to my table where I was drafting this review.  My sub was tasty, and the value is comparable to their sandwich-making competitors.  If I am in the area and in the mood for sandwiches, I would stop in again.  (Note: At previous location of Las Vegas Grille. Same parking lot as Swish Shabu Shabu)"}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to give this place a try, after our first two options were closed already.  The store was clean and has nice themed decorations.  The staff was proficient at their job and the sandwich order was prepared and delivered to the table quickly.  This was my first and only visit to any Firehouse Subs, so it took me a few minutes to finally decide on ordering the Steamer (#3) combo that I upgraded from med to footlong for an extra $2 or you can also 2x the meat on the medium size sandwich for $2.  It was a good idea to upgrade the size, as my friend who just ordered the regular combo was still hungry after polishing off his medium sandwich, his bag of chips and the drink.  I was satisfied was the sandwich, but it is on the pricey side. ($7.59 for the large sandwich +$2.19 for the combo + tax = $10.58)  I still think I would get a better deal at Togos (if I was back in California) and Quiznos (especially with coupons and online promos they email). So in terms of value, I think it lags behind the other sub shops.  Flavor and taste-wise, I thought it was good.  And the best part was trying out the assortment of bottled sauces that are available for patrons to try.  My favorite is the African origin Puri Puri sauce.  Anyway, I am glad I gave it a try, but highly doubt that I will return in the future.    Decor:  4/5  Themed decorations that you know is professionally implemented.  Service:  4/5  They did their job professionally.  Taste:  3.5/5  Pretty good sandwich (Steamer, which is supposedly their top seller).  Value:  2.5/5  On the pricey side, and the portion is on the smallish side.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Simply so good. Service is wonderful. Clean place. Just perfect for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Went in to purchase the Italian sub was extremely disappointed took the top of the bread off the sandwich to find half of piece of salami and a half of piece of each meat the sandwich was all bread. Total waste of money will never go back in there again."}
{"text":"I've been to firehouse subs more times than I can count and I've enjoyed every sandwich I've had there. I've tried every numbered sub on the menu except the meatball but that's only because it's just to messy to eat during the work day. Definitely the best sub shop in Champaign/Urbana!"}
{"text":"This is my time here at  fire sub , it's so good  Very courtesy service  Neat & clean i love this place"}
{"text":"Not pleased.  Ordered over the phone.  They have an area for these orders to be picked up.  Cashier ignored me and kept ringing up the walk-ins.  Waited for about 7 minutes and left.  Won't go there again.  Don't have the time to waste on lunch hour."}
{"text":"We had heard great things about these sub's so we were excited to finally try it.  The décor us fun and all things firehouse. We got some sub's which were hot and toasty with plenty of meat, cheese and condiments.  The small sub is really quite ample as well.  I have to be honest I didn't find anything all that out of the ordinary there; the classic sub fare.  The service was very good and very fast which was nice.  It is a nice chance from Subway or Jeresy Mikes and the like.  I will definitely try it again but I doubt I would go out of my way to seek them out.  The price was a little more than I like but for a warm sandwich that is somewhat understandable."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new place, heard good things about firehouse subs ordered the steak and cheese ended up no cheese also a turkey sub with lettuce tomato and mayo we live about 15 minutes away by the time we were ready  to eat the turkey sub was so soggy you could hardly consume it always believe in second chances hope the next time it will be better staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I noticed this place about two months ago when I saw their \"opening soon\" sign. I was in the area the other day and decided to try them out for lunch.   They have an interesting firefighter theme going on. I remember seeing a fire hose, firemen gear, and various pictures in the restaurant. The employees were very friendly and seemed to enjoy working there.  The menu consists mainly of hot subs and maybe 2 choices for cold subs. I decided to go with the medium Club on a Sub: smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, bacon, and Monterey Jack Cheese. They asked if I wanted it \"fully involved\" which was mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pickle on the side. I just asked for mustard and lettuce. Decided to make it a combo with chips and a drink as well. I paid $8.63, which is pretty expensive for a sub meal.   However, it was a very tasty meal and I enjoyed it! The ingredients that they used were very fresh and my sandwich was still nice and hot when I got home to eat.   Not that this is an issue to me, but unlike some of the other sandwich chains, you cannot see the employees making your food. You place your order with the cashier and wait until they call out your name. I waited about 5 minutes, although I did go in about 30 minutes after they opened.   Good sandwiches, but I won't be back very often because of the price. I went to their website and signed up for their newsletters and promos by email, so hopefully they will send out some good coupons!"}
{"text":"Damn good subs! No cold sandwiches here, so if that's what you're looking for, head over to JJ's or Capi's. They give you the option of white or wheat bread and toast it slightly, which makes the sandwich even better.   Equally as amazing as the sandwiches is the hot sauce bar they have! They have a spread of about 30-40 different hot sauces, ranging in heat levels, that you can try on your sammy!"}
{"text":"I love this Sub place. I first came here with church friends, they recommended this place to me. And honestly, I was so impressed. All the staffs are all well trained,very courteous and attentive to the needs and satisfaction of each customer. The store owner Ed, is a very friendly guy to everyone too. And lastly, the food is just amazingly great and affordable! I always love coming here. They always never fail to impress me. Firehouse Subs, you are will always be my favorite sub place! Thanks for always making my tummy happy with your foodie ^_^"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch, ordered a salad and it was delivered in a timely manner. The salad was good and the service was adequate. However it does appear that the local for house sub shop is still going through some learning and training issues.  I placed my order including a large tea, Received my order with a small tea. However I was not charged incorrectly.  The individual that was with me ordered a sandwich, and a drink. Her saying sandwich included items that she had asked to be left off however, she just remove the items to keep from having to consider sending the sandwich back.  This seems to be the normal here lately when we place an order as this is happened many times. I think that the local fire house subs needs to spend some additional training, especially on the cash register, or the intake person."}
{"text":"I love Firehouse subs, food is awesome and they always remember my name which is awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Ah, Firehouse...I forgot how good you were. I'd not visited you since I lived in Charlotte.   This location is on Indian School near the Sprout's -- I stopped here for take-out one night after grocery shopping when I didn't want to cook when I got home. The employees were helpful and there's plenty of seating.   Every sub I've had here is good. Skip Subway and come here."}
{"text":"I love the Hero Sub here. I'm always greeted with a friendly smile and usually by not just one employee, usually every employee welcomes me into the restaurant. Being from the south this reminds me of a place back home that no other place around here rivals and the hospitality is up there as well. I'm a lifer.   The brownies are delicious. they have baked potato chips so you can feel like you're being healthy. I'm not a huge fan of the copious amounts of flavors but they do have the coke fountain machines with every flavor of everything.   ** found out by asking, that the medium hero has the most bang for your buck as far as meat servings go. Can't remember exactly how much but the medium hero is sufficient for an adult."}
{"text":"Bacon turkey and ranch is the best thing in the world!! I love it ... my wierd about meat coworker got the chicken sandwich and she loved the meet.. you can taste the good quality"}
{"text":"Just not thought it would be. All the rave but to me it was a good sub but over priced. Maybe it was the hype the commercials but after going here I think I will go back to my old sub shop."}
{"text":"I ordered their special of the day and my wife ordered one of the roast beef sandwiches she did not enjoy our meal very much I did not have much sauce for flavor of vegetables but mine was spot on and delicious was moist and had a lot of flavors going on I would definitely do this again"}
{"text":"My wife and I were totally psyched when we learned a Firehouse was going to be so close to us.  Our first experience was in Charleston, SC and we instantly fell in love with it.  Great hot and tasty subs!  They give the little ones fire chief hats with their meals.  What little kid wouldn't want to play fire chief and wear a hat?  The staff is super friendly and they have a Coke Freestyle machine with Cherry Limeade option!"}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars because the overall place is very good, but the customer service is what brought to light the 2 stars.  I went in on 11/19 for my birthday, it's actually, or at least was, a great program to get a free sub on your birthday.  When I ordered and showed my ID that it was actually my birthday, I was immediately asked if I had the rewards app, I honestly knew nothing about the app.  Now it wasn't that I needed the app, it was the way that the entire experience was approach.  Lisa S., who I was later told was the GM, basically said, \"if you don't have the app then I can't help you\" and then \"would the others in your party like to order something?\"  I was floored.  I was so shocked because this restaurant has historically had amazing customer service, over the top customer service.  So I proceeded to order my daughter a sandwich, because she really loves the Hook & Ladder, while the rest of us were deciding our options.  In the meantime I downloaded the app and it immediately showed a reward of a free birthday sandwich so I went back up to the counter, and it happened to be a very nice young man, David, that greeted me.  While I was standing there Lisa asked him to step to the side and she told him to tell me that it takes 48-72 hours before my app will update with there system, keeping in mind, I can hear this entire conversation.  So he came back and told me about the situation, it was at this time I fully decided that I was no longer going to deal with Lisa and this particular restaurant, so we left and literally went next door to a mexican restaurant that gladly provided me with a birthday discount and my party of 8 had a nice lunch together.  I could not believe how this general manager, Lisa S., could possibly be in charge undoubtedly knowing that she is in no way mature enough or professional enough to even address a customer concern or situation.  It was apparent that she was not going to try and provide a good customer experience nor was she interested in future business.  A lot of people in the restaurant saw this and a couple even commented to me on her attitude.  I am not saying that I won't return, just not when Lisa is there."}
{"text":"This is a FANTASTIC location, holy cow. My husband were traveling from PA to do a few things in the Cleveland area and needed a quick meal. We saw a busy exit and took it and ended up seeing the Firehouse Subs location there in Woodmere next to the Whole Foods. We had never eaten at one before but had heard really good things. Upon entering the store we were greeted, explained the menu and we ordered. The manager helped us, Dana I believe her name was, and she was so kind. We placed our order and waited a few minutes, and then the sandwiches came to us by a friendly employee. And then, oh my goodness. We had both ordered the Italian sandwiches on wheat and they were HUGE and fabulous. Amazingly well put-together, perfect seasonings and just the most incredible thing I had eaten in a long time. After about ten minutes the manager came to ask how our sandwiches were. I truly could not have had a better fast casual meal out. The place is super clean, with a spotless bathroom. I only regret that I can't frequent this place more, seeing as I live out of state! Thank you for a wonderful experience, Firehouse Woodmere!"}
{"text":"Only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because normally I have had great experience here! And love their food. However this is the second time my fiancé has been served a cold philly steak sandwich. This time he brought it back, asking to heat it and they offered to make a new one. So we waited another 5 minutes, no biggy. He made sure to tell them he had ordered extra cheese and no mushrooms (he can't eat them) like 5 times. He gets his piping hot sand which and starts eating it. It had tons of mushrooms!!!! By this time he was too annoyed and sat there picking them out for ten minutes. I understAnd people make mistakes, but he was very adamant on telling them no mushrooms several times to the guy actually making the sandwich. What if he was deathly allergic? I am not sure we will be back"}
{"text":"I love Firehouse Subs. I am extremely glad that they are finally in the Phoenix area after discovering them back east several years ago. I always get the Chicken Salad sub but have heard great things about all their sandwiches. I hear their Meatball Sub is the best. I also like that they help non profit's and give back monetary donations to the community. Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite near home, I finally had the chance to try Firehouse Subs. I've heard about them for a while and since I'm always looking for good sandwich options in town, I thought I'd give them a try.   Their menu is anything but extensive. They have about 10 different sandwich options, but they all sounded pretty good so we were quick to order. I got the Engineer which was great with the addition of mushrooms. Considering the prices, you get a huge footlong sandwich for the price.   On top of that, the soda dispenser is amazing. So many different varieties and mixtures to choose from. You can get pretty much any soda you can think of and you have the option of adding flavoring as well. It took me forever to pick my poison.  Service was good, the location is enormous and is clean, which is important.   When I got my food home, I was a little turned off by how soggy the sandwich was. I'm not a fan of soggy bread typically. My fella's wheat bread definitely held up better than the white I ordered, so I'll probably order wheat next time. Despite the soggy texture, the flavors were fantastic. A little bit too much meat for my taste, but I think I'm a bit odd in the respect of preferring my sandwich not as meaty. The sandwich was melty and extremely tasty.  I'll definitely be back. So happy to have a good sandwich option near home, since I don't like Quizno's, Port of Subs or Capriotti's."}
{"text":"Good subs there pretty big kinda expensive for a large but freshly made and really good. But kinda reminds me of a quiznoes sub place different that subway but that's the appeal."}
{"text":"We go to firehouse subs probably once a week! They are by far one of the best sub places around! We really only get to eat out once a week and that says a lot about this place!! The service is fast and the kids love the drink machine!"}
{"text":"After spending Halloween handing out candy with my parents in the East Valley we were super hungry on our way home, about 9:45.  I always get nervous going into places like this right before closing time because I used to work at Paradise Bakery, and I know what a pain it is to clean up after just one stupid sandwich.  These guys definitely didn't show any displeasure.  We were warmly greeted with nary an evil eye in sight.    The decor is super themed but cute.  I like the cheese thank you very much.  The employees are even in a sort of fire fighter uniform.  Their menu is diverse enough to make most people happy.  I was really hungry so I ordered the Firehouse Hero, a trio of roast beef, turkey, and honey ham.  The meats and cheese are steamed before hand to seal in extra juice and just make it really good.  Nice touch.  The bread was exactly the way I like it, sort of soft, sort of crusty.  The meats all tasted really great and were actually distinguishable from one another, unlike other certain sub shops.  The honey ham was my favorite, it was really sweet and really good.  I wouldn't mind if they brought one of these Downtown.  Good sandwiches for a good price."}
{"text":"The subs are always awesome here..today I got the hook and ladder light which is a good option if you want a lower calorie sub. On the other hand you can get the Italian sub which is full of salami and ham. Also they have a hot sauce bar that you can try a ton of different sauces which is kind of fun."}
{"text":"I have heard many positive things of Fire House subs so when I saw this location open up about a mile from my house I thought that I would try this new place . The price of a footlong sub is about $8 but for paying a little bit more than the other competitive sub places the quality of the subs with the meat bread and condiments are very high quality . The theme of the restaurant of course has fire house fire man and 911 items. This location has a large quantity of seating and the employees are very friendly and helpful . Plenty of parking just off Tatum Boulevard north of Greenway . I would recommend this place to friends and family. I will definitely come back and try the other subs that they offer"}
{"text":"I normally don't review chain restaurants, but I had to give props to Firehouse Subs.  I've only tried the hot subs and they are delicious. Perfect portions.  Its pricier than Subway and Quiznos, but definitely tastes better too.  It is very clean restaurant and the staff is over the top friendly.   It is also very kid friendly- and the kid combos come with a plastic red fireman hat."}
{"text":"We wanted sandwiches and this is near home. My parents love this place in PA, so we decided to stop by. My lady was hesitant since sandwich places usually make a great meat sub but then skimp on the veggie people. This time not so much. She said the veggie was awesome! My kid had a meatball and loves them. I had the steamer that I think I get each time. They have maybe 40 different hot sauces in bottles to try there, so I always love that, too."}
{"text":"Me & my husband came to this location & 1st off we were greeted by workers who seem like they didn't want to be there. 2nd they were basically all teenagers with No supervision. There was Constant talking among each other that we waited for our food to come out about 20/25 mins for 2 sandwich's and they forgot to give us drink cups. We had to remind them. We weren't the only guest waiting when others had to walk numerous times to the counter to ask if there food was ready. Finally got our food & drove home. We got home & opened the sandwiches club on a sub & hook and ladder which were Cold & it fell apart. The bread looked cheap & basically Noooooooo Meat & more veggies. We couldn't eat it. We end up throwing it away. Btw, the meal prices ain't cheap so you would thought you would get at least your money's worth but we were wrong.We will not be coming back to this location. They need to seriously have there Staff in More Training & Less Talking or get New Better Staff with Adult Supervision and Please Get it Together."}
{"text":"When I tell my co workers let's go to My Firehouse they always think I am funny until I walk in and I am greeted by a wonderful staff that know my name and order.  I have been going there since they opened.  I have met the owners and let me tell you they are awesome.  They set the bar high for their employees in keeping the place clean and delivering great food.  Mind you this is practically attached to my University UNLV.  So go rebels and support this local business that is just a small hike to get to.  This is a great location and Firehouse uses excellent meats in their sandwiches.  If you want a hot Sub this is definitely one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Love this place. Came in for lunch during work and the sandwich was amazing and the chick behind the counter was super hot! Bravo firehouse keep hiring hot chicks and stop hiring scrubs and dudes!!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time the other night because I had heard a lot of a good things, and this location is a straight drive down the street from my house. I ordered the Firehouse Hero on wheat which involves turkey, roast beef, honey ham, and provolone. It was delicious! They definitely didn't skimp on the meat. The price was around the same as a Subway sandwich, give or take a dollar, but definitely a jump up in quality.  They had one of those fantastic new Coke machines with 120 flavors. Sparkling water, Fanta, Mello Yello, etc., all of which were listed on their cups in case you get lost in the number of flavor combinations you can come up with. Bonus points for lots and lots of drink options.  My favorite little quirk about this place was the mini-bar of hot sauces they had on display! I'm terrible at guessing numbers, but I would say they had 30-40 different kinds. I love variety and I love hot sauce on almost everything. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any because I wanted to get in, eat my sandwich fairly quickly, and get out. That, and it was my first time there so I wanted to try it true and unadulterated. But the former leads me to my next observation:  I gave it three stars because I went in about half an hour before closing (I know, shame on me) and felt some hostility from the employees for being there that late. I used to work at a coffee shop on the Strip, so I understand what it's like wanting to go home after a full shift and having to re-wash all the equipment I just cleaned to make someone a drink so close to closing time. But I still never expected to go home any earlier than half an hour after closing. It was a job and all. At Firehouse, a group of people came in a little after I did and one of the girls let out a loud, exasperated sigh and exclaimed, \"McDonald's is open 24 hours!\" This was clear as day, and totally uncomfortable to hear as a customer.  If people wanted a McNasty FartBurger, they would go there. I think it's safe to assume we all know McDonalds' hours. But people show up at Firehouse Subs to give them their business instead because they do have good product. I'll still be back for another sandwich, but I guess I'll just have to make sure I'm hungry at a more convenient time."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in my experience here. First of all, they do not have gluten free bread like the other Firehouse Subs do. That was the entire reason we came. But we didn't want to go through the hassle of finding another place, so I ordered a salad instead. Incredibly mediocre salad, several pieces of wilted, brown lettuce, very few veggies, and brought it over without the turkey that was supposed to be on it. I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"I'm not a sub fan, but if I'm going to have one, it's at this place.  Nice service, clean and good subs.  Their bread is decent, they have hot and cold sandwiches, and their meats are good quality. And...my kids love the firemen hats they get. If it makes my kids happy, it makes me happy."}
{"text":"I went with two other people, I got a sub, and they got a sub and a salad. The sandwiches were tasty and the salad was so big my friend couldn't eat it all!!  I particularly liked the flavored soda machine. That was pretty neat. I will definitely be back for some more tasty subs! The people were also friendly as well."}
