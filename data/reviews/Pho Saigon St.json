{"text":"Surprisingly this place has the best pho I have ever had! I would come back again. 
Bubble tea was good too."}
{"text":"Came here three times so far and ordered pho each time. The second time I came was on new years day and the broth was watered down - however, they were one of a few restaurants that were open so I can't complain. The other two times, the broth was very good and there were plenty of meats. Better than Pho Viet Xpress nearby."}
{"text":"After reading multiple reviews, I was quite skeptical as I am a pretty big fan of another pho spot down the street.  I ordered the Pho special with everything in it. Might I add it was pretty good, broth is clean, portion is normal but the main thing I keep coming back for is their spring rolls. On the other hand, their curry dishes, calamari and rice dishes are nothing special, calamari portion is small,rice and meats are really dry. If I were to come back it would be for their spring rolls and pho."}
{"text":"Came here twice since it opened and enjoyed both times.  Food is fresh and portion is decent for the price.  Pho soup base is on point with the very best.  Not too busy so it is easy to find a seat.  Place is well lit and decor is modern.  Will come back again for sure.  The avocado milkshake is amazing but the viet coffee was only okay."}
{"text":"This place is new in the area so we got in to give it a try cause I loved pho. So I got my regular rare beef and beef ball pho. You can tell by looking at the picture of my pho is way too oily for the soup base and portion was very little compare to the regular restaurant I went. And also ordered a fry rice with kalbi the rice was too salty and the kalbi was ok. Basically there is so many pho places around the area that is better than this place."}
{"text":"My workplace crew makes frequent trips to the Szechuan restaurant in the same plaza, so I spotted Pho Saigon opening some time ago but only recently had an opportunity to drop by and try.  This is a keeper in my rotation of lunchtime haunts.  The restaurant is hands down the cleanest Vietnamese restaurant I have ever seen!  The wait staff were friendly and prompt, but most of all the food, which comes in generous sized portions, was fantastic.  I had the tofu and vegetable noodle soup, which was massive!  Their broth is vegetarian - this is important, as a lot of places will serve a vegetable or tofu noodle soup dish, in chicken or beef stock and not tell you that your food is not vegetarian.  It looks like the restaurant is also in Uber Eats and Skip the Dishes, based on the steady stream of food couriers during the lunch hour.  It's worth checking out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Pretty great service and environment. Nick and Jenny really put together a great menu and have put a beautiful restaurant in the north end. Ordered the Pho Special and it was exactly what we expected. Super flavourful broth that didn't feel heavy or too salty and noodles that were the right amount of chewy and smooth. Got to try the mango smoothie and it is on par or exceeds any of the best mango smoothies I've had in the city. Would totally recommend coming here if your are jonesing for some Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Food is great here. Had the fried tofu, crispy wonton and pho. Authentic viet food, great portions and attentive friendly service."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a decent Vietnamese restaurant in North York, so I'm pretty glad I stumbled into Pho Saigon St. on a random Saturday night.

We ordered some crispy tofu and shrimp wontons to start, along with a bowl of beef ball and rare beef pho and a chicken and pork rice dish for our mains. And of course, I had to have my Vietnamese coffee over ice.

The pho and rice dish were good. Solid quality, great flavours, affordable, and really hit the spot. Same goes for the shrimp wontons.

What really gave us pause was that crispy tofu, my goodness, where do I even begin? Great flavours and textures, huge portions for appetizer prices, and it had me wanting to eat more even though I was already quite full. We ended up also ordering the garlic and basil chicken wings as well, and the tenderness of the chicken and crisp and flavourful batter on the outside were delightful and completely unexpected from a quiet little Vietnamese joint near Bathurst and Steeles.

If we hadn't been so full, we might have kept ordering the rest of the appetizer menu just to complete our tour of the menu.

I'm fairly happy to have found a new Vietnamese joint to frequent in North York, and I can't wait to come back and try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is no where near the authentic Pho, the broth still has the beef smell and it is tasteless, and also they use instant pho which also has a bad smell if they do not know how to wash and cook it properly."}
{"text":"I came into Pho Saigon St with my dad after reading the reviews on Yelp and after hearing it from my friend who claimed: \"this was the best new pho restaurant in the area\".

My dad and I got seated right away and we ordered the Bun Bo Hue, crispy spring rolls and a bowl of house special Pho.

15 minutes passed and we first got our spring rolls. These were really delicious! Probably what I love most about this restaurant. They are extremely crispy, freshly made and it also comes with a large chunk of pickled carrot, which was also refreshing to cleanse our palate. 

Five minutes after we got our spring rolls, we got a large bowl of pho and a small bowl of pho. My dad and I were confused since we never ordered the large bowl of pho - we ordered the Bun Bo Hue. So we notified the waitress that there must have been a mix-up and she said she'll double check for us about our order.

About five minutes or so went by and the waitress never got back to us about the status of my dad's bowl. In fact, she was taking other people's orders and didn't look us in the eye as she walked by our table. It was only after another waitress came by, saw my dad not eating the pho and asked us what was wrong. When we told her that there was a mix-up, she looked surprised (which gave me the assumption that the previous waitress never told anyone about our mix-up) and immediately got our order in. So we had to wait another 15 minutes for my dad's food to finally come.

My dad's bowl finally came in and he wasn't very pleased with the order. There was quite a bit of soup in comparison to noodles, and there wasn't anything special about it, either. It tasted like overly citrus spicy soup. I thought the house special Pho tasted good, but I didn't think it was worth the $8.50 price tag. The portion is quite big and they provided a good amount of noodles and meat in my bowl, but I also specifically asked for extra green onions (which was not fulfilled, unfortunately).

As someone who works in customer service, I can empathize that sometimes things can easily slip out of your head as you get multiple requests from different customers all at once, especially if you're new to working in the service industry. However, it bothered me how we were simply ignored by the first waitress about our problem. We were never given any follow-up and after 5-10 minutes of waiting \"for our bowl to come\" it seemed like nothing was done about it. If the second waitress had not asked us about our problem, I don't think we would have gotten my dad's bowl. I would have appreciated a simple explanation from the waitress - it feels uneasy being left out in the dark and not knowing what is going on.

We were given a 10% discount for the mishap, which I noticed, but the lack of communication and the typical taste of the food made me feel unenthusiastic to give this restaurant a good tip after we left. I definitely would like to come back again and give it another shot, because I have a feeling it was a pure accident rather than this restaurant being bad overall. 

There are definitely great points about this restaurant, like their cleanliness, great tasting spring rolls and large portions of meals... I'm really hoping my next visit will be better!"}
{"text":"Pho is decent. A little more expensive than other places but the portion is big. The service was good, they were able to accommodate special requests and the food did not take very long to make. The Viet coffee with condensed milk came with individual filters. I would come back."}
{"text":"New place in the area so we decided to check it out! Good food, spacious and very clean. The staff are friendly.  Had the spring rolls and the crispy tofu as starters and had bue bo hue here. Would recommend. Only thing I would suggest is maybe make the logo more eye-catching--hard to tell where the restaurant is in the plaza."}
{"text":"Saw this new place and decided to give this restaurant a try based on multiple high reviews.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to its hype.  

We ordered some spring rolls and basil chicken wings as appetizers.  For the mains, I got bun bo hue and the wife had pho tai Bo Vien.

Let me begin by saying that the spring rolls were alright.  It had a very \"homemade\" taste to it.  Viet people who grew up and had their mom's spring rolls as a kid will know what I mean which isn't a bad thing.  They were a bit on the soggy side but they jam packed the filling.  Next was the basil fried chicken.  This was a major fail! The chicken was super tasteless as if all they did was fried up some chicken and tossed in some fresh basil and called it basil fried chicken.  I had to dunk the wings in my fish sauce that came with the spring rolls to actually finish the wings.  Very disappointed.  If you really want to see how a pho place does chicken wings, check out Pho Hung's fried chicken!

Anyway, let's move on to our mains.  Nothing really outstanding here.  My broth in my bun bo hue tasted very diluted and my wife's pho bowl was SUPER oily.  

Hate to do this to up and coming restaurants but due to the wide selection of pho places around, your pho and menu gotta be on point to compete and I think this restaurant doesn't stand a chance if they keep doing what they do."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese place really surpassed my expectations! Came here on a Saturday night and the place was pretty full, but we got a table quickly. Service is better than most pho places, and the decor is nice and most importantly CLEAN! Which, if you've been around the block, you know is hard to come by ;)

Ordered the garlic basil chicken wings, crispy tofu, and shrimp wontons as appies. All 3 were delicious!! Perfectly fried and crispy, with amazing flavours. The apps honestly make this place stand out from other pho places.

As mains, we got the pho with rare beef and beef balls, and the chicken & pork on rice. The pho had a nice savoury broth with chewy noodles, and the grilled meats were nicely flavoured as well. Next time I would love to also try their bun!

As for drinks, we tried their regular bubble tea with grass jelly and cold Vietnamese coffee. These were great pick-me-up's and was honestly surprised at how good their bbt is (not being an actual bbt cafe).

Lastly the prices are super affordable to say the least. I think this place is new so I would highly recommend checking them out before the crowds roll in!"}
{"text":"We have ordered the fresh rolls, garlic basil chicken wings, spicy calamari, short ribs with fried rice, special pho and thai green curry chicken. All delicious! I also enjoyed my vietnamese coffee and kids like their milkshakes.  Too busy eating and forgot to take pictures..."}
