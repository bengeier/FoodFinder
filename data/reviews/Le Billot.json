{"text":"Very over salted, probably microwaved too. Salmon tartar tasted like garbage..... Definitely would not return. No wonder it was completely empty. Staff was friendly and service was fast though, so that's worth one star."}

J'ai terminé par des beignets au caramel.

Abordable, délicieux. Un must"}
{"text":"This place was odd. It was beautiful, with fresh, local food and a decent menu, but it seemed to be struggling a bit, either with identity or just customers. We sat on the terrace which was 3/4 full, with barely anyone inside, and no one else really showed up the whole time we were there. There were absolutely no complaints with the food or the bread (oh my god the bread was amazing) or even the service, so I'm mostly mystified as to what's \"wrong\" with it. I'd come back if I just wanted a nice relaxing fresh meal, but not if I wanted to be in a bustling scene."}
