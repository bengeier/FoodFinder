{"text":"Found a nice Groupon to here so figured I'd give it a try. While the physical restaurant is nothing to speak of the food if awesome! I tried the Lavell Burger, the Philly Streak, and the Soul Rolls all of which were unique recipes that I have not seen anywhere else. Even without the Groupon prices were very fair for the amount of food that I received. If you like good southern food you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stars are for the food. Everything you can't go wrong here . Soul food at its best and the prices are spot on. 

We found this place on yelp after attempting to go What-a-burger which is next door. It was closed because it was Sunday luckily we saw Lavell's right next door. So happy"}
{"text":"This is my partner's favorite casual place to eat in Charlotte. The food is southern and good. There's a good variety and the kids meal is the size as most places entrees. 

Great lemonade huge portions and friendly staff. Its located next to What a Burger on Main Street so its easy to find."}
