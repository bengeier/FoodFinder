{"text":"I'd say this would be a 4/5 Review.  I had made my first visit to Le Cafe Michi for birthday dinner this past week. It's hidden away in a tiny plaza off of Sheppard and Pharmacy.   The place has limited seating but cute. Luckily we had made reservations.   The front area has a display case of the cakes. Out of place there were also some extra goodies like handmade goods and jewellery being sold. The decor of the place tries to capture a \"cafe\" environment you'd find in Japan along with exposed brick areas that divide seating and the cake display case. In the back room was a private area that looked like a sushi bar. Along the hallway windows lined across the wall of the back room to appear as if you were peering into a cafe along a street.  When we had been seated and settled in, we ordered 3 \"dinner meals\" to share. Each came with choice of cake and either tea or coffee ; Uni Don, Chyo Chin bento, and a Chirashi. In addition we ordered another sashimi set in case there wasn't enough to go around for our family of four.  Food service was a bit slow but the patience paid off when our food arrived. The presentation of the dishes were delightful. The Chyo chin bento came in a round egg like bowl with could be separate into 3 sections (top layer was fried chicken, middle was sashimi sampler and bottom layer was Unagi don)... kind of how dim-sum bamboo steamers are stackable. The chicken was crisp and flavourful and the spicy mayo was the perfect balance for it; it was quite popular among my family. The Unagi-don was quite good also; both the rice and the Unagi contributed equally to lfavours.  The other 3 dishes (Uni don, Chirashi and Sashimi set) probably impressed me the most. In terms of presentation the sashimi sat on a very thin layer of Tamago and definitely packed with a lot of sashimi unlike a lot fo places I've been to.  Both the Chirashi and Sashimi set came with a wide variety of fish and seafood; the ones that stood out the most was the inclusion of Uni, Mentaiko (spicy marinated Pollock Roe), Abalone(I think that's what it was?), and real crab Kani. My parents loved the Yellowtail so much they ordered a second serving of it.   Uni is my favourite item on a sushi menu, and I was thrilled to try the Uni don. The uni don came with rice, but it was also drizzled with this green mixture. I wasn't clear what it was but it seemed to have a little bit of spice to it (I think it was probably something pickled) and it added that little bit of acidity to the dish that made it great.  Finally after all our main dishes were done, we ordered 3 cakes: Chocolate Sake cake, Hazelnut cake and the Tofu cheesecake. My sister was a fan of the hazelnut cake, but I was more enticed by the Tofu cheesecake and Sake cake. I did not know what to expect for the Tofu cheesecake, but it offered a light yet still rich texture which melted in your mouth.   The flavour for the Sake chocolate cake was much more bolder in flavour than the other two cakes. It was very chocolatey and moist but small hints of Sake in it. Most definitely a cake best eaten with some coffee.  I would definitely return in the future with some friends. The quality of food impressed me, and the pricing was fair. Most notably I'd come to eat Chirashi and the Uni-don again, if not to just visit this quirky little cafe."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend with the biggest love for Japanese cuisine. I was skeptical at first, didn't expect much out of this small, and somewhat hidden restaurant in scarborough.  It was a bit pricy ($140ish for three), but definitely worth getting more rounds of sashimi. The chirashi was exceptional, I think it's safe to say that their sashimi is definitely better than an average Japanese restaurant. The deserts just felt compulsory, I ordered the green tea cake, and they had so much red bean filling, which was a huge plus.    The space is quite limited, my friend reserved a day before for 5pm, and the place was packed by 7ish with more people coming in, so reserve in advance."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this restaurant for dinner on at Saturday evening ( a while ago). When we walked in they asked us if we made reservations in advance. We said no. They denied us and told us they are fully booked. Yet the restaurant was EMPTY (there was not a single customer). We are never going back there again."}
{"text":"we went there for their sushimi, but they dont serve it til five. other dish is avg. their tofu cheese cake is interesting, and can taste tofu within it, the green tea cake should be nice, but the piece I got was soaked.  this is not a must go place to me, but service is good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for lunch. It was moderately full, enough that it didn't make me want to second guess my choice of restaurant, but not as packed as I'd anticipated, as the volume of positive Yelp reviews led me to believe.   I ordered the unagi rice combo, which comes with miso soup, a salad, and a dessert. The eel was the most tender and soft unagi I'd ever tasted. I don't know if that necessarily makes it the best unagi though, but the flavour was good. It was a good sized portion -- as in there wasn't too much, which is what I find for a lot of restaurants -- and left room for dessert.   I had the tofu cheesecake for dessert and it was amazing! It was really light and smooth, and had a thin crust with black sesame bits. I'm not a huge fan of rich New York style cheesecakes, so this was right up my alley. My mother had the Earl Grey Chiffon, which was not at all good. The sponge was wet, not moist; stretchy, not cottony; and didn't have a lot of flavour.   I feel Cafe Michi is pricey. My experience here was good, but I don't think I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Pretty small restaurant. Need to make reservation every time.  Sashimi is fresh. I always order the chirps hi sushi which I love the most! Portion is more than enough for a girl. Comes with cake of your choice. Tofu cheesecake and greeted red bean cake are my favorite.  Its curry dishes are tasty too. I recommend to go with any course with sashimi.  A bit pricy though."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal, returning customer at Le Cafe Michi and have always enjoyed the meals there. Today I ordered a Large Pork Katsu Curry as take out. I opened the takeout box and noticed that it's smaller than a regular portion so I called back. The owner said this is the large size. I have had this dish many times at the restaurant and it was always a thicker and larger cut of pork. Quite disappointing. Then I noticed as I bite into the pork that 1. it's overcooked, and 2. actually it's slightly burned (see photo). I am writing this after the first bite. Unfortunately this was a waste of $20. Likely, I initially thought the pork was smaller than usual because it's overcooked. I will return next time and order the same and take a photo to demonstrate how different the two dishes are. FYI, I'd normally give 4+ stars for this place but burnt food should never be served to customers, IMHO."}
{"text":"Chirashi is very good. The best one I have eat in Toronto.  Coffee is good too. But all cakes are just OK for me."}
{"text":"This place is odd but I kind of love it. It is very unassuming they must operate on strictly word of mouth business. First it is very authentically Japanese, no Korean or Chinese influence here but oddly enough French? We got the special that came with salad miso soup chosen main and dessert of choice.  Our salads and soup were very tasty and the main meals kastsu curry and cold soba really hit the spot, classic and good. The dessert was phenomenal got the tofu cheesecake and the greentea cake which were both perfection. Will be back for sure these guys have an odd little niche but they do it well."}
{"text":"Small and decent Japanese Cafe in the neighbourhood. The green tea cake was awesome. I wasn't hungry and just wanted to try the cakes, It is weird that I was told that I have to order a dish in order to get a piece of cake individually. My friend tried their unatama lunch special, and she said it was decent. As for the portion of food, I would say it is a bit small for the price. Would like to come back to try something else when I am hungry."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is owned and run by a Japanese chef and his wife? who serves and bakes all the delicious cakes in the restaurant.  The owner was very friendly and he personally selects all the fish so you get very fresh fish that varies every day. He told us he doesn't have a website because he uses different fish everyday.   When we went, he had fresh sardines and he added some sardine sashimi into my Chirashi.  It was delicious and the way he prepared it with ginger masked the fishy taste that sardines usually have.  The Chirashi was the best I've tried in Toronto, the eel rice under the Chirashi was so delicious and had no fishy taste due to his preparation skills and the freshness of the fish.  I highy recommed getting the 3 course meal set because it comes with a delicious cake afterwards!  i chose the green tea cheesecake and my friend got the tofu cheesecake.  They were both excellent and not too sweet.  It's definitely a place that foodies would enjoy."}
{"text":"My parents love their cake especially the sakai chocolate cake.   I always ordered the chirashi dinner set $35 including soup, salad, green tea/coffee, a bowl of main course and a slice of dessert.    Their food is high quality.   But they have limited food selection."}
{"text":"Great dinner here for the first time! I had chochin bento and it was delicious! My bf had katsu curry rice and this one was pretty good too. Since we ordered a dinner special, at the end I had tofu cheesecake which was outstanding and my bf had green tea sake-cake which was also very delicious! I'm Japanese and came here with my \"Japanese\" expectations tonight. Overall I approve this cafe/restaurant and will definitely come back to treat myself. :) One thing I would suggest is not to get house red wine by glass."}
{"text":"The food was good but I think the prices are too high for what it is. They have some nice cakes and the cafe is quite cute. I wish the lighting was a bit better - I got the feeling it was dingy since the area is pretty sketchy. Overall, I don't think I will be coming back because food isn't spectacular and prices are too extreme."}
{"text":"This place is so bad, worst service I have ever got. We had reservation for 8 but they could only accomendate 6, and when we asked for extra chairs, they very RUDELY told us they cant and we decided to get take out. Even when we got take out, the server had to ask if she could take our order because we are not eating in anymore. Then they again RUDELY kicked us out by asking us to take our stuff and seated the other customers. Will NEVER come bak to this place!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here yesterday and we ordered the dinner combo, gyroza, ikura roe, plum wine and unagi.  Food: -The salad was very simple, crunchy and fresh.  -Miso soup was okay, but a bit on the salty side. -The green tea had a strong flavourful taste. -Plum wine was very tasty, light, sweet and crisp.  -Ikura roe remind me of popping boba. The juice just 'pops' inside your mouth. So yummy! -We both ordered the Japanese Curry Beef. It was really delicious and flavourful. I love the thickness and spiciness of the curry sauce.  However, it's either, I didn't mix well enough or there's not enough sauce on the dish because I was left with ¼ of the rice untouched.  -Tofu cheesecake is not too sweet, the cream was very light, the bottom crust was very thin and there's a hint of tofu taste. Amazingly unique! -Green Tea cake was full of green tea flavour, very light and kinda fluffy. Absolutely delicious! Love it!  Atmosphere and Service: This cafe is really small and even with reservation, we still had to wait for awhile. The waitress was really friendly and she always comes around to fill our tea.  Overall, the foods were pretty authentic and their cakes are amazing! A MUST-TRY!"}
{"text":"Went there the other day and the whole place was empty. But apparently you can't get a table unless you make a reservation. Really? There's plenty of places around here that has japanese restaurants. Just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's good but I expected more because of the prices. Desserts are the highlight. Venue is dated and needs to be refreshed. Not sure I will return because of the price and ambiance."}
{"text":"This place inside is quite narrow and small. More fit for Hobbits! Checked out their lunch specials, and we're lucky to get seats with out reservation. My bro decided to try their Unatama (eel with egg and rice). Their more pricier combo at $20+. This includes miso cup soup, salad, the entree, green tea, and a dessert cake. The Unatama tasted fresh and was good dish. My bro gf got the beef bulgogi type and it wasn't a hit for her. For me, I got the curry katsu chicken. It tasted not bad for me, but it kept reminding me of the taste of gravy with a little spice. The chicken cutlet though was nice and crisp and was good, but the curry was okay.  The salad is standard, and the miso soup is the same. The dessert cake which is highly hyped about turns out to be so-so. I got the hazelnut cake. The hazelnut cream was nice, but the cake was a bit dry. My bro got the green tea cake which had some red bean fillers in it as well, and it tasted alright.  For three ppl with combos the meal came to a whopping $60+ before tips. This is probably my only try, as I do not see anything good to come back for.  FYI- The male server we had was a bit direct in his approach. When we asked if they offered other drink option, he stared googly at my bro gf and replied, No!   Second, when I ask if small and large portion which would be good, he looked at me and said, you look like you can eat large for sure. lol"}
{"text":"My third time here. This small yet intimate restaurant keeps throwing me surprises and incredible experiences!   My friends and I were lucky enough to order the bento boxes and cakes since they're limited. The bento box was extremely worthy: the sashimi were sliced generously and served fresh; the karaage (Japanese fried chicken) was crispy, yet tender and juicy inside (I've tried karaage from places and la cafe michi's has a very special place in my heart). The crispy chicken was dripped with some spicy sauce which definitely blends well with the food; the eel rice was topped with egg sheet strips, it was not fishy at all and had a sweet/sour taste to it; lastly the cake, I got the green tea/red bean cake, I wanted to get it for the past few times but they ran out. The green tea compliments so well with the sweet red bean stuffing.   Another thing that I'd like to acclaim is the service. Since we went during a Sunday night, the store closes at 8'o clock. However we were celebrating my friends' birthday and went over for approx. 40minutew, but the waitresses did not interrupt us at all and waited until we finished.   Great place."}
{"text":"I came here around 8:30pm with family and it was great. This place is really packed. Almost everyone had a reservation while we did not so I would recommend making one when you plan to come. We got seated at the sushi bar and had a nice view of the sushi chefs assembling food. Don't be afraid of sitting at the bar, the chefs don't bite. Really. If anything, they are super attentive to you. You can definitely tell that they care about customer service.  As for the food, we tried a bento, sukiyaki as well as 3 cakes. We got the sake cake, tofu cheesecake and the lemon cake. I honestly thought the sake cake would taste like a chocolate one with a mild sake flavour or barely there sake flavour but I was wrong. Sake taste is pretty strong. The tofu cheesecake was absolutely delicious and soft but my favourite would have been the lemon cake with the berry filling."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is not cheap, but it's worth it, especially you are craving for some quality raw fish.  What I like the most is their sashimi combo dinner, the chicken dinner with some salmon sashimi and their chirashi.  All their dinners come with complimentary salad and dessert (a slice of Japanese cake).  My favourite is not their japanese green tea, tofu cheese cake, sake cheese cake... but the English Truffle (mixed fruits with some very light pound cake in a cup).  It tastes so good! It tastes a lot better than it looks. So, given this, I dont think this place is too expensive."}
{"text":"Thank goodness I read reviews for this place before going! The tip to look for Lin's Garden made finding this place a lot easier. My friend and I came for Friday lunch and it was not busy at all. There was only another table of two here when we were here.  We ordered a lunch special curry that included a salad and a slice of cake and also two rolls (cali and spicy salmon). The rolls had a lot of rice, tasted good, but were not worth it. They also were kind of falling apart. The curry was tasty but was a bit small (compared to J-Town's portions).   The real stars of the meal were cakes. With the meal we got the green tea red been cake and we ordered the sake cake. Both cakes were huge portions and we did not end up finishing it. They also weren't too sweet which I know my mom would have loved.  Overall, I think i may order a cake from them for my mom's birthday but food wise I find it over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Looks ghetto from the outside but the inside is a nice, quiet, cute environment that's good for bringing a date. Most of the tables were for 2's so getting a group of 5 in there was hard. Lots of people made reservations on the Sunday evening and it looks like you do need it because their space is tiny and can only seat so many.  I had their unatama (eel and egg on rice) and it was delicious! Tofu cheese cake was amazing. Their chirashi was on the pricey side ($38 for the meal) so we didn't order it but we were watching the sushi chef make them and it looks so good. Large piece of uni, eel hidden under the egg and pieces of fresh sashimi. I'll probably try that next time."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Aside from sushi, I love cakes and coffee.  This place has it all. My favourite is the cafe au lait chirashi and the green tea cake.  I like the mocha cake as well.  It gets very busy here so you either need to go when they open in the morning, or make reservations for any other time. It's a small place, so it's rather hard to get a seat if you don't have reservations."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. Their chirashi is my favorite. Nice sashimi on top with a thin layer of eggs between the rice and the sashimi, in the middle of the rice there's BBQ eel. A very nice looking and delicious chirashi. Their cakes are good too. And please choose coffee if you like coffee when you order the combo. Their coffee is awesome too. I haven't try many of the other items Coz everytime I go I go for their chirashi."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Run by real Japanese people. May need to make appointments in advance since the restaurant is very small."}
{"text":"Went for Sushi. When you first enter, it doesn't seem like there is a sushi bar; if is hidden in the back. Sushi selection is not so vast, but the pieces are big and made well.   The cakes are also delicious!  I would recommend this place...but just be prepared to pay double what you would pay else where...quite expensive!  Make sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here since they originally opened years ago. Service has gone downhill, food portion sizes have been reduced multiple times, prices have gone up, and food quality remains very good.  All that being said, I will still continue to come for the expensive but nice treat - cafe au lait chirashi incl. tea and cake for $38 plus tax."}
{"text":"Amazing taste. Fresh  material. Lovely sashimi. Yeah, little pricy but nice taste and excellent experience."}
{"text":"Love it! I am the fan of their sashimi. I guess they make their own wasabi. It is also very fresh!!! This is the only place I tried ever had this fresh sashimi in my life.  Greentea cake and sake cake are also my favourite. The eel fish is very fresh and juicy.  It should be 4.5 star. The reason it is not 5 star is the soba is good but  has no 'wow' factor.  Price = their quality.   Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Don't take me wrong. I really like the sake cake there and it was my 3rd time there.  However, it would be my last time.  I went with 3 friends and we ordered 3 set dinner (over $20/set) and a cake + tea (~$10) for the other person who had dinner already. First of all, we brought an unfinished hot chocolate in and they want us to finish it OUTSIDE (it's not like we are not ordering anything there. We didn't want to make a scene out of it so we did so).  Anyways, this place isn't like other Asian restaurant that would have a tea pot ready on the table for you to serve yourself.  In fact the set dinner came with the option of tea or coffee and it's refillable.  So just from my logical sense, we each have a set dinner and the other friend order a pot of regular green tea which is also refillable.  What's the big deal of my friend shared his tea with me when I ordered a coffee for my dinner set??!! The Jap server wasn't giving us any good attitude when we came in the restaurant.  When she saw us sharing the tea she told me to pay for the tea.  That's the big joke of the night. Never going back there any more.  For others who go there, hope you have better luck than us."}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner with a group of 6 and the service was great! I really liked the ambiance coming into the restaurant.  I ordered the chirashi and it was a very pleasant surprise! This is the only time I've ever had a chirashi with two layers of rice, where the middle layer between the two thin layers of rice was unagi. Sashimi was really fresh and I liked the assortment that was given.  Prior to the chirashi, I got a seaweed salad which was good. I really liked the desserts though! I ordered a tofu cheesecake, but my friends ordered a variety so I tried the other cakes as well.  Overall a great experience. It's a tad pricey, but I'm looking forward to my next trip there!"}
{"text":"My favourite Sushi Restaurant!  Gotta try Chyo-Chin Bento with a slice of green tea\red bean cake."}
{"text":"Not bad. I mean, service took FOREVER because we were in the back, but the owners and chefs were so nice! Everyone was japanese and it is most definitely authentic. It is on the pricey side, but the food was decent! I mean, I have tasted better but I wouldn't mind going to eat some sushi.   I was not a huge fan of the dessert, 'cause i found that heavy. Otherwise, it's not bad. Just a little overpriced..."}
{"text":"Le Cafe Michi is one of the best japanese restaurants in Toronto!  They have such a great and fresh assortment of sushi, sashimi, hot foods and desserts. I've been here 10-20 times and i've been extremely satisfied each time."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Reminds me of my trip to Japan. Unfortunately, the food is a little expensive compared to other japanese restaurants. The cheaper food is about $15/17 for things like donburis. The better food is approximately $23+ for things like the chyo chin bento, chirashi etc. They also offer a omakase meal where the chef chooses what you eat for you. Something I'd like to try someday since I think the food here is really good!   I love the chyo chin bento and that's what I normally order! It has everything I love. A good taste of fried food, cold sushi and comes with rice to fill you up.  The top layer is karage chicken. Crispy and has that light sweet taste to it. Absolutely love it. The second layer is sashimi. The fish is fresh and very good. Last layer is the eel donburi.    The dessert is amazing! I love their tofu cheesecake! Definitely great for people who can take soft, light tastes. The chocolate cake is also very good. Personally, I prefer these two compared to the green tea cake although it is also very tasty. So far, I find all their cakes and desserts very appealing.  Each portion is small but I personally don't eat much so I think it's good. This may not be a good place to take a guy friend who eats a lot though."}
{"text":"Their sashimi was delicious! Melt in your mouth and so fresh. The chicken karaage was so tender and juicy. And the Tofu Cheesecake is a MUST! Everyone raves about the green tea red bean cake but that's because they didn't try the tofu cheesecake! The Earl Grey Chiffon Cake is a close second for me. A bit pricey and I've read a few reviews about the service. The service isn't what you would find in a fine dining restaurant, rather it seems like a family owned business and they are attentive but not out to smooze you for a high top; I personally thought the service was great."}
{"text":"Very expensive with small portions for the sushi.  The curry and rice dishes were better priced.  Salad plain, just lettuce and dressing with a tiny cucumber.  Miso soup salty.  Cakes were good.  If u want to buy a cake, it's $50.  Holy moley... Tables are cramped and tight.  It was an ok experience but probably would not return."}
{"text":"Good food and service, I love the coffee and the green tea cake is so good.  I have tried the hot pot seafood and Eel rice, both are good.  I will come back next time and will try the sashimi and sushi."}
{"text":"JW and I have been eager to find good japanese restaurants in the uptown area and we came across this hidden gem in Scarborough. Le Cafe Michi is a coffee shop style restaurant run by a family. It famous for its unatama (eel simmered in egg on rice) and cakes.   I ordered their Unatama and JW tried their Cafe Au Lait Chirashi Sushi. All combos come with coffee/green tea that can be refilled, green salad and miso soup. We ordered coffee despite the fact that we were having dinner b/c we knew their coffee are very high in quality.   JW's assorted sashimi were placed very artistically in a special piece of dinnerware. The sashimi were fresh.  The sushi rice had very little vinegar added to it compared to other japanese restaurants.  Very simpleyet delicious dish.   We found this letter to customers very thoughtful and cute. It basically said they had to raise the price of some of their dishes due to worldwide eel shortage. We understand this perfectly because we have witnessed eel prices going up as well in the last few years.   I LOVE THE UNATAMA. It came with a lot of eels even though they raised the price. The dish was very light in taste despite of the colour of the sauce which was definitely deceiving. Although you expect more flavours to explode in your mouth, the dish served the purpose of bringing out the real flavour of the eels. I prefer it this way instead of drowning the egg in sauce and then all you could taste would be the sauce and nothing else.   We got to pick two pieces of cake to wrap up this amazing meal. We went with green tea cake and tiramisu. Love the green tea cake which had red beans hidden in the cream. Compared to the green tea cake, the tiramisu was certainly not as bright. We can't wait to try out all of their cakes.   Verdict:   roasted !  Love this place! Can't wait to go back for more unatama or even a piece of cake to go with a coffee for a nice afternoon tea. Definitely a hidden gem.  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/07/16/le-cafe-michi for awesome pictures of the food i mentioned above ! :)"}
{"text":"We went at Le Cafe Michi after reading some articles about sushi on the web a Sunday around 6pm. I took the dish \"Le Café au Lait Chirashi\", the fish was really fresh, the tuna was amazing, probably the best one I had in Toronto. The dish was composed of multiple layers with  an omelet to separate the fish from the rice, every bit was full of savor. The menu included a dessert, you can choose between multiple types of cake. I took the green tea cake, my partner took the Tiramisu. The cake was very light and tasteful , it ended perfectly the diner. I put 5 stars because the quality was really good, the fish was fresh, the dessert was original, the price reasonable for a good sushi.  I recommend the dish:  Le Café au Lait Chirashi"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend as she remembered coming here for her birthday when she was younger for their cakes. It's a small restaurant cafe, that was quite busy for a Saturday lunch. We didn't make a reservation but that wait was only around 5 minutes which was great.   I ordered the (small) Beef Curry Rice combo and my friend got the Gyoza combo and they were both really good! The curry had a perfect amount of spice and sweetness to it (for Asian curries). However, there was way too much curry sauce in my dish so I ended up spooning a lot into my friend's rice. The salad & miso soup that came before our main dishes were nothing special, just your typical starters.   For dessert (always the best part haha), we ordered the Green Tea cake and the Tofu Cheesecake. As many other reviewers have stated, the tofu cheescake is really good; it's light and fluffy and has a sweet tangy taste to it that's not too overpowering (to be honest I was quite unsure of how it would taste). The green tea cake had a red bean filling and the cake itself was good but nothing special, it was the icing that was really delicious. It was light and had the perfect amount of matcha flavouring that wasn't too sweet.   The total came to around $35 including tax+tips, which is reasonable for a filling combo meal! Service was friendly although on the slow side, and overall atmosphere was pleasant (but it is more of a cramped space so I wouldn't come here with a large group). Will probably come back to try the other cakes!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with husband and we were seated at the sushi bar.  Glad I made reservation as all seats are either reserved or occupied.  It was a small cafe type restaurant but clean and neat.  I ordered Chicken and Egg Rice while husband had Udon.  My portion was not considered large but I am always a light eater and our order comes with refillable green tea or coffee and dessert.  Husband's udon was just the right size and his comes with dessert too.  Food was freshly made and we like it very much.  We chose to have green tea cake and tofu cheesecake as dessert.  Price was $40 tax-in with tips extra.  Definitely would recommend to friends who wanted authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"This is my all time favourite Japanese restaurant by far. Anytime I want a good Japanese dinner, hands down this is the place I would choose. Their sashimi is always fresh and their food quality is always at its highest.  Recommended Dishes: Chirashi Don- their sashimi lays on top of their layered Japanese rice, eel, and egg. Perfection piece!  Premium Nigiri Sushi- Perfect combination of sushi and rolls dinner. This is the perfect quantity and their sushi never disappoints!  Chyo-chin Bento- Combination of Sashimi, Unagi Don, and Fried Chicken. Gives you a twist of raw fish, rice, and hot food. This is a great way to have the best of both worlds :)  My #1 FAV and must get at this place: Green Tea Creme Brûlée. Sometimes I feel like i'm coming to cafe michi just for this dessert, but they make this so well! The bitterness in the matcha mixed with the creamy texture and caramelized sugar keeps me coming back for more!  Good job Cafe Michi!"}
{"text":"It's always great experience dining there. We just think it's a little pricey. Hope they can adjust the price a little lower... then it would be PErfect :)"}
{"text":"Holy expensive, Batman!  But to me, worth every penny.  I happily fork out the dollars for this authentic \"mom & pop\" couple.  They are REAL Japanese people making SUSHI and delectable desserts.  Damn fine sushi.  A real family run operation, their daughter even served us.  She was very sweet and adorable.    We sat in the back section, in front of the sushi bar action.  We watched Mister \"Michi\" prepare everyone's fish with a very experienced hand.  We also witnessed Mrs. \"Michi\" preparing fried chicken, soba and rice bowls. They were so cute.  My companion and I shared a spicy salmon roll to start, the most expensive one I've had in my life ($7.45 for six pieces of maki).  Most places charge half that price for the same thing - but different caliber, as we soon realized.  This was fresh and delicious, large hunks of salmon in a spicy mayo, surrounded by perfectly warm, vinegar-ed, sticky sushi rice.  My companion and I both had the Chochin Bento.  We loved the three tiered compartment bowls.  The top bowl contained karaage with spicy mayo (Japanese fried chicken).  Hot, crispy, juicy and delicious!  It didn't look like a lot, but there was actually quite a bit of chicken in there.  The middle bowl contained the best sashimi I've ever had, fresh and melty.  Six slices in total, two each of salmon, tuna and whitefish.  There was a shiso leaf in there too, I've never had shiso.  It was minty.  The final bottom bowl contained the excellent sushi rice, slivers of fried egg and pickle, and two slices of yummy sweet grilled eel.  If you want a picture reference, the Chochin Bento was uploaded by Patty L in photos.  It's DEELISH!  Our Chochin Bento meal sets also included green salad (quite big with a nice tangy dressing), unlimited coffee or tea (we chose green tea) and a slice of dessert (home-made cakes).  We each had the green tea cake, and split an earl grey tea chiffon cake. Lightly sweet, fluffy, fantastic icing.  The daughter said her mother made both those cakes just that morning.    All in all, a great sushi and dessert experience!  I must go back!"}
{"text":"I went there with a few friends the other week. Make sure you make a reservation! The place is quite small but very popular. We all had a curry meal for about $25, this included a soup, a salad, tea, and a cake!   Overall food quality: good, no complaints Special notes: BEST. CAKE. EVER."}
{"text":"We just tried to call for take-out at 7pm and they said they were EXTREMELY busy. I think they need to hire more people."}
{"text":"Finally made it out here! This restaurant has been on my list for quite a while, and I'm so glad I made the trek. Went for lunch and shared the sashimi set and the unatama set. We had salads to start. Delicious assortment of fresh sashimi including scallop, sweet shrimp, squid, octopus, salmon, tuna, mackerel. The unatama (unagi+tamago, eel+egg) was kind of like an eel version of an oyako-don. Again, delicious.  Let's not forget the cake. We selected the tofu cheesecake and the fruit shortcake, and they were both excellent. The (bottomless) coffee that came with the meal was a refreshing change from the green tea that is usually served, and it helped kick the post-meal snooze. After we had dessert, the waitress informed us that they forgot our miso soups, and gave us a couple of cookies with their apologies.  They seem to do quite a few takeout cake orders (advance ordering required). I saw a 12\"x12\" strawberry fruitcake being loaded into a giant box and it looked fantastic. By the way, don't try to go there only for cake during lunch hour. Wait for tea time (3:00 pm to 5:00 pm). Otherwise, they won't seat you and (politely) ask you to do takeout.  Excellent service, excellent food. The price is a bit steep, but when it's this good, I'll gladly pay for it."}
{"text":"It's OK. I ordered the udon hot pot, and I got what I expected, sorta. I wish there has been more stuff in it. The cakes are good but I'm not much of a pastry and cakes person so it didn't appeal to me. Maybe next time I'll try the sushi."}
{"text":"Love their plum wine jelly! Very delicious. If you read this, you should try~ Their lunch combo is a good deal, which included a main dish, house salad, tea/coffee, miso soup and also DESSERT!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to Le Cafe Michi 3 or 4 times over the years, I have always ordered the sushi/maki combo and was always impressed with the freshness of the sushi. Of course the best part was always their great dessert. Great combo at reasonable price. We don't come here on a regular basis because the location is a bit out of the way for us.  We made reservation for dinner here again tonight after 2 years. I ordered Le Cafe Au Lait Chirashi. My partner and I also shared a karaage. The chicken pieces were good, not as salty as the ones you get at other locations. The Chirashi, honestly my first impression was not good, but look Is deceiving.  The price point of $45 is much more expensive than I recall. The serving look small and stingy. But as you begin to dig into it, they packed quite a variety and quantity of fresh sashimi in it. The uni with a dollop of fresh wasabi was so yum. The unagi hidden underneath was a pleasant surprise. I didn't finished the whole portion cos was very full. My partner was also very happy with the seafood hotspot main course. Dessert I had tofu cheesecake, just as good as I remember."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a treasure located in a sketchy little plaza in Scarborough - you totally think you are in the wrong place when you park in the lot. But when you walk inside you will find yourself in one of the best sushi restaurants in the city.  This is a cute little restaurant - divided into 2 smaller dining areas: the part facing the sushi bar, and the part facing the cake case. I like that their menus come with a little photo album so that you get a sense of what you are ordering. The sashimi is very fresh and everything is beautifully presented. The wasabi is strong - which I love! The bento boxes are so artfully put together that your eyes are delighted even before you taste anything. The unagi (BBQ eel) is not \"fishy\" tasting. Service is a bit slow, but it's because they take their time in the kitchen to ensure everything is just right.  Apart from the excellent sushi, one of my favourite reasons for coming to Café Michi are the beautiful desserts. The green tea cake is incredible! It's moist and light and a sheer delight! I'm also in love with the strawberry shortcake - thin layers of moist shortcake layered with real whipped cream and strawberries. Nothing is too sweet and each slice is perfectly portioned. You can also pre-order an entire cake (for pick-up) if you phone 24hrs ahead (48 hrs required if you want to pick up your cake on Sunday). The owner's wife makes all of the cakes herself - except for the green tea cake - it's so popular (they can go through 8 of them on a busy night) that she has someone else make them to her recipe. If you want take-out, a slice is about $5.  If you come on an afternoon between 3-5pm you can have afternoon tea: a pot of tea and a slice of cake.  It can get very busy and this place is small, so call ahead and make a reservation.  On one side of the dessert case and along the top of it are handmade crafts (phone charms, jewelry, bags) that seem a bit out of place.   They accept cash, debit and Visa/Mastercard."}
{"text":"Is it a sushi bar? A cafe?  This place is a combination of both.  When you first walk in, you think you're at the wrong place as it looks nothing like a sushi or Japanese place.  Then you notice that there is a sushi bar at the back of the restaurant.  I have been craving about chirashi lately and decided to give this place a try after a friend posted a few photos on social media.  The chirashi has everything, from fresh scallop to fresh tuna.  But it is not cheap as it costs $39.  My wife ordered the curry chicken on rice, it's not bad but nothing extraordinary.  I mean most sushi stuff taste very similar, it's hard to say this place serve really good sushi over another place.  Overall I would say pretty good.  Like I said, this place feels like a coffee shop and they have good selections of cakes for desserts.  They have over 10 choices of desserts on display.  The tofu cheesecake and the green tea cake were perfect compliments to our meal.  Loved  the green tea cake with some sweet red beans in it.  I'm not overly impressed by this place, the reason why I rated 3 star and not 4 because the moment I sat down, I noticed this very sour smelling coming from somewhere which made the overall experience not as good as I wanted.  Note: this place might get very busy as I was told, the 30 minutes we sat down for lunch, I've heard many reservation requests for dinner so make sure you call ahead."}
{"text":"Went to le cafe michi since a friend suggested I try it as I was looking for a Japanese owned Japanese restaurant. The first time we went searching for it we got lost and eventually didn't find it. Which was really annoying as I lierally live only 5 min. Away! Thats walking distance. However I located on urbanspoon and I actually mapquested it to my utter embarrassment! It was in the dodgy plaza where Lin Garden is located right in the corner. Since I've been there twice and the food is really tasty! The rice different than the usual sushi places. It's soft and not stale and the flavour I just cant describe. Presentation is great. However make reservations as it's a tiny place and they close at 9pm on the dot!"}
{"text":"Pricey pricey and teeny tiny restaurant. Food is good but the Deserts are great. Chocolate sake cake is very good. Restaurant will not fit groups over 8 people. Reservations a must."}
{"text":"Le Cafe Michi is tiny place, found in a strip mall on Pharmacy, south of Sheppard. I almost missed it the first time I  came here. I stopped by early Tuesday evening for dinner. There's a small cafe in the front and more seating in a back. It's best to call ahead for reservations if you're coming with a larger group.   I found the foos to be slightly overpriced. Having said that, the best value is the lunch or dinner combo, where you get a salad, miso soup, choice of entree and dessert. I got the curry rice with chicken entree, which tasted great. And portion size was good enough for me.  The desserts are superb (loved the green tea cake!) The wait staff was very attentive and came to check in on me every so often.   It's nice to have an authentic Japanese restaurant in the Scarborough area, and I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Just a heads-up...this is a very small restaurant - be sure to make a reservation or else you likely will not get seated - especially on a Friday or Saturday night.  I ordered the café au lait chirashi bowl - super tasty!  The sashimi was all very fresh and their was even some tamago and unagi within the bed of rice.  Serving -size wise the bowl doesn't seem like a lot - but it's quite filling.  Price-wise...this was pretty expensive - we got the set that came with salad and dessert and with tax and tip came out to be about $50 per person.    Their cakes are also really good!  The flavours are not ones that are readily available in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good thing I made a reservation before coming here because they are SO busy!   This cafe is very tiny and service can be pretty slow, but it's the perfect place to catch up with friends over a delicious bowl of chirashi.   That's all I ever order here, they have one of the best Chirashi bowls in Toronto. The toppings are fresh and full of variety and the rice is laced with unagi and egg. SO GOOD!   The dessert selection never disappointments. Their specialty is their tofu Cheesecake or their Mille crepe cake. I'm biased because I love all things cake, but I would seriously come back just for cake.   Call me a fan!"}
{"text":"This review is for their cake only!  Ordered a whole green tea cake after reading all the awesome reviews here :) It was indeed pretty awesome! The green tea taste was just strong enough, the texture was smooth and silky, the sweetness was not overwhelming, and the red bean filling complemented the green tea cream perfectly.   My parents also agreed that it was worth the price.   The reason I took a star off is because even though I told them the exact time I would be picking up the cake, for some reason it wasn't ready when I arrived and we had to wait around 20 minutes. Other than that, the service (from placing the order to being greeted in the restaurant) was quite pleasant.  Obviously we didn't eat in the place, but from what I could see the interior was very nicely decorated and cozy with a Japanese feel to it (there were some small Asian accessories for sale at the front). Most of the tables had a 'Reserved' sign on them, so reservations would be recommended.  I will be returning to try their lunch menu! :)"}
{"text":"I unintentionally came here to eat.   I thought I could grab something quick from Lin Garden but it was rammed.  I had no reservation, but I was by myself. The cutie waitress asks the chef, the chef gives me a seat at the bar.  Score!   Haha I recognized the chef from the Washoku Matsuri Japanese food festival the one year I went.  Maybe he remembered me as the guy that constantly asked for more?  Haha. Eating like a beast has its privileges.   I quickly look through this photo book they have of the menu and order the Cafe Au lait chirashi. It's like a never ending bowl of goodness! I've eaten at various spots at the fish market in Japan and this comes close enough for me.  Being a whole 5 minutes from my house and all.  Had the green tea cake.  Smooth, creamy, light..... Genius! Also had a drink as well.  After tax and tip spend about 50.  I will return, but next time I'll try the bento that had the karaage. Looked good! I glanced over at the girl eating it a few times.  Her boyfriend was probably thinking I was checking her out but I was really checking out the chicken.  If a fight broke out, I probably would've lost being so full and all."}
{"text":"I got their chirashi don and green tea creme brulee. Im impressed with their fresh sashimi. Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love the place. It's cute, food is so fresh, desserts are amazing but the price is so unreasonable I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Small place but the food was so good! I got the Katsu Curry (pork), delicious. I also tried the sukiyaki and I'm not really a fan of sukiyaki but this one was so good! I'd actually order it next time. Dessert is a must. Their cakes are light and not overly sweet but still good. I tried the Tofu Cheesecake, Green Tea Cake, Sake Cake and the Plum Wine Jelly. Tofu and Green Tea were my favourites of the cakes. The Sake cake was chocolate which I love but I could taste the sake in it, which I didn't love, but it was still good. The plum wine jelly was really good (if you're not a cake lover), it had lychee in it. Food was good, I would totally go back!"}
{"text":"I can understand why there are so many great reviews!  I only knew of this place for their lovely cakes (which by the way are yummy, moist, and not overly sweet), but our family of 12 decided to come here for dinner. On that note, you need to make reservations. The restaurant is tiny, but there is another bigger back room.  The food is really yummy, although the sushi/sashimi \"plates\" are quite small. Their set dinners are great value which comes with fillable coffee/tea, a main course, and slice of cake. I had the Chicken Terriyaki and YUM! Usually, the white meat is dry and tough, but none of that here. This meat was JUICY! It came with yummy rice and veggies and I CLEANED the plate.   Other really delish items were the soba noodles in heart-warming broth and Japanese-style curry.  Cakes are varied here and some are very \"Japanese\" such as the Green Tea Cake. I had the Earl Grey cake which was oh so moist.  It's a bit out of my ways, but definitely would love to come back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My fav janpanese curry dish is from here. And definitly recommend to get the combo with dessert~  really good Jap style cakes"}
{"text":"My friend suggested to meet up here for lunch. We made reservations for a Sunday but I don't think it's required since there was quite a few empty tables. Once I arrived the place does not look too pleasing from the outside its in an area where a lot of the stores is run down. From the outside it looks like it's closed and dark. Once I got inside I quickly found my friend among the few tables in the small restaurant. We had to ask for menus and water. The menu comes with a small photo album that is quite useful. I opted for the 3 bento karage chicken and eel rice. It came in a super cute cylinder bento box that is 3 layer. The first layer had the karage chicken. There were around 4-5 pieces. Then there was a layer of sashimi and the last layer had eel rice. The sashimi was good. It wasn't the freshest but it satisfied my sushi craving.  The karage chicken was too fried for me. The eel rice was good it only had 2 pieces of eel tho. Rice was good too. This meal was super filling for me so I wasn't able to finish the karage chicken.  The combo also came with a dessert and coffee/tea. I opted for the green tea mousse cake. It was average had bits of red bean in it. Ialso tried the hazelnut cake and the fruit truffle... Everything was just mediocre.  The good thing about the place was that we were able to stay there for quite a while I think it was around 2-2.5 hours we stayed there for. There wasn't many other tables around.  My bill came out to around $34. I think I would have enjoyed AyCE more. It didn't taste too authentic to me or maybe I cannot tell the difference from just my order."}
{"text":"Warning, I may be bias.  Food: 4/5 Set meals are great but pricy. Service: 4/5 Staff is super nice.  Environment: 3/5 Could use a face lift. Washrooms: 3.5/5 Okay. Worth it?: 5/5 I will always come back.   I should probably explain the title. This is where my girlfriend and I went for dinner on our first date. So this place has more meaning to me and will forever be 5/5 stars.   I love the sushi here. There is always a good mix and everything is super fresh. The desserts are even better and be sure to check out their selection in the glass window.   The only thing I have negative to say about this place is the decor could be updated. Having the venue looking as good as the food would make this place a real gem!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with Cafe Michi, as an esteemed friend had recommended it to me as the place to go for sushi uptown. Let me emphasize that the scope of this review does not cover the experience of eating at Michi, but rather... The lack thereof.   I had arrived at the restaurant at 8:30pm, which would be considered the appropriate time to feast for any modern urbanite. Upon entering the restaurant, the waitress motioned to us with her hands as if she were shooing us away... Explaining that the kitchen had announced their last call at 8:30pm... I was outraged. Looking around, the clientele was young and vibrant, I couldn't understand why dinner time had to end so early. Regardless, she threw us a menu and suggested that we order takeout instead. I pored over the menu for another 10 minutes... Finally deciding on the chirashi treat, also recommended by said friend. To our delight, the waitress then exclaims that the kitchen had changed their minds and were no longer even willing to prepare food for takeout. Enough is enough!  I left immediate (after a quick survey of the dessert bar) and headed to the joint next door where I was finally treated like a first class citizen. Lin Gardens and their nice \"special chicken\" treat saved us that night.  I truly hope that cafe Michi will adjust their hours of operation. Unless they plan to cater to the senior population of the 6ix, this shit ain't gonna fly."}
{"text":"Le Cafe Michi came highly recommended and I had been meaning to eat here for around two years but never came around to it. Previously I have only been able to order take out desserts as the restaurant is very busy and usually cannot accommodate for drop in guests. Make a reservation!  I ordered the Don Katsu curry rice set meal. The curry was good but nothing particularly special. My date ordered the fried chicken rice with sashimi. He said the sashimi was especially fresh but we had both had better fried chicken. Since I had highly anticipated eating here, my expectations were a bit high and I finished the meal feeling a bit disappointed. However this restaurant truly has some of the best cake I've ever tasted!  We ordered the green tea red bean cake and a cheesecake. Both were very light, not too sweet, and delicious. The cakes will definitely keep me coming back but I will probably not return for dinner."}
{"text":"(More like a 3.5) My friend has been raving about this place for years -- he's a regular. Since he's always talked about it, I've always wanted to try. We finally came here today and I tried what my friend always gets-- the Cafe au lait chirashi. I was actually slightly disappointed to be honest, but maybe because I anticipated it for so long.  I feel like the main selling point is obviously that it's super photogenic. Other than that, the fish wasn't bad, but nothing amazingly spectacular. I do like how they had eel at the bottom, totally wasn't expecting it. But overall,  I feel like I've had better chirashi for less than the $39.95 price tag, but yes this does come with coffee and delicious cake. The other things on the menu also seems a bit pricey for what you're getting-- my other friend thought the eel and egg rice he got was pretty mediocre. All in all I guess its worth a try but don't expect too much. It does make a cute picture though ;)"}
{"text":"I only came here to try out their matcha red bean cake so this isn't really a review for the restaurant but for the cake. It was really light but had a strong matcha flavour. Great little treat, on the pricey side though"}
{"text":"This place is a North York gem. I love how it's very unassuming and family style. The menu selection has something for everyone. I loved the eel on rice, and the fried chicken was bomb. Green tea cake was light, airy and soo delicious. Could eat that cake forever.  The sashimi we got didn't blow my mind, which is why I gave an ok review. I expect the fish to be the star in any japanese resto I go to. Also the staff were very slow taking our order as it seemed the high call volume was taking a lot of their time!  Overall, would def go again, but would not frequent too often as it's pretty expensive for the portions you get."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's the big fuss about this place.  I've been recommended this place on several occasions by friends and coworkers... finally got a chance to try it out.  I came here on saturday around 3:30pm, and just missed their sushi bar... which I was a bit disappointed about bc I wanted to try the cafe au lait chirashi.  So I ordered the seafood hot pot - there was a good amount of seafood, and the udon was good, but there was nothing special about it.  I also tried the green tea cake which was really soft and mushy... the presentation was also questionable, as there was green cake/mousse smeared along the edges of the plate.  I also had a chance to try the gyudon which is beef, onions and egg on a bed of rice - the rice was really wet and mushy, but the flavour was good.  Also tried the tofu cheesecake - which I was not a fan of as it left a weird after taste in my mouth.  I'm usually a big fan of asian sweets, since it's not too sweet and not too heavy, but I did not have an overly positive experience here.  Service was also slow and inattentive, and we had to walk to the cash register to ask for our dessert and bill.   Maybe we came here on an off day and I'd be willing to come back to try the sushi, but based on the prices and the quality of food, I would not recommend this place. The setting is also so-so as the cafe is situated at a ghetto-ish strip mall in Scarborough."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have luch and afternoon tea. I'm a regular customer of Le Cafe Michi. The menu is designed very good with plent and different types of Japanese food. There is no dessert menu, customers will choose what they like from the dessert display case. And their dessert selection rotates often. I noticed that some of their cake bases are from J-Town. The dining environment is sweet and comfortable for a group of friends to have their afternoon tea."}
{"text":"Interesting experience but pricy for the food you get. I had really high expectations for Uni but it wasn't that fresh.. I had much better tasting Uni at that pricing point. Sushi was decent but again for the price you pay there wasn't enough of wow factor. Interior is outdated and service is below average. The food looks only good in pictures."}
{"text":"I actually came into this restaurant with really high hopes, and I think I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the chicken and egg with rice (forgot the actual name) and my boyfriend got the katsu don. Overall, I thought our meal was ok, but at the same price as Fin Izakaya's lunchtime specials, I much prefer the flavours of Fin, and my boyfriend agrees. Although, I didn't order any sushi, when I looked at the sushi chef ( and possibly owner) work on making them, I was also kind of disappointed. They charge quite a lot for any of their seafood related items, so I get that the fish must be super fresh and high quality. However, though he is fast at what he does, the sushi chef seemed to have sacrificed quality of his sushi for speed. He was chopping up his maki rolls into uneven sizes and ragged edges. I'm not knowledgeable enough to judge how he did on the nigiri sushi though, but he truly is very generous with the fish.   Overall I think this is a nice place, but at this price I don't think I would return for dinner, maybe lunch. I didn't have any dessert this time, so if I return, I may just stick with the dessert also."}
{"text":"Foods good. Qualitys food. Price is a little steep but you get a cake which is awesome. I like the blueberry cake. Also. I think their cakes are homemade.   I have the chirashi usually. Lots of variety so I like that option. Also comes with a thin layer of egg and eel sauce underneath which is a nice surprise.  Lots of customers there are Japanese. That's when you know it's good food."}
{"text":"I would not have know there was such a cute restaurant stuffed in a small strip plaza! The moment I walked in, felt like a hybrid between English-Japanese style decor. It's a bit tight in space, but we had a large group - so quite understandable. The servers were very polite and quick to help us when needed.   My group ordered: Chiraishi, Bento Box, Unagi on Rice, Unatama and Japanese Curry Rice. I don't think the dishes stood out in particular for me though. The food was okay, a bit generic and didn't exactly stand out from other restaurants. What did really catch me on the menu was the dessert. I had the green tea red bean cake and that was seriously the only thing I remember having. Everything else my friends had for dessert was a blur because I was so focused on my own cake. It's delicious! I would come here just for the cake. It was so soft and the green tea flavor is so rich. I would come here just for dessert since I remember seeing a huge variety of cakes/dessert."}
{"text":"I am so happy that today I finally get to try this place.  The pictures of their cakes looked so delicious.  The decor of the place is kind of dated and looked like an old sushi restaurant with the exception of the cake stand toward the front end of the restaurant.  I didn't like the chairs or the tables, they looked a little old.  Although it is not dirty, it just somehow does not feel clean, maybe it is the colour platette.    I was looking forward to the delicious cakes though, but I first went thru the menu.  There is a photo menu with the picture printed for most of the items.  I was going to get the assorted sashimi with rice, and the price was close to $40 per person.  I was like O--M--G, so I decided to get something cheaper since it was only lunch.    The staffs are really friendly in general, and put up with my mom's expectation of a \"yin yang\" (HK style drink with half milk tea and half coffee).  It was so funny, and the staff was to nice and said they could do it, but it will be green tea and coffee.  The staff's expression was priceless, so funny.    I ended up ordering the curry beef and my mom ordered the chicken teriyaki.  The chicken teriyaki was a little dry with too little sauce, but the flavour is good.  My curry beef was delicious, and it tasted like the same dish I have had in Japan several years ago.  Very rich in curry flavour, a little sweet, a little spicy and just complements the beef and potatoes and rice perfectly.  The cakes were highlight of my lunch.  The green tea cake was moist and complement well with the red bean and the green tea cream.  The cappuccino cream cake was rich and velvety.  So delicious.  Definitely would just come here for desserts.  I didn't give five stars due to its decor."}
{"text":"I recently came with a friend and it was not an omakase occasion, but a respectable meal and experience nonetheless.  I made reservations about two hours prior, since I'd heard that they are often necessary. Indeed, half-way through our meal the place was comfortably \"packed\". Yet, the service was kind and moderate in tempo - just what you would expect in an establishment where one goes to have a relaxed time (rather than some places that rush courses as they are dependent on high table turnover).  Ambiance wise, Michi is somehow plain and kitschy at the same time. Against mostly stark white walls,  the tiny, framed, gift shop-type art looked awkward and like a weak attempt at \"Japanese\". Then there's the homemade jewelry for sale by the cash register... To say the least, there's a clean mish-mash of too little and too much going on in terms of interior design. The aesthetic could use a splash of colour, texture, or something. Visually though, the food is phenomenal. Great care is taken in the presentation of menu and actual food items. This includes table settings that are, you guess it, white! But the feel of the china and chopsticks speaks volumes of the care that Michi puts into the food, which is also plated to appease the senses (even as far as sushi somehow already looks quite artful however positioned, including in styrofoam). Taste-wise, it's a winner. But I won't spend too much time on this as I feel that it should be enough to say that they care immensely about their food at Michi. Further, I don't want to start some series of \"authenticity\" debate that tends to circulate around restaurants like Michi. I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"Came here today,   Food was nothing special except for the tiramisu cheese cake.   I wasn't expecting the food to be that expensive but it was.    I ordered curry pork katsu for $15...   Then I also ordered one of the bento for $27 with 4 pieces of  karage, 6 small pieces of sashimi,  2 pieces of small eel with rice.  Well.. There goes my money.... I am brokeeee.  Overall the food is decent. But you could probably get the same thing for cheaper somewhere else.  Most likely won't be coming back for lunch.    Note: they charge for tea."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Sushi was really fresh. Service was nice. But prices are very expensive and small portions. The place looked very plain and ordinary. For such high prices, I expected a much nicer atmosphere and better appointed interior decor."}
{"text":"Horrible food with unreasonable price.I don't know why they have a rate seems not bad.I went to this place couple days ago and I WILL NEVER GO BACK for sure!!!!!!Food was horrible and sooooooo expensive,I had eel rice ,they charge me 20 dollars for a small amount and disgusting food!!!Unreasonable price much more expensive than other place.Never come!!!"}
{"text":"Bought a cake there with a friend and proceeded to sit down and eat it. It wasn't busy at all and one of the workers told us to leave because it was for dining in customers only. We said we just bought slices of cake and didn't understand the issue. The worker kept staring at my non-Asian friend and told us to leave. I don't just freely pull out the race card, but it seemed to play a part here. My friend, who is Pakistani, felt discriminated against. It was a very uncomfortable situation. Maybe if we were both Japanese that would have been better?"}
{"text":"My brother and I decided to give this place a visit after all the rave reviews, and it's definitely a nice place but small and busy - you defnitely need reservations. We were heartbroken when they told us they were completely booked up for dinner on a weeknight (what!), so we decided to get take out. Then we were heartbroken even more to find out that we couldn't order any sushi, since the sushi chef was completely tied up with all the sit down orders. Le sigh.  We ordered the gyudon and a chicken katsu curry meal to go, complete with the green tea cake and the bailey's cake. The cakes are fantastic, and completely worth it. The cooked food is good, but nothing amazing. I know I know, I need to come back to try the sushi. It's on my to-do list while I'm in town.  The staff is friendly, but they seemed pretty stressed out with all the orders coming in. It's hidden away in a side plaza, so you'll need sharp eyes to find it - they don't have an \"open\" sign out front or anything and it's sort of dimly lit, so it always looks closed from far away."}
{"text":"Food is not bad, actually quite good but they will deliberately serve you stale sashemi and give you poor service if they do not want you back!   The staff are very racist.  Caveat Emptor!!"}
{"text":"If you want nice cake and coffee in small dinghy store on a strip plaza, this is the place for you. The tea time combo is a pretty good deal. For dinner, I already had food, so I just wanted cake. They have a weird rule where you have to order dinner food/combo for dinner. The server ended up saying that I am \"sharing\" my friend's dinner with her and then ordering extra cake and dessert. Here comes my giant eye roll. The food and cake are solid. Green tea cake was delicious. Pork cutlet with curry rice was good too. I just think the food is a little pricey for the environment it is in."}
{"text":"The quality of food had slightly drop.   The uni was not as fresh as last time I went, as well as other sashimi.   Service was way too slow. We asked for our cake for 3 times and it took 15 minutes to send the cake out. And is a really thin slice of cake, last time I got twice bigger than what I got today.  The server were not polite as well, she didn't clean up the table and didn't refill our tea on time. Acting like we killed her parents or she just don't wanna work here anymore.  Hope they can hire more people to help out or at least be more polite  With this height price and poor service( I think ayce might be better than here) , I rather go to somewhere to get a better quality sushi lol."}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite Japanese joints! This small, quaint cafe serves some of the best sushi I've ever eaten. My favourite dish is the Cafe au Lait Chirashi which is assorted sashimi on a bed of rice! It sounds simple but it's incredibly delicious. Many of the other items are equally as delicious and I always here other patrons raving about their meal!   All the dinner specials come with dessert -- the green tea creme brûlée is delicious as is the tofu cheesecake.   As with almost sushi places, expect the prices to be steep but the quality is very good and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Location The restaurant is very tiny and can be found in a plaza. Parking was okay on a weeknight but I have no idea about weekends. I just want to warn you that reservations are a must!  Service Standard, lols. I'm getting lazy and don't want to type. You don't really need to ask them about the menu items because a photo book is present for those who are confused. I think this is a big bonus because I don't want to google pictures every time I read from the menu. The cakes are displayed outside and instead of looking at the pictures, you can directly choose from the counter. Everyone is nice so I don't have anything negative to say.  Food It's not exactly cheap. The food is definitely good and I can see why they jacked up the prices...having said that I do think it can be a little lower. Most of the menu items can be upgraded to a combo where you get dessert (i.e. any of the cakes). I am telling you right now, GET THAT OPTION. Their cakes are amazing; in fact I would come back during tea time just to eat these desserts again.  Salad - Meh lol. We could pass.  Hot pot - The udon was very smooth.  Chochin bento - All the bowls come stacked so when you reveal each layer, it's like SURPRISE! Lol. The sashimi was the best part of this bento; super fresh!  Green tea cake - This is quite heavy but in a good way. Green tea all the way! Did I mention that there is red bean inside? Ask yourself this question, where do you get red bean in a green tea cake? Probably only in Asia.  Tofu Cheesecake - It works because you taste more cheese than tofu. I hate it when a cheesecake becomes something else because the tofu overpowers it. Extremely creamy and oh so delicious."}
{"text":"The food is good, but over priced. Why was my lunch close to $30? Had their chirashi last time for dinner, it was very good, but why was it $40 after tax? For the same price I can get a Morimoto chirashi"}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers. My last visit was quite a while ago, and I noticed that the prices have gone up a little. I ordered the sashimi set.  - Miso soup - flavorful, as it should be. 9/10 - Ordered toro sashimi - 5.25 for 2 pieces. If you guys read my other reviews, you should know that I love toro. So this piece of toro is probably the lowest quality toro I've had at a good restaurant. It had no melt-in-your-mouth texture at all. Now of course, for 5.25 for 2 sashimi (compared to say, miyabi 3 pieces for 18, yasu 1 piece otoro sushi for $10), you get what you paid for, but I wouldn't mind paying more had they offered better quality toro. I'm almost certain it wasn't bluefin tuna. Just judging the quality, it receives a failing grade. 4/10. -Sashimi set - good quality. Maguro wasn't all that great. No Uni. Scallop and sweet shrimp were good. Not sure if it justifies the price increase though. 7.5/10. -Baileys cheese cake - my coworker and I didn't really taste any Bailey's. Not gonna give a rating since I'm not too into cheese cakes to begin with.  Onto what my coworkers had - Chochin bento - I tried the fried chicken. Great chicken (just like when I ordered it before) but might have been stingy with the spicy mayo. We asked for more though. 9/10 - Coworkers liked the chicken don and the salmon roll.  The quality may have gone down a notch since the last visit. Also since the price increased, value seems to have gone down too. Good service, which is about the same, but the entire restaurant only had one other table.  I'd return again, but probably not for the sushi/sashimi items. I'd like to try the sukiyaki udon and stuff someday. For in terms of sushi, I'll probably stick to Aoyama, which is almost just down the street, for better sushi and better prices.  8/10 for quality, 8.5/10 for service, 7/10 for value. 8/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"Desserts are good and fish is fresh. Probably of similar quality to a medium level Japanese place. They use real wasabi which is wonderful. Service is good but tiny space so reserve ahead!"}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Service : 4/5  This is one of my favourite sushi place, I have visited this place many times, all dinner set comes with tea/coffee and dessert. My favourite is cafe au lait chirashi even though it's a little bit pricy, but I like more varieties, it's definitely worth a try and I keep coming back for it :) Besides fresh and yummy sushi, they have a lot cake selections, and my favourite cakes are green tea brulee, tofu cheese cake, and earl grey tea chiffon I wish the tea can be a little bit stronger.  Highly recommended ??"}
{"text":"Well, their food menu is quite expensive and quality of the fish was okay. I'm not very impressed.   However, their dessert is a Star! That's the best dessert place in town in my opinion. I have tired almost various kind of cake from the store. -Green Tea red bean cake:  Green Tea with Red bean cake is my favorite one. It has strong macha taste without overly sweet. On top the cake it has a bit macha powder as well. -Sake cake: Very light sake flavor and not too sweet.  -Hazelnut cake and chestnut cake: Both Hazelnut cake and chestnut cake are very light. I will say it is the least sweet cake from the store. If you don't love sweet too much, you can definitely try this one. -Chocolate sugar free cake: Even its sugar free, it still tastes delicious. I believe they uses sweeteners instead of sugar. Surprisingly, there is not weird taste of the sweetener.  It has perfect balance b/t chocolate and sweetness.  -Tofu Cheesecake: It does taste similar to JTOWN's tofu cheesecake. However, I'm not a big fan of tofu cheesecake in general. It is too creamy for me after half of the cake.  -Earl Grey Cake: Not bad, but not my cup of tea. It does have earl grey favor, but it is just a bit werid to me.   The price is  around 4.9 per slice  for most cakes; Greet tea is $5.5 per slice. Portion of the slice is not too bad. At least I feel fulfilling and guilty after that.  You can also purchase half cake for $20 or whole cake for $40.   Btw, if you decide to go for lunch/dinner, make sure you make reservation. It is very small place with around 10-12 tables only including sushi bar."}
{"text":"Came here on a visit back to Toronto during Christmas break recently. A great place to do afternoon tea with a friend. Their afternoon tea specials go from 3:00pm-5:30pm where you can get a slice of cake and tea/coffee for $6.95. Their matcha green tea cake and tea special is $8.95. Still a good deal considering their slices of cake are around $5 to $6 already. Tried their sake cake and it was delicious. My friend tried their Baileys cheese cake. The baileys was more subtle in taste but the sake cake was quite flavorful. Definitely the green tea cake and sake cake are my top two faves!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I visited this place. I have tried the unagi don and hot pot udon. The food is good and normal. I would really like to have the sashimi bowl next time.  The dessert is great there. Earl Grey cake is so tasty with strong tea flavour. The sponge cake is quite soft and fluffy with several layers of cream. The sweetness is just alright and perfect."}
{"text":"As much as I LOVE this restaurant, I went for dinner today and found a dead, black, winged ant at the bottom of my salad bowl. Better food management should've taken place. The waitress mumbled sorry and only after awhile did she offer to replace the salad.   I didn't give it one star because the rest of the food here is good, although a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Café Michi is in a bit of a hood But the food is really quite good  Michi is so small, so fun, so peachy. It fills a spot that's a bit nich-ey.  Though the sushi is a bit pricier than it should.  I would recommend ordering from the set menu Getting a slice of cake is the specialty of the venue  I had the Chunky Chicken rice It was very tasty and nice  But the Green Tea Cake is what makes them their revenue.  If you go, you should make a reservation I would go back again without hesitation  The service was great And we ate and we ate and we ate  There you go, my friends of Yelp Nation."}
{"text":"Le Cafe Michi is small and quaint like most eateries you would find in Japan proper.  Le Cafe Michi is a diamond in the rough.  The rough being an unadorned, bland white plaza in the middle of Scarborough.  The numbering is pretty weird on Pharmacy Avenue and I actually drove past it a few times before I finally found it.  I panicked momentarily when I walked in and almost every single table out front had a RESERVED sign on it.  It may be located in a most humble and hidden location, but demand can rival any restaurant located in prime real estate locations downtown.    The restaurant itself is not big.  I would say that maximum capacity is no more than 35.  As you walk through the door you will see the cake display and random knick knacks (key chains and jewelery?) for sale at the counter.    It isn't your typical Japanese restaurant run by Chinese people.  And although the word \"authentic\" is thrown around so much it'll make your eyes glaze over - Le Cafe Michi is just that.  As I entered the restaurant  on this particular Saturday, eagerly anticipating my meal I felt a flush of panic.  Almost every single table had a reserved sign on it.  I start praying to the upper powers that there is still room and magically my prayers are heard.  As I'm being led to my seat I catch a quick glimpse of the cake display, because you come to just as much for the cake as you do for the actual sushi - or so I'm told.  I can't help but feel puzzled as I see random Japanese knick knacks (jewelry and key chains for sale on top of the counter).  The decor is minimalist, but I am lucky enough to nab a seat by the sushi bar,  where Toshi-San works his magic.  I carefully scan the menu and notice that the Omakase rings in at $50, but that you need to call in advance.  Omakase, literally meaning \"I'll leave it to you\" is a tasting menu in which the chef presents you with a series of dishes from lightest to heaviest.  [1] Depending on the venue, this can be quite a spectacle to watch.  The salad is pretty average but the Miso soup was definitely memorable.  It had a really concentrated flavour to it and you could taste the distinct soy flavour in the soup, even if it was just a tad bit salty!  I tuck that thought into the back of my mind and focus on what I can order.  We end up opting for a set lunch of Sashimi served with rice, starter salad, beverage (coffee/tea) and dessert.  We also order Katsu Chicken Curry that is accompanied by rice.  Unlike most Japanese restaurants in Toronto, you have to pay for the tea at Le Cafe Michi.  I can harp about how the Sashimi was fresh, but there's not much else you can say about raw fish and Toronto is definitely not home to the freshest catches either.  One really only needs knife skills - and most sushi chefs are experienced enough to serve up the right thickness of sliced fish. My only compliment can be that the wasabi \"relish\" with scallions was delicious.  The Katsu Chicken curry was creamy and thick.  The chicken is battered and deep fried.  The chicken was perfectly battered and crispy on the outside.  The chicken was quite tender.  For me, the selling point of this dish was the rice.  The texture of it was different than your average plain bowl of white rice, and soaked up the curry beautifully.  The base of the sauce is made with curry powder and thickened with a roux.  It should be noted that Japanese curries are unlike Indian curries in that they are quite mild.  While it is regarded as a Western dish (since the introduction of curry to Japan was via English cuisine), it is now regarded as a national dish due to its popularity. [2]  The Green Teacake was what I was most excited about as several friends had dined here and highly recommended it.  Asian desserts tend to be less \"heavy\" and less sweet compared to its Western counterparts.  Mousse cake are most popular because they are regarded as light and airy.  The cake was layered with green-tea infused sponge cake and mousse with a red bean filling and definitely lived up to its hype.  The sponge cake was light as a feather, and the red bean gave it just the right amount of sweetness.  Verdict:  Those of you who are used to stuffing yourselves silly at AYCE Japanese buffets for $25 will find Le Cafe Michi to be on the expensive side.  Mains range from $15-$35, but you come here for quality as opposed to quantity.  It is a relaxing place to go to slowly sip back a cup of green tea while savouring the flavours of the items that are placed in front of you.  The servers are quick to refill your coffee/tea and work quickly and efficiently.  I will definitely be back to try the Omakase - as the price is quite reasonable compared to the likes of Sushi Kaji ($100-$120 for their tasting menu).  ---------------------------------------------------------  [1] Wikipedia"}
{"text":"I have been to this little authentic Japanese restaurant for many times. The first time I went there was 4 years ago. Since then I only order Chyo-chin bento. This bento contains fried chicken, 6 pieces of fresh sashimi and a bowl of chewy rice with eel. The bento is the best option among all in terms of value and taste.  Oh,btw, they use fresh ground wasabi instead of powder. Not that many Places would do that in Toronto.  I go to Japan from time to time. Very few Japanese restaurants in Toronto can provide you authentic Japanese food. This one is one of the few Japanese restaurants that maintains Japanese cuisine standard."}
{"text":"Cakes are out of this world! You're gonna love it!   If you're hungry and want to get full on food, this is not the place.  Food portions is good for small eaters. Food is good but price is above average.  Overall. I would come back and just have cakes and coffee. Always call and make RSVP cause the place is very small."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese restaurant tucked in a rather dodgy plaza by Pharmacy and Sheppard. This place is a weekly staple of mine for their Green Tea Cake and Sake Cakes; also recommend karage, which can be ordered on its own or in the bento combo (smaller portion in the combo).  Other recommendations include cafe au lait chirashi, but their price has been raised consistently throughout the years. I usually choose omakase, or cafe au lait + karage in order to be full, and I am a very small person.  No matter what, try their green tea cake, the best."}
{"text":"After giving up on this restaurant for two years.  Recently heard good things about them, decided to give them another try.   Surprising they redeemed themselves,  food and service was amazingly good.  Back to the glory days of Le Cafe Michi.   Very happy to have this one back on our dinning list."}
{"text":"Such a cute place, very pretty and definitely suitable for a date! The food is very well cooked and presented :) loved it!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me as this is a neighbourhood gem. I came here with my friend after a fun day out and we did the smart thing by making a reservation (it is a must). Onto the venue, one could not tell where this store cause it is tucked away in a small plaza. The restaurant is small, like a typical mom and pop shop. Outside is more of the restaurant sit down area while the inside is the sushi bar. That's the place to see the master does his thing with precise knife skill.   Onto the food. What can I say? This place never disappoints. I ordered a katsu-don with chicken with combo, my friend ordered the Le Cafe Michi Udon hot pot with combo and we shared the spicy scallop roll (to die for). The spicy scallop roll uses a sriracha sauce as base, but it's not that spicy. I usually overshot it with their self prepared wasabi (note, they don't use the imitation stuff). It adds extra flavouring to the palete. The combo comes with a slice of cake and these are also to die for. I had the raspberry yogurt mousse cake. There are real raspberry seeds all over the cake. Their cakes are made in house and they are not sweet at all.   I will always come here for my \"fix\" of real Japanese food. Though recently the prices did go up a bit. But that is acceptable."}
{"text":"Are these ratings real?   $21 for a dish of curry + a small slither of cake. Have you had the chicken katsu without the curry? It's bland and tasteless. $38 for a dinky bowl of chirashi?  Sure it's fresh, but so is Tarro and Aoyama. The environment would be much nicer too.   I'm also not a Starbucks supporter but save your money and get a green tea latte at Starbucks instead. Twice the size and matcha powder.  I also have a feeling they invite bloggers to eat for free to get reviews. I saw at least 2 of them while I was there."}
{"text":"After hearing about the food in this place from so many people, and all the high ratings i decided i have to try it, since it is very close to where i live as well.   Overall i was underwhelmed by what i experienced, first of all, for a place that prides itself on quality there are various things that i believe it just plane average at best, and not even above average. The Maki sushi roll we orderd the spicy scallop maki. the scallop taste fine, however it is unremarkable and the rice texture is too wet sushi. Overall it is not worth the 10.95 that they charge for this roll.   the next was the Large Katsu Curry Chicken Rice. now the combo which includes miso soup, salad, and a cake. cost 19.95 before tax and tip. overall i was expecting amazing quality and unbelievable taste. The curry chicken, overall was average, it was not bad, but it was definitely not great enough to justify the price. The curry tasted exactly like instant curry you can buy at asian grocery stores, nothing refined or special about it. The Katsu chicken was like regular fried Katsu, there wasn't anything special either.   The cake was the only thing that some may believe is very good. Overall their cake is different in flavour then most places. and it is not bad, but not worth going out of the way to get.   My disappointment with this restaurant is that the price being so high for so many of their items, they're quality and the food they give just doesnt' warrant the price. most of their items are overpriced by double the amount. a chirashi cost 39.95. which is ridiculous considering what quality and portion they serve.   Overall i won't recommend this place to anyone. unless they enjoy spending loads of money for average food. i believe the rating represents what i believe which is the food is not bad, but not great. and definitely not amazing"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! The fried chicken nuggets is a must try! It's the best I ever had.  The chicken was juicy and the batter was thin and crispy.  Most of the meal comes with a slice of cake.  I get the green tea red bean cake every single time.  It's very soft and not too sweet."}
{"text":"MAKE RESERVATIONS!  I called in for reservations, couldn't get my time, so I settle for the 6pm seating, which is fine, I was dining with a girl friend, and we don't mind eating a bit earlier.  When I came in one time at 6pm there was no one here... as we were eating random customers kept walking in, they looked around and saw lots of empty seats, but was told it's all reserved so they had to leave, and this happened to a lot of customer who walked in. So if you did not make reservations, don't bother coming at all. even till the time we left almost 8pm (they were kind of rushing us out, but the place was not full), the place was only half full. I don't think they should be doing this reservation system.  anyways the price point is pricey, and portions are small. I've had much better japanese food, and the cakes is from J-Town. the seats are too close together, that you can hear other people's conversations."}
{"text":"first time dining at Le Cafe Michi with my boyfriend. The restaurant itself is pretty compact and small (tip: best to go with 1-2 people). There's only a few tables and the tables are very close together. I felt a bit awkward eating with my boyfriend, while other people are right beside me, hearing our conversations. But the food was decent, I highly recommend just going for take out or for dessert and chat with some girls friends. As for the pricing, it was expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"Has gone downhill since their inception, but overall still a fine Japanese gem in the GTA."}
{"text":"We walked in to see approximately 3 tables of Couples and a Single Lady at the Sushi Bar. Yup, this place had reservations on pretty much all other tables. EXCEPT for mine. :P   We were offered to go into the Sushi Bar area rather than the Cafe area. Good thing I'm too lazy to reserve on this Weeknight. The place setting were all offered as in Chopstick Holder, Soya Sauce Dish, Ceramic Cup but we were still given Wooden Chopsticks(?). The Ceramic Tea Cup was impossible to hold for my friend as the heat penetrates it completely unless you have asbestos fingers.   #1 Cafe Michi Sushi Set($18.95) which I thought was quite reasonable however there are small details lacking. Sushi is an art-form therefore I will critic it as so, it's only fair. This was only considered acceptable value since Cake Slice and App Salad was given, however no Miso Soup.   The California Roll was yummy but my Yelp friend would say \"where's the Black Sesame\". The END pieces were also facing up which breaks up the uniform 6-piece Rolls. In terms of the Sushi, I only fault it for the Snapper having a rip right in the middle.   #2 San-Shoku Chirashi($27.50) although with a modern presentation, I felt a bit overpriced here especially when the Squid, Octopus pieces could barely be considered a morsel. The Salmon seemed to be in half slice which just lacked that satisfaction factor.   Mocha Cake had Mocha smoothness once you let the solid state Buttercream melt in your tongue. It is good but not better than the Green Tea Cake which was light fluffy with Green Tea flavour while the Creamy portion was reminiscent of Green Tea Ice Cream.   All this said and done, Le Cafe Michi is still 4 *Star* worthy. Especially the Sushi Chef was so patient and friendly in handling the drunk disturbing Lady whom should have went to an Izakaya instead. He was still in FOCUS on his busy task at hand, my hats off to ye.  Good place to take a Friend for a quiet Birthday dinner since the Cake Slice was included in the Specials.   :P"}
{"text":"It's a cute little store located in Scarborough, fairly close to Steeles. Not a difficult place to find and although there's not a lot of parking spots, I didn't find it difficult to find parking. There were plenty of seats when we got there and the waitress was extremely friendly.  Le Cafe Michi also has a few non-food items for sale - super adorable.  Prices are fairly expensive here, you're looking at approximately $13-$22 a meal for lunch and, their portion sizes are small as well. I got the beef curry rice for $12.95 (small) for lunch. It comes with a miso soup, a salad and a slice of cake. I would have definitely traded in for a large portion $2 more, if I knew the portion sizes of these meals.   The quality of the meal was A-ok for me, nothing particularly special - not too sure if their sushi selections are much better. Overall, it was a cute little restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken/eel rice tri combo with cake. I thought the fish tasted fresh and the chicken was deep fried nicely. The decor of this place is so runned down that it feels weird paying such high prices. I'm not sure if i would go back, the price didn't justify the overall experience."}
{"text":"The gyudon was pretty good. The cake was okay but nothing special, had really high expectation based on the reviews, was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is ok. But pricy. Also the service doesn't match the price. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Got several dishes but had the donkatsu myself with the cake combo. Somewhat overpriced but quite delicious. I would return here but the prices could come down a bit for location and food.  The cakes were just ok; food was better."}
{"text":"First time here and the freshness of the fish in the cafe au lait chirashi was second to no one. Favorite part was the yellow fin tuna with wasibi sauce dots. The wasabi salad was yummy as well as the tiramisu. Green teas was hit and had just the right amount of tea leaves to give it the perfect amount of aroma. It is on the pricey side so if your hungry I'd recommend you find a ayce restaurant so you don't complain about the portions. If you are looking for quality I recommend you make a rezo before you arrive. Cheers"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I was excited to go to Café Michi for lunch when a co-worker suggested it. As stated in previous reviews Cafe Michi does slightly resemble a bakery as you notice the cake display when you first enter the restaurant. The staff was polite and attentive and seated us right away.  When looking at the menu, there didn't seem to be many sushi options as there were more hot dishes then fish. The prices are a bit high, I mean $3 for one piece of nigiri sushi is a bit much, even the lunch combos where priced at $18 which come with Tea/coffee, soup and cake. To me if I'm going out for sushi I'm there for the fresh fish not the dessert. Paying that much for a lunch I would rather have more sushi options, I ordered the spicy salmon and vegetable roll, I have to admit when the food arrived I wasn't too impressed, it was okay taste wise the spicy salmon could have had a bit more heat to it but I loved how strong there wasabi was. In my opinion I've had better sushi for that price.  I probably would not go back."}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= Cozy, inviting, just like a shop you'd find tucked away in the side streets of Japanese cities.  Staff seemed friendly and the place is clean!  Food ===== We order two set lunches--Great food!  You can put this up there with the best.    The service however, is confusing.  Don't get me wrong they are really nice, but today I was a bit dumbfounded.  Me and my girlfriend both ordered a lunch combo.  Lunch combos come with a drink and free refills.  ** But Apparently you cannot share drinks.** - When we asked for refills we figured we'd get a refill and we can swap so we get to try out all the drinks.  (Its coffee or tea, but they're both premium coffee and premium teas) - We kinda just blurted it aloud that we'd swap drink so we get a taste--and this is where the waitress jumped in and said we cannot do that. - 0.0...so she was very insistent that we cannot share our drinks, even though refills are free. - If we want to taste the other drink we have to buy it... 0.0.  I found that ridiculous so we said okay but we share our drinks anyways.  I'm sorry but the meal is $$$ and I find the rule silly.  We got weird stares and so we finished and left as full, satisfied but unhappy customers :(.  Will we come back again? =================== No.  Money is hard earned and I'll spend it in places that provides good customer experiences.  It might be a custom that we are unaware of but leaving unhappy after spending a not insignificant amount of money on food doesn't seem to make any sense."}
{"text":"I had no idea I did not write a review for this place despite I used to come here often 3 years ago when high end authentic Japanese food were still hard to find.  Came here again over the weekend with JC since she wanted to try it so I booked 30 minutes before coming for a table of 2 and I was surprised it was available!  I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar if possible.  Before I go to the reviews, I must warn everyone Le Cafe Michi is expensive!  If you want to be somewhat full and enjoy the good food, expect to drop around 45$ per person.  For 2 people, we ordered the Cafe au lait Chirashi which comes with lots of great and high tier sashimi on the top (Uni is included), and once you break through the layer of tamago (egg), you see unagi don underneath!  This is probably my favourite dish here and of course I told JC to get it. =)  I went with the Chichon Bento which has three layers, first layer is your fried chicken with spicy mayo sauce, second layer has 6 slices of sashimi and last layer is a unagi don.  Portion wise is perfect for one person!  Chicken is fried to perfection with juice flowing out in every bite!  Sashimi is fresh as always and Unagi Don, although it only two pieces of Unagi, it was still well made.  Each dish comes with complementary desserts, which you can choose anything you want from the display, but if you need recommendation, i HIGHLY recommend the Tofu Cheesecake, Green Tea Creme Brulee or the Green Tea Cake."}
{"text":"You have to make a reservation for this little place. Service is good but food-wise, I didn't think it was anything special...No offence to the owners. A bit over-priced in my opinion. And it's located in a...not so interesting part of Scarborough."}
{"text":"It has been almost five years since my last visit at Le Cafe Michi for dinner. Thought we'd give it a try again!   Went there on a weeknight and it was packed! We didn't manage to order the omakase and did a la carte this time!   Their sashimi and sushi are on par but the noodles and dons are much better. So next time i know this place is an option if i prefer their hot table.   The best is always the last. Their famous desserts have held their high standards... green tea cake, creme caramel, tiramisu and more... it never fails you!!   A definite yes to recommend! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night as recommended by a friend who said this place is well known for its desserts. I was a little sketched out by its outer appearance as the restaurant is in a small strip. It's not as bad as it looks!   The food served here is Japanese style but I wasn't really impressed. Everything on the menu was expensive (at least more than $17). And that was the average lunch price! However, there are options to order dishes on their own for a little less (~$13) OR order a main dish that comes with matcha tea, japanese salad, and a dessert (only $5 more-ish). The latter is a much better deal. I ordered udon hotpot which was a simple udon noodle with seafood. Nothing spectacular. The green tea was authentic which was pretty cool.   I think the best part of the meal was the desert. Being well known for desserts, it's a must try. I had a earl grey cake with a hint of orange and it was delicious! I also tried their tofu cheesecake (stolen from my friend hehe) which is AMAZING!!   I wouldn't order food from here again but their desserts are worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I initially had high hopes for this cafe since it was recommended by our friend as well as the rave reviews. I wouldn't say I'm a sushi or Japanese cuisine expert but I've had my fair share of meals.  First of all, typically you would expect a small cafe in Scarborough area to have reasonable prices, but this is not the case. Prices for their \"meals\" or \"combos\" are quite unreasonable. It ranges from average 30-50$. It comes with tea or coffee, slice of cake, small wakame salad and the main meal. This means that the main course is about 20- 40$ but the portions are ridiculously small.   I ordered the cafe au lait chirashi dinner combo and my husband ordered a katsu curry combo. Both of which tasted fine but nothing stellar. The price for the chirashi for example was $38. At Akane sushi in Richmond Hill, you can order a love boat filled with almost 35 pieces of sushi for the same price! I understand if the sushi quality was amazing but the uni on the chirashi don was not even that fresh!  If you have tried all the good sushi restaurants in town and you are looking to try a new place, you may want to see what all the hype is all about, but otherwise, it's a pass for me. The cakes were quite tasty but I think a lot of people are biased because of the cakes."}
{"text":"Came in for a very late afternoon lunch - sushi bar was closed but great variety of other dishes. We had the sukiyaki and tonkatsu. 2 very different dishes that were both excellent and reminded me of meals I had in Japan. The meals came with a choice of tea or coffee, and also a slice of cake for dessert - hot tea with green tea cake was a perfect way to end the meal.  I loved everything about this place! Staff is so nice and the ambiance is great for enjoying a low key meal and socializing with friends. I even love their display cases with fun Japanese purses and wallets, cakes, and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years and I still love this place because it's a nice little restaurant with consistently good food. My boyfriend and I come here from time to time on date nights since we don't live that far away. It gets really packed on the weekend so make sure you make reservations.   The restaurant is small and can hold about 22 people at a time. The front has a display of all the delicious  desserts they sell, and the back is where the sushi bar is located.  On to the food: I usually order the Chyo-chin bento but today I decided to splurge a bit more for the Cafe au lait chirashi($39) cause I was craving sashimi. My combo includes a choice of tea or coffee, a Seaweed salad, and a dessert. The Seaweed salad is average but I do enjoy it more than the regular garden salad they serve with other combos. The presentation of the chirashi is really nice and I really liked the fresh uni. The sashimi variety is great, and I love the surprise underneath the bed of seafood! There's a very thin layer of egg, rice and eel, making it more interesting to eat than just plain rice. I chose my usual dessert of the English trifle, because I just love the refreshing taste of the fruits layered with cake, custard, and whipped cream. I've tried most of the desserts and really like that none of them are overly sweet. My boyfriend ordered the Hazlenut meringue cake and the flavour reminded me of Ferrero Rocher, but just a hint of the flavour which is pleasant.  Overall: It's always a pleasant experience for me here and I love the casual atmosphere. I'm taking a star off because it is more on the pricier side and the service is slower when the restaurant gets busy. It's hard to flag someone down to refill our coffee or tea even though the restaurant is small. But as far as food goes It's great, and always leaves me satisfied. My favourite will always be the Chyo-chin bento because of the large juicy pieces of karage drizzled with a spicy mayo sauce. There's 2 slices each of salmon, tuna and hamachi on the second tier and eel, rice, egg and some seasoning on the third tier. The variety of flavors is what keeps me coming back :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and I plan to repeat my visits many, many more times. While the place, ambiance, etc., is not what you'd expect for the prices, it's definitely worth every penny once the food arrives.  The place is suitable for soloists, couples, friends, colleagues and families alike with its neutral decor and lack of mood lighting, and I guess that's what makes it work. On my first visit, I was accompanies by a few of my friends, one of whom lived in Japan for some time. She adored the place, as it reminded her strongly of a little cafe she would visit there, and thanked me for the moment of semi-'deja-vu'.  A run down of what I've tried here so far: Teri-Don: It was really well prepared. Grilled pieces of chicken with just a hint of sauce over a bed of rice in a bowl. The teriyaki sauce wasn't sweet like ubiquitous pseudo-sushi restaurants throughout Toronto.  Spicy Salmon Roll: The professional sushi chef had cut just the right piece of salmon. It was melty, and delicious. The rice was prepared as authentically as it should be.  California Roll: The maki rolls reminded me exactly of the few great, authentic Japanese restaurants I've tried all around North America. I use their rolls as the baseline for my judgement, and really these rolls were just as good. The rice was prepared well and extremely fresh.  Japanese Green Tea Cake: I'd recommend this one for the slightly more health or weight conscious, as the cake is still extremely delicious and creamy, but just not as heavy as the cheesecake. Blueberry Cheesecake: Love! A slice will make you fall in love with it's berry-nut combination. Peanut Allergy alert, however!  The service was fantastic for a busy restaurant. The attentive and courteous waitstaff spares no second, constantly refilling cups with tea and removing plates where needed.   Overall, Le Cafe Michi is a once size fits all for authentic cuisine enthusiasts like me."}
{"text":"This is my third visit. My previous one before today's was 2 years apart. Their service was incomparable to what I had experienced two years ago. I finished my main dishes and tea was not filled. They used to clean the tables before desserts but they no longer do so. The sashimi were tasteless (so was their wasabi - yes plain wasabi)! Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want high-end Japanese cuisine plus dessert.  I almost always order the same thing, the eel rice + sashimi + chicken karaage, and it comes with a dessert and your choice of tea or coffee (free refills), all for just under $30.  The meal arrives in a cute 3-tier container with chicken on top, sashimi in the middle, and eel rice at the bottom.   The chicken karaage is like no other fried chicken I've ever had. I come here specifically because I crave for the chicken. It comes with an orange sauce drizzle that tastes a bit like spicy chipotle mayo.  The sashimi came in 6 pieces, salmon, red tuna, and hamachi. They were fresh and delicious.  The eel rice was pretty good, and has bits of preserved orange zest (I think that's what it is) which adds a nice dimension to the flavour.  For dessert, I ordered the fruit trifle. It's one of their best desserts, in my opinion.  In the past, I've also tried their Cafe Au Lait Chiraishi, but at $40, it's a bit overpriced, even with the included dessert and coffee. That being said, it is probably the best chirashi I've had in the GTA, in terms of taste and presentation.  The service was warm and welcoming, and they`re run by Japanese people (yes, it makes a difference). The tall male waiter was kind and attentive, and his voice sounds like the the voiceover in the Japanese YouTube cooking show, Cooking with Dog. Try to notice it next time.   It's a small restaurant with a small parking lot, so make reservations and try to arrive early to get a parking spot."}
{"text":"I'm back!!! Oh such good cakes keep me coming back for more.  This time I tried the tofu cheesecake. It's amazing! If you like Japanese style cheesecake (which tends to be airy and light), you'll love this. The cake itself is very light, not too sweet, the crust is thin made of graham crackers and black sesame seeds, which adds a nice flavour to the delicate cake.  I've been here to many times, I think I've almost tried all their cakes. I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Despite the long wait times, their food was always consistently good, and their cakes were some of the best I've had in the GTA. However I had unfortunately encountered a really frustrating experience with them that completely turned me off.  I was with a few friends of mine and we came to the restaurant at 8:00pm. The server told us to wait for a bit for our table, but 25 minutes later, told us that they can't serve us because they were full. I was furious that she made us wait that long before telling us that she can't accommodate us. She wasn't even apologetic about the situation, and acted as if it was a situation beyond her control. I was surprised to see that a Japanese restaurant would provide such poor customer service - they're usually on point when it comes to these things. I understand that these situations aren't ideal, but a sincere apology really would have been sufficient.  I would love to go back there some day, but now that there are a lot of new and high-quality Japanese restaurants and Asian pastry shops in the GTA, I feel no need to make the trip to Scarborough to be treated like this.  ?????????"}
{"text":"Hidden place in Scarborough. This place is packed on a sat night, need to make reservations.  The desserts here are pretty good, good selection of cheesecakes. Since I don't eat raw fish, it's hard to find something good to eat. The sashimis look like good quality, as there is a sitting bar you can see the sushi chefs making the food. There are a lot of sushi chefs for the size of the restaurant, the place seem very authentic with all the Japanese employees. Excellent and prompt service, if you're sitting at the bar sushi chefs would ask you if everything is okay, which is very cool.  I had the hotpot which is just an udon, it came with the salad and green tea and dessert."}
{"text":"Pretty cozy place. Good for quiet conversation. Their combos are great and the cake displays really are a nice touch. Their a la carte sushi leaves something to be desired if you're very discerning. The lure is in its location and word of mouth appeal."}
{"text":"Overrated, cake is really expensive, and staff isn't very friendly. Was also disappointed because I've heard many things about the cake not being very sweet, and it was sweet (I don't like sugar). Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Menu: https://www.zomato.com/toronto/le-cafe-michi-scarborough-gta/menu#tabtop  What we had: Chochin Bento (Karaage, sashimi, eel on sushi rice), Premium Nigiri sushi set, green tea cake, hazelnut cake  Taste: 9.5/10  The sushi and sashimi were perfect, fresh fish with just the right amount of rice.  Karaage (deep fried chicken) was moist and flavourful.   Eel on rice was succulent.  Both the cakes were very good too, but did not meet our expectations (based on what other reviewers wrote).  The green tea flavor was definitely on point, but the cake itself was a little lacklustre (dry).  Would rate 10/10 for taste if it were not for the cakes.  Value: 1/10  26$ for the chochin bento and 38$ for the sushi set (these both came with salad, coffee/tea and a piece of cake).  The sushi set came with 8 sushi and 2 rolls (6 pieces).  While we were somewhat full by the end of the meal (we ate slowly), Steven probably could have ate everything by himself and still have room for more.  **Average cost per diner: 40$ After Tax+Tip  Service / Convenience: 8/10  Authentic Japanese restaurant with a very soothing environment.  We actually got to sit near the sushi bar and got to see some live action sushi making.  The place is fairly clean, servers are very friendly.  The restaurant itself is fairly small, and tables are close together.  It wasn't very crowded when we went (around 7:30 pm), however, as other reviewers stated, its better to have a reservation.  Would go back? Maybe, but only after try other similar restaurants to compare first.   Would recommend to friend? Yes, great place for a date or special occasion.  Similar places: None for now  **Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"Really fresh sushi, especially the sea urchin. Pretty high quality for the price. It's more expensive but it includes salad and dessert. The Chyo-chin bento had a good variety. Eel on rice is nothing special, but tasty. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a very small and quiet Japanese owned restaurant cafe located in Scarborough. Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Came here with a group of friends.   They had set meal which came with salad, tea or coffee and a slice of cake! We all went for the set meals.   I'm just going to review my own set meal here.  I ordered the Cafe Au Lait Chirashi. ($38.95) The set up of bowl was beautifully arranged and filled with a lot of sashimi goodness. There was sweet shrimp, scallops, uni, etc...all so fresh and delicious! Underneath the array of sashimi was also a thin layer of egg omlette, underneath the egg was even more!!! There was also unagi along with the sushi rice! It was quite a big bowl for me, but it was so good I devoured the whole thing :P  My other friends thought it was a bit overpriced and portion was small for them. But for my order, I think it's worth it!  For dessert I choose the Green Tea Red Bean Mousse Cake. It was delicious! The cake was super moist, airy and light."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi restaurants. The menu is a photobook so you know exactly what you're ordering. Had a chirashi combo and sashimi was really fresh.  The best part of this meal is the dessert. There are so many cakes to choose from and they are all freshly baked in house. I highly recommend the tofu cheesecake (you can't tell it's tofu at all) and the green tea mousse cake which contains some red bean."}
{"text":"The sushi is great here, really fresh, but very pricey for the portions you get. Compared to other sushi restaurants I've been to, this place feels more authentic, but it's not exactly worth the hiked up price to get it. I got the Chirashi Bowl for $40. The fish they use is excellent and it's presented beautifully, but I wouldn't come back again to pay that price. The place is also very small and a bit grungy. Staff are very friendly though and if you get a combo, you get a miso soup and cake as your dessert. Their cakes are quite good, all with a Japanese style."}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Small little cafe, good quiet atmosphere to chat with friends. Authentic Japanese food. Fish is always fresh. Cakes are tasty and not too sweet. Service are great. Chyo-chin bento, chirashi sushi, and the tofu cheesecake are some of my favourite. Make sure you make reservation."}
{"text":"Came back for a splurge lunch after many years and it is still pricey and just 'ok'..   Cafe au Lait Chirashi  ~$40!! - My main reason for coming was for the sea urchin, but sadly not in season!! so substituted with fish roe, which was just as good, big and salty  - 2 each of salmon, hamachi, tuna, red snapper, octopus, plus scallop, squid, sweet shrimp, ebi  - rice is covered with a thin sheet of egg, with eel at the bottom. pretty warm homey bowl of rice contrasting the sashimi at the top - served room temp/warm.. this is supposed to make the fish taste stand out more? didn't really have much difference, just that the fish, especially tuna, was a bit softer  - a bit let down for the price, because at $40, I could have similar/better quality sashimi with more variety of specialty fish  - for quality wise, I could get a similar bowl of chirashi at half the price  - comes with seaweed salad (good! not those artificial green ones), coffee/tea, and cake.  I think the main selling point is the chirashi and the cakes, which was a bit disappointing. I had the Tofu Cheesecake - very strong cheese flavor, and surprisingly heavy for a tofu cake. The Sake Cake is a German chocolate cake with sake cream, definitely taste the sake; it's sort of like Tiramisu but without the coffee."}
{"text":"I've seen this place grow from 'cafe' serving coffee and cakes to a full blown menu over the years.  The cakes are done well, they might not look the best, but the taste and quality of definitely there.  The dinner service is so-so. The service is often slow and the cook foods are sub-par. It's good value for Japanese food, however I wouldn't say it's great or anything special. I think the set meal pricing makes it worth it. We tried their sashimi, katsu don, unatama, chirashi and I can't say anything stood out. Not sure I'll be returning on my own will, the service was a bit slower then I'd like and it felt like we were there forever because we waited so long for the waitress to even appear to make any requests. This is an area where improvement is much needed."}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Michi one time. I decided to give it a try because it's near where I live. Sushi was okay. I've had better. It's a small place, not a lot of seats. The dessert part of the restaurant is a unique feature. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I have been there three times now, and I can easily say this is one of my favourite Japanese restaurant. 4.5 stars. The -0.5 star goes to crowded space. The spacing is really not all that great.   This time I went with mom for her birthday. We went on a weekday for lunch, as usual I made a reservation to ensure that we can be seated immediately. The lady who picked up the phone actually spoke decent English for a change. I was really pleased. When we arrived, the service was excellent. To my surprise, the waitresses who helped us actually spoke English very well. The food was served at a decent pace, and our tea was constantly refilled without having to ask.   We ordered the unatama (eel on rice) lunch special and assorted sashimi. The lunch special came with complementary salad, miso soup, green tea/coffee and cake. The portions are fairly small but they do fill you up rather quickly. The appetizer salad and miso soup was nothing too special, though my mom did note the soup being a little salty for her liking. The unatama was absolutely amazing. The eel they used were definitely NOT the canned ones you see in AYCE restaurants. The eel was nice and tender when cooked, and it was glazed with eggs, green onion, and seaweed. The sauce they used was not overly salty at all.   As for the sashimi, I must say I am pleased. The fish they used were very fresh, so when eaten they are extremely tender and literally melt in your mouth. This is by far my personal favourite dish. The soy sauce was provided for you in a small dish rather than you having to pour it out of a container like a lot of other restaurants. The soy sauce is specially made by them, because it's not overly salty at all, and it even gives a slight tinge of sweetness. As well, the wasabi was grinded from fresh horseradish, so it doesn't overpower the taste of the sashimi in any way, unlike the paste wasabi one usually gets.   For the cake, we chose the green tea cake with red bean paste. I must comment, they did something special to it. They marked the plate with \"Happy birthday mom\" in various colours, as well as put candle on the cake for mom. She was very happy and very pleased. As for the cake itself, it's not very sweet, which is perfect. The red bean paste just adds the extra slight sweetness to the cake, it's an amazing combination.  Overall, it was a fairly pricey lunch ($58 + tips) for two, but it was worth every penny of it. Great service and great food. Highly recommended and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came for a dinner date, with a reservation as the place is kind of small, but popular. It's in a small Scarborough plaza, but inside the front half is a cafe-looking area and a more sushi-looking place in the back. We both ordered the Chyo-Chin bento.  I really enjoy having this set dinner here, as it comes with Chicken Karage, Sashimi, and Unagi rice; all favourite items of mine, and it comes with a dessert. The chicken is crispy and I like the sauce it comes with. The fish is fresh, and the eel on rice goes well with everything. For dessert I especially like the Tofu Cheesecake. It's very light, but still creamy. The set itself is quite filling, and will cost $26 plus tax + tip."}
{"text":"Reservations definitely recommended. I love how most of their dishes come with cake. I usually opt for the cafe du lait chirashi or the be to with chicken karaage, sashimi and eel rice. Cakes are very delicious as well and a perfect ending. I recommend the tofu cheesecake and the green tea with red bean cake"}
{"text":"FINALLY!  After many months, my friend and I finally go to meet up to eat at Cafe Michi (seemed like every single time we wanted to go, it ended up being a Monday - and the restaurant is closed on Mondays).  I thought it was closed when we drove up to the restaurant.  It's located at Pharmacy and Sheppard right next to Lin Garden.  Not the prettiest little plaza, but what do you expect from Scarborough? ;)   (I kid, I use to live in Scarborough).  Anyhow, the front of the restaurant was more dark, but the back of the restaurant was better lit and located next to the sushi bar.  My friend and I decided to sit at the back.  We both ordered specials.  The appetizer was okay - typical salad.   I ordered a small Japanese curry katsu don (which wasn't that small - which was great!)  and she ordered a seafood udon.  My dish was great -- I have a weird affinity for Japanese curry.  It had some braised beef, potatoes, etc.    We always ordered a hamachi roll to share.  It had a little bit too much rice for my liking though.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dessert. My friend ordered the green tea cake and I ordered the Bailey's cheesecake.  I must admit, the Bailey's cheesecake was heavenly.  I've been craving for it for the longest time, and it definitely hit the spot.  Cafe Michi is definitely a nice place to have dinner with a good friend for some sushi and some cake if you ever want the combination.  The unlimited tea was great too as they actually used real matcha.  Definite recommend!"}
{"text":"space is limited, so better make reservation  love their cakes, especially their English Truffle  and for me, they have very good katsu don and gyu don in town :-D"}
{"text":"I am defo a fan of this cozy cafe. The cakes are always delicious - so delicious that I always forget to take pictures. The best cakes in Scarborough. One of the best places in the GTA.  I've eaten lunch here once and it was CHEAP. Tasted like home cooked food! Yummy.  Like the previous reviews, Michi isn't well known for their great customer service.  They sometimes forget you're there, especially if you're in the sushi bar room. (Thank goodness the sushi chef is attentive!) So, minus 1 star because their customer service is usually on the bad side... but then it's always busy and there's little space to move around.  My favourite cakes are: Sugar Free Chocolate Mouse and Sake Cake!  You must try these!!   I'll be back...probably tonight :P"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I don't know how anyone can give it a bad review. This place is a hidden gem in Scarborough and is located beside Lin Garden (great Hakka food from what I hear) in a dodgy plaza. Most people make the mistake of thinking they could get a table by just walking in with no reservations. That is a rookie mistake my friend. I mean sometimes that will work but usually this place is super busy and gets booked up quickly. You don't know how often I've seen people get turned away because they didn't make reso.  I love their selection of food and my fav is the combos that come with salad, main, tea and dessert. Great value IMO. Definitely try the omakase but you need to let them know a day in advance to prepare it! They have a cute photo album so you can see what your dishes will look like - nice touch!  I just wish they were more frequent in refilling my tea opposed to me asking all the time. Otherwise, friendly staff and great food!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese home-cooking and premium-quality sashimi. Karaage is outrageously moist and crisp, while beef sukiyaki houses a variety of deliciously fresh ingredients in a rich and aeronautic broth. Staples like gyudon and katsudon are comfort foods not to be missed. Finish off the meal with some of the city's best cakes, meticulously crafted to a Japanese master's standards. Tofu cheesecake, earl grey chiffon, and matcha are some of many standouts."}
{"text":"Food:   The main course is perfect, we ordered Unatama & Toritama dinner set. The egg dressing is cooked medium that perfectly blends with the rice and eel / chicken.  Chicken & eel were very tender and juicy with rich flavours.  Rice is Japanese rice, cooked very soft, and some people may not like it. Personally I prefer chewy rice.   The green tea cake is very soft and sponge, not the sugary-sweet that most western cakes taste like, but the red beans are over sweet, and could included less in the cake.. Green tea flavour is very rich! Love it!  Sake cake is basically chocolate cake blended with minimal strong sake, you can taste the alcohol but not to the extent that it takes over the chocolate.. The cake is more like a mix of brownie & choco-cake, and it goes very well with tea/black coffee  Tiramisu is a little too sweet, in my opinion, but I think most ppl will like it, and tastes better in comparison.   Service:  Very good, tea & coffee were constantly refilled, dishes were served on timely basis..   Price:  All meat-set (15-17) are cheaper compared to fish-set (23-ish), sushi & sashimi are even more expensive. The food quality is, so far in my opinion, deserve the price.   All tables are couple-seated, just one at the corner with 3 seats.   Definitely going back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"The food is good! I like the fry chicken ( sorry i dunt rmb the name of that lol). The fry chicken is a little sweet, which teases good, and not too dry. I like the fresh urchin. THE THING THAT I LIKE MOST IS THE GREENTEA CAKE!!! WOW IT IS SOOOO DELICIOUS!  one think i dont like is the place is too samll...... = = probly cuz i am fat lol"}
{"text":"Expensive, high quality, fresh but small portions. Dish #1 $25 for 6 pieces of sashimi (Tuna, salmon, white fish). Also came with 4 large pieces of fried chicken. The chicken was amazing (moist, crispy and tender). Also came with small bowl of eel on rice. Dish #2 $22 for eel on rice with eggs. Tasted really good but dish was very small and did not satisfy the glutton within me. Meals came with a slice of cake. We got the Green tea cake and chocolate sake cake. Pretty decent. Seating is limited. Really liked the photo book menu. If it wasn't for this I wouldn't haven known half the stuff I ordered. Overall a very good experience. Come with a half full stomach and a fully loaded wallet. If I had to fill my appetite I'm sure I would have spent $100 on myself alone."}
{"text":"Small inconspicuous place that you'd miss if you blink. Wasn't even sure the place was open. Ordered the beef curry and rice dish to go. Comes with a small garden salad. Salad and beef were quite fresh. The rice was a touch on the pasty side but not overly a problem. Service was prompt. Not sure if try the place again as it wasn't a knock out. The place is quote small so reservations might be required. Staff are quite friendly. Wasn't offered a water or green tea while waiting for my order."}
{"text":"Love the combination of great sushi and pie, what else could a girl ask for?"}
{"text":"I decided to try this little restaurant which I have heard of but never tried on a Sunday afternoon. I was amused by the cake display and small selection of accessories that were on sale at the front of the cafe.   After sitting down and examining the menu, I ordered the Tamago Don lunch special which included tea or coffee, salad, miso soup and a slice of cake. My friend ordered a similar dish but I cannot recall the name of it.   The server we had was very friendly and attentive. We received our food in a timely manner, the salad was a very generous portion and tea or coffee is refillable (which is a plus). The food was very flavourful and delicious. Although the prices are a little high but for the service and amount of food I think it is reasonable. The sushi was priced a lot higher, so I would suggest having the sushi during dinner. Both my friend and I agree that we would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Food wise the food was ok, I was expecting the sushi to be a bit better. The eel egg rice was pretty good, however the curry was probably the most tasteless thing I have ever eaten. Luckily, their Green Tea cake made up for the main disappointment. That slice of cake was wonderfully moist and there is a hidden layer of red bean that creates this perfect slice of dessert heaven. Their mocha cake was good, but their green tea cake was the winner by a huge win margin. Their green tea is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here. The set menu comes with coffee or tea, salad, main course, and a slice of cake. Everything tasted pretty good. Their chicken katsu curry was really delicious and as good as the one I had in Japan. Their cakes are very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Fabulous place and great service!  I've had quite a few of their dishes...and they have all been delicious.  Their teri-don (teriyaki chicken bowl) is deliciously flavoured and that is a regular item I always get.  If I'm hungry enough, I venture into getting the \"chyo-chin bento\", which consists of 3 layers of side dishes including the most bottom layer as white rice with eel, middle layer consisting of a couple pieces of (extremely delicious & fresh) sashimi, and finally, the top layer with fried chicken.  Their soba is also made just right and their sauce is made to perfection.  I've also had some of their sashimi dishes and their sashimi rivals the other Japanese place close-by.  It also appears as though their soy sauce is specially made because there is a smoky sweet/salty taste to their soy sauce, which complements their super fresh fish nicely.  I've also had their toritama, a dish that has chicken & onions on it - and it is certainly a good comfort food dish.  Recently, I've had their salmon don, which was quite good - their sashimi is always the most fresh.  I also had their seafood udon, which is my favourite.    This place is truly owned by Japanese people (very few and far in between) in Toronto and their food is so authentic.    Cafe Michi also has a variety of cakes, some of which they buy, but some of which are made by the owner herself (who is the nicest lady ever!! =^-^=).  My favourite cakes are definitely the Earl Grey and Lemon Ciffon cake.  I also recently tried their English trifle and it was also...scrumptious!!!    In terms of ambiance, Michi is very very cozy and sweet.  Above their cake counter are accessories (jewelry, decor, etc.) that the owner's mother makes.  Those cats she makes are absolutely adorable.  Overall, the portions of food are fair.  I think if you are the average guy, one teridon isn't going to fill you up.  I, however, always walk out feeling extremely full, especially when you get their lunch set and dinner set.  Price wise, they are definitely pricier than their surrounding competition but with good reason.  Their fish is a lot fresher than the average place (and it can usually be distinguished by experienced sushi/sashimi eaters such as many of the reviewers here).  If you're looking for QUALITY Japanese food, you should come here.  However, if you can't justify the cost of the cake and food here and you're looking for massive QUANTITIES and meh-okay quality, stay in J-town's food court or keep going to AYCE places.  ***Also, make sure you make reservations for dinner.  Many people do, hence why if you come in without a reservation, chances are you probably won't get a seat at night despite all the empty chairs (it's because you walked in shortly before people with reservations are coming in :P).  But to avoid disappointment, this would be my words of wisdom from me to you :)"}
{"text":"I was there at 12:15 today. I was told to wait for 15 minutes for a table, which I am fine with. At 12:30, a table was available, but the customer showed up with their reservation. The server told me that they made a mistake and the table was not available for me. I understood, so I ordered for take-out. Then, it was 1:15, about 45 mins after I ordered take-out and I was told I had to wait for another 15 minutes for take-out. I only ordered for 2 Teriyaki Don. Then she came back and told me that the rice was undercooked. At this point, I was fed up and so I asked for a refund and left. Making two mistakes in a row with the same customer is unacceptable. By the way, they did not even say sorry. I went to J town instead and got the same food in 5 mins after I placed my order."}
{"text":"The green tea cake and fruit short cake are the best cake I have ever tried in Toronto. It's really Japanese style cake."}
{"text":"Tucked away at a run-down corner of Sheppard/Pharmacy, don't let the mediocre neighboring restos fool you :P This one is a gem!  Faves: 1) Stacked bento combo: Had karage (Japanese fried chicken.. SO tender, A+), sashimi (very fresh) and eel on rice (too much rice..) 2) Beef curry (very flavorful, for girls the small size would be enough on an avg day)  Most of the dinner items there also come with a salad/miso soup + dessert. The cake selection for dessert is ridiculous and too delish to pass on. Recommend the Earl Grey or Green Tea cakes!"}
{"text":"Great little gem of a restaurant in Scarborough. I've come numerous times and have tried their entree and cakes. By far the cakes are the most impressive, with unique tastes and delicious textures. It is generally a quiet restaurant, which is excellent for conversation. Seating is rather limited, so I recommend making a reservation.   My only two complaints are that the decor is rather plain (although that may be intentional on their part) and it is a little too pricey to make this place a regular dinner spot."}
{"text":"Only thing keeping this place from getting the full rating is the price. I consider their food quality to be high and their service is much better than some places I've been to. But with every meal they overcharge you a few dollars for the slice of cake, well what if I don't like eating desserts? There's no decor to speak of. Language barrier seems to be an issue with a few tables around us, we didn't have that issue since we pointed to the waitress exactly what we wanted.   As always I ordered the Chirashi and it was delish! Beautifully presented and it was as fresh as it gets. The grade of the fish is obviously higher and tastes like the fish just came from the sea this morning. Friend ordered the Chicken Katsu and I had a piece, it was good. But honestly for that price I probably wouldn't order it.   I had high hopes for dessert because it seems like other Yelpers enjoyed it, I guess it's just not my cup of tea. I'm not overly crazy about their desserts and the fact that it was included in my set where I had to pay the extra money for it."}
{"text":"It was good but I found it rather pricey.  The space is small but not too bad.  The curry was good but I've had better beef curry.  My husband had the hot pot udon soup and that was quite good (probably the best value).  I don't know if I would go back again, maybe to try the green tea cake but living in East York with Mon K Patisserie nearby I doubt I would go back there for their cakes as it seems like they were brought in."}
{"text":"Cafe Michi is an interesting place - I wouldn't have known there was an authentic Japanese restaurant, run by Japanese owners and staff, that also makes its own cakes, in a ghetto-ish looking plaza - if not for food blogs and yelp!  Cafe michi is a great place for mid-range sushi/sashimi. The quality is good and consistent, and they use quality soy sauce and wasabi. While the portions are a bit smaller, the quality is definitely not something thats compromised. And the big plus is a number of the meal options come with dessert - which is a slice of their specialty cakes (e.g., chocolate sake, green tea, cappuccino mousse, earl grey, etc) or other desserts like tarts or trifle.  Two of my favorite meals are 1) the karaage chicken bento (Chyo-chin bento) which comes with karaage chicken (really delicious - juicy!), some sashimi, and rice + eel, and 2) the cafe Au lait chirashi - which has a nice mix of different types of fish and uni, and rice bed with eel. The former is a decent dinner deal at about $28 - which includes a small salad, the meal, drink (tea/coffee - with refills), and dessert. The latter is almost $40, and comes with the same (except the salad is a bit different). It's not cheap, and the portion isn't that big, but should be alright - you'll be reasonably/or somewhat decently full. If nothing else, you can get some of that delicious chicken for about $7-8.  Now the drawbacks to cafe michi - it's a small place, and it's often full or close to it, so you should call to make reservations. The place is not the most comfortable place to sit, so you'll be going there for the food, not the ambiance. It's also got limited staff and they're often busy, so service (speed, attentiveness) varies. Though the staff is nice and polite. And as mentioned, it's in a plaza where you wouldn't expect to find a good quality sushi + cake place. But don't let the lol key location and storefront deter you from trying it!"}
{"text":"Had a quiet lunch with the wife and was pleasantly surprised by this little Sushi joint which was tucked away in a non-descript plaza. I had the Katsu Don set and she had the Chirashi Don set. Both were really good and we were impressed by the quality of the food on the whole.   The desserts that came with the set meals were a little underwhelming. Overall it was a pleasant meal, and we will probably be back again!"}
{"text":"The location is kind of hidden, but since I had been here before with my friend a year ago, it was easy to find.   I decided to eat here because the cake is so heavenly with amazing flavors. I came here for dinner and my friend had made reservations for 6:15pm, however we had arrived around 5pm. We were able to sit and order without a problem.   The menu offers a wide variety, however the portions are kind of small and the prices are relatively expensive compared to other places. I ordered the Chochin bento, which came in a three story stackable bowl with karage (fried chicken) at the top, sashimi in the middle and eel with rice at the bottom.   Since I came with two other friends, I had the chance to try more than just one cake. We ordered the tofu cheesecake, green tea cake with red bean and my ultimate favorite the Earl Grey tea cake. All the cakes are so delicious!!!!! I would definitely come back just for the cakes.  Tips... - Ordering Cake is a MUST - Since the restaurant is relatively small, you should make reservations  - Tucked away on the second store from the left beside Lin's Garden"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I've ever been to. It is located at the SE corner of Pharmacy and Sheppard. Seriously, SO hidden! Well, at least I wouldn't notice it in that plaza! Try to spot a small black canopy. Limited parking spots... go early!  It is a very small, cozy restaurant, so be sure to make a reservation way in advance. It is booked up even on weeknights. I went in on a Thursday night to pick up some desserts, I noticed ALL tables had a reserved sign... on a THURSDAY night!   If you love unagi (eel) on rice, you'll absolutely enjoy their version. Chirashi is also top quality with fresh assorted sashimi on a bed of rice #yum #artwork  One thing you'll definitely notice when you walk in is the dessert display. They offer many variety of housemade desserts, so delicious! So far I've tried the following, and was very pleased with each one :) *MUST ORDER* even if you're FULL lol. or take it home!   - Blueberry Cheesecake (if you're a big cheesecake fan, this is for you) - Bailey's Cheesecake (love this so much, ordered every time) - Rare Tofu Cheesecake (strange combo, but tasty and very light) - Chocolate Sake Cake (chocolaty goodness) - Green Tea Cake (most popular, also very light)  Final note: This place is definitely a hidden gem for Japanese good eats in Toronto! Food is delicious, service is attentive. I will be coming back soon to try more desserts :D"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there the first time and never going again. Food was so so and menu was unclear (they have two menus where one is only a booklet with pictures and the other one with the price)...we ordered two combos and nothing was included apparently...they didn't say one of the combo didn't include miso soup so we got charged for that...on top my gf got charged for the coffee that was suppose to be included according to their menu. The bill ended up 100$ for shit food that I can get anywhere tbh..."}
{"text":"Cafe Michi is a like a place you'd find in a small rural town of Japan--authentic, delicious and unassuming in its presentation.   I order the chirashi most of the time and it's consistently excellent. The sashimi cuts are small and there's a good variety in the selection of fish. It's not a selection that you usually get.  Their cakes (like everyone has said) are phenomenal! Go with more people so you can try more of the cakes because you will want to!  Highly recommended for an uptown sushi dining spot."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I come here no matter what I order!  Their from the quality of their rice to the quality of their sashimi and even their wasabi, everything is truly great. The restaurant is quite small and has a quiet, relaxed atmosphere.  A lot of their meals come with salad and refillable coffee/green tea as well as any slice of their house-made delicious cakes. :D  The price range is a little more pricy, the lunch sets ranging around $15-25 and their sashimi sets being around $25-40. But if you're willing to splurge a little I think you'll enjoy it :)!!"}
{"text":"They have combo meals that come with salad, Miso soup, coffee/tea and a dessert which make it so worth it! I got some beef rice combo and my friend got the crispy chicken curry combo. Not bad at all! Cost under $20 each.  Staff is very friendly and I like the atmosphere there. I made reservations for 6 since there isn't a lot of space. Food comes out really quick. Their coffee is really good too!! Unlimited ;)   Tofu cheesecake is bomb."}
{"text":"very nice?everything is fresh just the store is too small. greentea redbean cake is amazing"}
{"text":"Real Japanese food!    The chef owner, the sushi chefs, and the staff are all Japanese and the owner learned how to bake those incredible cakes when she was an apprentice at Bakery Nakamura (now in J-Town) so expect the desserts to be very Japanese style.. light, not too sweet, and made fresh in house.  From the signature Green Tea Cake, to the Sake Cake, to Creme Brulee or Trifle, the desserts are top quality but not overly sweet, so if you are looking for decadent sugar laden desserts, you will be disappointed.  The menu, including the little photo book, is very authentic Japanese.  The sushi is expertly prepared and the rice is as it should be, not hot, not cold, and seasoned with rice wine vinegar.    The Chawan-mushi (egg custard with hidden treasures like shirmp and enoki mushrooms in a cup) was perfectly silky and piping hot made fresh to order.  The Omakase here consists of multiple courses, and a surprising amount of food, including dessert.  The desserts are all in a glass display as you enter and remind you to same room for your favourite.  Big eaters might find the portions small, but these are Japanese size portions and are just enough.    Yes, it's in a tiny strip mall on Pharmacy just south of Sheppard, but the quality is far and above much bigger and fancier places that don't serve authentic Japanese food.  Cafe Michi is the real deal."}
{"text":"The set lunch comes with soup, salad and desert of choice. I had the sugarless chocolate mouse and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaas! The food was amazing! Dessert was delicious!  You would never have guessed from the outside looks of the restaurant aka sketch af LOL The restaurant itself is pretty small, so make sure u call ahead of time to make reservations to avoid disappointment.   What I ordered: Combo J - seafood udon Combo 4 - bento box  Both combos came with coffee/tea and dessert. First, the udon was very tasty. Perfect chewiness. The broth was very delicious. Lots of veggies and seafood. Then, the bento came in a stack of three dishes which i found really cute, not the typically bento box i was expecting. It included the chicken karage, sashimi and unagi rice! The chicken was lacking some flavours, so i had to ask for more sauce. Everything else was amazing! Esp the unagi rice, but i might be a little too obsessed with unagi LOL As for dessert, you can choose anything from the dessert showcase, from their cakes to puddings. I asked which one was the most popular and went for that - ofc its the green tea. Super moist and soft! The custard pudding was a little dry. Seemed like it has been refrigerated for a while. On top of that, i bought an earl grey one to go, which was also very moist, but lacked earl grey flavours. Staff could be more attentive in refilling our tea. Other than that, i like this place."}
{"text":"We finally made it back here for a 2nd time visit for lunch after a year.  This time I made reservations and got a nice table by the window.  It's a really small cafe style place so be sure to reserve a table.  My husband and daughter both ordered the Chyo-chin bento set which is probably the best deal here for $26.95 which includes Karaage (fried chicken), sashimi, unagi rice bowl, slice of cake and as much coffee as you want.  My husband really enjoyed the variety and I tasted a piece of the chicken and it was so delicious.  I got the Cafe au lait Chirashi which was a bit pricey for $38.95 which was only okay.  The selection of dessert here is amazing.  We got the tofu cheesecake, earl grey and sake cake which were all really good.  Be prepare to be really full if you get the set lunches.  I can't say that the sashimi here is too memorable but love the combination meals with coffee and cake which will keep me interested in coming back."}
{"text":"Minus 1 star only because the restaurant is so small. Hard to get a table if you don't have a reservation.   Food is delicious! Homemade desserts accompanied as well.   I've always ordered the chochin bento combo which comes with the sashimi, chicken karaage, eel on rice and dessert.   Really cute how all the plates stack into each other once finished."}
{"text":"I love Le Cafe Michi! It's one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto because of its homestyle Japanese food. There's just this air of cozyness and warmth that makes this restaurant awesome.  I've been here a few times and I've had the Cafe au Lait Chirashi bowl and the beef hot pot.  The seafood for the Chirashi was very fresh and plentiful. It goes well with the sushi rice and unagi underneath. It's a healthy and filling dish I'd say!  The beef hot pot is deliciously hearty and savoury. It's got a bit of sweetness to it that complements well with the tofu and vegetables, making the broth very flavourful.  For dessert, I've stuck with the classics, green tea cake and tofu cheesecake. The cakes were light and fluffy and had the right amount of sugar. Great way to end the meal! Although the meals weren't the quickest (20-30 min wait), I'd say that they really nailed the dishes, making the wait worth it. I'm looking forward to coming back! I can't wait to try more food here."}
{"text":"My 3rd attempt at eating at this restaurant because they were always closed when i tried to go - but it was worth the wait.  It's kinda funny because I see that others have also made the same comment!  The food is honestly too pricey for its quality. Perhaps if you ate things like raw fish, you might be happier there, but my curry katsu was uninspiring and bland for over $20. Okay it includes soup, salad and a giant cake, and the soup and salad were tasty, but i'd much rather just go there and eat the cake - mainly because their cake is delicious. I tried the matcha cake and the orange chocolate cake and they were both so spongy and gratifying.  Owned by real Japanese people speaking Japanese, service was not to be complained about.   I'd be back for cake."}
{"text":"Disappointing lunch meal.  I ordered the Pork Katsu Curry Don.  They do not have fukujinzuke!  That's a must for any Japanese Curry dish.....Also, the tonkatsu was very bland, don't have the strip of fat in it.  Curry was also not tasty, it seems to be straight out from the curry roux box without any flavour.  With salad, coffee or tea, miso soup, and a piece of dessert this comes to over 20 dollar for a small size!! Will not return.  There's almost no space between tables."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday in May after the lunch crowd came and went to meet a friend for afternoon tea.  Neither of us had ever been to Shiso Tree and it was definitely outside of our respective neighbourhoods, but we were feeling adventurous so we drove in search of this very cozy hidden gem.  Parking seemed sparse and the location was difficult to find because you can easily drive past the plaza's entrance if coming from the north on Pharmacy. But luckily I was able to find a spot quickly because it was almost 2pm.  Dining room decor was minimal and slightly gray and cold at the front of the cafe, but the back room where sushi chefs prepared raw fish infront of a sushi bar and 2-person seating was warmly lit, and diners' conversation were livelier due to the confined space.  I ordered a tonkatsu rice bowl and my friend ordered some kind of beef stirfry on top of rice. Our orders came with miso soup, salad, green tea, and a hefty slice of cake in our choice of flavour. For dessert, my friend ordered a green tea sponge cake with red bean filling, and green tea whipped cream layers, and I ordered an Earl Grey sponge cake with orange marmalade layers.  I took a taste out of her dessert too and both cakes were super moist and delicious in their individual ways. They were unlike any of the processed catering cakes you'd find at chain restaurants and bar & grills or coffee franchises.  These cakes were excellent. (Not an expert on sponge cake and ratio of moistness to cakeness :D...but perhaps some diners might think the cakes were \"too\" moist, but they were still outstanding.)  My rating is 4 stars because despite being on a marginally pricier side of almost $30/person, the food was delicious, the serving of one portion after another from appetizer to dessert was satisfying like a prix fixe meal, and most important to friends who have not seen each other in years--we were able to eat and have a catch-up conversation for 3 hours without anybody rushing us to pick up the tab and vacate the table quickly for other patrons.   The time of day on a weekend was definitely a factor in our positive dining experiene, so I recommend coming in during post-lunch pre-dinner hours."}
{"text":"I have been here for my birthday and my 2nd anniversary with my boyfriend. Overall, it's a fancy place to celebrate events, but the menu is a bit expensive ($20+). Make sure you make reservation coz it's always full house. It's not good for groups, probably 2-4 people maxmimum.  If you dine here, make sure you get the combo, which include salad, miso soup, coffe/ tea, main course and a piece of cake, and it varies from $20 - $40.  I heard their sashimi is good but we didn't try because it's too expensive. Instead, we tried the Soup Udon and Sukiyaki. Yumyum their Sukiyaki was great! I like their soup base and veggie ingredients, the portion is pretty big too.  Their cake is very good too. We ordered blueberry cheese cake and there are seasonal cakes options too. I believe all their cakes are good so you could just randomly pick one."}
{"text":"Food and services were very good until today, when they made us leave because we were early for the 3-5 pm Tea Time combo.  We went in around 2:40ish, place had a lot of ppl but not 100pct full, we told them we were there for the Tea Time combo but at that time they didn't say anything.  Later we were seated at about 2:48 and was told that we cannot get the combo bc it's not 3 yet, and we should go and come back in 12 min, so we left w/out ordering anything.  Ok technically I cannot blame them for not letting us order 12 min to 3, but where were you when we came in?!!  You could've saved us the 10 min wait!"}
{"text":"It's a Japanese family restaurant  Sushi and sashimi are fresh, abit pricy.   Love the cake here. Esp, the strawberry shortcake is my favor. Recommend the shortcake and green tea cake. Best is order the combo, so there will be slice of cake after the meal"}
{"text":"Le Cafe Michi you really disappointed me!! I was hoping you can impressed my Yelp Blogger Japanese food expert with your food, but in fact you embarrassed me...   You charged $8 for your Toro Miki which we were happy to pay expected that it would at least be half decently good... but it was like something I got at T&T. The rolls was falling apart when we picked it up by chopsticks and the toro was so chewy....   Luckily, My Chicken Teriyaki Set ($12.95) was as good as I remembered. The chicken was tender and moist with this light delicate gingery taste. I always love the cake and the coffee that ones with the set!!   Services was though arrogant and lacking... I was not impressed.... I was in fact embarrassed.... The older lady that took care of us later was much better, maybe I should request not to be served by one of those pretty Japanese girls??"}
{"text":"Kind of a 3.5 here for me for my first experience here. I came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and ordered a lunch special, which came with a salad, miso soup and dessert. I think the value was good because my meal was only $13.50 in total - a slice of cake alone would be $5-6 so I definitely feel like I got my money's worth! I ended up getting the beef curry, which was very flavourful and unfortunately I found it to be a little bit spicy by the time I was halfway through the dish.   They have a pretty large selection of desserts which is displayed behind a glass counter at the front. I got a slice of the green tea cake while my lunch companion got the sake cake. Both of them were really good! The cake was very soft and light and fluffy, and neither of them were too sweet, which I liked. The sake cake was chocolately but not overly rich - however I couldn't really taste the sake.  I felt sufficiently full after my meal but not completely stuffed, so I would say the small portion for the curry is... pretty small. I maybe could have done with the larger size :P  I will say however that the service was a bit lacking. The restaurant wasn't full when we first came in, and we got a seat right away. Throughout the entire meal the restaurant wasn't that busy, and they had multiple staff members working. However, we had trouble flagging down someone when we wanted to get our bill, and also they didn't come around to refill our tea cups enough, which we weren't particularly pleased with.  However, I am intrigued enough by the cakes and reputation of this place to want to come back and give it another try in the future! I have heard great things about their chirashi (which is a whopping $38 so it had better be damn good) and hopefully will have a chance to try it next time :)"}
{"text":"I've heard of good things about this place. I tried the chirashi dinner set which was about 30$, came with a salad and a choice of their authentic desserts. Presentation of the food was good overall. The Sashimi was fine and the Tamago had a nice flavoured taste to it.  I had the sakai chocolate cake which was pretty unique. Except, I wished the cake was refrigerated more. The waiters were extremely friendly..service was attentive....but they're Japanese so that's expected. lol  To be honest, overpriced. I'm not sure if it's worth 30$ for what it is. I might go back for the desserts but definately not the meal sets."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I discovered Le Cafe Michi about 6 years ago, and at the time - I was in love.  The Cho-Chin bento was truly a delight - chicken karaage on one tier, sashimi on the next and finally eel on rice on the last.  The spicy salmon roll was far superior to that of the other sushi restaurants I had tried.  Despite the hefty price tag, I enjoyed the food very much.  I remember the first time I visited this restaurant, I was charged $4 for a pot of tea, and then my family ended up paying $8 when they refilled our water.  I thought that was ridiculous since they just refilled the teapot.  Upon my recent visit, I noticed that the menu has changed.  If you order dinner, you will get refillable tea or coffee, salad, miso soup (with some exceptions) and dessert.  This is definitely better value than I remembered.  I ordered the Cafe au Lait Chirashi this time.  It was extremely pretty to look at, as it should for $45.95.  The fish was decent, but nothing mind-blowing to me.  I liked that there were quite a few pieces of uni and squid.  I think I will go back to my Cho-Chin bento next time, as it did not disappoint my eating partner.  At $34.95, it tasted great and the value was better.  We ordered our favourite spicy salmon roll, and while it was still good - there was a lot more rice than our last visit (a year ago).    For dessert, I ordered the Fruit Shortcake and my partner ordered the Tofu Cheesecake.  We both liked the fruit shortcake more, as it had more flavour and variety with the fruits inside.  The whipped cream was delicious.  The tofu cheesecake paled in comparison, but I'm sure it would be loved by those who prefer a lighter flavour.    Overall, our experience before was better - but it won't stop us from coming back for the Cho-chin bento.  Cake-wise, we have also had the Matcha Red Bean (super popular!), the Blueberry Cheesecake (pretty good) and the Lemon Chiffon Cake (just okay)."}
{"text":"Have been hearing raves about this place for a while but have never been although being so close by, we did finally drop by during summer and it was closed for renovation. Then at the end of August we finally made in to Le Cafe Michi after all these years.  Seaweed Salad & Chef's Salad that came with the meal/combo  Cafe au lait Chirashi $36.95 ~ the price include salad, a slice of cake & tea/coffee ~ The sashimi was fresh and delicious but I find it a bit pricey compare to my other favorite places but it's the perfect solution to fix my chirashi craving without heading downtown.  Choyo Bento $24.95 ~ the price include salad, a slice of cake & tea/coffee ~ Love the 3 layers of the bento, small but packed a lot. ~ Karaage (Deep Fried Chicken), Sashimi & Unajyu (eel) on Sushi Rice ~ Love the crispy goodness of the karaage with the flavorful and thin batter and event he eel tasted better than so moist and flavorful.  Earl Grey Saffron Cake & Japanese Sake Cake ~ Japanese cakes are usually lighter and less sweet, these were no exception and I loved it.  ~ Love the lightness of the earl grey but the strong sake chocolate cake can't be beat ~ 2 of our fave things in one, what else could we ask for.  Verdict: ~ Love everything we had but it's definitely a splurge  ~ Would come back for more or come back to grab some dessert to go Le Cafe Michi on Urbanspoon"}
{"text":"Le Café Michi is located in a tiny plaza at the corner of Pharmacy and Sheppard. If you blink, you'll certainly miss it. If it helps, the tiny restaurant is in the same plaza as Lin's Garden, which has more visible signage.   Plastered on the front page of the menu is a list of rules to abide by while dining here. No reservations for cake and drinks only. They do not serve cake and drinks only during peak dining hours. No sharing of coffee or green tea. Minimum order charge of $5.00 per person if that person does not order anything. I personally found this slightly annoying and pretentious.   My mom and I shared a Chyo-chin Bento, which came in 3 stacked tiers. At the very top was the featured deep fried selection (agemono) of the day- nuggets of lightly battered chicken drizzled with spicy mayo. This was very tasty, particularly that tangy spicy mayo. The chicken was juicy and flavourful, but not overly greasy. The middle layer contained six pieces of assorted sashimi- salmon, tuna, and hamachi. I wasn't the greatest fan of this. First of all, the sashimi wasn't as cold as I would prefer it to be. Out of the three types of sashimi, I only enjoyed the salmon. The other two had a slightly unpleasant fishy aftertaste. The bottom tier featured unajyu on sushi rice. The hearty bowl of rice was topped with fillets of barbeque eel, shredded omelette, some pickled vegetables and toasted seaweed. I wished there were more than 2 pieces of fish, but other than that, this was really delicious. The eel wasn't particularly stellar, but what shone was the sushi rice, which was so flavourful that it hardly needed any garnish.   In addition to the lunch set, we also ordered uni sashimi, which both my mom and I love. This was simple and delicious- fresh and sweet! Uni is one of those things that will taste horrible if it's not fresh, but luckily this turned out great.  Finally, our tiny slice of blueberry cheesecake was utterly disappointing. I love my cheesecakes, and this one was awful! It was grainy, dry and bland. Even the blueberries as garnishes were sour. The only positive thing I have to say about the cake was that the slice was extremely small. Ergo, I didn't need to feel too guilty about eating it. Nevertheless, it was a complete waste of calories, and effectively ruined the meal, even though everything else was pretty good.   I can definitely see the charm in this restaurant, but at the same time, I also sense a pretentious air that I don't appreciate. I wouldn't rush back any time for another meal. But when I have another fresh uni craving, I'll definitely keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"I've been to Le Cafe Michi a couple times for lunch and dinner. Located at Sheppard/Pharmacy in a plaza, the restaurant is small and can be hard to find if you are unsure of where it may be located. The decor of the restaurant is outdated and old but is kept clean. Sometimes the place can get super busy for dinner so reservations are probably recommended if you go during those times. It may also be hard to accommodate bigger groups as the restaurant is only so big.   Run by Japanese owners, Le Cafe Michi serves up fresh sushi/sashimi and cooked foods. The chirashi and bento are probably their most popular items on the menu. What is unique about the restaurant is that they also have many homemade cakes/desserts that are often included in the price of the meal (and a must get!).  I've tried the popular chirashi which includes kaarage chicken, eel rice, and sashimi. The dish comes with a unique presentation where each of the items are stacked on top of one another.  The 3 components to the dish make up for one filling meal (especially when salad and dessert is included as well). Recently, I went to Le Cafe Michi for lunch and got their unatama dish (bbq eel, green onions simmered in egg on rice). Great delicious pieces of eel with egg and rice, delicious. In terms of the cakes, I recently tried the green tea mousse, green tea cake, tiramisu, and tofu cheesecake. My favourite hands down is the green tea mousse. The lightness of the cake and strong matcha taste makes you keep eating more and more.   Overall, consistent and good food at Le Cafe Michi."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get their unatama (eel and egg on rice) but this last time I decided to branch out and finally try their sushi. I had heard awesome things about a cafe au lait chirashi so why not! My bf got the unidon (sea urchin on rice).  The cafe au lait...super deceiving! It didn't  look like much but as I started eating, it felt like an endless bowl of rice under all the sashimi. Even better, there were pieces of unagi hidden in it.   The unidon was literally a bowl of rice with a gigantic pile of uni on top. Uni's not my thing but my bf loved it. I think that was a year's worth of uni for him right there!  The two dishes aren't on the cheap side but you get quality, quantity, and pretty presentation. Service was surprisingly bad today. The older lady was good coming around w coffee refills but anything else was super slow/non-existent. we wanted to order our desserts and nobody came by so I went to the counter. Three girls were up there, two had looked over at me but completely ignored me. At least a \"hey, we'll get to you in a sec\" would have been nice. Finally one girl takes the dessert order ....and it never comes. Realize that they forgot about us when the table beside us order later and get their dessert before us so we ask that girl and eventually get our dessert.   Still a solid 3 stars from me."}
