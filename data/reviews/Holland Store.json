{"text":"A little piece of Holland in Toronto.  It's a small grocery store that carries almost a lot of foods and gifts imported from The Netherlands.  Speculaas, stroopwafels, chocolade hagel, and much, much more.  Not eat-in service as what most sites say it is."}
{"text":"There are very few Dutch food places in the GTA so I am very glad to have one close to the 401.  It's across from the super store at Weston and 401.  I usually go with one thing in mind to pick up but then childhood nostalgia hits and I end up with candies and sweets and other treats that remind me of my childhood.  I don't think I ever get out of there with just a few things.  Today they were all stocked up for Sinterklaas and had papernoten, taai taais, chocolate letters (puur and melk).  I think the shop is geared towards the older Dutch immigrants who likely pop in regularly to get some groceries.  I love stopping in and loading up!"}
{"text":"Store is too small, it only carries a small inventory, over priced, products close to expiration date you need to keep your eye on it. I live within 10 minutes drive but I will drive to Burlington (40ish minutes) to buy my Dutch provisions. Owner is uncomfortably in your face,"}
