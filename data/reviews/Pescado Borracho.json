{"text":"This place is great! Service was perfect and the food was  delish. We ordered house margaritas and omg prob one of the best we've had. Certainly get street corn to go with your tacos. The jalape√±o butter is delish! The salmon taco was cooked perfectly and the mango salsa goes nicely with the salmon. The Californian taco is their best taco but be prepared the PB got sauce is hot! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely superb. Reasonable prices, superb food, unbeatable service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A nice, clean, and appealing restaurant. We started with the chips, dips and Guacamole. It came with a huge amount the Guacamole! As the main meal, I ordered the chicken enchiladas with sweet beans. It was Delicious! Good background music in my opinion- ie :The Eagles, Rolling Stones, etc. It's such a pleasant change from hearing today's pop music blaring.  Our server (Tori) was extremely attentive and knowledgeable.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight with friends. We are all fans of high tide. After seeing the reviews I really wanted to try the octopus tacos but had never had it and wasn't sure I liked it. Our waitress was nice enough to bring me a sample. It was delicious!! So I ordered that and a side of corn. My friends also ordered corn but they got it off the cob and it wasn't charged like my on the cob was. I would suggest getting it on the cob. Delish!! The only downfall might have been the slow service. However, it didn't bother us since we were busy talking and catching up. At the end my friends did say it was a little too fancy for them. I guess they were expecting regular old tacos. This is not that place. I thought it was absolutely delicious. Definitely check this.place out! I wish I had got pics but I was busy shoveling it down lol."}
{"text":"Tried this place out, excited because I love a Mexican/seafood combination! It was soooo yummy, the have gluten free options, and are cautious of shellfish allergies. The food was amazing, the octopus taco is a must!!! I had a great experience on my pick up order, they are new and people should be more understanding of growing pains that ANY new restaurant and business goes through. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant! I was a little disappointed that they don't have ceviche, but I guess they have something called Aquachiles that I have yet to try that's \"similar\" but there is nowhere in Gilbert that serves Ceviche (or at least good Ceviche) so I'm hoping it gets added to the menu soon!"}
{"text":"We went here for Taco Tuesday and it was delicious! I ordered the California and Fried avocado taco. Highly recommend the California taco. The staff was super friendly and our server, Josh was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wow what a fish taco! Huge chunk of Sea bass and delightful drizzled sauce. Plenty of meat options like the beef spare rib taco AND the vegetarian \"Avo-taco\" (deep fried avocado)is Devine!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty and service is excellent! Margarita is sooooo good!!! Our waiter Hayden is very attentive."}
{"text":"Everything we had was really good! Got the fundido queso with chorizo added and it was amazing! This appetizer is filling enough for a whole meal honestly. Definitely recommend the crispy avocado taco, very refreshing and delicious!"}
{"text":"Try California taco. It's delicious. The quality of meat is amazing. The micheladas are more of a bloody beer than anything."}
{"text":"I was REALLY hoping to like this place. At first glance, the prices are \"up there\". You have to ask for the chips and salsa if you want any. Salsa was poor, as it tasted from the can. I tried to order a side of rice for my baby, but they don't carry rice?!! (What?! Huge downside)they also don't serve agua frescas. I ordered a michelada, and we know a good miche, it barely had any flavor, we make them better ourselves. We also had an order of posole, Californian taco, and Baja fish taco. The tacos were pretty good, but not authentic and 2 fill you up, as they're a good size. Our waiter was awesome!! His service was great. 5 Star for the waiter, I wish I knew his name. Anyway, we're sort of what you call \"Mexican food snobs\" as I grew up with my Nana making homemade Mexican food and my mother in law comes in twice a year from Mexico spoiling us with her cooking. But what do you expect from a Mexican restaurant in the middle of Gilbert. Cute spot, with good size booths and great for those who think they're eating real Mexican food"}
{"text":"This place hits all categories well. The place itself is inviting and the decor is pleasant. There is more space than one might think. The service was friendly and timely and then there is the food. The chips were thin and warm and the guacamole was fresh and flavorful. We had tacos (4 different kinds) and they were all amazing. We will be back with friends for sure."}
{"text":"Really great food and service  Fish tacos were amazing, literally one of the best I've had  The key lime pie was super and interesting (a little different).  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Cute little spot in Gilbert, definitely worth checking out! We didn't realize that Pescado Borracho was High Tide's sister restaurant but we have been meaning to go there too! Tacos seemed like the perfect option for when we were out though, so we went to this restaurant. Saturday evening & we snuck in (unknowingly) before happy hour ended so that was a nice little perk!  First and foremost our sever was great. He was very thorough in explaining all the menu items, answering our questions, and providing prompt service. It was a tough choice but I went with the Baja Fish Taco & Crispy Avo Taco, and my husband went with the Carne Asada Taco & Pollo Asado Taco. I personally enjoyed the Pollo Asado one the most even though it wasn't mine, it had the most distinct flavor. Following closely behind were the Avo Taco & Baja Fish Taco; we agreed that the Carne Asada one is the only one we would skip on next time.  Overall a good place to check out, especially during happy hour. They have margaritas on special - I got the mango one & it was really good, along with $1 off all tacos and some starter specials. As I mentioned, it was difficult to pick which taco to go with so we will definitely be back to try others!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times and I gotta say, it's my favorite spot for tacos. One of the tacos (Spicy shrimp, I believe) was not one we particularly liked but they more than made up for it with their awesome customer service! Taco wise, I personally love the Baja fish, chorizo (that fried egg tho ) & the crispy avo!  I am super impressed with this place & how reasonably priced it is! Awesome service, attentive wait staff (shout-out to our new fave waiter Joshua) and seriously yummy food! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Very happy with the food and service. Paying seven bucks for a taco never felt so good.  Wife had alot of requests that they filled."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? That's what I keep on repeating after my trip to Pescado Borracho, And you will be too after you try some of their yummy yummy tacos!  Fellow yelpers, I pride myself on finding awesome tacos wherever it is I travel too. And this week I'm in Phoenix Arizona and happy to say I found the mother load! Anytime you can see and octopus taco on the menu, you had better order it! So I ordered up an octopus taco, as well as a brisket taco, and an order of chips and salsa just for giggles. The sounds of choices were green tomatillo and a few roasted red salsa. The green tomatillo salsa was so sour, I couldn't stand it. The river was good but it just lacks some heat, so I asked the waitress if they had anything to kick it up a notch. Fortunately, they have a habanero salsa that will do just the trick (bring extra Kleenex because your nose will run!)  The octopus taco was as expected... AWESOME!!! However the brisket taco was less than his lesson. Imagine your mother making the best slow roasted beef dish, only to serve it with a bunch of pickles on top  The waitress said that it was the green tomatillo sauce that they leave a little chunkier, all I can say is they should've left it off. Which brings me to an uncomfortable moment, that being once you express that you didn't like something, shouldn't the server do something about it? I guess, but they chose to do nothing, so I guess not!  But, whatever... I'm here for the tacos, and I used the spoon to scrape off all of the pickle stuff on the beef taco. So here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? Yes  Advocate? Yes  PS-check out the nifty pictures I took!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!  The same owners also own High Tide next store which is also amazing.  Their blood orange margarita is awesome!"}
{"text":"The tacos are excellent! The habanero corn is probably the best corn I've ever had. I think this is now my new favorite taco spot."}
{"text":"The wife and I went HAM on some tacos on Memorial day. Much to our surprise, it was Margarita Monday with $4 margaritas. As a wise man once said, YOLO, so we had a great lunch and a few bevvies for an all-in check of just 40 simoleans."}
{"text":"This place is super fun! We went for happy hour and for great deals on delicious food. We had some of my favorite margaritas around, and they have a ton of fun flavor add-ins for margs as well as mojitos. I'm a classic \"on the rocks with salt\" kind of person, so I didn't get a flavor but they definitely looked great! The tacos are also really great. I went with ahi tuna and carnitas. The ahi one was just ok, but the carnitas one was great! My friends raved about the crispy avocado taco, so think about that one when you order!   It was really a good value. For two tacos and two margs I spent about $20. Plus they give you chips and salsa when you sit (get the guacamole, too. I don't even love guac but it's amazing here). Will definitely be back for happy hour soon!!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try this place after I heard the owners of high tide owned this establishment as well. It was amazing!! My mom even loved it and she is the pickiest person I know! The sale was perfect and the chips were freshly made and warm. We got the street corn as an appetizer and it was so good that we ordered a second one. All three of us ordered tacos and we all ordered different ones. Every single one of them was delicious!! We cannot wait to come back! One of my favorite restaurants hands down!"}
{"text":"This place is good but definitely not as good as their sister place High Tide. This place charges for chips which I could only agree if someone doesn't purchase food. Prices are a little high for amount fo food you get but food is good. Not sure I'd go back but will continue to go to High Tide."}
{"text":"PB was just okay, its not bad, but it was not spectacular either. I always judge Mexican food by the salsa.  A bowl of salsa verde and a bowl of red. The verde was a bit sour, no heat and just average. The red had even less spice, boring. Both of them needed salt, cilantro and serrano.  We tried a couple of their tacos. The carne asada and pollo. The carne asada had a great flavor, good kick, but lacking in the meat. The pollo was too sweet. The pickling spice they use is just too sweet and no heat at all.  Again, the tacos were just average, but since i is close to the house may try again. The service, was  nothing special.  Overall, the price versus the portion is too high since the quality was nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"The wife and I visited this place on Saturday.  We first tried the guacamole which we both thought had a little too much onion.  I had the \"California\", Fish, and Carnitas tacos and thought they were all very good.  They are much bigger than street tacos so be careful and not over order.  My wife had the Crispy Avo and the Fish tacos.  She also thought they were very good.  We will be back for sure, especially for the happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"I was going to give it a lower star because the host/hostess have a bad attitude. There was a young girl and boy in the front. Almost left because of them, however we were wanting to check this place out so we stayed. My server was super friendly, helpful and just happy! Food was fast, filling and pretty good. Tacos are delicious & cheese Fundido was really good. Everyone else that passed by was also friendly and kept checking up on us. Server deserves 5 stars, hostess one star."}
{"text":"Yumm!  The octopus tacos are ridiculously delicious! Their margaritas are also   The service has always been fabulous!  Everything else that we ordered was great! I just don't remember what that was..... again... those margaritas"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the salmon tacos. Large piece of salmon grilled and seasoned perfectly. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has great food.  Tried it the other night when High Tide was to busy.  The whole Red Snapper is to die for.  Our server Dakota was great explained the menu, portion size and what they recommended.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place always has good tacos, good margaritas and the staff has been lovely every single time. Chips and salsa with guacamole are great, queso as well but better with guac.  My fav taco is Baja fish Taco or Californian! Super good!  Also to try: the strawberry margarita"}
{"text":"Nothing great if anything a little disappointed.   Been wanting to try it out and was in the area with 2 if my kids. Stopped in and was surprised it was not an order over the counter but instead waited to be seated.  Upon being seated we were handed menus (and crayons for the kids). Within the minute our server asked if we would like to get started with waters and some chips n guac. Sure sounds good.  Chips n guac Came out quick and was good, wasn't too excited with either salsas. I ordered the carne taco, was a little fatty but lots of meat and flavor!  The worst was when the check came and realized that our chips and guac cost more then the 3 meals we ordered. $6 taco $6 taco $5 kids meal $8 chips n guac, make sure people know you charge for chips n guac, especially at that price."}
{"text":"Food is great, and the atmosphere is laid back. People are carrying on with their conversations, very chilled. Great for young families, our three year old was very entertained the whole time. Friendly staff, and very attentive. We will be coming back often."}
{"text":"A taco bar opened by the adjacent High Tide restaurant. It was packed when we went at 6PM on a Friday; there was a 30 minute wait. We sat at the bar. The menu is fairly limited and mostly focused on seafood and tacos. I sampled the baja fish, fried octopus, and grilled shrimp tacos. The $5-7 tacos were all fairly large. The baja fish taco was solid. I was not thrilled with the other two. The octopus breading was strange and the shrimp were overwhelmed by the spicy sauce.  Pescado Borracho fell short. The tacos were underwhelming and slightly overpriced (I am willing to pay $5-7 for tacos, but then have higher expectations). I did not order drinks, but while sitting at the bar, I did not see anything that would suggest that the drinks were anything other than mediocre."}
{"text":"We noticed a new restaurant sign in our neighborhood and thought we would give it a try. OMG! What an amazing taco shop! I hesitate to use the word \"taco shop\" as it is so much more! It was delicious, fresh, and the flavors were outstanding. I had the fried avocado taco and the blackened salmon taco with mango salsa. I did not want them to end! My husband had the Posole and he said it was some of the best he's ever had. Then we found out it was owned by the same people who own high tide and we were not surprised. Incredible quality, super fresh seafood & meats. Gilbert is super lucky to have this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not very authentic. Very disappointed. The Aguachile  not authentic at all. Even the server suggested we try a sample before committing to it since a lot of customers don't see to like their version. Good call on the sampling....it was...interesting. My enchiladas were mediocre. Prices were on the expensive side for the quality of food. Took my husband and my parents for dinner and will most likely not be going back especially when there's actually a MUCH better Mexican restaurant across the street!"}
{"text":"So so good. Plenty of non-fish options. The fried avo was my favorite taco. So delicious. Awesome customer service. Great guacamole with chips and salsa. Too full for dessert today but their Chocolate Chip &Coconut Butter Cake with banana dulce de leche ice cream sounds incredible. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and I really like it. The food is very good as well as the service. I have a hard time finding a place that my wife and son and I all like, but this is the exception. Cannot beat the happy hour pitcher of craft beer for $6 (Ballast Point Sculpin is a choice). I have paid more for 1 beer. The tacos are not cheap, but they are very large. I have ordered the sea bass, octopus, and carne asada tacos so far, and all of them were excellent. This is one of the few places that I want to try everything on the menu so that I will not miss anything.  Try the corn with habanero, it is really good."}
{"text":"Overall decent meal and will probably return, but change what we ordered. Started the meal with a margarita which was poor at best. It was poorly garnished, bland, and basically just mixed ice. Half of it was spilled down the side of the glass, and the chile topping was all on a napkin at the base. Would not order drinks again. Then had a serving of the spicy street corn. Would not order that again either. The only thing with flavor in it was the little bit of cheese, and the rest was bland. Plus it needs to come with chips or something to eat it with.   Ordered 4 tacos between the wife and I. Fish, Shrimp, Cali, and Avo. All were excellent flavor. The fish was almost too big and for once I think a smaller piece of fish would have made it better for a fish to toppings ratio. The fried avocado and cali one was excellent. The shrimp was good, but they put the sauce and topping on the outside of the taco on top of it. Who the hell does that? I want something I can pick up and eat. It was annoying having to take a fork, open it up, and move all the toppings to the inside of the tortilla, then be left with a soggy wet outside from being topped in sauce. Once you did that, it was good though.   I was a bit afraid since it is associated with the High Tide, which still holds the record for being one of the worst meals ever in the state of Arizona in my 5+ years living here. Overall I would go back, order some tacos and enjoy, but skip the sides and drinks. Maybe just do some tacos for takeout.   Service was Meh. Watercups stayed empty pretty much the whole meal, waited a long time to order, and the fact that they would even bring the margarita to the table in the condition it was in was sad."}
{"text":"Do not go if you want authentic Mexican seafood.   I ordered aguachile de camaron and instead got a soup bowl  with shrimp, octopus,  and sea bass?  I asked if they can serve it to me without the seabass and they said no because it was pre made.  That's not how this appetizer is made.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Crispy Octopus Tacos! These were so delicious with the chorizo and pineapple. I would definitely order it again. My husband had carne asada  enchiladas and was just as happy! Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"It was not lousy service. It was no service. Waited 15 minutes with six employees bumping into each other but not waiting on us. I know the food is good but the wait is ridiculous. And so we just left"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of high tide so I had to try this place, my wife  and i ordered four different kinds of tacos and every one was delicious ... we didn't go with the huge appetite but I would enjoy picking out there on any other night I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent, From the service, to the margaritas, to the food! Good value as well. Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Recommendations.....You HAVE to try the crispy octopus tacos...they are amazing!!  Pollo Asado is awesome also, but the crispy octopus is amazing!!!!! I will be ordering 2 of those next time."}
{"text":"I had the chicken enchiladas and they were fabulous! Service was fast and all of the staff was very friendly. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Not authentic, I'm from Baja and I was expecting the Hometown taste but I didn't find it, it's more adapted for the American costumers. And I found it's expensive, I will not care to pay more if it's the authentic cuisine that i really miss... This restaurant is the kind of fast food spot without the \"fast food speed\"  You get in and get the menu by yourself and sit down by yourself...Uhmmmm how they have control about who gets first on the busy days? I will for sure upset... also the menus are just printed on paper and they reuse them... they only decent menus are the ones for drinks and alcohol... Also the kids menus doesn't include prices.  I think this is a place most likely for grab a bite and drinks after office, but again if I want to do this, for the price... I will definitely go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"First time here and found it on Yelp. Great food and prices ok. Happy hour great! We had the crispy octopus taco, Baja taco and blackened salmon taco! Chips and salsa great and House Margarita was wonderful!"}
{"text":"The tacos are large and have very flavorful! Not greasy at all either. Loved the churos as well. Staff was very friendly. Can't wait to try more of their tacos!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and well put together. We enjoyed fast service and food the staff exceptional. Absolutely Loved the street corn and Avocado Key Lime Pie. Tacos were good and we were happy to find it was very reasonably priced. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place due to good reviews.  Disappointing food.  Carnitas and chicken enchiladas were bland.  Our waitress asked us if we want OUR chips, salsa and guacamole...as it turns out they charge for it.  Not going back to this place..."}
{"text":"The food was okay. If was a little co fusing at first because our server asked if we wanted chips and salsa and if we didn't her would get us complimentary chips and salsa.  I had a friend avacado taco, which didn't has very much flavor. The kids meal was more expensive then my meal. The really good thing about this place was the black beans. Omg they were amazing."}
{"text":"Food was great! Baja Fish Taco and Pozole was my favorite! Highly recommend!!!  A little pricey but absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Went in for first time on Mother's Day and the first impression was the rude nature in which the manager treated the hostess. Through the dining experience, the people working seemed very unhappy. Morale and vibe in restaurant was dismal and I feel the manager running floor was the reason. We witnessed her snap at bartender and server. No smile, no checking up on tables which is a good practice overall but especially when you are a new restaurant. Food took a long time to come out but was really good. They make great unique tacos. Restaurant charges for chips and salsa and they are not good. I recommend skipping. Happy hour is great! Drinks are made with top shelf liquor. Vibe needs a change to bring us back!"}
{"text":"Good upscale tacos but not super expensive. Had pollo asado, California (carne asada), Baja fish and side of elote. All were very good. Corn could be a bit more creamier. (Think how a street vendor sells elote in a cup). Nice atmosphere and clean inside. Friendly staff and good service."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today to have lunch after reading the previous Yelp reviews. I had the California Carne Asada Tacos, AMAZING! The atmosphere was nice and the service was Excellent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Had the grilled shrimp, fried avocado and Baja tacos. So tasty with some amazing flavors. My husband had the crispy octopus with the pork chorizo wrapped in cabbage and said it was to die for.  We will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I can tell this food is definitely prepared with love from an executive chef with talented hands.   The red snapper, pescado burracho, was very fresh.  I'm surprised you can get fresh fish in the Valley and it was well prepared.  This was prepared like my mom used to make it.  5-stars.  This is pan-fried, not deep fried.  The white sauce that came with the fish was okay.    One thing though when you eat a whole fish, and it's big and I was unable to finish by myself, is that there are small fish bones that you have to sort out and throw away.  In American dishes, this is never done but in Mexico and Vietnam, they cook the whole fish and leave the bones in.  Maybe a little different way to eat if you are not used to it.  The pineapple cilantro margarita was great.  Complimentary chips & salsa were good.  The pinto beans that came with it was an all-star 5 stars.  It made the fish taco so flavorful, like flavor crystals in every bite.  You can't eat the pinto beans by itself.  You have to put in a soft taco."}
{"text":"My wife and kids decided to try this new place out yesterday and we are so thankful we did. This placed just recently opened not too long ago and is right next door to the restaurant called High Tide Seafood. (High Tide actually owns this place). Anyways, here's the  pros and cons.   Pros: Mouth watering, so much flavor in everything we ordered. Flavor, flavor,  flavor it was all AMAZING!   I ordered the Octopus Taco, Carna Asada Taco, and Fish Taco. They all screamed \"flavor\". Best tacos I've ever had in my life and I'm not exaggerating! We also ordered the cinnamon twist and they were perfectly cooked, soft, warm and had just enough cinnamon where it wasn't too much. They also have honey if you ask for it.   Cons: NONE. If there was any cons, I'd tell you about it as I'm pretty candid.   Price: This place is a little on the pricey side but the flavors and deliciousness truly make up for it.   WE WILL BE LIFE LONG CUSTOMERS! GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"The food was cold and flavorless, ordered a regular basic michelada it was AWFUL AWFUL JUST AWFUL. wouldn't recommend this place, and the girls in the front just stood around didn't greet customers or say good bye once we left. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Food was amazing but of course - it's owned by High Tide.  Service was great!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this spot for a late lunch. Good choice! My friend and I chose Pescado Borracho because it is a sister restaurant to High Tide, located just next door.  We love High Tide so we figured we'd have an equally good experience here.  Absolutely.  We started with plain chips and salsa.  Chips were warm from oven, very thin, crispy and yummy.  Two different salsa accompanied the chips, one mild and one little hotter.  Both very good.  My friend ordered the Baja Taco, which featured battered and fried cod.  Delicious!  I had the braised short rib taco which was also delish!  In fact, we both liked our dishes so much we each ordered a second taco.  We are not big on moderation.  Second was just as good as first, although half way through the second taco we were both stuffed!  My friend ordered a margarita from the happy hour selection and said it was excellent.  I decided to try something new and ordered a cocktail with mescal and coconut mix.  It just wasn't something I was enjoying, so the bartender offered to replace it with something more to my liking, at no charge for the replacement drink.  Well done!  I ordered one of my tried and true drinks and was very happy.  Our initial server was the female bartender (Monica maybe), and she was very cordial, informative and professional.  I'm embarrassed that I don't remember her name - especially since she so kindly replaced my cocktail. Our first server transitioned us to Hayden who took great care of us.  He was also cordial, informative, and professional.  All in all it was a great experience.  We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food! Really busy on a Saturday night but still had good service. The Californian Taco, Baja Taco and Pozole were exceptional!"}
{"text":"Attended a soft opening last night if this brand new restaurant in Gilbert. Located at Val Vista and Williamsfield next to sister restaurant High Tide Seafood.   Same owners as High Tide with the same awesome fresh ingredients dishes. This restaurant is more casual serving a variety of yummy dishes.   Just as beautifully decorated as High Tide with warm lime green walls, gorgeous light fixtures and wall decor.   Prices are so reasonable for the quality of food.   Their chips and salsa to start our dining experience were so tasty. We ordered some appetizers, margaritas, and entree dishes.   This new fun and delicious will do amazing in their location."}
{"text":"Street tacos and happy hour atmosphere is something we will come back for.  Music was great and our servers were cool to talk to and very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my wife for lunch for the first time. Very clean with fast service and great food.   We started with the street corn in garlic butter. We also had the habanero butter on the side. With the garlic butter, the corn was hot, crisp, and sweet, with just enough garlic to add some tanginess. The habanero butter was spicy, with heat building when you loaded the corn up with it. Excellent!  My wife had the cheese enchiladas and loved them. The plate had three large, cheese-stuffed enchiladas covered with a heaping helping of cheese sauce. She uses these as her canary in the coal mine for a New Mexican restaurant.   I had two tacos, the Baja fish taco and the PB carnitas taco. Each was served in a six-inch tortilla and stuffed with fish or pork. There is more in one of these tacos than in two or three of the street tacos at most other restaurants. The fish (sea bass) was crispy and moist, with just the right amount of salsa fresca and cabbage. The carnitas was flavorful and crisped up just right on the flat top.   We will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were visiting family in Gilbert so we thought we would give it a try after we saw what great reviews this place had. We were not disappointed. The menu really doesn't do the food justice though. Luckily you could see the photo's of the items on yelp reviews to better explain what the items were. All the food we ordered was excellent ! We ordered fish taco's ( they are huge ) just wish I had a second tortilla because the fish was to big for just 1 corn tortilla. We also had the pinto beans and garlic butter street corn both where excellent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG!!!   Best tacos ever!!  Wow.  They did a taco \"takeover\" at the Whining Pig and it was amazing!  I had the flour Californian and AVO. Sooooo good.  I want more!  Great service.  Super friendly employees.   Loved it."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! I got the crispy Avo & the ahi tuna taco & loved it! Street corn was great and so were the chips and salsa. I wish the salsa had had a bit more flavor to it. Overall, a great place for some good mexican-style seafood!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican seafood! We stumbled upon this place and we loved the food and whole experience. I would highly recommend it and we will be back. The prickly pear margarita gets FIVE stars too!"}
{"text":"We went to Pescado Borracho for the first time last night. If you are looking for tacos and want a casual atmosphere this is a place to check out. 2 of the kids ordered chicken tacos which they enjoyed. My oldest ordered Mac n cheese and she said it was amazing, even though it looked like it can from a box.    I ordered the Californian (minus the hot sauce) and the chorizo taco. Both were really good. I actually wished I had more but just the two were quite filling. Our service was great and the prices are pretty good.  We went during happy hour so we actually got $1 off tacos. The kids meals were actually the most expensive thing we ordered at $7 each.   We will go back and I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful. The restaurant is clean and visually appealing. The food was very good. Kids ordered off the kids menu and loved it. We had Baja Fish Tacos and they were amazing. We also ordered the street corn and guacamole. Both were outstanding and rival many other restaurants in the area! We will for sure be going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The tacos are great, staff is friendly, drinks are good, atmosphere is fun and the owners truly care about putting out quality food."}
{"text":"First time here.  Ordered the Aguachile appetizer.  Sizably portioned but very bland and unseasoned.  The chefs here really need to be tasting what's coming out of the kitchen.  Some salt and Serranos may have saved the dish.  We had the octopus, shrimp, and fish tacos, all suffering the same blandness.  Even the hot sauces were bland.  I know the younger crowd dosen't care for heat, so maybe that explains it...."}
{"text":"Best ever frozen prickly pear margarita!  Their chips are great-and their salsa's have a good flavor.  The green is a bit hotter and more flavorful than the red, but a mix of both is excellent.  The guac is chunky, a bit of a small portion for $5, but it was tasty.   Today's taco choices were crispy octopus and braised beef.  The octopus is my new favorite!!  With pineapple added-it was awesome.  The braised beef was very tender and good flavors, but a bit more spicy than we were looking for."}
{"text":"So it was Sunday evening and I was enjoying our evening together as a family and didn't want to cook. Tried this place out and found a gem in my own neighborhood. They had great service and food to match."}
{"text":"The service was good, friendly and efficient.  The food was just ok, nothing special but it was fresh"}
{"text":"The price is reasonable for the portion size even though it is one taco with no side. I ordered a fish taco and it was perfect - a large piece of fish, crispy outside, warm and flaky inside, and quality fish, and the sauce complemented the fish nicely. We also had chips and hand made guacamole that I enjoyed - it's the warm, thin and crispy style chip that seemed like they might make them in-house. We didn't try the desserts but I'd like to try them."}
{"text":"Nice find.  From the owners of High Tide, this place reminded me of really good street tacos that I had while on vacation in Cancun a few years ago.  I tried the octopus & ahi tuna tacos and was not disappointed.  Their taco game is on point."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today while I waited for my dog to get groomed next door and WOW am I glad I did. When I walked in there was a seat yourself sign so I was a little skeptical but not even a second after I walked in I was greeted by the all of friendly staff who told me to sit wherever I liked. The server brought me a water right when he came to get my actual drink order... exactly what I needed after being in the heat! I was surprised when he told me he was new because he very efficient, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the queso appetizer with lobster and YUM! I also got the Baja fish taco which probably one of the best I've ever had. Top notch service and great food!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Blackened Salmon Tacos!  I really liked the Waiter who helped me out!  I also enjoyed the Chips and Salsa!  The Mango Salsa that was on my Taco was really good as well!  All the Staff was really nice and friendly when I accidentally left my phone on the Table!"}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food wasn't all that great. We had the queso fondido with lobster, but felt that it tasted bland. I had the Baja fish taco, which was good. I also had the shrimp taco, which was also bland. We really wanted to like this place because of the reviews, but it fell short of our expectations.   Positives: great service and nice presentation of food  Cons: Bland food and overpriced for what it was"}
{"text":"This is a cute restaurant with a unique menu. Amongst the 4 of us we had the avocado tacos, fish tacos, shrimp tacos, Pescado Borracho, street corn and black beans; and everything was delicious! Good margaritas too! Service was good and we were seated right away, food also came out quickly. I don't want to give it 5 stars because we'll have to wait 2 hours when we come back!  Edit to add: The desserts were also delicious. Try the chocolate chip butter cake and the avocado key lime pie!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the smell when you walk in strong sewer smell that may or may not resonate from this building but it's present and overwhelming. Nonetheless we tried the chips and guacamole which was bland and aged with brown spots. Then we each got our tacos. Average of $6/tacos so we were surprised when a single taco showed up on a plate. Mine was cold, the ahi and tortilla included. My wife's was the same. Ultimately disappointed that it wasn't good. Wanted to like this as it's close to home and convenient."}
{"text":"First visit here and the place is new, so although it wasn't perfect we will probably give it another try. The good: octopus and shrimp in tacos was very good. The chips and guacamole very good. The not so good was ahi tacos had so much non fish junk in it I couldn't even taste the fish. The bad: corn tortillas were cold and greasy, flour tortilla was ok only. Service was very good."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  Short rib tacos were so tasty.  Haberno sauce was yummy, but oh so hot.  The butter cake and banana ice cream was to die for.  Awesome service and awesome food.  What a great combination."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because of the high yelp reviews. I know now that those reviews are flawed. Nothing against the establishment but I should have known this place was no good by how many seats were open. Also, the chips and \"salsa\" had no flavor. I ordered the Californian tacos and ended up picking it apart to avoid biting on the hard French frys. I'm not picky eater but this place was bad. No way it should have over 3 stars."}
{"text":"Damn good. Had queso with corn cakes, tacos (I had ahi and shrimp) plus elote (get the spicy). The best part of it all...they have Widow Jane. Not just the regular but two kinds!!!  That's bourbon from New York if you don't know. Only had it at PJ Clarke's in city or special order prior to this. Momma had the pina sangria and doubled down (so I think she liked it). Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing fresh fish and seafood placed in creativity. Crisp and clean flavors, calling them tacos does not cover it. We will be back to try everything on the menu. One of the best since we came to AZ. Will bring out of town family and friends"}
{"text":"Now I'm not exactly a fan of the \"street corn\" it tasted like garlic butter and the butter tasted the same as a seafood dipping butter. But their Posole is AMAZING and a very large bowl for a resonable price. I def am a fan and will be back just for the Posole. The tacos, and Guacamole. was also great!"}
{"text":"I wish I could've gone inside to eat because the drinks looked amazing and the vibe was great.  We grabbed some food to go due to time constraints. I can't even tell you how happy I am we tried it.  Between 3 of us we tried shrimp, crispy avo, octopus, braised short rib and carne asada tacos.  Un-freaking believable! Husband ALWAYS gets carne asada every chance he gets and said it was top 5 he's ever had.  He went on and on about it! This place has it dialed in as far as atmosphere, drinks and especially the amazing food.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The Baja fish tacos were delicious.  And on the taco Thursday they are only $3.50 during happy hour.  The service was incredible. Seriously the waiter was the absolute best server we have had in a very long time. He explained the menu and how everything works. I personally would not recommend the pork tacos but that's not to say that everything else wasn't delicious.  But, seriously the Baja fish tacos had a sizable portion of fish, it was fresh, it was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Top notch taco selection and my wife advises the margaritas are marga-great-a! a little married humor for you.  dinner wait gets up to an hour or more. come here for lunch and sit down immediately and enjoy delicious food & drinks!  definitely will come back (for lunch)."}
{"text":"Overrated and under seasoned.  Their Baja and California tacos are OK at most. Rice is bland, 1/4 of a cup of queso dip will cost you $4 and everything is a la carte. I was thoroughly disappointed as I brought my husband here for Fathers Day.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Everything delicious, had the california taco, crispy Avo taco, Baja taco, street corn. Satisfied my cravings."}
{"text":"An Amazing Unique approach to Taco's!!! I ordered 3 and Loved all 3 of them! The Crispy Octopus Taco was Unbelievably Great! Would highly recommend going and trying! I will be back again and again! Waitstaff was Awesome! Dakota was Great  and took care of us the entire time we were there! They have brought a very cool twist to the Taco that's for sure! Great job and Welcome to the Neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love this new restaurant!  The short rib and fried avocado tacos are amazing along with the chicken enchiladas.  Wait staff is super friendly and portions are perfect!  I highly recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"Holy Borracho!  I was able to convince my husband to come here for dinner (during rush hour, on a Friday) instead of our usual San Tan Brewery.  He is thanking me BTW.  We started off with drinks (per usual) I ordered the blackberry house margarita with muddled jalape√±o (per my request) and it's a House-made pur√©e because of course I asked.. because it was absolutely delicious. No funky after taste or hint of chemical, it was a fresh margarita and I am impressed.  For appetizer, we chose the chicka-rones which is a classic spin on the fried pork skin but instead it's chicken skin fried.... don't wanna know the calorie count on that but trust me, the plate was clean.  Every taco was different and we ordered 7 total. My favorite was the AVO.. fried avocado with a crispy cheese taco shell and cucumbers to balance the heaviness of cheese and avocado. Gosh, great food and service.  Plotting our return.."}
{"text":"I think we have eaten here at least 4 times in the past 3 weeks. The food is so good. The octopus tacos are super good. The crispy octopus with the pineapple is a great combo. My absolute favorite is the Californian with tasty Carne Asada and French fries...sounds a little strange but it is SO TASTY!!! Also have to mention I think their tortilla chips are some of the best in the valley. Love that they are not full of grease. They have specials at Happy Hour that are pretty good. I like the prickly pear margarita! Can't wait for our next meal here!"}
{"text":"From the owners of High Tide comes a hip new Taco and Tequila Bar.   The ambiance of the restaurant is incredibly modern which incites the vibrant experience I would expect out of a Tequila Bar.   The food is incredibly fresh and unique. My Wife and I shared the aguachile (similar to a ceviche) which was the best we've had. The tomatillo salsa was out of this world and had a sweet a tangy flavor. The taco shells were delicate and flavorful and the enchiladas were accompanied by a zesty lime sauce. In all the flavor of the food was delightful.   Our server Savannah was on her A game. We always had refills on drinks and she was quick to recommend her favorite items on the menu. The bussers were attentive and kept our waters filled and our tables cleared of dirty dishes.   The entire experience was one that I can't wait to relive. Next time I hope to leave a little more borracho myself :)"}
{"text":"I've passed this place for the past couple of months on my way to and from work and finally decided to go in and I don't regret it!! Quick service service and amazing food!! The fish tacos are super yummy and the green salsa served with chip (have to be ordered) is super good!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, best tacos we have ever had! We sat up at the bar, all 3 bartenders were very friendly, helpful and  knowledable. We ordered the Californian, pb carnitas, and grilled shrimp tacos. We eat A LOT of Mexican food and the Californian was the best taco I have ever eaten in my life. The husband loved the shrimp taco as well as the Californian. The pb carnitas was a bit fatty. The carne asada in the Californian was incredibly tender and no fatty pieces. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, unfortunately very slow service. We waited 35 minutes for 3 tacos and 3 bowl's of very salty pinto beans, no bueno!!! They were very apologetic due to being short staffed. Pricey for such small portions."}
{"text":"We visited during our vacation to Arizona.  I searched Yelp and thought this would be a good stop for a quick bite to eat.  We had a party of seven and were seated fairly quickly.  I decided to try a cucumber margarita and it was a fail. It was very small, very expensive and lacked flavor.   I spoke to the bartender and he did what he could to remedy my problem, but I think they may need to look at another recipe for these. I wasn't there for the margaritas, I was there for the tacos and we were very impressed.  My favorite was the Ahi Tuna.  This was amazing.  The portion of tuna was very large and had amazing flavor.  The crispy octopus taco was also a favorite among the group.  The children's menu was reasonable.  The servers we had were amazing and were doing everything they could to make our meal enjoyable.   My next trip to AZ I will definitely be stopping by for the tacos again."}
{"text":"An urban twist on Mexican food with some unique and delicious recipes. Great food, nice decor and large portions. You won't regret trying this one."}
{"text":"Great food! Octopus tacos, short rib tacos, fish tacos are all really good with fresh ingredients and multi flavors! Tried the coconut butter cake with chocolate chips for desert! Much better than a pazookie! Decadent! Will be returning soon ! Good margaritas too!"}
{"text":"It's a Keto Taco Lovers dream come true, cabbage wrapped deliciousness that fills you up and satisfies all your taste buds at the same time. I had the polo tacos, cabbage wrapped and they were amazing. Snuck a chip or two and they were light and crisp and full of flavor as were both the green and red salsas. The ambience is cool and the service is great too. Can't wait to go back for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the customer service and most importantly, the FOOD is amazing. I would definitely recommend the tacos. I had the chicken and my husband had the fish tacos; both delish. This place is a spot I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Went for a work lunch, first time here. Everything was very good. I liked the octopus better than the avocado only because of the sauce. My coworker got the sea bass tacos and switched the sauce to a Baja sauce and that was amazing!!"}
{"text":"We checked out Pescado Borracho based on Yelp reviews for Mother's Day. The restaurant had a casual up beat atmosphere and the servers took our order quickly. We had the shrimp, carne asada, chorizo, and fish tacos and none really lived up to the hype on Yelp! Everything was ok but we would not come back again. The menu said the shrimp was grilled but it wasn't, just seemed steamed or even boiled. The carne asada was extremely dry and the chorizo was pasty. The presentation was nice and the tacos came out looking better than they tasted."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a new, hip place to go? This place is modern and trendy with an abundant selection of margarita flavors that will make you want to try one of each. Every flavor is so good - I wish they would offer a margarita \"flight\"!  We had the signature dish, the Pescado Borracho and loved it. If you are a foodie and adventurous I recommend it! The street corn was the best I've ever had. You get two ears and can choose garlic or habanero butter. The habanero is out of this world. Not as hot as it sounds, the perfect touch of heat.  The Aquachilies are excellent and a big portion....so delicious. We felt very welcomed as we walked in and had very good service! I can't wait to go back and try the Queso Fundido. I would highly recommend you give this family-owned place a try!!"}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona it was my mothers birthday, so our friends suggested trying out this new restaurant. My mother and I love Mexican food and tacos so we thought that this would be a great fit. There were six of us at dinner and the margaritas were flowing! Their menu is not large. There is a handful of appetizers, a taco menu and a few entrees selections. We started with apps. We tried the fundito, Street corn and aquachile. Everyone loved the fundito and aquachile, however the street corn really lack flavor. For the dinner entr√©es most everyone ordered tacos and one ordered enchiladas. I ordered three different tacos, all seafood of course and my favorite was the octopus taco! This taco was so amazing and it was the first one that I tried that I didn't even want to eat the other ones because I thought nothing would be as  amazing. Definitely try this taco! Everyone else seemseemed to be very pleased with their taco decisions. The only thing that was unfortunate is the restaurant doesn't do anything to celebrate a birthday. So our amazing server took it upon himself and bought my mother a dessert and brought it to her so we could all sing happy birthday. This was so incredibly kind of him and he really made her night. Overall we had a good experience and I think they really need to make sure that they can do something to celebrate special locations. But I would definitely go back to this restaurant I need another octopus taco or two!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place for lunch based on the great reviews. It's owned by the people that own High Tide next door - which we love.  Upon entry there is a sign saying \"take a menu and seat yourself\" there were no menus and we needed a table for 8 which they did not have until we requested.  We were seated and never saw a server or member of staff for 15 minutes until someone came and put a bowl of chips at one end of the table. We asked for a second bowl of chips for the other end but never received them.  I decided to ask for service and I was promised that someone would be with us shortly. Two tables were served before us even though we were seated well before them.  We still didn't have menus, glasses of waters, or plates for the small bowl of chips placed at the top end of the table which clearly was not enough to share between 8.  After asking twice for menus, being giving a bowl of chips with no plates or utensils, no water and zero service, we decided to walk out after waiting over 25 minutes - and yes I timed it after having to ask for menus the first time so it was probably closer to 40 minutes.  For management: This place is NOTHING like High Tide in regards to service, your staff seemed nonchalant about us walking out and didn't seem to care for our business when we were there. The self seating isn't working as I saw other people struggling to find tables and customers arguing over their bill.  I would rethink this system and start a full service like High Tide"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Got the shrimp taco and the Baja taco. Wow so impressed. So much flavor! The waiter was great as well. So attentive and friendly. Beautiful decor as well. Very clean! And might I add...they played my favorite music the entire time. I think they had the Michael Jackson Pandora station on ha! :) Will be back! Am already craving it again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried several tacos at happy hour ($1 off).  Regular size tacos loaded with ingredients and full of flavor.  We tried the Baja , a fried sea bass with aioli, the California, carne asada, and the pollo asada, seasoned chicken.  All three had good flavor but the pollo asada had a marinated cucumber that added a sweet flavor that I didn't care for but that is just me.  Next time I get that taco I will have them leave the cucumbers off.  Also, if you don't like cilantro like my wife and I, make sure you have them hold it off because they use it on just about everything including the pico de gallo and side orders of beans. Speaking of which we tried black and pinto. We prefer the pinto over the black because of a sweet flavor in the black beans. All that being said we were pleasantly surprised with how good the food was.  We added a couple of House Margaritas ($5 at happy hour and multiple flavor choices, the blackberry is dangerously good.  Plus on Monday Margs are $4).  One other thing was there hot sauce, a very tasty chipotle (Smokey jalape√±o flavor) sauce that we put on everything. Yum!  We also had a sample of their aguachili, or something similar to that name, I can't remember exactly.  But it was their version of a ceviche, and if we would have had any room left we would have ordered a full serving. That was really good!!   We will definitely be back,  definitely more stuff to try, but watch out for the cilantro."}
{"text":"Stopped by as I was in the area and had heard good things.  Service was pleasant and it was clean inside.  Had two of their chicken tacos and unfortunately they weren't that great.  Chicken was a little on the lukewarm side with very little texture.   The tacos were also a majority guacamole and crema - needed something crunchy to balance it out a bit.  They also included pickled cucumbers in the dish which was not a appetizing flavor.  Just an ok experience."}
{"text":"Sea Bass Tacos!! Great fish tacos! Street corn is very authentic! Fresh ingredients! So far favorites are the Salmon, Baja, Californian. Goooood margaritas!"}
{"text":"Saturday evening was our first time eating at Pescado Borracho. We arrived around 7pm and were seated immediately. Their Facebook post advertising the aguachile seafood/salsa verde dip drew us in. We had to try it. The service was very attentive and fast. The aguachile comes in a big bowl with a base of tomatillo salsa and contains a generous amount of shrimp, octopus, and sea bass with cucumbers and avocado on top and it's served with tortilla chips. We also had tacos; I ordered the short rib and baja fish tacos with a side of garlic butter street corn. Everything was delicious. I was not a huge fan of the corn tortillas, so next time I'll order flour."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Really hip, cool place to hang out and try some amazing food.  I'm glad it opened up here and I hope it stays.  If you live in the area then it's a must try."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! I came here last week for a couple tacos with my friend. I ordered a salmon taco. When I asked the waitress if the salmon was normally cooked well done, she said yes, always. As such, I did not order the salmon well done like I normally do since she stated they already are well done. Salmon came out (SMALL $7.50 TACO!!!!, street taco size) and the salmon was shiny and slimy. I asked the waitress if she could cook the salmon longer, she brought it back to the kitchen to do that. When she came back, there was barely any salmon left, only a few flakes. I didn't know where my filet went?? I didn't even eat half of this, now cabbage only, taco. When I got my bill I asked if the taco could be taken off my bill. Waitress went back to the office and asked the manager who said no, since they remade another for Me. The waitress had agreed there was barely any meat left on the 2nd taco. She asked if I wanted to speak with the manager and I agreed. The manager then agreed to take it off but never came out to talk to me. If this wasn't enough, I paid cash and the waitress never brought my change.... must have kept for herself? A self-presumed tip.... not a good look ma'am."}
{"text":"Super delicious good sized tacos. Wife and I shared 3 tacos - California, salmon and Baja. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Baja Fish taco, The Californian taco and Pollo Asado taco + mojito (white peach is da bomb!!) and your evening is perfect!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with wife and daughter.  We were seated right away.  For app we got corn which was great.  Daughter got mac & cheese with fries.  Wife and I shared the \"Pescado Borracho\".  They did say it was a whole fish...and they were right.  Head included.  The fish was deep fried and had all the bones.  It was extremely messy, but very tasty.  They only gave us 3 tortillas though.   We would go back, but not order that 'thing' again.    Atmosphere and service were good and again, the food was tasty."}
{"text":"We decided to try this out and it was a great environment. My favorite was the California taco without the fries. The flavor was really good and since happy hour gives $1 off the tacos I had two! The chips were so good and the corn tortillas were just as awesome. The habanero salsa is definitely worth the heat and pairs so well with the chika-rones. The reason this received three stars is the restaurants extensive use of tomatillos and tomatillo based food. There was an awesome sounding seafood ceviche on the menu but the tomatillo base was just too much to really enjoy the sample given. I would definitely give this more stars if there a greater variety of sauces and/or food based available."}
{"text":"Yelpers nailed this one. Awesome tacos!  Our group tried as many different tacos as we could. Octopus was top notch as was the ahi tuna and the blackened salmon. We tried several others and loved everything we ordered. Service was great as were the $4 margaritas (\"Margarita Monday\").   We got chips and salsa and guacamole and two tacos was almost too much. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and very demolitions m do an. The fish tacos were delicious. The cheese enchiladas were very good too. The highlight of all of the meals was surprisingly the boracha beans. They were delicious.   The guacamole was just ok.   We will be back."}
{"text":"We visited last Friday and enjoyed it all! The house classic Rita was very good  We had three! The chips and salsas were fresh and tasty.  We had tacos and I must say the chef is creative.  Guess what? I went again on Saturday with my girlfriend and this time I had the Pescado (fish).  It was delish! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food was terrific. I had the Pescado Borracho fish dish. Very good. Wife had fish taco and carne taco. Everything was very good. AND...Excellent Service!!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for happy hour and I am most definitely Happy!  House Vodka Mule was very refreshing.  The guacamole was a delicious start to the meal.  The \"California\" and grilled shrimp taco hit the spot.  I will be bringing friends back for another happy hour ;-)"}
{"text":"Best tacos In Arizona! My rank of the four tacos we had:  1. Octopus taco - seriously!  2. Avo taco 3. Baja taco 4. Seared ahi tuna taco.  I would've loved to try the garlic corn on the cob, but I knew we would be too full. Wish we could take this place back to Utah with us."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to try this new place based on the other reviews and I'm sure glad we did.  The service was wonderful, the tacos (especially the Californian and fish) were fantastic and the churro bites were delicious.  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We came here last weekend and were VERY satisfied! Our server was extremely knowledgeable and took time to explain menu items. She also offered to bring out the first free order of chips and salsa, without asking, even though it was \"upon request.\" Our water cups always stayed full and the table clean. Our tacos were absolutely delicious and incredibly fresh. A lot of flavor and a lot of variety on the menu! This is definitely our new fish taco place and we can't wait to bring family and friends. Plus, it's less than 5 minutes from our house!"}
{"text":"I like this place,waitress are nice and service is fast I tried Baja tacos and crispy octopus are delicious. I love guacamole. But pozole was not that good feel like was old  that's why I give 4 starts"}
{"text":"I want to give 3.5 stars.  Service was great. Food was okay. Wish there was more spice. We ordered the whole fish, posole, and some tacos with chips and guacamole. Chips were hot. Guam was fresh. But salsa was bland. Server said they had a super hot habanero salsa but we didn't want to burn our taste buds.   Tacos were large in size. Next time I want to try the chickarones. Table next to us ordered them and they looked super good."}
{"text":"After moving from San Diego to Arizona I've been craving a good taco place. This place reminds me of my Saturday mornings walking across the border for fresh tacos! I can't rave enough about the fish or shrimp taco! Oh YOU HAVE TO TRY the corn!! The service is fantastic, the drinks are great and the food is AMAZING! Highly recommend you trying here!"}
{"text":"Service awesome. Atmosphere fun/cool. Fish taco was above average. Salsa was pretty lame no heat and little flavor. Chickarones were a tad thick. Fresh made should be lighter and not chewy.  I would go back for the service and drinks."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  I had the avocado taco and a fish taco with a cabbage leaf instead of a tortilla.  Excellent!  I loved the flavors.  The pickled cucumber in the avocado taco were perfect.  I also indulged in a red sangria which was also excellent.  They should put their name on the door.  I observed people on two separate occasions come in and then leave because they were looking for High Tide.  Excited to go back and try some other things!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  I think they have the best tacos in town!  Must try the octopus and fish tacos with flour tortillas!  Micheladas are great also!"}
{"text":"Good variety of tacos, all very delicious! Not cheap but you get a hardy taco for $5. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"How do you not visit a place with such a fun name?! My husband and I came to Pescado Borracho and were welcomed by the staff and an ongoing playlist of MJ, Justin Timberlake and Usher. The inside is very modern and clean with bright green and blue colors.   The service was very quick and checked on us frequently, and the menu looked very appetizing. There were so many unique taco options, ranging from fried octopus, salmon and tuna to steak, carnitas, etc... many options and lots of variety! Although I wanted to try five different tacos my husband and I decided to share the Pescado Borracho (fried snapper). How can you not?! We also order the PB Street Corn and a side of charred jalape√±os.   The Pescado was very juicy and flavorful but be prepared, it is the whole fish so watch out for bones! Although it was very good, it is like eating crab or crawfish, a lot of work for little protein. Overall glad I tried it but I think the tacos would have been more of my style. The street corn was delicious, and the habanero butter added nice heat but it was very buttery and thick. I would definitely recommend, just be prepared to consume a heavy amount of butter. We also ordered two cocktails which were good but very sweet.    Overall, we enjoyed our time and would like to visit again, it just seemed like what we decided to try wasn't my favorite. Glad I tried but I still want to explore the taco menu!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy avo and bass tacos. Both were great, but a little on the pricey side. The meal comes with complimentary chips and salsas. There is one red salsa that tastes mild and a green salsa with a slight kick. These were both great and very unique! I also ordered a prickly pear margarita which was good, but wished I had ordered the original. The atmosphere is very casual and the decorations correlate with the food items that they serve. Try this place out. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"All the previous reviews are true! Came for lunch with my wife and we had drinks and tacos. She had the Baja fish taco and crispy AVO! I had the crispy octopus and grilled shrimp tacos! All were winners!  She had the House margarita and i had the mechilada! Both were fantastic.   The place has a cool vibe and our server Hannah and bartender Lauren were awesome as well!  Highly recommend this place! It should be here for a long time! The local owners get it and have brought another great dining experience to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Outstanding tacos! The Crispy Avo was a tasty surprise. The Crispy Octopus and Fish taco was prepared very well. Not a lot of breading and cooked just right.   We loved the garlic butter corn off the cob- delish!  Service was very good.  We hope this gem sticks around! We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Better than I imagined (and I am a big fan of High Tide, their sister restaurant next door). This place is a little more casual than High Tide but still fairly upscale when it comes to tacos. Service was great and food was high quality and delicious. We love PB  (Lent or no Lent)!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos!! Everything taste really fresh and flavorful. Chips are thin and crispy, fresh salsas are tasty as well."}
{"text":"Mango Margarita was so yummy! Great taco portions. Ordered the pozole, delicious but would prefer it with more soup and hot. Overall good first visit. Will come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Needs improvement. First time I've had salsa without any kick at all that my seven-month-old agreed."}
{"text":"We came back to try it again but the tacos and salsa weren't as good this time plus they charged us for bringing us the wrong house hot sauce when we asked for it.  Better off going to Mucha Lucha or Isabella's right down the street for some authentic Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place with my family for Mother's Day based on all of the great reviews but I didn't have the same experience. The fish taco and the enchiladas were the only good thing on the menu. The service was alright but the energy of the restaurant wasn't the best. Overall, I won't be coming back based of the food and the service we received."}
{"text":"Always looking for a great taco shop, I found it! The flavors and creativeness of food is on point.  Enchiladas are not what your expecting there better. And did i mention the salsa both red and green I can't decide which ones better. The waitress could have been a bit more attentive, but the food made up for it.  The manager came over and was super pleasant. We are absolutely coming again."}
