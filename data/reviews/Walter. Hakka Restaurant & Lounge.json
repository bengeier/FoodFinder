{"text":"Find a paradise where everyone will get to know your name at the Shang!  It's restful paradise and patrons make for an experience that leaves you wanting more....and if you like me just can't get enough there is Hold em poker on Sunday afternoons...but get in before four and see Bruce for your early bird bonus!"}
{"text":"Really good hakka Chinese food and bar. Highly recommended. Chilli chicken dry and fried rice combo!"}
{"text":"Wings are really good try the sweet and hot ones (mixing the 2 sauces. ) that the bartender recommended .

Mostly middle to old age men in there ...mostly regulars but still a cool local place to visit.

The quality of the place is low as in ripped couches and ghetto like scene. But if ur in the area it's a good place to check out and chill for some drinks wings and a game of pool. The regulars there are also generally pretty cool, they might come ask u for a game of pool or something .

DIfferent crowds show up in terms of culture from white black asian and Indian . Seems pretty multicultural."}
{"text":"If you plan on doing any take out orders I suggest call 20 to 30 minutes in advance they do take some time making their dishes.. I suggest getting the Chilli chicken with gravy and the special fried rice that's a meal for 2 or 3 people for the price of 20$.."}
{"text":"'Twas a cold and rainy night when my crew and I decided to go out for some spicy eats and beer. As usual, the boys turned to me to find a place. No pressure there.  Lol. Ever since the Doctors doubled the meds intake I feel as I can do anything if I put my mind to it. Yes I can!  
I pull out my trusty iphone and open up my Yelp App. Hmmmm. What do we have under bookmarks?  Process of elimination. Down to two places.  Ahhhhh, let's try Shangri-La. 
Brampton here we come.  
We pull up in the lot and we all immediately notice 1 inebriated male literally falling out of the place.  This dudes was right tanked. He couldn't even walk. All seated in the car with mouths open wide in disbelief and wonder, feelings of fear and regret overcame my mind.
Benny scay now. 
Benny's crew looks at Benny and harmoniously say, \"seriously Benny?!\". 
Benny, with a look of extreme fear in his one good eye, replies, \"Benny scay!\".  
My buddy steps up and says, \"I no scay!,, let's go in and eat!\".  
Benny says, \"But Benny is scay!, Meds no work anymo\". 
Benny, whilst still scay, is pulled from the car and reluctantly follows his crew into the resto. 
Enter restaurant. 
Holy mish mash of people. All sort of guys and gals hanging out drinking beers, eating and playing pool. No hammered dudes stumbling around or laying on the floor in puddles of vomit. Just a bunch of nice looking people chilling and having a pleasant time. Yeah sure the place may be a wee bit skiddy lookin but,,,,, never judge a resto by what happens to stumble out of it!  
Benny's Meds kick in again. 
With a twinkle in my one good eye and a skip in my step I swagger up to bar and lock eyes with the purti-est Bartender. I give and get the warmest smile and which set the perfect tone for the evening. I must say that our server/bartender, whose name is Tobi, was fantastic. So personable and genuine.  It was a pleasure to have her deal with us.   Love her!!!   
We start with a pitcher of beer.   
Our order:
Chili Fish Dry - Extra Spicy.
Chili Chicken Wet- Extra Spicy. 
Three pound of Chicken Wings - Suicide and add extra fresh chili pepper. 
Hakka Noodles - Extra Spicy. 
Verdict:  
Chili Fish Dry was crunchy. My one buddy loved it.  Not spicy. I found it to be ok.  
Chili Chicken Wet. We all liked this one. Nice and spicy. Chunks of chili pepper everywhere!  
Hakka Noodles. Ok. Not spicy at all. Just ok.
Suicide Chicken Wings. Dayaam!  Really good. Crunchy and covered in fresh minced chili and hot sauce.  We request extra fresh chili and did they ever accommodate us.
All in all this place was a surprisingly pleasant little hole in the wall full of nice people who just want to de-stress from a long hard day.  
There is plenty of parking out in the lot so don't worry Yelpers,, you will all find a spot. 
I would also like to note that we went there on a Friday and during our dinner we observed a band setting up.  Live music?!?!  Nice.  
Well, that is my report on the Shangri-La.  I hope you liked it.  Give it try if you find yourself in South Brampton.  Oh yeah,, with orders over 40 buck you can Yelp App unlock a pound of Chicken wings for 4 buck.  
Peace out Yelpers!!!"}
{"text":"It's a dive, but it's still MY local dive..  What can I say, I've been drinking here for the last 10 years through 3 owners and 3 styles of bar.  From the Crown and Anchor, to Tartan Arms, to the Shangri La now, I will continue supporting it as long as it remains within stumbling distance to home sweet home haha..  They serve regular pub items, pretty good wings, and \"Hakka Chinese food\" now too..  Patio is always nice on a great summer day which is where most people will be out drinking.. No cover charge for UFC nights is nice but often crowded.  This is a completely biased review because I'm here 4 nights a week and everybody knows my name, so you can disregard this

2015 edit:  the Shang has changed a lot, for the better!  they've done some renovations, hired more full time cooks and bartenders, got a sweet digital jukebox, actual HD signal for the TVs, and even have a fun digital dartboard game now (Bull Shooter)


What to eat?

- Wings: hot and honey. Ask for them \"finished on the grill\".  And with green chili, if you like spice
- Chili Chicken wet or dry with veggie fried rice combo
- Manchurian chicken wet or dry
- Curry chicken spring rolls
- Actual fresh cut fries"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. The people are friendly and the beer is cold. There is a patio section outside where you can sit for a meal, drink, or to enjoy a smoke. One of the main activities seems to be pool. There is a constant rotation on the table and everybody seemed to be having a good time. 

I ordered the chicken and curry sauce meal. It was prepared well and came quickly. There are deals on wings almost every day as well. Check out their drink specials when you arrive!"}
{"text":"This was a delivery order. The lady who took my order was really nice and didn't miss a thing. It as also a nice touch that she welcomed us as a new customer. The driver arrived on time with the food nice and hot. We were able to pay debit since the driver brings the wireless pay device. The food was top quality and we will order again soon."}
{"text":"If your in the B-town and your looking for a pub to have a beer..shoot some pool..watch some sports...have some homemade Hakka Chinese food...yes...Hakka Chinese food and Pints..then Shangri-La Bar and Grill is the place to go!!  Me and a buddy wanted to hit up a pub in the area, but through the magical power of Yelp I found this hidden gem in the central area of Brampton.  I was intrigued by a sports bar pub that you can grab a pint and have a plate of home made Hakka Chinese food with it. 

 Located in a strip mall right off McLaughlin on Charolais, it looks like a very small neighborhood pub...a little run down..but nothing to be apprehensive about.  A good sized pub complete with a pool table, lounge with a large flat screen, music jukebox, hightops and booths.  A very local establishment with lots of patrons calling most of the staff by their first names.  Very \"Cheers\" like...The staff are friendly and the owner (Walter) is around talking to the patrons.  Walter was born in India, but is from a Chinese heritage, thus the Hakka food menu.  Lots of combo specials that are very reasonably priced ($8-10 dollars) The menu also has some pub style items (fries, chicken fingers, burgers) but the main star is the Hakka Chinese food.   I also found out there is a check in special on the Yelp app for a pound of wings!! 

We ordered the Chili Chicken combo with fried rice and the Szechuan chicken spicy with fried rice, the free pound of wings also a couple of pints to wash it down.  Our server was super friendly and the beer was cold. The food arrived quickly and the portion sizes were pretty big.  I really enjoyed the Chili chicken, just enough spice and the sauce was tasty.  The Szechuan chicken was also quite good, but my preference was the Chili. The pound of wings were absolutely huge!! 10pcs of drums and wings, way more that 1 lb.  After our meal Walter (owner) came by and asked how our meal was.  I was quite impressed by the friendliness and quality of Shangri-La and it will be a place that I will be coming back to!!

Update:
I orignially gave it a 4...because of the location, but if you overlook it and focus on the unique food , the staff and the non-pretentious nature of the place..it's a 5 in my books.."}
{"text":"An ok joint but a nice place to hang out in on a Friday night with the right people!

Food is Hakka inspired with some North American grub thrown in.

Don't order wings here, won't waste my time. Used to be a bit more dive-like but has been since renovated."}
