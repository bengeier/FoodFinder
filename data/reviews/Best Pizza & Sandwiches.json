{"text":"Really good pizza ! Make sure you order the full sheet pizza. The pizza was hot and ready  on time. Love the nice staff"}
{"text":"My first time trying best pizza and it will not ne the last.  The online ordering is very simple and straight forward, it said the pizza would be ready in 25 min and they had it done in 20min which is a plus since i work close and my lunch time is precious. I ordered the Chicago deep dish with pepperoni and sausage, the description says there is 1lbs of cheese on it and that is not joke. That being said i was disappointed with the amount of pepperoni and sausage on it there was half as much as i was expecting which is my only issue which was going to put them at 3 stars but overall the pizza was very good and flavorful dispite the lack of toppings the crust had a very nice flavor and went well with the abundance of cheese and the great red sauce that topped it all just sweet enough and seasoned perfectly. That being said i will definitely order again and will recommend it when asked for a place to get good quality pizza."}
{"text":"Really good pizza,  lots of fresh toppings.  The employees were very polite and friendly. One of the better pizzas I've had in a long time. Super prices. We will definitely be heading here again!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! After working a 12 hour shift with no break I Ordered 2 pizzas that were suppose to be buy one get one... 19.49$ not sure how I paid that for one pizza. After an hour of waiting we call and were told the pizzas were on their way. Mind you I have 3 starving children at this point.  After several phone calls and almost 2 hours later our pizzas show up..FYI we live 5 minutes from here.  They were cold, greasy and the best part the driver said our order was put last for delivery. I will never order from here again. Please note my husband made this order so I wouldn't have to worry about dinner after a long day.  Best pizza will never have our business again.  I work too hard for my money.  Little Caesars is better than this crap!  I refuse to give it any stars but had to so I could post the review."}
{"text":"I was in town and needed to grab dinner on the fly for a few folks. Did my Yelp research and found Best Pizza? Well that sounds simple enough and has delivery, dine in or take out. They serve sheets, round pizzas, calzones, wings and sandwiches, ect.  Great prices and the service was fast and friendly. We enjoyed our deluxe pizza with very fresh toppings and some solid tasty buffalo wings (done right and saucy!)  They have coupons, so be sure to find a good deal for your party. When in OH, I'd stop back here for fast pizza and wings again! Currently a Yelp check in gets you a free cookie too!"}
{"text":"I received a menu from them recently which is was the first time I had ever heard of them. Looked them up on yelp and was intrigued by the positive reviews.   I ordered a calazone on the phone and they said 20 minutes. I got there in 14 and they were pulling it out if the oven.   Took it home. Ate it all. Immediately. It was very good. Crispy crust, not too much dough, great portion of filling. They also gave two cups of sauce, which was my only complaint since they were cold. Easily remedied in the microwave.   Prices were great for the size and quality. Highly recommended."}
