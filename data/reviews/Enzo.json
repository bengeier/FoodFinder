{"text":"Surprisingly tasteless. It was as if they didn't add salt to anything. The dough had wood fired marks but no wood fired taste. It also just didn't taste. There was no sense of yeast. The mushrooms and pepperoni also were bland. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I just came in earlier. It was right before close. Had a slice of a veg pizza. It was pretty good. I'll come back for some beef slices later. 


The guys working were nice. I'll try a.whole pizza sometime, but I'm.cutting right now.
I need to eat more here to further analyze..."}
{"text":"The pizza competition has a new challenger on Queen. Enter Enzo - I've no idea what their background is, but given that there's one Pizza Pizza down the street, two Pizzaiolos within a 5 min walk, and North Of Brooklyn (their direct competitor) immediately around the corner... let's just say it's a bold move.

On my way to pick up pizza for the team at NoBo, I dashed in to grab some from Enzo for a direct comparison.

I ordered both the Francesco (mushroom, mozz, olives, sausage, artichokes, roasted red) and Pepe (calabrese pepper, pepperoni, onion, olives). Flavour-wise, they sorta tasted the same, though I want to say I liked Pepe better. Both were decent picks, though I don't have a lot of recall on them - I was distracted by work. I'd probably give both a go again some time to check. Co-workers voiced that they liked North Of Brooklyn better (we also had NoBo's Margh and Puttanesca the same day).

But *I* clearly liked Enzo enough to return.

So, I had the Enza (buffalo mozz, fresh basil) today for lunch and really liked this one. The basil was nice and aromatic, the buffalo mozz was fresh and faintly buttery. Photo: https://twitter.com/foodpr0n/status/328945872253640704/photo/1

The crust: I like. On the thick side of thin and with good chew (more chewy than I think many people may like). The bake is just-toasty, and no significant charred bits. Gives it a nice (and even), crispy, outer shell. Taste of the dough is faintly sweet.

Overall, I like it. I feel the ingredients are good, the dough is tasty, and the cost is moderate (well, on the upper edges of that). Wasn't revelatory as that first bite of Libretto pizza years ago, but it's a good pie. Worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Friendly and cheaper than places like Libretto, but the pizza doesn't hold a candle to the thin crust Neapolitan pizza at Libretto. Maybe that's comparing apples to oranges - definitely a notch above grabbing a slice at Pizza Pizza but it doesn't even compare favourably to Amato."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pizza here, service was great as well.  We had the Enza.  Its a nice snack size pizza, thin crust.  Nice light pizza.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the city hands down!  It was love at first bite when I tried the Americano. Think big mac in pizza form - genius right?!  Other pizza places don't even exist to me anymore.  Another great choice is the Mila - a delicious white pizza with mushrooms and prosciutto.  Other honourable mentions are the Pepe (hot!) and Bonjourno (Think breakfast).  

As if a grande Americano wasn't enough - you can also get their dessert pizza which come in nutella or cookies and cream.  Hungry yet? 

Delivery service available within a certain area within 40 minutes and they always write a cute note or draw a picture on your delivery box.  Bonus - you can tell them what message you want written on your box."}
{"text":"I'll have to agree with the other reviewers raving about the service at Enzo Pizzabar. It is unusually warm and pleasant in an area of the city known for aloofness and cool-as-a-cucumber attitude. Pizza was delivered hot and fresh out of the oven with a nice tender crust and zesty tomato sauce along with tasty cheese spread randomly over the pie. Topped off with a hearty tiramisu it made for a satisfying visit and we will be back! (gotta try the Oreo cookie pizza...)"}
{"text":"This place has stiff competition as there is a good pizza joint right around the corner and then some other spots nearby that serve good pies. 
We called in before hand on a Sunday to make sure they are open. 
We went for a Margherita and Lana (White Pizza). Also added a bit of the greens on the Margherita. I ordered a glass of Cabernet for good measures. 
The pizza took its time but the service is top notch. 
On to the main 
The Crust is not overly thin nor is it New York Style. The sauce on the Margherita was decent and hits most of the right notes. I would say one of the better pizzas around this area. 
A great addition to the pizza scene that's heating up this city.
4 Stars."}
{"text":"Why the high fiver? The pizza itself is addictive but the main reason is because of the service.  I ordered a personal pizza which they made fresh with ingredients from Italy...yum! While sitting I was offered an espresso, that's class right there. From that I had a great convo with them about the history of their pizza, where they got their ingredients and their future plans.

They are going change the place to a sit down restaurant soon.  I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza at work. A little pricey but well worth it. $40 with tip and got a large americano big Mac pizza and it was amazing. Everyone at work loved it so much they ordered a second one after we destroyed the first one."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here and try the pizza for quite some time.  I was disappointed with the overall taste of my pizza.  Granted I got the pepperoni one (can't remember the exact fancy name).

I asked for light sauce and there was alot of sauce on it.  The pepperoni were little small pieces, it almost reminded me of a hot dog.

I gave this place an extra star because of the service.  Girl working there was nice, very friendly, even came and checked up on us.

Would I come back here?  I don't think so.  I found it to be overall meh, not alot of cheese for what you pay $10 for a personal pizza (they stretch the dough to be thin so it is bigger than what it should be)."}
{"text":"Friends told me about this upscale alternative to the standard pizza joint and something that is basically the equivalent of a Big Mac pizza. When I heard of the channelling of my favorite burger into a pizza, I had to go try it out. First, go hungry. Those thin crust pies may appear to be an easy take down, but they are more filling than you'd think. Secondly, appreciate the service. Out waitress was engaging, fun and remembered my friends from only a couple previous visits. Try the white sauce and mushroom pie or the Big Mac pizza. Top it all off with wine or San Pelegrino. Tasty and different, it's worth the trip"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of thin crust pizza like Libretto, Brooklyn, etc ... so this isn't my favourite. Service was nice when i went there during the off hours. 

I had a slice of mushroom with italian sausange. Fresh ingredients. It was a good quick bite to eat, in and out, pizza by the slice, but again, I'm biased loving my thin crust pizza. Reasonably price for Queen W. Then again, I didn't order a drink so my slice was reasonable."}
{"text":"I am so sad Enzo closed. Hopefully the owners actually do open a new place as they said they would."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this newcomer on Queen West. The pizza is dependable and they are creative... if you know the \"secret\" menu. They do go above and beyond to remember customers and to put names on the boxes, which is a classy touch. I've only had the pizza a couple of times but all my coworkers love the pizza here as well. This is a dependable establishment which is working hard to make a presence and name for themselves in Queen West and Toronto. They got some real heart and are friendly as hell. If you're skeptical, come for the service and try the food. They are earnest and put love into the work and the business and you have to respect that.

Plus I like that they make an effort in an online presence."}
