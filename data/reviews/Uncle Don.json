{"text":"Stopped by to eat here after grocery shopping. Was quite surprised by the quality of the food considering it's only a food court. It's owned and ran by just 2 friendly married couple who just want to make cheap and great food. I recommend the combos that they have as it will be the best bang for your buck. I got the Tonkotsu  Ramen but I've seen other people get items like the fish cutlet and the spicy chicken and I'm looking forward to trying those items later on. :)"}
{"text":"Small family place! The price is fair especially for its portion. You can tell that everything was home made by them. I think only 2 people work there but they serve the food in a timely manner and the money was well spent. 100% def would go there again.   I recommend their combos with the cutlet and the Ramen, prepare to be surprised by their portions."}
