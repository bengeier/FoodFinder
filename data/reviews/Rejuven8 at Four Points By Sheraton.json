{"text":"This wasn't bad. It wasn't great either. The spicy thai soup was great. The salad was fresh. I had chicken Tandoori that was pretty good too. The mango cheesecake for dessert was tasty but frozen in the middle. Service was friendly and prompt. I probably would have given it a slightly higher rating if the price had been a little lower. My meal was $41 not including the tip."}
{"text":"Don't eat here on the weekend. Why you ask? Well with one bartender who evidently must so room service man the bar AND the restaurant, it's impossible to get any type of good service. Your food ends up cold by the time it arrives, you'll wait 20 min for your check and by that time you just want to leave...."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you what the food is like here, because after over an hour of waiting and trying to place an order, I gave up and went elsewhere. Fortunately there are other food options a short walk away."}
