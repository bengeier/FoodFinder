{"text":"Food: 5/5. The portions were generous and very filling. I shared a combo 3 (chicken breast, and 2 different styles of kabab). The meat was tender and flavourful.  Price: 3/5. It was a bit overpriced but for the amount we got it wasn't too bad.  Service: 0/5. I don't mind if my food takes a bit longer to bring out, because it could mean they take the time to prepare it and they were also busy. My problem was the waiter only came by twice all night. Once to take the order and once to bring the food. Any other thing we needed, we had to flag them down. I also tried to use the Yelp promo to redeem a free orange juice. They first said they will \"check\" and never came back. When I waived them down again near the end of the night, they said that they don't do it if it's a busy night. How long does it take to pour a glass of juice...?"}
{"text":"It is a very cozy place with traditional decoration. The servers are friendly and nice. In addition to tables , there are some alternative sitting area that you can sit on oversized traditional benches ( very cool) The best part is the food. The kebabs that I had in this restaurant is as close you can get to tastes of kebabs in Iran. I take my dad to this restaurant regularly and always leave satisfied with the food and service."}
{"text":"Great food. The chicken dark meat kanaka was so delicious, the dizi is so authentic and healthy. The atmosphere and decoration is amazing and reminds you of the traditional Persian restaurants. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's a good place for family the food  is very  delicious and tasty the server they are very friendly they are very kind they check all the time that if you need anything and they have a live music from Thursday to to Sunday but it's better you can book before to go  for reservations."}
{"text":"Not happy. Waste of our Money . Went with a group of Friends there . Very disappointed . was told there's 6 Kaleh-pache available .4 came  first  ,2 came 40 min later which  3 of the dishes didnt have the tongue . was obvious it was only 3 set of kaleh pache but they decided to split to 6 portion and if people realize then  we do something about it!!!! and can you believe  Kareh-asal $8.99.  oh and the attitude of the young waitress was terrible. Overall wont go back there and wont recommend to anyone at all.  I guess they are not fully aware of  the power of \"word of mouth \""}
{"text":"AMBIANCE The decor is very unique and kind of warm and welcoming inside with a mish-mash of different things. They have tables and traditional takht (bed) style seating covered with Persian rugs.   FOOD: We ordered several starters, doogh (yogurt drink), and several kabab platters. WOW!!! This is my new place!   Appetizers were quite yummy.  The kabobs: The meat quality, marination, and tenderness of the meats were absolutely right on. The meats were so delicious they would easily separate and melt in your mount while you enjoyed the aroma of the different flavours. WELL DONE to the entire team did the perfect formula here. Oh let's, not forget the basmati rice, wow, very high quality stuff here and cooked perfectly!  SERVICE Although the restaurant was quite busy, they staff was very attentive and food delivery time was very fast. They were also warm and friendly which other reviews posted otherwise. Remember, treat people nicely and with respect and you should get the same treatment in return.   They also have a little bell at each table to get the attention of the staff of you need anything.   COST ABOUT $35/person all in (incl. tax/tip). For what you're getting here it is worth it. Persian food is not cheap folks; high-quality cut of meats, spices like saffron (one of the most expensive spices in the world), and prep time and labour intensive."}
{"text":"It was fun sitting on a relaxing couch to sit on and eat dinner. The food was flavorful and the kabobs were very tender.  Even the ambiance was lively and live music Friday night was lots of fun."}
{"text":"You really don't want to go there for breakfast!  Their Halleem and Kalepachee is NOT tasty at all.  It is it also pricy for no good reason!   Not satisfied at all!  The only thing good is their abgoosht"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The server was very rude. The kabab was dry and smelly. They overcharge a lot and they think that the costumers don't realize. Two koobideh, one yogurt, and two teas for $65 dollars!?"}
{"text":"Everything was awful. Service was bad, food was bad. Never go back again We found a date pit in our tea tray. Tried kebabs and Ash (the pot) which wasn't even close to the authentic one. The Kashk & Bademjan (eggplant & yogurt curd) wasn't well prepared. The eggplant should be barbecued in that dish, but it was only fried. Generally, nothing was good there"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage! Asked for NO TURNIPS, got extra turnips, ordered a fantastic grape, got coke. In the cans. How that got mixed I don't know. Below room temp kebabs, room temp shawarma and room temp samosas. The service was rude and horrible. Only got attitude about the food not being warm enough for consumption and the turnip thing. Avoid this place. No idea how it's even open."}
{"text":"This place is quite the hidden gem. It has no signage facing Yonge street and if you are not Iranian, there's a fat chance you won't ever know about this place.   That said, this place serves up some fine Iranian food. However...you can get essentially the same food all around in the same plaza, or across the street in literally any direction. Being a restaurant with service means there are more overhead costs and they have to charge a higher price. My view of Iranian food is that grilled kebobs would be about the same anywhere. As long as you are using the right seasonings, and the meat has the right ratio of fat vs meat, and don't overcook it, it will taste great.   So...I'm a foodie. I only care about the food. If I bring a date, I would come here. They have live music the time I visited. If I'm eating by myself, you can bet I'll just go for one of the places nearby that sells the same dishes for 20-30% less. But I have to admit the restaurant looks pretty cool. It has some traditional Iranian style furnishings and seating areas. Definitely an interesting experience."}
{"text":"I loved the authentic Iranian food that they offered.  I find that it was very good quality. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also very Iranian (had traditional carpets and even costumes inside of the restaurant). They also played Persian music to add up to the atmosphere.. However, customer service needs improvement. It took them solid 15-20 minutes to bring us water, even though the restaurant was almost empty (I believe there were only 3 tables in total that were being served). We also ordered a big meal to share and they did not even bring us separate plates until we asked them five minutes later.  If the restaurant improves its customer service, they will reach five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Just explain to me how our bill got to 51 dollars for 2 khoreshte gheymeh plus one salad and bottle of dough, thanks for over charging us"}
{"text":"Excellent cozy traditional Persian food place. The decor is spectacular. Food is fresh and of high quality. Music, especially the Violin is lovely. Servers were friendly if a touch inexperienced.  It's a small place and could get loud but every detail is meticulously recreated in the spirit of traditional persian tea houses.   Pro tip: try the traditional meat stew dish of \"Deezi\". You can ask your server to help you prep it table side."}
{"text":"Poor service the waitresses were very inpatient and on the rude side! Over priced \"sar shir asal (15$), Halim= watery oatmeal. Place looked nice!"}
{"text":"After five times being here I decided to bring my friend. He agreed that kebabs here take you back to Iran. How ever please don't nag about service. You have to be lucky in a middle eastern restaurant to get a good service. Their purpose is to provide us with authentic meal not to win a prize for best service in town .  My next try will be breakfast."}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Horrible service. Super Slow and they will never check on you to see if you need anything. So consistently you have to call them up to your table. We got ASH RESHTEH not only it was cold, later we found out they warmed the ash in  microwave. Like WTH?? Even people around us were complaining about the service. We shall never go there"}
{"text":"Came to this place with my family. Food was very tasty!! We had Abgoosht, kabob and ash resheteh. Everything was delicious. We are from LA area so we been to many Persian restaurants before but hands down this place was one of the best Persian cuisine that we have experienced. Service was great too! We loved our server.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Guys you HAVE to check this 24 hour CAFÃˆ out! The moment I stepped inside I felt as though I had been transported to Iran. Sit on Persian carpets with fluffy pillows and sip some hot tea paired with sweet baklava, listen to live music, dance and try a bowl of Dizy... You won't be sorry! If you're looking for some fun and good food at any hour of the night or day, this is THE place."}
{"text":"Good food, very average Service. After ordering arround literally 400$ we ask to redeem 2 free orange Juice (yelp check in promo) the waiter told me : Sorry we're too busy to honor the promotion.  It started very well but now I understand why they have max 3 stars. Not coming back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night while visiting family from Iran and had the best time! We ordered appetizers/entrees and everything came out delicious - that's saying a lot since I'm spoiled with great Persian food in California.   We ordered kashk eh bademjoon, dolmah and asheh reshteh as appetizers then the barg, koobideh and joojeh kabob combo platter as our entree. Aside of the great food, I loved having the owner dance with our group. Thank you so much for the great service and fun, Shabestan staff!"}
{"text":"24hr. very juicy meats and great atmosphere.  service is good.  like going here very late night"}
