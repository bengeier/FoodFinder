{"text":"La cuisine est bonne et Un bon rapport qualité-prix. Le service est moyen et le temps d'attente peut être très long, 1h in lundi soir..."}
{"text":"Incredibly generous portions, and cheap cheap!! Service is great. Food is good. HUGE menu, a taste for everyone. Really good table d'hote pricing. I will come again and again and my wallet won't break!!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Even though it was packed and only two waitresses we didn't have to wait that long for our food. Waited a bit to get the check.  But the food... Delicious!! And they took care of us non-french speaking tourists."}
{"text":"Le Bistro tôt ou tard est un coup de cur!
L'endroit est lumineux et le service est sympathique.
Les plats sont copieux et les prix raisonnables.
Les déjeuners classiques (ufs, viande, patates, fruits) sont les meilleurs dans le quartier! Les patates sont délicieuses, bien dorées et assaisonnées. Le bol de fruit est généreux, diversifié et frais.
Les bénédictines sur bagel sont bons.
Un bémol, la focaccia au chèvre était décevante. Encore une fois, généreux sur le chèvre, mais la pâte était sèche.
Malgré tout, j'ai hâte de découvrir le reste du menu!"}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch outside that included coffee, fresh fruit, baguette, and the meal.  Staff was attentive and friendly.  I had the #11, poached eggs over potatoes, bacon, ham, sausage, mushrooms, and cheese curds with sauce.  It was amazing!!  My friend had raspberry crepes with eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, and mushrooms.  All was fantastic, and the fresh cut fruit was such a great variety.  Coffee was great too, had 4 cups!!"}
{"text":"As others have said, really good food & portions for the price. We were looking for a cheap place for brunch in the plateau area, and this was just around the corner from the place we stayed. 

The menu is only in french, but the waitress was happy to answer our questions. We each tried a different type of crepe and were all satisfied and surprised to find that they came with eggs, toast and lots of fresh fruit. Mine was about $8, and my friends whose orders included bacon/sausage were around $13.

Since it's in the ground floor of an office building(i think), there was quite a lunchtime rush. When we arrived at 11 there were 3 tables occupied, and prolly 12 by the time we left. Unlike others on here i didn't think the service was poor/slow, the 2 waiters did a great job of keeping up with the rush while being friendly."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this little bistro! My family and I are currently on vacation in Montréal, and we were looking for a place to eat French food for dinner tonight, so we decided to try Bistro Tôt ou Tard because of the pretty high ratings and the variety of the menu and because French food is one of my absolute favorites. When we first walked in, the place looked a little empty and slow (this is because it's more popular in the mornings for their brunch), but we were greeted \"Bonsoir!\" by a nice waitress who showed us to a booth. 
My family and I ordered a veal with linguini dish, a steak with rice & vegetables dish, a grilled trout with rice & vegetables dish, and a penne pasta dish with mushrooms and shallots. Two of these dishes were on the specials menu at just $3 or $4 more, so they each came with soup (we got a creamy vegetable soup and a tomato chickpea soup with cilantro), a dessert, and either coffee or tea. The food was SO GOOD, I didn't want to stop eating! Also, the portions were plentiful and the presentation of the meals was so pretty! For dessert, we had a créme brûlée and a chocolate mousse cake, which were both delicious and both small and light enough to eat after our meals.
The waitresses here were so kind and helpful (thank goodness they knew English), especially since everything on the menu was in French and we were barely getting by with my beginner level French. Service was good, prices weren't too high, and I've decided we have to come back again before leaving Montréal because this place makes me happy and makes me feel like I'm in France! Je t'aime, Bistro Tôt ou Tard!"}
{"text":"The food is great here but service is hit and miss. Waited 55 minutes for a mushroom and Swiss omelette. After a reminder at 45 minutes, again repeating mushroom and Swiss, it finally arrived 10 minutes later as bacon and Swiss. So, no lunch for me today."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my first meal in Canada during my first visit to the country. I ordered  mussels that comes with a mixed green salad. Great flavor and a very big portion."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch! Bear in mind, portions are HUGE. We had the eggs benedict, which was great, and the fig/date crepes, which were simply amazing and quite possibly the best crepes we've ever had. Both brunch dishes came with ham, bacon, AND sausage, which upon reading the menu I thought was a typo, but was in fact the reality. I don't think I've never had a larger portioned brunch before. I finished about half of mine. The bloody mary was also very good, although not made with horseradish, which I almost always prefer. It's also located right at the corner of the park, which provided excellent people watching. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is hard to spot, but worth the effort. Their brunch options offer delicious food and large portions, for a price equivalent to other places in the area. Their service is good for busy weekends, and any wait is usually only a few to 15 minutes. They have a lovely covered terrace open during the warm months. Note: there are three bathrooms, one is hiding and is handicap accessible, with a changing table."}
{"text":"I ordered the goat cheese Eggs Benedict and it was by far the most amazing brunch ever! Goat cheese, caramalized onions, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce on a toasted English muffin... Absolutely unforgettable! AND it came with bacon, ham, sausage, baguette, and herb potatoes with the largest most fresh fruit \"cup\" and coffee! Also a great balcony to eat on that overlooks le Parc de Fontaine. Go here!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner with cocktails here. My friend ordered a Long Island iced tea and said it was one of the best he's had. I had a strawberry daiquiri that was refreshing but a bit strong. We ordered fried calamari, which was delicious and crisp without being too chewy. I split a seafood linguini dish with my other friend and we both agreed that the noodles were perfectly cooked and the seafood was delicious. Great service, very friendly to us non-French speaking tourists!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! We went for late brunch and the portions were really big, bigger than any fancy restaurant dinners. Also the taste was amazing, better than most expensive and bigger restaurants. The only negative thing i can say about this bistro is that the serving time was really slow, but it was definitely worth the wait. We will definitely go again the next time we visit montreal. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This one is a good bet. Has a large menu, with a lot of pasta dishes, meat and sandwiches/burgers. They have a 2/$22 dinner option which I believe varies depending on the day. When we went, they were offering items such as salade nicoise, beef milanaise, fried calamari, and a few other main courses. This deal also gets you and your +1 each a soup I believe. I decided to go with their other special menu, one of the table d'hôte specials, $20 for bavette, comes with your choice of soup, dessert and coffee. I chose the chickpea, coriander noodle tomato soup, which tasted pretty similar to Moroccan harira soup. It was tasty, and the crispy little wedges of olive oil coated bread they brought along with it were great. The bavette was a really large piece, grilled to my liking, and came with caramelized onions. I picked fries as my side,and they were nice and crunchy and salty, perfect for dipping in their house mayo. Dessert was a choice between chocolate cake or tiramisu. They each were solid, not overly sweet, although not the part of the meal that will make me come back. I'll go again for the bavette and yummy fries, as well as the wine deals. $11 for half a litre of house wine made me happy! Service was very nice and friendly, and the location of the resto with its large windows would make a fun place on a snowy day or sunny one!"}
{"text":"Cozy place with good food and good value! Staff are friendly and helpful.
Very nice mussel and seafood linguine, yet the steak was a bit over-cooked."}
{"text":"Delicious and worth the price. This felt like an English breakfast because of how much food they give you. I ordered the salmon Benedict and received coffee, fruit, potatoes, ham, bacon, sausage AND sautéed mushrooms for around $14. Loved my meal and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour déjeuner avec la famille. 

Points positifs: ils sont ouvert tôt, les portions de fruits sont généreuses, les déjeuners ne sont pas trop chers, près du parc lafontaine pour aller marcher par la suite. 

Points négatifs: peut-être une mauvaise journée (ou nous sommes venu trop tôt) mais la serveuse ne semblait pas contente de travailler ce jour là. Les employées semblaient se préparer pour un rush de client plus tard dans la matinée ce qui as fait en sorte que personne n'est venu voir s'il nous manquait quelque chose, si on voulait plus de café, etc."}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité prix pour la qualité servie, vue claire sur le parc et service aimable. Mais les plats sont composés de trop de produits industriels. Ex. Champignons de Paris en Boite, sauce hollandaise en poudre. Dans un restaurant je m'attends à des produits frais et préparés par le Chef, pas à des produits congelés déjà préparés en usine. Les assiettes seraient moins copieuses et mieux resserrées autour des ufs personne ne se plaindrait. Finalement vous mangerez les fruits avec leur pelures et sentirez la cuisine à plein nez en sortant. Rencontre culinaire un peu ratée."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this hidden gem on Cherrier street across the street from Lafontaine Park and absolutely loved the food service and cozy ambiance. This tucked away resto offers a stunnung view of Lafontaine park. The resto itself is large enough to hold groups of 10-12 people. It has has quite a few booths that sit 4 to 6 people. Service is super friendly and this resto actually takes reservations for breakfast so no line-ups!  The food was absolutely delicious!  One of the best breakfast places I have been too. I had the quebecois omellette which comes with potatoes and a delicious big fruit bowl. The other classic breakfast dishes such as eggs Benedict and eggs, bacon and pancakes were also a hit with friends . The fruit bowl was pretty impressive as it contained a wide variety of fruits from yellow cantaloupe, watermelon, cherries to a slice of passion fruit!  The prices are so reasonable not expensice at all for the great quality of food and portion!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place. It was near La Fontaine park and easy to find. The waitress was very attentive. I ordered the Crepes with apple and cinnamon. It also came with two eggs, a lot of fruit, country style potatoes and a ham mushroom medley. The crepes were perfect. It was a lot of food. It will hold me for the whole day."}
{"text":"We were stayed in the hotel around this place, yelped and decided to try this one. It was beyond our expectation. Food was amazingly great and has been thr best restaurant so far in our trip to Montreal. Service also good, they are friendly. Highly recommend! !!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place so we decided to try it out a few weeks ago. 

The food is good and coffee is okay. Portions are huge and the price for the brunch is under $15. Also they serve brunch until 5 pm everyday. 
The eggs come with a side of fruit and potatoes. They also have a nice patio outside, perfect for summers. 

However, the service is so slow and forgetful it almost ruins the experience. We weren't the only ones noticing the lack of attention from the servers. The people sitting on the table next to us were frustrated as well and mentioned that this place is known for their slow service. It's almost sad that a place that has everything working in their favour, don't hire more help. Will not be visiting again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Friendly service (thanks Isabelle!), delicious food and tremendous value.  We both had the table d'hote and every course was well prepared and tasty.  My Pave de saumon frais de l'Atlantique was tender & moist and probably one of the best I've ever had.  At $18 which included my choices of a yummy turnip & date soup and luscious chocolate mousse dessert, this is as good as it gets!  The house wine is only $11 per half litre and our dinner for 2 was under $60 + tips.  You GOTTA eat here as one TV food personality would say! :)

P.S. My dining partner described his Emince de veau aux champignons as OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was advertised in a tourist brochure, so I headed over on a Sunday morning.  With floor to ceiling windows on two sides, diners get expansive views of Parc La Fontaine diagonally across the street, and cyclists streaming by.  Inside, it's a comfortable space with a bar along one side, and a 70's retro feel.  I ordered smoked salmon Benedict for $12.95, which also included the following:  over a half-dozen sections of pineapple, grapes, citrus, and melon; two pieces each of sausage, bacon, and ham; sauteed fresh mushrooms, home fries, and a quarter of a baguette.  It appears the prix fixe brunch includes all of that, and everything served was high quality, fresh, and beautifully presented.

So why only three stars?  The service was completely disfunctional.  When I arrived just before 11:00, only about six of the 30 or so tables were occupied, yet both servers were clearly getting frazzled.  An hour later, with the place fully occupied, they were completely overwhelmed.  There were long lines of people waiting to be seated, waiting for menus, waiting to give their orders, waiting for their food, waiting for their check, and waiting to pay.  Tables could have been turned in about half the time it actually took if the dining room were run efficiently.  It's ironic that once orders went in, they came out in a timely fashion. 

So if you're a patient person who enjoys well-prepared, fresh and high quality food, head on over.  Otherwise, you might prefer someplace that has a bit more respect for your time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I spent our vacation in Montreal and came across this place when looking for somewhere to eat breakfast. We decided upon the banana, strawberry, and chocolate crepes with eggs, bacon, and fresh squeezed orange juice. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious! Went back for dinner later in the day and had fettucine with chicken! This place is awesome! We will definitely be going back the next time we return to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Brunch: portion copieuse. Les fruits sont magnifiques et surtout servi dans un bol pour ne pas qu'ils trempent dans le jus des oeufs! 

Souper: portion tout aussi généreuse. Cuisine goûteuse. Vraiment, vraiment abordable! 

Je le recommande sans hésitation!"}
{"text":"I came here four times; I mostly ordered the brunch menu stuff. The portions are very large for their price and the first couple of times the food was fairly good. 

However after the first time I arrived, each time I came, the service deteriorated further, and the very last time I went I realized that the food was rubbery and bland. There are almost always flies buzzing around, and they were clearly understaffed, but they weren't very busy at all. The waitress was fairly rude and unattentive, and she was mocking us behind our backs, shaking her head at the other waitresses as she walked away from our table and muttering stuff like \"are you serious?\" under her breath... I would not go back again."}
{"text":"Tasty and very filling - but compared to other brunch places I've tried in the Plateau, not what I'd call remarkable. However, the prices are decent enough and the options are plenty (maybe too plenty). The amount of food on each plate is definitely too much for one person - I prefer a more well thought out presentation with enough food but not over doing it. My plate had what seemed like a whole can of mushrooms, and each plates comes with ALL of the meat choices (bacon, ham and sausage), not just your choice of one. Overall, with the fruit bowl (some fresh fruits and some not so fresh), the mountain of fried potatoes, the baguette and your actual meal choice, it ends up being a lot of food wasted because an average human just can't pack that much food in their belly. 

The feel of the place is kind of like a former 70s hotel bar and restaurant, nestled under an apartment complex on the corner facing Parc la Fontaine. It's easy to miss, especially if you're a cyclist and focused on the bike lane and getting through that large, busy intersection. 

The service was fine, our dishes arrived in front of us very quickly, and there was plenty of seating despite the restaurant being very full. 

It doesn't make my list of Brunch Best Bets but no regrets."}
{"text":"This place is great for families, groups, and dates. The service is always great, the staff is always friendly and the portion size is always so satisfying. You get way more then what you expect. I love brunching, lunching and dining here, I have not once complained about my food because it always tastes great!"}
{"text":"Bistro Tôt ou Tard is the perfect place to go to if you want to brunch on a budget. Located on the corner of Cherrier and Amherst, it is nice and cozy and has quite nice views of the park right next to it. The warm and inviting environment combined with the cool morning air and sunlight shining through the windows provided a relaxed feel, and the amount of food given for the price was amazing.

I ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, and for $12.50 it came with a sausage, two slices of bacon, a large amount of homestyle potatoes, and a bowl of fresh fruit. The sausage and bacon were perfectly greasy and carried a savory flavor that satisfied my breakfast meat craving. The Eggs Benedict, interestingly enough, had a base of Montréal bagels rather than your typical English muffin. While I didn't really care for the change, probably because I think that Montréal bagels are too stale and sweet (?) for my taste (go New York bagels!), everything else about them were super tasty with perfectly runny egg yolks. The potatoes didn't taste overly fried and salty like I normally find with breakfast potatoes, so that was a huge plus for me. Finally, the fruit was a sweet and refreshing way to end a meal that left me almost in a food coma and unable to walk home. Whether you interpret that as a good or bad thing is completely up to you, but the price I paid (both literally and figuratively) for eating that much was all worth it in the end."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you're American!! This was our second choice but with overwhelming good reviews we were excited about eating here and walked about a mile to get here. Upon arrival we waited about 15 to be seated, which was expected. Once we were seated, we didn't see anyone for about 25 minutes, no coffee or acknowledgement, but somehow the women sat after us had their coffee in minutes. Upon asking for service a waitress came out and took our order. Food came out 30 minutes later, cold. Had to ask for the check and didn't see her for another 20 minutes. So we walked in to pay and she continued barking at us even though we clearly couldn't understand the quick French. Good food, shit service.... If you're American."}
{"text":"I had their brunch on a week-end, with the place bursting with people. They serve the usual breakfast fare, eggs, Benedicts, waffles, etc. The price is fair, given the ginormous portion of food served.

One hiccup during my visit; each of the plates came with a small bowl of fruits. That day, it was a mixture of melons, one of which clearly had gone bad. There were only a few bits of melon in each cup of fruit so by the time we realized and spit it out, we didn't have any left to show the kitchen.

The decor is fresh, modern, vibrant and green, and everything looks quite new.

I would come back if I was in need of a breakfast fix with friends, but this spot does not stand out from the crop of other similar priced and similar menu-ed brunch restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If I lived remotely closer, I would go here all the time.

Service was friendly but not intrusive - no rushing here to turn over tables. And all brunch meals come with onions, ham, potatoes, bacon, sausage, AND a huge bowl of fruit! I'm not talking crappy honeydew/canteloupe melon fruit, I'm saying an actual array of bananas, apples, cherries, berries, pineapple, etc... fruit!

For two visiting Americans with rusty French skills, they were great, it was nice to see the wide age range of patrons, from families to young couples. Always a good sign :)"}
{"text":"My top go to neighborhood restaurant in Montreal. Highly recommended for brunch, lunch or dinner. The portions are big, the food tastes really good and the prices are really cheap! The service is always great and I have brought many people to this place and everyone has been pleased with it."}
{"text":"The portions were massive. Just MASSIVE!

Ordered the SEAFOOD RISOTTO (highly recommend it), and cried tears of joy...was the best risotto ever hands down. THE BEST! The shrimp were plump and juicy, the mussels were steamed just right, and each grain of rice were cooked to perfection. Since we ordered the combo, it came with a soup or salad, the main, couple of desserts to choose from, and a choice of hot beverage.

We packed our main and dessert to go. Had to forgo the beverage.

Total came to ~$45 after tax for 2!!! We felt that it deserved 20% in tip.

Sad we have not found a place in Toronto which offers the same quality and reasonable price. Maybe someday.

Montréal; you win!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant est vraiment très bon. Le service est super et en plus ce n'est pas cher. Tout pour plaire. Je vous conseille les pâtes au saumon ou le pavé de saumon au choix. Tout cela est très bon."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. They have a huge menu and great deals on drinks. The shrimp fettuccine, bavette, trout, salmon and the chicken fettuccine are excellent. There is a table d'hote option that includes soup and dessert with your choice of coffee or tea. I have also been there for brunch and I got the crepe with chocolate, strawberries and bananas. It comes with 2-3 crepes filled with chocolate and is topped off with strawberries and bananas. It also comes with two eggs cooked to your liking, toast and a side of fruit and you have the choice of a glass of orange juice, coffee or tea. All for $9.50! The prices are very reasonable and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Varied menu offered many different types of options. The grilled trout was especially good. This place is very reasonably priced for food that would cost more than 2x the price downtown or in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Compare to other Italian restaurant, they are not pricy and the portion is very reasonable!! Service is great! I enjoyed so much!!"}
{"text":"Un très bon endroit, le cadre est agréable mais sans plus. Des plats plus que copieux et des bons produits. Parfait pour un petit (gros) brunch avant une grosse journée."}
{"text":"For the area, it's hard to beat the price point at Bistro Tôt ou Tard. And that's before one considers how delicious and traditional some of their French cuisine is. The mussels and fries are great, and with numerous sauses to choose from (I recommend the champignon à la crème). The rognon de veau (kidney) is served with steamed vegetables and is tender. Get their soupe maison if its the soup of the day, which is lemon, tomato, chic pea and cilantro. The servers are friendly and bilingual. Previously a Universal that closed, the decor was left behind and shows its turn of the millenium stylings of flood lighting and faux stonework. A large covered terrace makes for rain-proof outdoor dining, and they have televisions that show the game. Good food, especially their pasta bakes, fish and and crème brûlée. There is a lot of booth seating, and a view of the park. Unpretentious, laid back and affordable."}
{"text":"I had brunch here this past Friday morning.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating, especially considering we were mostly English speakers.  The waitress even asked if we'd like to split the bill (which we did and it was quite convenient).  I ordered the mushroom and swiss  cheese omelette, which included a side of potatoes, toasted baguette sliced in half with butter, and a fruit bowl.  I appreciated the large portion.  The omelette was a typical diner omelette in my opinion, nothing special.  The fruit was good, however not all of it was perfectly ripe.  I tasted some of my friend's salad (it contained arugula and smoked salmon).  That was excellent.  Note: she got the dressing on the side.  I'm not sure how it would have been dressed otherwise. Considering the price and the portions, I would recommend this place.  It was an easy meal."}
{"text":"When you live in the neighbourhood you have no choice to try this place. I tried it for their brunch that they serve everyday until 5pm. The portions are massive. Even if you take the smallest option, they offer you a bowl of fruits, potatoes, baguette. And it's really cheap. You pay between 6 to 14$ for the brunch. The place is cute, intimate, they also have a terrace. The place if often packed during the week for lunch (service could get really slow). They serve pasta, pizza, sandwiches, salads and the portions are really generous. I've tried the lobster linguini and it was better than i expected for the price i paid. Service is always nice, they often forget some little stuff (bred, water...) as they are a lot to serve you at the same time. But you ask and they are reactive. A good spot for food at anytime !!"}
{"text":"It was the biggest portion with the best quality, at a great price. I ordered the garden omelet and it comes with a handful of potatoes, two toasts, and a LARGE bowl with all sorts of fresh fruits! I also wanted to try the french toast, and the waitress kindly reminded me that it was going to be a large dish too (which comes with potatoes, sausage and bacon, etc), and she suggested that I get a side of french toast. They were more than delicious. Really soft, creamy and eggary (yeah I just made this word up...). Really worth the price. $8.95--the omelet plate."}
{"text":"This spot is pretty awesome. The food is very descent and cheap. I had the chance to try so many items from the menu, one of my favorite things is Focaccia goat cheese. I do mostly brunches at this spots but been here for lunch and dinner couple times. Table d'hôte is pretty filling, you are going to have a doggy bag leaving this place."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots when I feel like a weekend feast. The plates are ENORMOUS and the food is pretty good considering how much you get. 

Cute patio that opens up in the summer, but the whole place is bright and cheerful."}
{"text":"J'adore aller bruncher au Tôt ou Tard! Ce n'est pas un endroit qui attire l'attention de l'extérieur, mais malgré cela c'est à mon avis un des meilleur brunch rapport qualité/prix sur le plateau.  Les assiettes sont généreuses, les fruits toujours frais et les serveurs sont sympathiques et attentionnés. De plus, il donne une agréable vue sur le parc Lafontaine et en été il est possible de profiter de la terrasse. 
Il y a parfois un peu d'attente et le café n'est pas top selon moi, mais le bistro reste tout de même une formule simple et gagnante.
On n'y va pas pour la déco qui visiblement n'est pas très actuel, mais pour la qualité, le service et l'emplacement.
Je suis une cliente satisfaite depuis plusieurs années que ce soit pour le brunch, le souper ou le 5@7 sur la terrasse."}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité / prix pour ce resto pour les petits déjeuners; 2 oeufs / bacon / saucisse / patates / fèves aux lard / fruits =  8$. Par contre, le service est un peu lent. J'y retournerai quand même. Wifi gratuit + vue sur le Parc Lafontaine."}
{"text":"Lovely, especially for the price.  My wife and I enjoyed 4 meals over 2 days at Bistro Tot ou Tard and enjoyed each.  We enjoyed a lovely eggy brunch with all of the sides, perfectly prepared with lovely fruit on the side and delicious potatoes. One evening I tried an unusual cut of steak - beautifully prepared as medium rare with a lovely mushroom sauce.  My wife tried the veal liver which was terrifically fresh and tender without any gaminess. Our dining companions both had (and raved over) one of the ravioli specials.  

Another night we tried the mussels - absolutely perfect and a steal at the price!  Oh and the fries were way, way too good.  I'll have to work out a lot to get past those.

Finally, we had a quick lunch on the way to the airport - hamburger gourmand.  Again, a winner."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant! It's really amazing! Went twice and never got disappointed. The price is good for the portion and taste, and the restaurant is quite busy, so please reserve or you will need some luck to find a place at peak hours!
I tried their seafood pasta and it was HEAVENLY, their mozzarella sticks are also amazing! Brunch is not as good as supper but their mushroom and beef dish was really really impressive! Sum all, a big thump up for Tôt ou Tard!"}
{"text":"This place was so perfect! It was less than a 10 minutes walk from our hotel, and right next to the park. We actually ended up going here twice on our trip because it was pretty great and so convenient after a day of walking. We got the veal, ravioli, seafood pasta, and another pasta with spinach and Alfredo I think. All of it was great, but the veal ravioli in Brie and mushroom sauce was the best we tried. I don't know if it's a cultural thing for Montreal, but the service was very slow. Noticeably slow. Maybe I'm just a silly American who wants to eat and leave, but there was a lot of downtime during our meals."}
{"text":"Great Group Dining!! I left the place drunk, full, and with plenty of delicious leftovers for around $20. Prices are very reasonable, service was excellent, and the food was great. Red Sangria pitcher is a delicious steal! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"La nourriture est bonne. Par contre un petit coup de balais sur la terrasse, y allumer la lumière pour qu'on y se retrouver pas dans le noir une fois le soleil tombé et venir prendre la commande pour les desserts plus rapidement qu'après 15 minutes après la fin de notre repas seraient des choses vraiment apprécies."}
{"text":"Très belle localisation non loin du parc Lafontaine.
Un peu d'attente pour être placé mais le plat du brunch et le smoothie étaient à la hauteur"}
{"text":"I don't get why I didn't submit a review for this gem up until now. Go-to place for brunch for the past 2-3 years, I've introduced friends to the place many times and it still amazes me at how underrated the place is. Low-key attitude, pretty good service and consistent good food. Plates are huge by the way, good thing Park LaFontaine is right across the street for you to crash while you process all the deliciousness from Tôt-ou-Tard!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased by this place. They only had the French menu online when we looked, but they have an English menu in the restaurant. We came for dinner around 6:00 on a Sunday night. It wasn't crowded at all and we were seated right away. 

The menu was big and they have a wide selection. I got the penne romanoff without cheese and a glass of Listel-Gris. Both were amazing. It was about $19 CAD with tips. We did have the ask for the drinks menu as it wasn't given to us.

The restaurant is about a 5 minute walk from Station Sherbrooke and about a 10 minute walk from Station Beaudry. The entrance was a little hard to find, as it seems to be part of a building.

It's definitely a great place to go for dinner. They also offer breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"You can trust Bistro Tôt ou Tard to provide a filling, delicious brunch at a reasonable price.  Thanks to yelp, I first visited this restaurant last summer and returned this weekend with some friends.  It is located on the first floor of an office building across the street from Parc La Fountain.  There is an outdoor patio for the warmer months.  Both times I visited I ordered the  Breakfast \"Chez Nous,\" which has potatoes, bacon, sausage, ham, and cheese curds.  As it is listed on the menu, it comes with poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce (listed as \"Dutch sauce\" on the English menu), but I asked for scrambled eggs and no sauce and they were happy to comply.  All of their brunch offerings come with a baguette, bottomless coffee or black tea, as well as a large bowl with a variety of fresh fruits.  Our server was friendly and attentive, though we did have to ask for coffee refills.  They also have espresso and a variety of lunch options, but with such big brunches for only around $13, I have yet to move past the first page on the menu.  Definitely a brunch winner!"}
{"text":"Le bistrot tôt ou tard porte bien son nom !! Après une excursion abandonnée cause de neige ! Le seule endroit disposé à nous recevoir à 7h00 sans manger de fast food est bien ce restaurant qui permet au lève tôt de pouvoir profiter du lever du jour avec un agréable petit déjeuner. Cela faisait longtemps que j'avais pas profiter d'une sortie dans un petit café aussi tôt le matin !! C'est vraiment très sympa ! Je vous écris donc à 7h20 du matin, l'ambiance est donc calme, nous ne sommes pas seule, certains habitué sont déjà la, journaux à la main, odeur du café qui embaume la salle, j'aime cette ambiance que je retrouvais enfant quand j'allais au café avec mon père ! 

Allez j'arrête de raconter ma vie ! On nous accueille de façon très douce, parfait quand on n'a encore les yeux qui collent !! 
Le bol de chocolat n'est pas parfait, un peu trop sucré mais j'en tiendra pas rigueur, ici au Québec on n'a du mal avec le goût du chocolat ;) !! Le café au lait lui est bon et corsé comme si on voulait nous réveiller :) 

Alors les plats arrivent !! Bons j'avais oublié qu'il était aussi gros et manger d'aussi grosse quantité à 7h00 du matin c'est tout juste pas possible :p 

J'avais déjà mangé ici !! La première fois c'était bon ! Le plats de pâte au poulet était pas mal !! Cette fois ci c'est beaucoup moins réussi !! Nous avons pris deux plats, une omette et un des ufs Bénédicte !! C'est juste copieux !! Après le reste, tout le monde peut en faire autant et même beaucoup mieux !! Non c'est pas très bon !!

Les ufs Bénédicte était trop froid ! Le saumon presque gelé, juste sortie d'un frigidaire à la dernière minute. La saucisse grasse mauvaise! L'omelette quand à elle n'était pas maîtrisé, les épinards dans l'omelette n'était pas coupé ou beaucoup trop gros ! On n'avait du mal à mâcher !! Bref pas extra du tout !!

Mais on conserve 3 étoiles pour le côté lève tôt, le bon moment que nous avons passé ici ! Mais il y a beaucoup à faire pour avoir un petit déjeuner ou un brunch à un niveau acceptable !!"}
