{"text":"Met this fun crew at the 2014 foodie fest, had the deep fried lobster tail, which was amazing. Got to hang out with the staff.. so much fun and great selection of hot dogs"}
{"text":"I've tried Sin City Dogs a few times and their dogs never dissapoint. Ran into them at Foodie Fest and had to try the Lobster Corn Dog. Wow. What a treat!   They embody what a good food truck is all about. Nice gourmet take on popular street food with friendly workers."}
{"text":"Sooooo yum!   Tried this place out when they were parked Downtown behind Park on Fremont for the AIDS walk/March Against Monsanto day.  I very picky about my veggie dogs (not a fan period) so when I told my friend to surprise me with a vegan style choice she picked a spicy Wise Guy Vegan Style and I was pleased!   Disclosure: I never ate hot dogs nor those icky sausage brats? prior to a plant based lifestyle so I'm not sure what to compare the flavor to.  I'm not a fan of Tofurky anything lol. I can't stand the faux meats that company makes and I avoid them (and almost all faux) like the plague. I was told this was a Tofurky beer brat? The fennel flavor hiding inside is not a big turn on for me but luckily the fennel was not strong so the dog stayed on my plate and not tossed in the garbage can :) The sheer smell of breakfast sausage? (have never tried) makes me gag due to fennel smell :)   I really loved the bread, all the yummy peppers and onions PILED HIGH and the spicy kick that it had!  We shared a side of fries and the couple of fries I had were super good! Not over not under cooked and like a nice fluffy baked potato inside. Not salty. I hate salt.  For about $8 a dog and a side of fries is waaaaay too much food for me. I was stuffed on half of the dog and a few fries.  My friend said the service was super nice and was proud to serve a compassionate food choice.   Two thumbs up and I def want to try them again soon."}
{"text":"Mark my words you guys have evolved the hot dog. I have had a dodger dog a dog at Fenway in Boston and I think the bread the dog the toppings. You have blown them all away."}
{"text":"Checked them out at the food truck rally by the tony hseih's downtown project.  They had a prefetch solid lobster tempura dog with Siraracha mayo, greens and onions.  Surprisingly fast."}
{"text":"The snappy and juicy dogs combined with fresh tasty buns provide a solid base for a few different dogs. I had the General Lee and it was fantastic and my homie seemed to love the vegan dog! The french fries had been seasoned really well and the house made hot sauces are flavorful and spicy! It's my first visit but there will be many more I'm sure!"}
