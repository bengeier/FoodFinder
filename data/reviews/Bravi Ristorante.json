{"text":"A bunch of us went here for a friend's birthday. I had a $27 bowl of ravioli - containing 5 squares of ravioli. One of my friends had the gnocchi which was equally disappointing. I think she had 10 pieces for the same price as my ravioli. Most of the table had the steak which I believe they thought was average. This restaurant is WAY overpriced and the food is nothing special. The only positive about this place is the table located in the elevator. It is supposed to be the most romantic dining experience in the city. I will never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for our wedding anniversary and really enjoyed ourselves. We sat at a table that offered privacy, between two wine racks. The food was excellent, as was the service. And we dine out frequently. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I visited Bravi last night for dinner, and I had an exquisite experience.  Each one of the courses were full of bold flavours and presented really nicely. The portion size was perfect and all around I loved the experience. My favourite dishes were the gnocchi di pomodoro, with mozzarella and basil, then the branzino dish with parsley foam,  and the flourless (gluten free) chocolate torte with vanilla mousse for dessert was delicious.  The service was really fast, professional and very pleasant. Bravi has an amazing atmosphere (candles), I would recommend Bravi for a romantic date or get together with family and friends. It was well put together and I am definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Bravi just plain sucks as a so called \"high class restaurant\". And as for owner Sam Genkov? Anyone who's had to deal with the guy can tell you he's either schizo or on drugs. Avoid."}
{"text":"Nice romantic athmosphere. Food was ok, not spectacular but decent, slightly overpriced. The service however was not all that great. When we did not order any wine or \"sparkling or still\" bottled water, the waiter looked at us in dissapproval and said in a condescending tone \"Really! It makes the food taste better...\" and left avoiding eye contact. That was awkward.  If it was not for the judgemental, pretentious, uncomfortable service attitude we could go back but I do not think we will."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!Super Romantic and friendly stuff!  their Tagliatelle Frutti di Mare and Ravioli are my fav!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Bravi last night. The ambience was quiet and romantic, the service was attentive and the food was delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I just started work at a great company on Bay Street. Fortunately for me my desk is right next to a lovely unassuming intelligent lady named Cathy. She's the kind of person who leads by example rather than telling you what to do, and fortunately her biggest passions are also my biggest passions such as classical music, theater, the arts, travel, opera, great food, and great movies. She devotes a large amount of her time to be a volunteer for incredible organization such as Roy Thomson Hall, Massey Hall, and the Toronto international film Festival, which again or I'll some of my favourite places in Toronto . I was raised in a house with annual memberships to Roy Thomson Hall and I'm used to seeing the Toronto Symphony orchestra regularly, and in fact I play clarinet and that was my lifes dream was to play for the TSO. Both my sons play clarinet and I have a 13-year-old who also successfully plays guitar in restaurants, therefore we've always had a very musical family. I've also always been addicted to travel - and also good films, in fact two movies have been filmed in my house, and I try to get out to see as many tiff films every year as possible, therefore Cathy and I have quite a lot in common and quite a lot to chat about. Therefore it was disappointing to hear after only two months of working with her and that she was retiring. During her time with the company, Because Cathy has great taste in restaurants as well, she would often book corporate events to this amazing restaurant Bravi. Therefore because Cathy would never ask for a favour for herself, and because I am a pushier kind of person and I have many years of experience working in restaurants and assume that I know how to talk to fellow restauranteurs, I took the time to meet the owner of Bravi and begged on Cathy's behalf that perhaps we could have a nice going away lunch for her at this beautiful restaurant, but because the people attending were mostly secretaries and not necessarily the millionaires who can afford these prices, is there anything he could do for us? He fortunately said he could bring us free appetizers and I said that would be great. We arrived and I expected very little such as bread-and-butter maybe some olives and Bruschetta, but they fed us a free feast so perfectly prepared, presented, and delicious, I was completely shocked- most especially the delicious Charcuterie, wild Boar, and calamari. This was above and beyond what they needed to do, and I will always be thankful, and my feelings are shared by everybody else at the table who were so happy to celebrate with Cathy in such a beautiful setting. The entr√©es were spectacular as well, as for the desserts, my favourite was the tiramisu -I highly recommend Bravi! They care about you and they go above and beyond."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and would have been more so if I had read the other reviews. So I feel obliged to state up front that the service was efficient and pleasant, we all enjoyed or meals and the prices seemed in line with us business district/ tourist area location. I cannot comment on the temperament of the owner.  Location is why I had low expectations when we wandered in. Tourist restaurants typically overcharge for bad to mediocre food and the business district is rife with ristorantes that cater to people with big expense accounts and little idea of the difference between haute cuisine and hot dogs. Bravi seems to hit a nice balance with Italian comfort food at downtown prices. Nothing spectacular, but pretty good and definitely  better than many other options in the area. Nice atmosphere and a nice space.   Finally, somewhere reasonable to go when out of own visitors insist on dinner within walking distance of the hotel!"}
{"text":"How can anyone seriously consider place that is opened till 10:30 p.m. on Saturdays?!? And closed on Sundays. Is it for toddlers so they should be in bed at that time? Or there is curfew on in Toronto? This place deserves to be closed immediately for good and to give nice location to someone who wants to work."}
{"text":"My favourite date night spot.  Great ambience, food and very pleasant servers. I have been here a couple times already and just totally pleased with the whole package.  The food tastes so fresh.  They start you up with fresh bread and olives, which they marinate in-house, and olive oil with Parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar.  Already so good and yummy but I try to stop myself as I have to make room for more.  The appetizers are good sized and I have tried the calamari (smoky and yielding) and Caprese salad(summer fresh).  For mainsI had the lamb chops, which were good portions and great seasonal sides.  I had mushy peas but they were so delectable (lots a butter??) and vegetables cooked al dente.  I have also have the ravioli with oyster mushrooms.  Love love love all of them!  So if you want romantic but relaxed this is the place to go. This is my neighbourhood go to spot for underrated something special!"}
{"text":"Friday night business dinner entertaining out of town business  guests.  Cozy resto, not too noisy but also not at capacity.  Service attentive.  Grilled calamari app  was good.  Cooked perfectly although the onion accompaniment was not the best combo IMHO.  Seafood fettuccine was good.  Scallops and shrimp cooked perfectly nestled in home made fettuccine in san Marzano tomato sauce.  Tiramisu was also good.  Apps about $16 and mains $30.  Another guest's braised lamb shank was delicious with risotto side.  Portions are a good size not too large but not bunny portions either .  Molto bene !!"}
{"text":"Came here for our 1st anniversary dinner. Very romantic, food was very tasty. Not a huge menu selection, but overall a very nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim on a Friday night. The fact we were the only ones there at 7pm made us a bit skeptical. Its a classy looking joint and we had 4 small kids with us but the service was great and not once did they make us feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.  We tried the prosciutto and calamari appetizers which were wonderful. That vinaigrette that came with the calamari was so delicious we kept asking for more bread to soak it up. Yum.   All the entrees however, were only so so.  We ordered the pappardelle, the strip loin,  seafood pasta, and the  carbonara pasta. Nothing terribly? bad, but nothing great or tasty either.  Not a bad place, but nothing really calling us back to it."}
{"text":"Nice little Italian spot with freshly made pastas, tasty apps, and great service. Had the grilled asparagus and Pappardelle Bolognese. Both were solid, especially the asparagus, although the Bolognese sauce was pretty basic and could use a bit more oomph. Michelle was very nice and provided excellent service. Will definitely go back when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with exceptional service and food. We experienced the old freight elevator table and it was nice."}
{"text":"Came here on a double date before a comedy show at the Sony Center conveniently walking distance from the restaurant. We made reservations for 7:30pm and were seated right away. They seemed short staffed however and we wouldn't consistently see the server. The service overall was extremely slow, but the food was good. I ordered the Pappardelle with a plain marinara tomato sauce because I do not eat meat so they kindly changed the bolognese offering. They at least kept the bread coming, but were very slow with the wine and entree's. I also found the prices steep considering the portion size and quality, tasty, but nothing out of this world. The butternut squash and cream ravioli with balsamic glaze that my date ordered are phenomenal, but minuscule and they only put like 7 on your plate, word of caution: you're going to stay hungry. Most places that serve so few ravioli at least make sure they're large in size. These were both tiny ravioli's in a tiny portion size, looks like a small plate not a main course dish or entree especially not to be starving after you paid $22. Same with the Pappardelle $19 but not a whole lot of pasta on the plate. Aside from the slow service and the pricey yet tasty food, the ambiance was great. Romantic and quiet, low lighting, we had great conversation and enjoyed a nice meal before our show."}
{"text":"Charming location.  Very friendly service. Highly recommend the calamari and a Steam whistle."}
