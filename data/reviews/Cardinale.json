{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. It had some very good reviews so we thought we would check it out. Very impressed. The service was quick, friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We had the carbonara and the meatball dishes and they were both over the top good. We highly recommend this restaurant and those two main courses."}
{"text":"Have I ever mentioned how much I love trying new things? Especially when it comes to food? Well if you didn't know... NOW YOU DO! And let me just say, I was very excited to go and try Cardinale!

We made a reservation for 2 at 6:30 on Saturday (yes, normally I'd pick a later time, but we just finished coming from a concert *GARTH BROOKS wooo!* and needed to refuel) So... We walk on in and are greeted promptly and shown to our table. 

If I would have planned this better, I would have requested a spot out on the cute patio, it was such a lovely day and as Canadians, you need to take advantage... however, I didn't think there was a chance of that happening after we arrived since it was really busy. I assume perhaps from two factors. 1. Event day  2. The restaurant did just open.

The space is cute and I enjoyed the ambience. Our server was very punctual and made sure to ask us if we needed to have an express service for the show (how nice!) but we assured him we just came from the earlier show and started to peruse the menu. 
I ordered a \"Claudia\" from the cocktail list. It was basically like a gin & tonic but topped with prosecco. To be honest I didn't taste the prosecco at all and I found it very bitter. I opted for a glass of white wine for my next beverage.

Now on to the GOOD STUFF!  For the food we started with the Suppli, which are fried risotto balls but not in a small ball shape like i'm used to, they were larger and oval shaped. I cut one up, let it cool and tasted.....amaaaaazing. I could have ate 3 more plates of these fried babies, they came on a bed of arugula and also what tasted like a house marinara. YUM.

For mains we got the Tortiglioni and the Gnocchi. The tortiglioni had these delicious wild boar meatballs that were succulent and full of flavour. I broke up the meatballs and kind of made my own bolognese in the Pomodoro sauce, since I found the sauce on its own didn't hold a flame to the meatballs. Also some of the pasta was still a bit hard and hadn't yet reached the el dente mark yet. It was a bit disappointing but that didn't stop me from stuffing my face until I had to tell myself \"psst, just because it's in front of your face doesn't mean you should eat the entire plate\" Or can you??? Not if you want dessert my fellow readers, and who likes gelato? This girl. 

The Gnocchi was also really good. It was pillowly soft, savory, cheesy... just full of flavour in every happy bite. 

Oh right, you are probably going... hey, didn't you mention gelato? And yes, I, in fact did. And so, for dessert we had the dark chocolate gelato with hazelnuts and salted pistachio... It was a very generous portion and I was reminiscing about my travels through Italy while enjoying. Bellissimo!  

The evening was a success, and I look forward to coming back and trying the other dishes and cocktails, also PS just like Hayden Block they have half price pasta after 9pm.... CARB UP!!!"}
{"text":"The manager was so rude and short-tempered. You could obviously tell he cannot handle criticism and crowd too well. He was constantly using \"F\" words in front of people and even pushed a lady who was standing by the front door and waiting for a table. Do not go there, if you want to have a nice family dinner. They have certainly lost the custom of all of our friends and family!"}
{"text":"Meh to bad appetizers, good pasta. 

I hope this restaurant works on their appetizer game. 

We had the PANE to start, I expected a delightful honey poppyseed bread but received dried old bread with poppyseed baked on top. The cool thing about popyseeeds in batter is you can bake it inside! This wouldn't matter if the taste was outstanding but honestly tasted like boring dry bread. Gross. 

Their CAESAR was OK. The dressing was heavy on the anchovies and missing some citrus. Calgary is a Caesar salad city, there is room for improvement here. 

The PANZANELLA was oh so dissspointing! This is one of my favourite dishes. The worst part is that the \"heirloom tomatoes\" which really were tri coloured grape tomatoes were rotten :( add that to barely edible tough bread, it was sad. Italians would have torn that bred into squares and saut√©ed it before serving to mask its age, but here it was served bruschetta style. The buffalo mozzarella was delicious though! The capers, olives and  cucumber were odd additions as those are more Greek salad ingredients, but I guess it was good they were there because they were the only edible things to pair with the mozzarella. Check your tomatoes guys! Buy big tomatoes so you can check them easily !

I probably sound harsh but I am providing this feedback so the resturaunt can improve their appetizers. 

All pastas we had were good. 

Regarding the MEZZE MANICHE egg yolk \"carbonara\", the smoke flavour was very overpowering, I'd recommend not having the bacon smoked on that dish. 

I advise guests to order the PAPPARDELLE, it was a delight."}
{"text":"We ate here today for the first time. Very nice environment, comfy patio. A nice and authentic Italian menu, the gnocchi was a good choice. I also had the gamberi appetizer which was a salt baked prawn with aioli sauce: delicious! A little expensive, but a good choice for the area."}
{"text":"A new venture from the owners of Hayden Block, in the spot of a former Italian restaurant, comes a new Italian restaurant. We stopped in on a Friday night and although there was a concert happening close by and the restaurant being mostly filled they were able to find us a nice spot on the patio. From there we dove in and began to conquer the menu. They had a long wine list but the dwindling days of summer had us craving a cocktail, with lots of unique options there was something for everyone. My wine focused take on a cocktail was refreshing and delightful. From there we ordered a variety of dishes to share including the meatballs, fried risotto, a salad, a pasta dish and of course bread. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive throughout the evening and he was the one who suggested the bread, which of course we weren't about to turn down. The food was fresh and tasty, I do wish the risotto balls were a bit cheesier but they were still delicious, just a bit different than I was expecting. Our two cocktails, salad, two appies and pasta dish came to just over $100.00."}
{"text":"My partner and I joined a group of friends here for a late after-show dinner, and having already eaten earlier in the afternoon, we weren't intending to order another full meal. So we ordered calamari to share, while our friends ordered their pasta (only two varieties made it to our table - apparently the two most popular: seafood linguini and the carbonara). 

The calamari was nicely grilled, not overcooked or chewy at all, and complemented well with the glaze (balsamic, if I remember correctly). We were not fans of the radicchio salad, but I blame it on the vegetable, not the cook (I don't know any way to prepare radicchio that would make me like it, to be honest).

When the pasta orders rolled in, my partner had a taste of each and was convinced it was worth a second dinner. Personally, I would have been okay ordering dessert instead, but curious at how he changed his mind over a single bite, I agreed to share a half plate of the seafood linguini. Why not both pasta and dessert, you ask? Well.. it was last call for the kitchen, and gluttons end up with tummy aches and undeserved negative reviews on the establishment... So probably best that it was just the pasta this time.

The pasta was excellent. The noodles were fresh and hand-made (you can instantly tell the difference); the sauce light and well-seasoned. Good portion of lobster too. Very enjoyable dish that I would not hesitate recommending. Half of half a plate was a good portion for us as it was already our second dinner, but I can probably devour a full plate myself had I been hungrier. I can see why it's one of the most popular dishes, for sure.

Atmosphere is cozy and not too loud, but I did find the room we were in a bit dark for dinner. Service was attentive, but a bit cold, perhaps because the gratuity was already guaranteed for large parties. I wasn't particularly fond of being offered only pop/water when I asked if I could order a virgin drink, especially when the establishment had a dedicated bar. 

Overall, a good dining experience with highly enjoyable food. Plenty of street parking, and a stone's throw away from the Saddledome/Casino. Pro-tip: I would book a date here on your next show."}
{"text":"The company I work for made the shades for the windows here and I installed them so I wanted to come back and check this place out. My wife, friends and I were going to a Roughnecks game so I made some reservations for dinner before the game.

We had the first table inside the door, which I was a little worried about being winter and feeling a draft, but it ended up being fine. Our server was great giving us a rundown when we first arrived, making suggestions, and getting us all sorted out. 

I had a couple of cocktails, of which I can't remember the names of, but they were all spot on. The menu descriptions were solid so you're sure to find something here for all different types of boozy taste buds.

We started with the grilled prawns which hit the spot for a starter.

We all of course went with various pasta dishes. The one warning I'll give here is that if you order the \"taste\" size, with some of the dishes that's exactly what you get. Just a taste. It was a little bit of a let down for my friends who shared a couple of things. Though our server said they weigh it out in the kitchen, it seems that some of the pasta dishes are a smaler portion than others. That being said though, they were all delicious.

For the location I would definitely suggest a reservation on the weekends. The place isn't overly small, but being beside the casino, BMO Centre, and Saddledome, it does fill up quickly if there's anything going on at any of those venues."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch at Cardinale.  We ordered Insalata and Calamari.  The Insalata was well dressed and there slices of peaches, pistachios and mesclun greens.  The Calamari was a grilled squid, slightly overcooked but came with a nice dressing with pine nuts and a grilled radicchio.

For our main meal, we decided on the smaller portion sizes of the following: 
LINGUINI - saffron linguini, lobster, fennel, sambuca, grape tomatoes 
BUCATINI - confit pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, basil
SPAGHETTI - capers, olives, anchovy, pangrattato
All pastas were well made and tasty.  I would probably order the Linguini again if I came back to Cardinale"}
